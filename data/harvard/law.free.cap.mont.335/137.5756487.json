The District Court designated Hausauer as a persistent felony offender and sentenced him accordingly. On appeal, Hausauer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>contends the District Court should have granted his motion for a directed verdict of acquittal because the State failed to prove the elements of the charged offense. In the alternative, should we decline to reverse on this basis, Hausauer contends the District Court erred when it failed to dismiss for cause two jurors who during <em>voir dire </em>revealed biases which made them unable to impartially evaluate Hausauer\u2019s case, and improperly instructed the jury on unanimity. Hausauer seeks reversal and an order for a directed verdict of acquittal, or alternatively reversal for a new trial. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Hausauer\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Hausauer\u2019s motions to excuse two jurors for cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">3. Did the District Court err by failing to properly instruct the jury on unanimity?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">\u00b64 Early on the morning of August 23, 2002, flames engulfed a camping trailer occupied by Hausauer in a residential neighborhood in Missoula, Montana. Although the source of the fire was never determined, evidence gathered at the scene led law enforcement officers to suspect the fire was caused by an accidental explosion resulting from methamphetamine production. On November 19, 2003, the State charged Hausauer by information with purposely or knowingly engaging in the procurement, possession, or use of chemicals, precursors to dangerous drugs, supplies, equipment, or a laboratory for criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs in violation of \u00a7 45-9-110, MCA. Hausauer pled not guilty on December 31, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">\u00b65 A two day jury trial commenced on June 25, 2004. In response to <em>voir dire </em>questions, two prospective jurors, L.H. and B.M., voluntarily admitted they had doubts about their abilities to be objective about Hausauer\u2019s case. Hausauer moved to dismiss L.H. and B.M. for cause. The District Court denied Hausauer\u2019s motions. Hausauer then used peremptory challenges to dismiss the two jurors. Hausauer used all six of the peremptory challenges available to him by the time jury selection concluded. The District Court excused for cause eight other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>prospective jurors not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b66 The State presented circumstantial evidence to support its charge against Hausauer because no direct evidence showed he operated a methamphetamine lab in the camper that burned. It was undisputed, however, that Hausauer inhabited the camper, occupied the camper when it caught fire, and sustained severe burns to his hands, arms, legs and torso before he exited the burning camper. Further, the camper\u2019s charred remains contained many items which are commonly used to produce methamphetamine. Police found in the camper a cooler containing dry ice and a bottle with traces of methamphetamine in it. Police also found two square metal cans of the same type as those which typically hold Coleman fuel or paint thinner, lye, a packaging label for hydrochloric acid, and a partially burned bottle of \u201cHeet,\u201d a fuel line anti-freeze consisting of isopropyl alcohol-all known ingredients for methamphetamine production. Additionally, a detective found paraphernalia typically used to facilitate the ingestion of methamphetamine-three lighters, a spoon, matches, a spray bottle, and a razor blade-in the clothing and fanny pack Hausauer wore when he arrived at the hospital for treatment of his burns and smoke inhalation. Finally, the burned camper lacked power, propane, running water, and sewage facilities-facts which further raised suspicions that Hausauer used the camper to produce methamphetamine and not for living quarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b67 At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Hausauer moved for a directed verdict of acquittal on grounds the State failed to prove the elements of the charged offense. Specifically, Hausauer argued the State presented no evidence as to any incriminating act or omission on his part, and as a result the jury had no basis for inferring his mental state. Hausauer also contended the evidence showed he legally possessed, for non-drug related purposes, the camper and all of the items found in it. The District Court denied Hausauer\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, and the trial proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u00b68 At the close of arguments the District Court instructed the jury on several topics, including unanimity. The court instructed, \u201c[t]he law requires the jury verdict in this case to be unanimous. Thus, all twelve of you must agree in order to reach a verdict whether the verdict be guilty or not guilty.\u201d Hausauer did not object to the court\u2019s general instruction, nor did Hausauer offer an alternative specific instruction on unanimity.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\u00b69 On June 29,2004, the jury found Hausauer guilty of operating an unlawful clandestine laboratory in violation of \u00a745-9-132(3), MCA, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the District Court designated him as a persistent felony offender pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-501, MCA. On October 14,2004, the District Court sentenced Hausauer to twenty years imprisonment at the Montana State Prison, with fifteen years suspended, for the offense. The court sentenced Hausauer to an additional twenty years with five years suspended due to his persistent felony offender status. The sentences run consecutively. Hausauer appeals from his conviction raising three issues. We affirm on Issue One, reverse and remand for a new trial on Issue Two, and decline to resolve Issue Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a directed verdict for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. McGarvey, </em>2005 MT 308, \u00b6 13, 329 Mont. 439, \u00b6 13, 124 P.3d 1131, \u00b6 13 (citation omitted). We also review a trial court\u2019s denial of a challenge for cause for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Golie, </em>2006 MT 91, \u00b6 6, 332 Mont. 69, \u00b6 6, 134 P.3d 95, \u00b6 6 (citation omitted). A court abuses its discretion if it fails to excuse for cause a prospective juror whose actual bias is discovered during <em>voir dire. State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 58, \u00b6 7, 320 Mont. 211, \u00b6 7, 89 P.3d 947, \u00b6 7 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b611  We review jury instructions in criminal cases to determine whether the instructions as a whole fully and fairly instruct the jury on the applicable law. <em>State v. Azure, </em>2005 MT 328, \u00b6 8, 329 Mont. 536, \u00b6 8, 125 P.3d 1116, \u00b6 8. A district court has broad discretion in formulating jury instructions, and our standard of review is whether the court abused that discretion. <em>Azure, </em>\u00b6 8 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">ISSUES ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\u00b612 <em>1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">\u00b613 At the outset, we determine whether the District Court abused its discretion when it denied Hausauer\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal. We do so because Hausauer requests disposition of this issue first, and were we to decide this issue in Hausauer\u2019s favor, we would not reach the remaining issues. We determine the District Court did not abuse its discretion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">\u00b614 Hausauer argues the State failed to present sufficient evidence to prove he possessed the mental state necessary to commit the charged crime, and therefore failed to prove an essential element of the charge. Hausauer contends the State presented no evidence of anything he did, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>or failed to do, from which the jury could infer his mental state. Further; he argues that all of the items found in the camper Hausauer occupied could be lawfully purchased and lawfully used for purposes other than drug production. As a result, the State failed to meet its burden of proof against Hausauer, and he should have been acquitted as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b615  The State counters that the District Court properly submitted the charge of operating an unlawful clandestine laboratory to the jury. Sufficient evidence existed for the jury to infer Hausauer\u2019s mental state from surrounding circumstances, including the fact that Hausauer occupied the camper trailer which contained methamphetamine as well as items commonly used to manufacture methamphetamine. As a result, Hausauer\u2019s culpability was a question <em>off act </em>\u2014 not a question of law-appropriate for the jury\u2019s determination. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b616  A directed verdict of acquittal is appropriate only when <em>no </em>evidence exists to support a guilty verdict. <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2003 MT 49, \u00b6 19, 314 Mont. 326, \u00b6 19, 67 P.3d 192, \u00b6 19 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). No abuse of discretion results from denial of a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal when the evidence presented is viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, and a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Longstreth, </em>1999 MT 204, \u00b6 16, 295 Mont. 457, \u00b6 16, 984 P.2d 157, \u00b6 16 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b617 The State charged Hausauer with purposely or knowingly engaging in the procurement, possession, or use of chemicals, precursors to dangerous drugs, supplies, equipment, or a laboratory for criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs in violation of \u00a7 45-9-110, MCA. At the time the District Court denied Hausauer\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, the court had before it testimonial evidence given by the fire inspector and police investigators who found numerous items commonly used to manufacture methamphetamine in the charred remains of Hausauer\u2019s camper. Missoula Fire Marshall Nate Nunally testified he found two square metal cans which he suspected once contained fuel or paint thinner. Officers found lye, a packaging label for hydrochloric acid, and a partially burned bottle of \u201cHeet.\u201d Police also found a cooler which contained dry ice and a bottle with white residue in it which State Crime Lab forensic chemist, Bahne Ann Kleitz, tested and identified as methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u00b618  Each of the items found in Hausauer\u2019s camper <em>may </em>be used to manufacture methamphetamine. None of the items-whether in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>isolation, or collectively-conclusively proved Hausauer operated a clandestine lab where he manufactured methamphetamine. In fact, the exact contents of many of the found containers remain unidentified. However, the District Court correctly concluded the State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to weigh the State\u2019s case to determine whether the State met the burden of proof required to convict Hausauer. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Hausauer\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal because sufficient evidence existed to allow the jury to determine the question of Hausauer\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b619 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Hausauer\u2019s motions to excuse two jurors for cause ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u00b620 The right to trial by an impartial jury is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. The bases for challenging prospective jurors for cause in a Montana criminal case are specified by statute. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-16-115(2), MCA. A district court may take a challenge for cause in a criminal case when the court determines a juror has a state of mind in reference to the case or to a party that would prevent the juror from acting with \u201centire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party.\u201d Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. This Court determines challenges under \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA, pursuant to both the statutory language and the totality of the circumstances presented. <em>State v. Harville, </em>2006 MT 292, \u00b6 9, 334 Mont. 380, \u00b6 9, 147 P.3d 222, \u00b6 9, citing <em>Golie, </em>\u00b6 8. Structural error occurs and requires reversal when a District Court abuses its discretion in denying a defendant\u2019s challenge for cause, the defendant uses a peremptory challenge to dismiss the biased juror, and the defendant ultimately exhausts all of the peremptory challenges available to him. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 7 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">\u00b621 Hausauer contends two prospective jurors, B.M. and L.H., revealed biases during <em>voir dire </em>which prevented them from evaluating Hausauer\u2019s case impartially. Hausauer posits B.M. and L.H. should have been dismissed for cause as he requested. After the District Court denied his motions to dismiss, Hausauer used peremptory challenges to dismiss both jurors, and ultimately exhausted the six peremptory challenges available to him. Hausauer argues the District Court abused its discretion in denying his motions, and reversal for a new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u00b622 We agree that B.M. should have been dismissed for cause, and a new trial is required here. We therefore decline to address Hausauer\u2019s contentions with regard to L.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b623  When <em>voir dire </em>questioning reveals a serious question about a prospective juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial, that question should be resolved in favor of excusing that juror. <em>State v. DeVore, </em>1998 MT 340, \u00b6 25, 292 Mont. 325, \u00b6 25, 972 P.2d 816, \u00b6 25 (citation omitted) (overruled in part on other grounds by <em>State v. Good, </em>2002 MT 59, 309 Mont. 113, 43 P.3d 948). In determining whether a serious question arose regarding a prospective juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial, we review her <em>voir dire </em>responses as a whole. <em>Harville, </em>\u00b6 10, citing <em>Golie, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-29 and <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-41. In reviewing a challenge for cause based on a juror\u2019s state of mind we emphasize the juror\u2019s spontaneous, and usually initial, statements or responses. <em>Harville, </em>\u00b6 9, citing <em>Golie, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b624 During <em>voir dire, </em>B.M. was questioned about Hausauer\u2019s entitlement to a presumption of innocence. B.M. revealed that she believed Hausauer would not be standing trial \u201cif there wasn\u2019t something connecting him to the crime.\u201d B.M. indicated she would only be convinced Hausauer was not guilty if evidence was presented that proved his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b625 In <em>Devore, </em>we remanded for a new trial on facts similar to those presented here. \u00b6 43 (overruled in part on other grounds). In that case, we concluded the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to dismiss two jurors who repeatedly responded to questions regarding their perception of the defendant\u2019s guilt in relation to the presumption of innocence they would be required to apply as jurors. Both jurors adhered to their belief that the defendant must be \u201cguilty of something\u201d or he would not have been on trial. Throughout repeated questioning, neither juror wavered from his belief that the defendant\u2019s presence in the courtroom carried weight, therein revealing their inability to afford the defendant a presumption of innocence. <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-24 (overruled in part on other grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u00b626 Here, B.M.\u2019s statements and responses to questions during <em>voir dire </em>revealed her inability to apply a presumption of innocence and objectively evaluate Hausauer\u2019s culpability in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">[Defense counsel]: [B.M.], what\u2019s your-your opinion about the fact that Mr. Hausauer\u2019s been charged and how do you feel about the presumption of innocence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">[B.M.]: I have to assume that there was-was some circumstance that-that the police department felt that there\u2019s reason for him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>be here today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\">[Defense counsel]: Okay. And what will you do with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">[B.M.] : Listen to the testimony and decide if it\u2019s-if it\u2019s enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">[Defense counsel]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">[B.M.]: If it\u2019s accurate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">[Defense counsel]: Now how are the scales tipped right now? You say there had to be some reason for him being here. I\u2019m talking to you about the presumption of innocence. So we\u2019re-how are the scales tipped right now in your mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">[B.M.]: Well, that\u2019s hard to-I guess my scales might be tipped a little towards-that there-there\u2019s condemning evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">[Defense counsel]: So -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">[B.M.]: I don\u2019t think you get to this point without that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-13\">[Defense counsel]: Okay. Now I\u2019m going to tell you that the judge will say to you he\u2019s presumed innocent, and the charges are absolutely not evidence at all. When the judge tells you that, can you put aside your kind of sense to the contrary and go with what the judge says, or are you going to have some lingering doubt that\u2019s not good for Mr. Hausauer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-14\">[B.M.]: Well, I \u2014 I\u2014I guess I\u2019d have to truthfully say I-I-I look forward to-to going through the evidence but, no, that there\u2019s-there\u2019s just a-an inkling that-that the police, the fire department, must have a pretty good idea that there\u2019s a link.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af9\">[Defense counsel]: Okay.... If you were on trial, would you want to be judged by a juror who has your attitude and feeling about this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnP\">[B.M.]: Well, I... can listen to the evidence. I think it\u2019s hard to say that anybody doesn\u2019t think that-that this person is-is here because he just happened to be in a motor home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-15\">[Defense counsel]: Well, I\u2019ve conceded he wasn\u2019t on his way to church.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-16\">[B.M]: Yes, but I\u2019m-I\u2019m a fair person but-so what-what I want-so would I want me on my jury? No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-17\">[Defense counsel]: Okay. And why is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-18\">[B.M.]: Just because what ... I said. I ... believe in ... the police department\u2019s ability to investigate and I don\u2019t think if-if there wasn\u2019t enough circumstantial evidence to get him here he wouldn\u2019t be here today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-19\">[Defense counsel]: Okay. So you ... believe that the fact he\u2019s been charged has weight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-20\">[B.M.]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>[Defense counsel]: And you have a hard time putting aside the presumption of innocence because you think that there\u2019s some evidence to the contrary at-at this juncture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">[B.M.]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u00b627 Defense counsel then moved for B.M.\u2019s dismissal for cause, and the District Court asked the State for its position. State\u2019s counsel then attempted to contrast for B.M the level of proof necessary to establish probable cause to arrest Hausauer from the \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard the State would be required to meet at trial. However, State\u2019s counsel never articulated her question in a manner which was understandable to B.M., who remained confused about the distinction the State was trying to make. Ultimately, however, B.M. clearly said that because Hausauer was on trial for a crime, she did not presume he was innocent. Hausauer would need to show evidence of his innocence before B.M. could find him not guilty, as evidenced by her responses to the State\u2019s questions, below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">[State]: You will hear the evidence from the officers and the other people at the scene, which is why we\u2019re here, but my duty is to prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt not just that he had a reason to be here but beyond a reasonable doubt that he did what I say he did to get here. Does that make sense? Is that something you can differentiate in your mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">[B.M.]: Well, I\u2019m not-I\u2019m still not sure I understand the question but-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">[State]: Me either so-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">[B.M.]: I ... I know I can go through the evidence and-and differentiate that fairly but I-but I\u2019m not going to lie to you. I\u2019m going to tell you I-I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be here if there wasn\u2019t something connecting him to the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">[State]: And if I-let\u2019s say my evidence does not prove that to you. That somehow it comes out that he was on his way to Sunday school. Are you able to then-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ari\">[B.M.]: Yes, I can do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">[State]: -find him not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">[B.M.]: I can-I can do that, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">The State objected to Hausauer\u2019s motion to remove B.M. for cause, and the District Court denied the motion. Hausauer used a peremptory challenge to dismiss B.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-14\">\u00b628 The State contends that even though B.M. \u201cbelieved the scales [of justice] might be \u2018tipped\u2019 towards the existence of condemning evidence, she could listen to the evidence\u201d before making an ultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>determination of Hausauer\u2019s guilt. We disagree. Taken as a whole, B.M.\u2019s statements and responses during <em>voir dire </em>reveal she firmly-believed there must be a good reason that Hausauer was on trial. The mere fact that he was charged with a crime, combined with her confidence in law enforcement, carried weight in her mind. B.M.\u2019s statements and responses dining <em>voir dire </em>revealed a serious question as to B.M.\u2019s ability to afford Hausauer the presumption of innocence to which he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b629  We reiterate our preference for dismissal for cause when <em>voir dire </em>reveals a \u201cserious question about a prospective juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial.\u201d <em>Harville, </em>\u00b6 9, citing <em>State v. Richeson, </em>2004 MT 113, \u00b6 14, 321 Mont. 126, \u00b6 14, 89 P.3d 958, \u00b6 14. \u201cWhile there may be some temporary inconvenience to the court and to the parties from excusing a juror for cause, that inconvenience is minor compared to the expense and inconvenience that results from having to retry criminal cases.\u201d <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6 25, citing <em>State v. Williams, </em>262 Mont. 530, 539-40, 866 P.2d 1099, 1104-05 (1993) (overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Good, </em>2002 MT 59, 309 Mont. 113, 43 P.3d 948). The District Court\u2019s failure to dismiss B.M. for cause was an abuse of discretion, and resulted in structural error which requires a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\u00b630 <em>3. Did the District Court err by failing to properly instruct the jury on unanimity?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\u00b631 In essence, Hausauer argues the District Court\u2019s general instruction on unanimity was insufficient because the complex statute under which Hausauer was charged created potential juror confusion regarding unanimity. Specifically, the court failed to clarify that to convict him all twelve jurors must agree that particular criminal acts by Hausauer corresponded to particular elements of his crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">\u00b632  We reverse Hausauer\u2019s case for a new trial on Issue Two, and therefore need not reach the merits of Hausauer\u2019s claim regarding the District Court\u2019s unanimity instruction. We recognize, however, that the District Court will on remand instruct a jury with regards to Hausauer\u2019s right to a unanimous verdict. The right to a unanimous jury verdict is a fundamental right protected by Article II, Section 26 of the Montana Constitution. <em>State v. Vernes, </em>2006 MT 32, \u00b6 21, 331 Mont. 129, \u00b6 21, 130 P.3d 169, \u00b6 21, citing <em>State v. Weaver, </em>1998 MT 167, \u00b6 26, 290 Mont. 58, \u00b6 26, 964 P.2d 713, \u00b6 26. \u201cUnanimity means more than an agreement that the defendant has violated the statute in question; it requires substantial agreement as to the principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>factual elements underlying a specific offense.\u201d <em>Vernes, </em>\u00b6 21 (citation omitted). On remand, the unanimity instructions should fully and fairly instruct the jury on the applicable law. <em>State v. DuBray, </em>2003 MT 255, \u00b6 88, 317 Mont. 377, \u00b6 88, 77 P.3d 247, \u00b6 88 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b633 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b172-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b172-7\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"AEU\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\u00b634 I reluctantly concur in the Court\u2019s reversal of this case because the District Court abused its discretion in not excusing the prospective juror, B.M., for cause. I do so, however, only because the record leaves an unanswered question concerning whether B.M. was a biased juror.</p>\n<p id=\"ArAN\">\u00b635 B.M.\u2019s responses to questions from Hausauer\u2019s counsel do not necessarily show that she was biased in favor of the State or unwilling to accept and apply the presumption of innocence. As shown by the quotations from the record at \u00b6 26 and \u00b6 27 of the Court\u2019s opinion, B.M. did nothing more than express what is naturally in every venire man and woman\u2019s mind when subjected to questions on voir dire concerning the presumption of innocence. That is: \u201cThere must be some evidence of guilt because the defendant has been charged. Otherwise, why would we all be here?\u201d Further, B.M.\u2019s thought was justified. There is enough evidence to charge Hausauer.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">\u00b636 By the use of the leading question, counsel for Hausauer was able to get B.M. to agree that the fact Hausauer had been charged had weight.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, neither counsel for the State, nor the court, determined whether B.M. could and would follow the law, once she was advised that the law unequivocally states that the charge against Hausauer is no evidence whatsoever of his guilt. Therefore, as noted by the Court at \u00b6 23, a serious question about a prospective juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial is raised in this record and it had to be resolved in favor of excusing that juror. <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-10\"> Defense counsel\u2019s next question, \u201cAnd you have a hard time putting aside the presumption of innocence because you think there is some evidence to the contrary at-at this juncture,\u201d actually indicates that B.M. had no bias in favor of the State. By having a hard time putting aside the presumption of innocence, B.M. embraced it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
