We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">\u00b63 (1) Did the State improperly elicit testimony regarding Upshaw\u2019s post <em>-Miranda </em>silence and is this issue reviewable under the common law plain error doctrine?</p>\n<p id=\"b187-15\">\u00b64 (2) May Upshaw\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel be raised on direct appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b187-17\">\u00b65 (3) Did the District Court err by failing to consider the presumption that Upshaw was entitled to deferred imposition of sentence for possession of dangerous drugs?</p>\n<p id=\"b187-19\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b187-20\">\u00b66 On June 12,2003, at approximately 3:00 a.m., Upshaw broke into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>the home of Brenda Parmer (Parmer) in Missoula, Montana. Parmer, who was sixty-one years old, lived with her son, Brian Pierre (Brian), and her two granddaughters, Brandy Hiner (Hiner) and Lueanna Pierre (Lueanna), Brian\u2019s daughter. Four young men assisted Upshaw with the break-in, and all the intruders wore bandanas over their faces. Parmer testified that Upshaw pushed her to the floor and commanded her to \u201cstay.\u201d One young man kicked a hole in the bedroom door; another kicked in the door to Hiner\u2019s bedroom and kicked her in the face, and Upshaw threatened Hiner with a knife. Lueanna, who shared a bedroom with Hiner, took the telephone into her closet and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b67 Upshaw and her co-intruders fled before police arrived. In her statement to the police, Hiner identified Upshaw as the assailant. Hiner told the interviewing officer that she was positive it was Upshaw, and that she was afraid she would be killed. Hiner, who was twenty-one years old at the time of trial, testified that she first met Upshaw in jail in 2002, and that they had been friends, but she did not recall for how long. She said that she had kissed Upshaw, but denied any sexual relationship. She testified that she had been at a friend\u2019s house on the evening of June 11, 2003, before the assault occurred on the morning of June 12, and that she and Upshaw had had a disagreement. During the trial, Hiner read a portion of her earlier police interview in which she said Upshaw was \u201cpsycho because she drinks all the time\u201d and that Upshaw had been angry with her and had acted as if Hiner were \u201cher girlfriend or something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b68 Lueanna testified at trial that on June 11, 2003, she picked Hiner up at a mutual friend\u2019s house and Upshaw slashed her tires before Hiner got in the car, using a knife with a black handle. Lueanna said she drove away, ruining her tires and rims, because she was frightened and did not want to suffer more damage to her car. Upshaw was arrested the afternoon of June 12, 2003, and the police found a small blue plastic box in her pocket which contained trace amounts of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u00b69 Detective Baker, of the Missoula City Police Department, was the primary investigator in the case. He testified that Hiner and Lueanna immediately identified Upshaw as their assailant in a photographic lineup. Parmer was unable to identify Upshaw in the lineup, but stated that she recognized Upshaw\u2019s voice. Brian did not recognize anyone in the six photographs used for the lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b610 The State filed an information charging Upshaw with count I: assault with a weapon, a felony, as specified in \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>(2003); count II: aggravated burglary, a felony, as specified in \u00a7 45-6-204(2), MCA (2003); and count III: aggravated burglary. Upshaw was represented by counsel, Margaret Borg and Ed Sheehy, at all stages of the trial proceedings. Upshaw entered pleas of not guilty. On November 21, 2003, the State filed an amended information, which added count IV: criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a felony, as specified in \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA (2003). At a pretrial conference, Upshaw\u2019s counsel declared an intention to file a motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude any reference to Upshaw\u2019s prior crime of allegedly stabbing her sister. The State advised they would concede this issue. A jury trial was held, and the jury found Upshaw guilty on counts I, II, and IV; count III was dismissed during trial upon stipulation of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b611 The District Court sentenced Upshaw to concurrent terms of twenty years with five years suspended on counts I and II, to be served at the Women\u2019s Correctional Facility in Billings, Montana. On count IV, Upshaw received a five-year sentence, to run concurrently with the sentences on counts I and II. Upshaw\u2019s trial counsel withdrew on June 7,2004. The court appointed Patricia Bik on July 1, 2004, to represent Upshaw on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b612 \u201cThis Court may discretionarily review claimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental Constitutional rights, even if no contemporaneous objection is made and notwithstanding the applicability of \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, criteria, where failing to review the claimed error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State v. Godfrey, </em>2004 MT 197, \u00b6 22, 322 Mont. 254, \u00b6 22, 95 P.3d 166, \u00b6 22 (citing <em>State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 137, 915 P.2d 208, 215 (1996)). \u2018We use our inherent power of common law plain error review sparingly, on a case-by-case basis, and only in the class of cases aforementioned.\u201d <em>Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 22 (citing <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 138, 915 P.2d at 215). \u201cThe particular facts and circumstances of each case drive the applicability of the plain error doctrine.\u201d <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 134, 915 P.2d at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b613 We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel <em>de novo. State v. Turner, </em>2000 MT 70, \u00b6 47, 302 Mont. 69, \u00b6 47, 12 P.3d 934, \u00b6 47. We review a criminal sentence for legality to determine whether the sentence is within the parameters provided by statute. <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>DISCUSSION Issue One</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b614 <em>Did the State improperly elicit testimony regarding Upshaw\u2019s post-Miranda silence and is this issue reviewable under the common law plain error doctrine?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b615 Upshaw urges this Court to invoke plain error review and reverse her conviction. She argues that the State violated her constitutional right to due process and privilege against self-incrimination by eliciting testimony from a law enforcement officer at trial that informed the jury of Upshaw\u2019s decision to remain silent after she received <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Upshaw contends that Doyle <em>v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240 (1976), is controlling and requires reversal of her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b616 The State responds that the prosecutor did not commit Doyle error by eliciting evidence of Upshaw\u2019s post <em>-Miranda </em>silence. It contends that the evidence came from a non-responsive answer by an officer, and that the prosecutor did not capitalize on the answer. It argues that the remarks at issue here differ in two important respects from those in <em>Doyle: </em>the prosecution did not deliberately seek to put the evidence before the jury, and the prosecution did not use the evidence of post-<em>Miranda </em>silence to impeach Upshaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u00b617 In reply, Upshaw argues that the cases the State uses to support its argument are not applicable. She contends that her claim of error mirrors that of the defendant in <em>Finley, </em>and thus plain error review is appropriate. Upshaw asserts that the evidence of her post <em>-Miranda </em>silence undermined her credibility before the jury. She contends that once her refusal \u201cto tell her side of the story\u201d was put before the jury by Detective Baker, the prosecutor let the inference of guilt raised by her silence \u201cwork its magic\u201d on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">\u00b618 In <em>Doyle, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the State may not seek to impeach a defendant\u2019s exculpatory story, told for the first time at trial, by cross-examining the defendant about his failure to have told the story after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings at the time of his arrest. 426 U.S. at 611, 96 S. Ct. at 2241. In <em>Doyle, </em>the defendants were arrested together and charged with selling ten pounds of marijuana to a local narcotics bureau informant. They were convicted in separate trials, held approximately one week apart, during which the prosecutor asked each of the two defendants why they had not maintained their innocence and given their \u201cframe-up\u201d story on their arrest. During the course of their state criminal trials, the defendants, who were given <em>Miranda </em>warnings after their arrest, took the stand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>and gave an exculpatory story they had not previously told to the police or the prosecutor. The cross-examination of defendant Doyle contained the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\">Q. [By the prosecutor]... You are innocent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">A. [By Doyle] I am innocent. Yes Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">Q. That\u2019s why you told the police department and Kenneth Beamer when they arrived-(Continuing.)-about your innocence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">A. ... I didn\u2019t tell them about my innocence. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">Q. You said nothing at all about how you had been set up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">Q. Did Mr. Wood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">A. Not that I recall, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">Q. As a matter of fact, if I recall your testimony correctly, you said instead of protesting your innocence, as you do today, you said in response to a question of Mr. Beamer-I don\u2019t know what you are talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-12\">A. I believe what I said-What\u2019s this all about? If I remember, that\u2019s the only thing I said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-13\">A. I was questioning, you know, what it was about. That\u2019s what I didn\u2019t know. I knew that I was trying to buy, which was wrong, but I didn\u2019t know what was going on. I didn\u2019t know that Bill Bonnell was trying to frame me, or what-have-you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-14\">Q. All right-But you didn\u2019t protest your innocence at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1Tq\">A. Not until I knew what was going on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-15\"><em>Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 614, n. 5, 96 S. Ct. at 2243, n. 5. In addition, the court permitted the prosecutors, over objections, to argue the petitioners\u2019 post-arrest silence to the jury in their closing arguments. <em>Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 614, n. 5, 96 S. Ct. at 2243, n. 5. The Supreme Court reversed the conviction and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-16\">[W]hile it is true that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings. In such circumstances, it would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-17\">426 U.S. at 618, 96 S. Ct. at 2245.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-18\">\u00b619 Applying <em>Doyle, </em>this Court has held that \u201c[o]nce a <em>Miranda </em>warning of any sort is given, it is error for a prosecutor to comment on a defendant\u2019s post <em>-Miranda </em>silence or his failure to offer a post-Miranda explanation of the alleged crime.\u201d <em>Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 31. Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Upshaw argues that the testimony elicited from the detective by the prosecutor violated her right to due process and her privilege against self-incrimination. Because Upshaw\u2019s counsel did not object to the testimony at trial, we must first determine whether this issue is reviewable under the common law plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b620 In <em>Godfrey, </em>this Court held that the plain error doctrine was not applicable. Godfrey\u2019s appeal stemmed from two instances of prosecutorial misconduct. First, the prosecutor began his cross-examination of Godfrey as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">Q. Mr. Godfrey ... how old are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">A. I\u2019ll be 35 December 15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">Q. Old enough to have explanations for certain events; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">A. I\u2019m not following you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">Q. Well, you have an explanation for what took place in October in your bus, don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">A. That\u2019s the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-11\">Q. And you have another explanation for what took place in the summer of\u201999 in the bus, don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-13\">Q. Okay. And it\u2019s been nearly seven months since the time of that initial search warrant, hasn\u2019t it been?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-15\">Q. So, you had seven months to think up an explanation, isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-16\">A. I didn\u2019t think nothing up. I\u2019m telling the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-17\">Q. And this is the first time that anyone has really heard this explanation; isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-18\">A. No, it\u2019s not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-19\"><em>Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 18. Godfrey\u2019s counsel did not object to this line of questioning. The second incident occurred at the end of trial, when the prosecutor, again without objection from Godfrey\u2019s counsel, stated in his closing argument: \u201c[h]e knew it was always going to be his word or my word type of thing. He always knew that. He\u2019s not a dummy. You saw him testify. He articulates well. He\u2019s got an explanation. He\u2019s had plenty of time to think about it.\u201d <em>Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 19. This Court held, \u201c[w]e conclude that the particular facts of this case do not compel the application of the plain error doctrine because there simply was no clear comment on or infringement of Godfrey\u2019s fundamental right to remain silent.\u201d <em>Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-20\">\u00b621 In <em>Town of Columbus v. Harrington, </em>2001 MT 258, 307 Mont. 215, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>36 P.3d 937, the prosecutor, during a driving under the influence (DUI) prosecution: (1) commented during voir dire that the defendant did not \u201chave to take the stand ... [h]e can take the stand if he wants to\u201d; (2) elicited testimony that the defendant invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights; and (3) elicited testimony that further police questioning would have been improper after a defendant invokes his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Harrington, \u00b6 </em>10. We held that these actions did not constitute <em>Doyle </em>error because \u201c[n]o comment was made that Harrington at any time refused to give a statement or refused to <em>testify.\u201dHarrington, </em>\u00b6 17. The fourth error in <em>Harrington </em>occurred during closing arguments when the prosecutor stated that the defendant offered no contradictory evidence to dispute the law enforcement officer\u2019s observations. Since Harrington himself was the only competent witness who could have offered testimony to counter the officer, this Court concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s comment constituted an improper reference to the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify. <em>Harrington, </em>\u00b6 21. We subjected the fourth error to plain error review and concluded that the error was harmless. <em>Harrington, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b622 In <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>280 Mont. 25, 927 P.2d 1033 (1996), the prosecutor commented on Sullivan\u2019s silence in his opening statement, introduced testimony regarding Sullivan\u2019s decision to remain silent during direct examination of the detective, and commented on Sullivan\u2019s silence twice during his closing argument. Sullivan\u2019s counsel did not object to these remarks. This Court invoked the common law plain error doctrine, and determined that Sullivan\u2019s constitutional right to due process had been violated. We held that \u201cthe prosecutor committed <em>Doyle </em>error when he commented on Sullivan\u2019s post-<em>Miranda </em>silence during the State\u2019s opening statement, case-in-chief, and closing argument.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>280 Mont. at 35, 927 P.2d at 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"AYq-\">\u00b623 Similarly, in <em>State v. Furlong, </em>213 Mont. 251, 690 P.2d 986 (1984), this Court found <em>Doyle </em>error when the prosecutor questioned the defendant thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">Q. Is this the first time you have told this story to anyone, Mr. Furlong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">A. Except what I have discussed with my lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">Q. You didn\u2019t think to tell the Police, the investigator, the County Attorney this before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">A. Nobody came to me and asked me what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-11\">Q. You are charged with a felony crime. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-13\">Q. You never thought about just mentioning that to somebody, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\">A. Mentioning what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">Q. That you have no idea how the property got in your car, never crossed your mind to mention that to anybody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">A. What do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">Q. When you were arrested by Sergeant Krakalia, you didn\u2019t just happen to mention, I don\u2019t know how that property got in there. I loaned my car to Johnny and he came back with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">A. I didn\u2019t say anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">Q. But you are going to be arrested on a felony crime and you don\u2019t think to offer an explanation when you are a totally innocent victim?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-10\"><em>Furlong, </em>213 Mont. at 256-57, 690 P.2d at 989. At that point, Furlong\u2019s attorney asked that the jury be instructed that nobody is required to give a statement in that situation and what it would prove would be merely speculation; this was overruled. <em>Furlong, </em>213 Mont. at 257, 690 P.2d at 989. On appeal, this Court concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s extensive cross-examination regarding his post <em>-Miranda </em>silence rose to the level of <em>Doyle </em>error and denied Furlong\u2019s constitutional right to due process. <em>Furlong, </em>213 Mont. at 258, 690 P.2d at 989. The <em>Godfrey </em>Court distinguished the facts before it from those in <em>Sullivan </em>and <em>Furlong. Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">\u00b624 In the instant case, Upshaw alleges her constitutional rights were violated during the State\u2019s questioning of Detective Baker. The questioning and testimony were as follows, to which no objection was made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-12\">Q. [By Mr. Paul] Officer tell us-Detective, tell us what happened next.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-13\">A. [Detective Baker] She [Upshaw] was placed under arrest. She had outstanding warrants, and I told her that we were going to go down to the police department, and I was going to give her a chance to talk to me and be interviewed to provide her side of the story because there\u2019s always two sides ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-14\">Q. So did you get a chance to speak with the defendant there at the police station?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-15\">A. I spoke with Adrienne Upshaw in-in an interview setting ... I turned on the audio recording device, cassette tape; again advised her of the Miranda Warning before any questions were asked of her; and she invoked her right to have an attorney before any questions so the interview was stopped. I believe her interview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>lasted no more than two minutes from the time the tape was on until it was turned off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">On appeal, Upshaw concedes that the prosecutor did not comment directly on her silence during opening or closing statements, but argues that the jury instead learned of her decision to exercise her right to remain silent after her arrest through \u201cthe carefully crafted\u201d testimony of Detective Baker. Upshaw contends that Detective Baker\u2019s testimony \u201cset the stage\u201d for the jury to infer that an innocent person in Upshaw\u2019s position would have \u201cseized the chance to talk\u201d to law enforcement and would have told \u201cher side of the story\u201d to clear her name.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u00b625 The State contends that neither of the prosecutor\u2019s questions invited the detective\u2019s answers which revealed Upshaw\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence. The State argues that no <em>Doyle </em>error occurred because the prosecutor did not attempt to capitalize on the detective\u2019s detailed and essentially non-responsive answers, that he did not question or confront Upshaw on this issue when he cross-examined her, and that he did not refer to her post <em>-Miranda </em>silence during his final argument.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq-m\">\u00b626 The brief mention of Upshaw\u2019s choice to remain silent was confined to a minor portion of the detective\u2019s testimony. The prosecutor did not pursue this issue, did not use the testimony to impeach Upshaw, and made no mention of it in either his cross-examination of Upshaw or in his closing argument. Unlike in <em>Sullivan </em>and <em>Furlong, </em>the prosecutor here did not comment upon the fact that Upshaw had failed earlier to volunteer her version of events to the police. \u201cA fundamental aspect of \u2018plain error,\u2019 is that the alleged error must indeed be \u2018plain.\u2019\u201d <em>Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 38. The error should leave one firmly convinced that the prosecutor\u2019s comments created an inference for the jury that by remaining silent after receiving her rights, the defendant must be guilty of the alleged crime. <em>Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 38. What occurred here does not lead to this firm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b627  We conclude that the facts of this case do not call for the application of the plain error doctrine because there was no clear comment on or infringement of Upshaw\u2019s fundamental right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Issue Two</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\u00b628 <em>May Upshaw\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel he raised on direct appeal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">\u00b629 Upshaw argues that her trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to object to numerous issues at trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>including: (a) testimony alleging that Upshaw packed a knife, testimony regarding Upshaw\u2019s other crimes, and testimony regarding an alleged lesbian liaison; (b) the filing of the allegedly unlawful amended information; and (c) the State\u2019s alleged <em>Doyle </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b630 The State argues that Upshaw\u2019s ineffectiveness claims should be deferred for post-conviction relief. The State maintains that Upshaw\u2019s ineffectiveness claims based on her counsel\u2019s failure to object are not record-based because a decision of whether to object to evidence is largely a tactical one, not one dictated by rote observance of evidentiary rules, and counsel should be given an opportunity to explain his tactical decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b631 In reply, Upshaw argues that she seeks review of her counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance under the exception to the record-based rule-namely, that no plausible tactical explanation exists to justify counsel\u2019s inaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b632 Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution and the Sixth Amendment guarantee a person the right to the effective assistance of counsel. When reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, this Court uses the two-pronged test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). That test requires the defendant to establish that counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell short of the range of competence required of attorneys in criminal cases and that counsel\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial to his case.\u201d <em>State v. Hendricks, </em>2003 MT 223, \u00b6 6, 317 Mont. 177, \u00b6 6, 75 P.3d 1268, \u00b6 6. There is a strong presumption with regard to the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test that trial counsel\u2019s performance was based on sound trial strategy and falls within the broad range of reasonable professional conduct. <em>Hendricks, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u00b633  However, before reaching the merits of an ineffective assistance claim, this Court must first determine whether the allegations are properly before the Court on appeal or whether the claim should be raised in a petition for post-conviction relief, pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA. <em>State v. Dyfort, </em>2000 MT 338, \u00b6 8, 303 Mont. 153, \u00b6 8, 15 P.3d 464, \u00b6 8. The general rule is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">[W]here ineffective assistance of counsel claims are based on facts of record in the underlying case, they must be raised in the direct appeal; conversely, where the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be documented from the record in the underlying case, those claims must be raised by petition for postconviction relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-9\"><em>Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6 12, 293 Mont. 60, \u00b6 12, 973 P.2d 233, \u00b6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>12. The test to determine if an ineffective assistance claim is properly brought on direct appeal is whether the record contains the answer as to \u201cwhy\u201d counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense. <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 58, \u00b6 20, 30 P.3d 340, \u00b6 20. Decisions regarding the number and timing of objections lie within counsel\u2019s tactical discretion. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 16. As a result, \u201cnon-record based information explaining the tactic may be involved, and thus [the claim] should be barred from review on direct appeal.\u201d <em>White, </em>\u00b6 16. A non-record based act or omission by counsel can include a failure to object to the admission of evidence, since \u201cthe use or non-use of objections may be purely tactical.\u201d <em>State v. Webster, </em>2005 MT 38, \u00b6 15, 326 Mont. 112, \u00b6 15, 107 P.3d 500, \u00b6 15. If the record does not fully explain why counsel failed to object to the admission of evidence, the matter is best suited for post-conviction proceedings. <em>State v. Notti, </em>2003 MT 296, \u00b6 8, 318 Mont. 146, \u00b6 8, 79 P.3d 289, \u00b6 8. In <em>State v. Dyfort, </em>counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission of a defendant\u2019s plea agreement resulted from an off-record discussion at trial. Thus, the record was inadequate to explain why counsel had, in fact, consented to the admission of the evidence. <em>Dyfort, </em>\u00b6 11. <em>See also State v. St. John, </em>2001 MT 1, 304 Mont. 47, 15 P.3d 970 (counsel\u2019s failure to object on the record to a district court\u2019s failure to consider sentencing alternatives was not record-based, and therefore was an inappropriate claim for direct appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b634 An exception to the requirement for a record-based answer as to why counsel acted or failed to act arises where \u201cno plausible justification\u201d exists to counter a claim of ineffective assistance on appeal. <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 15, 323 Mont. 6, \u00b6 15, 97 P.3d 1095, \u00b6 15. Circumstances in which this exception arises are rare. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 15. <em>State v. Jefferson, </em>2003 MT 90, 315 Mont. 146, 69 P.3d 641, is an example of when the exception applies. In <em>Jefferson, </em>the defendant withdrew a guilty plea to a felony assault charge. In doing so, he indicated that he wished to seek an acquittal. The defendant was subsequently tried for the more serious charge of attempted homicide. In his remarks to the jury, defense counsel admitted that the defendant was guilty of felony assault. This statement totally undermined the defendant\u2019s attempt to obtain a complete acquittal on all charges. In that situation, we found that there was \u201cno plausible justification for counsel\u2019s conduct under these circumstances.\u201d <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b635 As we stated <em>in Kougl, </em>\u201cgiven the existence of a \u2018plausible\u2019 (but not necessarily \u2018actual\u2019) justification, the proper action for this Court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>to dismiss the appeal without prejudice and allow the defendant to seek relief through a postconviction hearing.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 19. Applying the foregoing to the case at bar, we examine each of Upshaw\u2019s allegations individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">a. Failure to object to character testimony about Upshaw carrying a knife, testimony regarding Upshaw\u2019s other crimes, and testimony from Upshaw regarding an alleged lesbian liaison.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b636 Upshaw first argues that her trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to testimony alleging that she \u201cpacked a knife\u201d constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. Upshaw contends that pursuant to M. R. Evid. 404 and 405, evidence of her character and reputation was inadmissible. She further contends that no plausible explanation can frame counsel\u2019s failure to object to the testimony as a tactical decision, and that because of this, the reason why counsel remained silent is irrelevant. The State responds that none of the evidentiary issues that Upshaw appeals support a record-based claim of ineffectiveness. Alternatively, the State contends that Upshaw\u2019s argument fails because the testimony was admissible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b637 Second, Upshaw argues that her trial counsel was ineffective because he did not object to questions regarding her earlier charge for stabbing her sister, a matter on which the District Court had granted her motion <em>in limine. </em>The State argues that this issue is inappropriate for direct appeal and should be reserved for post-conviction relief. Alternatively, the State argues that Upshaw\u2019s answers to other questions opened the door to this topic, and her counsel\u2019s failure to object did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u00b638 Third, Upshaw argues that her trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of herself and Hiner about whether they had a lesbian relationship. She argues that the questions were irrelevant and inflammatory. The State argues that this issue is not appropriate for direct appeal and should be reserved for post-conviction relief. Alternatively, the State argues that evidence of a relationship between Hiner and Upshaw was relevant because it helped establish a motive for Upshaw\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\u00b639 Upon review of the record, we determine that it does not fully explain why defense counsel did not object to the testimony. During the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Upshaw regarding her use of knives, three discussions took place off the record, thus making it impossible for us to determine defense counsel\u2019s reasons for not objecting to this evidence. At a March 4, 2004, pretrial hearing, the</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>court granted Upshaw\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to \u201cpreclude any reference to [Upshaw\u2019s] prior charge of allegedly stabbing her sister.\u201d At trial, during the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination of Upshaw, the prosecutor questioned Upshaw regarding evidence of her past crimes, including the stabbing of her sister. The record reveals that defense counsel did not object to either the prosecution\u2019s questions or the defendant\u2019s testimony regarding the facts and circumstances surrounding Upshaw\u2019s prior criminal charge and subsequent conviction. However, a review of the record reveals that, during this testimony, the prosecutor requested to approach the bench, and a discussion took place between counsel and the judge off the record. In addition, during Upshaw\u2019s cross-examination, the prosecutor requested a sidebar with counsel before the bench, and the court announced a fifteen minute recess. It was after this break that the prosecutor brought up the June 22, 2001, aggravated assault charge against Upshaw for stabbing her own sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b640 Similarly, during a portion of Hiner\u2019s testimony regarding her and Upshaw\u2019s relationship, off the record discussions took place-in fact, during Hiner\u2019s direct examination, no less than four discussions took place off the record. Obviously, significant discussions were held regarding these evidentiary issues which we have no access to. Consequently, counsel's reasons for not objecting to this testimony regarding other crimes are not discernible from the record, and we will not speculate on those reasons, and whether they were appropriately tactical. Additionally, we cannot conclude that there is no plausible justification for this lack of objections. As we have noted, whether or not to object is typically a tactical decision, <em>White, </em>\u00b6 16, and we declined to undertake review of an evidentiary issue that involved an off the record discussion in <em>Dyfort. Dyfort, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12. There may be a plausible justification for counsel\u2019s actions, and thus the issues should be reserved for a post-conviction relief proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">b. Failure to object to the amended information.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b641 Upshaw argues that her counsel was ineffective because he did not object to the amended information, which included two charges of aggravated burglary arising out of a single structural entry. The State argues that resolution on this matter should likewise await a post-conviction relief proceeding. Alternatively, the State argues that because one of the aggravated burglary charges (count III) was ultimately dismissed by the court at trial, waiting until that time to dismiss the count did not prejudice Upshaw because the evidence related to the additional count was nevertheless admissible under \u00a7 26-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>1-103, MCA (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b642 The amended information charged Upshaw with one count of assault with a weapon, two counts of aggravated burglary, and one count of criminal possession of dangerous drugs. One of the counts of aggravated burglary was later dismissed. Based on the foregoing analysis and upon our review of the record, we determine that the record does not fully explain why defense counsel failed to object to this charge earlier in the proceeding. We conclude that there may be a plausible justification, and it is more appropriate for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">c. Failure to object to the State\u2019s alleged <em>Doyle </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b643 Upshaw contends that her counsel\u2019s failure to object to Detective Baker\u2019s testimony regarding the invoking of her right to silence constitutes deficient performance. However, as we determined earlier, the State\u2019s questioning of Detective Baker did not rise to the level of <em>Doyle </em>error, and thus the argument of ineffective assistance of counsel on this point is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b644 We conclude that we cannot address Upshaw\u2019s remaining ineffective assistance of counsel claims without considering matters outside the record. All of her remaining contentions would be more appropriately raised in a post-conviction relief proceeding. Therefore, we dismiss Upshaw\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel without prejudice to post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Issue Three</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">\u00b645 <em>Did the District Court err by failing to consider the presumption that Upshaw was entitled to deferred imposition of sentence for possession of dangerous drugs?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">\u00b646 Upshaw argues that the District Court erred in failing to consider the statutory presumption that she was entitled to a deferred sentence on her conviction for the drug possession charge, pursuant to \u00a7 45-9-102(6), MCA (2003). Upshaw contends that the District Court\u2019s discussion of the option of deferred sentencing focused exclusively on the violent nature of the offenses enumerated by counts I and II, and the risk to the community posed by a violent offender. Moreover, Upshaw argues that the State presented no evidence to rebut the presumption that she was entitled to a deferred sentencing on count IV. Upshaw concedes that because the court ordered her five-year prison term for drug possession to rim concurrently with the two twenty-year terms on counts I and II, she will not be required to serve additional time in prison as a result of the court\u2019s failure to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>deferred sentencing on count IV. However, she claims that due to the court\u2019s action, she is denied the opportunity to clear the drug possession conviction from her criminal record after a period of deferral.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b647 The State argues that the court did consider Upshaw\u2019s request that it defer imposition of sentences on all counts, and declined to grant the request because there was violence was involved in the matter. The State contends that the District Court treated the entire conviction on three counts as instances of the problems that Upshaw presented to the community, and there was no evidence that Upshaw\u2019s drug use was an isolated component of her other criminal behavior, and the court was within its bounds on sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b648 Section 45-9-102(5), MCA (2003), sets the maximum period of incarceration for the crime of possession of a dangerous drug at five years. Section 45-9-102(6), MCA (2003), further states: \u201c[a] person convicted of a first violation under this section is presumed to be entitled to a deferred imposition of sentence of imprisonment.\u201d The District Court addressed defense counsel\u2019s recommendation for a deferred sentence in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">Deferred imposition of sentence in my general orientation is reserved for those where there is no violence, and generally it\u2019s a victimless crime although on occasion there have been victims, and I acknowledge that, but this crime and the risk I think to the community are much greater, and I\u2019m concerned that the next violation might be more severe and that damage to possible victims would be greater if you remained in the community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The District Court pronounced twenty-year sentences for the offenses of assault with a weapon (count I) and aggravated burglary (count II), and sentenced Upshaw to a five-year commitment to the Women\u2019s Prison for the offense of possession of dangerous drugs (count IV).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">\u00b649  In <em>State v. Bolt, </em>204 Mont. 261, 664 P.2d 322 (1983), we determined that it is unnecessary to restrict the evidence admissible for overcoming the presumption in favor of deferred imposition of sentence only to evidence relative to the crime charged-possession of a dangerous drug. Rather, the presumption is to be weighed against all other evidence relevant to sentencing. <em>Bolt, </em>204 Mont. at 266, 664 P.2d at 324-25. Here, the District Court judge found Upshaw to be a violent offender. The court determined that Upshaw broke into a residence on June 12, 2003, and threatened Hiner with a knife. The court found that Upshaw remained unlawfully at the residence with the purpose to commit assault on Parmer, and that the arresting officers found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>drugs on Upshaw\u2019s person. Thus, any presumption that Upshaw was entitled to a deferred imposition of sentence was rebutted by the charges themselves and the information at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b650  We conclude that the State did not improperly elicit testimony regarding Upshaw\u2019s post-Miranda silence, Upshaw\u2019s remaining ineffective assistance of counsel claims are reserved for post-conviction relief, and the District Court correctly considered and rejected the statutory presumption of a deferred imposition of sentence for Upshaw\u2019s drug possession charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u00b651 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b202-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b202-8\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"Ae8\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">\u00b652 I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">\u00b653 The prosecutor requested a narrative statement from the State\u2019s witness, Detective Baker, \u201cDetective, tell us what happened next.\u201d In response to this open-ended invitation, Detective Baker responded, \u201c... I told her that we were going to go down to the police department, and I was going to give her a chance to talk to me and be interviewed to provide her side of the story because there\u2019s always two sides ....\u201d The prosecutor then asked the detective to take the matter a step further by asking, \u201cSo did you get a chance to speak with the defendant there at the police station?\u201d To which the detective replied that, yes he did speak with her at the station where he advised her of the <em>Miranda </em>warning before any questions were asked of her and that \u201cshe invoked her right to have an attorney before any questions so the interview was stopped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">\u00b654 The question is, did this sworn testimony from the detective violate the principles of the <em>Doyle </em>decision? <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240 (1976). The State argues that there was no violation of <em>Doyle </em>because the testimony was the result of a \u201cnon-responsive answer\u201d and the prosecutor did not seek to capitalize on the testimony to impeach Upshaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">\u00b655 The State\u2019s argument that the testimony arose from a \u201cnon-responsive answer\u201d is somewhat disingenuous given that the prosecutor did not pose a \u201cquestion\u201d seeking a \u201cresponse.\u201d Rather, he merely asked the detective to give an open-ended narrative: \u201cTell us what happened next.\u201d If an attorney chooses to seek narrative answers, he or she must have the witness adequately prepared so as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>to avoid inadvertent discussion of legally forbidden topics. Whether the detective\u2019s testimony was elicited or volunteered, the consequence to the defendant is the same: the jury is informed that the defendant, although given the opportunity, chose not to tell the officer \u2018her side of the story.\u201d The purpose of the <em>Doyle </em>rule is not to punish the prosecution but to honor and preserve the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent, irrespective of whether the testimony was intentionally elicited or inadvertently volunteered.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b656 Similarly, the argument that the State did not attempt to \u201cuse\u201d the testimony against the defendant misses the point. The question is not whether the State used the testimony, but whether the jury \u201cused\u201d or relied on the evidence in reaching its determination of guilt. We can only assume that the jury considered all the evidence and testimony before it regardless of whether the prosecutor chose to emphasize the testimony or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b657 Finally, as the Court points out, since defense counsel did not object to the detective\u2019s testimony at trial, a question is presented as to whether the alleged error should be reviewed under the common law plain error rule. The Court\u2019s opinion is puzzling in this regard in that the Court concludes that there was no plain error. With no objection and no plain error, the Court would normally conclude that the <em>Doyle </em>issue is not properly before us. The Court, despite the absence of plain error, nonetheless engages in a <em>Doyle </em>analysis and concludes that: \u201cThe brief mention of Upshaw\u2019s choice to remain silent was confined to a minor portion of the detective\u2019s testimony. The prosecutor did not pursue this issue, did not use the testimony to impeach Upshaw and made no mention of it in either his cross-examination of Upshaw or in his closing argument. Unlike in <em>Sullivan </em>and <em>Furlong, </em>the prosecutor here did not comment upon the fact that Upshaw had failed earlier to volunteer her version of events to the police.\u201d \u00b6 26. Logic dictates that, unless there was plain error, the Court would not have made these observations which are only relevant to a <em>Doyle </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b658 As indicated above, I would conclude that the errors alleged by Upshaw implicated fundamental constitutional rights and thus amounted to plain error. <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>280 Mont. 25, 32-33, 927 P.2d 1033, 1037-38 (1996). Upshaw, like Sullivan, alleges that the testimony in question violated her right to due process and her privilege against self-incrimination. In <em>Sullivan </em>we found plain error and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">Because of the importance of these [fundamental] rights and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>effect that a denial of these rights would have on the fairness of a trial, and notwithstanding defense counsel\u2019s failure to contemporaneously object or to claim error pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, our failure to review Sullivan\u2019s claims would leave unsettled a question as to the fundamental fairness of his trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apm\"><em>Sullivan, </em>280 Mont. at 33, 927 P.2d at 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b659 Here, the detective\u2019s testimony clearly created an inference for the jury that by remaining silent after having been given an opportunity to tell \u201cher side of the story,\u201d Upshaw must be guilty of the alleged crime. Our failure to find plain error leaves unsettled a question as to the fundamental fairness of her trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b660 Given the <em>Doyle </em>error, I would reverse Upshaw\u2019s conviction</p>\n<judges id=\"b204-6\">JUSTICE NELSON concurs in the dissent of JUSTICE LEAPHART.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
