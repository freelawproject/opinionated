Zuazua, brought this action in the United States District Court for the District of Montana to recover damages, in part, for Defendants Tom and Carol Tibbies, Coldwell Banker Gateway Realty, and Patti Stone\u2019s failure to fulfill their duties to Zuazua under \u00a7 37-51-313(4), MCA. Zuazua moved for partial summary judgment, alleging that \u00a7 37-51-313(4), MCA, precludes a buyer agent from simultaneously representing more than one buyer competing for the same property. Because the answer was determinative to the case and no appellate decision, constitutional provision, or statute clearly controls, the District Court certified a question and seven relevant, undisputed facts to this Court pursuant to M. R. App. P. 44(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">\u00b62 We accepted the certified question which we restate<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as:</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">\u00b63 Does a buyer agent breach his obligation to a buyer under \u00a7 3 7-51-313(4), MCA, when a buyer agent simultaneously represents more than one buyer competing for the same property?</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">\u00b64 Our answer is yes, a buyer agent breaches his obligation to a buyer under \u00a7 37-51-313(4), MCA, when a buyer agent simultaneously represents more than one buyer competing for the same property.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">CERTIFIED FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">\u00b65 1. Defendants Tom and Carol Tibbies are real estate brokers licensed and doing business in Montana as Coldwell Banker Gateway Realty (Coldwell Banker).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-15\">\u00b66 2. Defendant Patti Stone is a licensed real estate agent doing business in Montana, and for all purposes relative to the complaint, was employed by the Tibbleses as an agent and was acting within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>course and scope of her agency. Tom and Carol Tibbies are therefore liable for the acts of Stone.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b67 3. Plaintiff Amador F. Zuazua and Stone signed a \u201cRelationships in Real Estate Transactions (Combined Explanation and Disclosure)\u201d form on July 6,2003, establishing Stone as Zuazua\u2019s buyer agent. The agency disclosure form included the language of \u00a7 37-51-313(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AGy\">\u00b68 4. On July 8, 2003, Zuazua authorized Stone to extend an offer to buy real property commonly known as 2719 Kings Point Road, Poison, Montana. The initial offer was contained in a buy-sell agreement signed by Zuazua and Stone as Zuazua\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u00b69 5. Stone and Louis Moritzky signed a \u201cRelationships in Real Estate Transactions (Combined Explanation and Disclosure)\u201d form on July 12, 2003, establishing Stone as Moritzky\u2019s buyer agent. The form was identical to the one Stone and Zuazua had signed and it included the language of \u00a7 37-51-313(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u00b610 6. On July 12,2003, Moritzky authorized Stone to extend an offer to buy real property commonly known as 2719 Kings Point Road, Poison, Montana. The initial offer was contained in a buy-sell agreement signed by Moritzky and Stone as Moritzky\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\u00b611 7. The seller testified in his deposition that he considered both offers and decided to accept the Moritzky offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">\u00b612 Does a buyer agent breach his obligation to a buyer under \u00a7 37-51-313(4), MCA, when a buyer agent simultaneously represents more than one buyer competing for the same property?</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">\u00b613 A. <em>Does \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(a), MCA, prohibit a buyer agent from representing competing buyers?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">\u00b614 Section 37-51-313, MCA, governs the relationship between brokers and buyers or sellers and is intended to replace other duties as described in state law or common law. Unfortunately, the statute is not a model of clarity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subpart (2) lists the obligations of a seller agent to the seller. Subpart (3) lists the obligations of a seller agent to the buyer. Subpart (4), the primary area of concern for the certified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>question, lists the obligations of a buyer agent to the buyer. Subpart (5) lists the obligations of a buyer agent to the seller. Subpart (6) lists the obligations of a statutory broker to a buyer or seller. Subpart (7) lists the obligations of a dual agent. Finally, the rest of \u00a7 37-51-313, MCA, deals with the length of the broker relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b615 Section 37-51-313(4), MCA, does not specifically say that a buyer agent may or may not represent multiple buyers-that is, there is no language in the statute which expressly prohibits a buyer agent from representing multiple buyers competing for the same property, or vice-a-versa. However, Zuazua argues that the language in \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(a), MCA, requiring a buyer agent to \u201cact solely in the best interests of the buyer\u201d is a clear statutory mandate that the buyer agent cannot represent more than one buyer competing for the same parcel of property at the same time. Zuazua\u2019s argument centers around the word \u201csolely\u201d which he takes to mean, essentially, \u201conly,\u201d and the definition of \u201cbuyer\u201d in \u00a7 37-51-102(5), MCA: \u201ca person who is interested in acquiring an ownership interest in real property ....\u201d Taken together, from Zuazua\u2019s perspective, \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(a), MCA, thus requires a buyer agent to act only for one person who is interested in acquiring property or, in other words, only one buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u00b616 Coldwell Banker, on the other hand, contends that \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(a), MCA, obligates the buyer agent to \u201cact solely in the best interests\u201d of the \u201cclass\u201d of buyers, not specifically \u201ca\u201d buyer. Similarly, \u00a7 37-51-313(2)(a), MCA, according to Coldwell Banker, defines the obligations of the seller agent toward the \u201cclass\u201d of sellers, and \u00a7 37-51-313(7), MCA, defines the dual agent, who represents both the \u201cclass\u201d of buyers and the \u201cclass\u201d of sellers.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\u00b617 Assuming that Coldwell Banker is correct in its assumption that \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(a), MCA, defines the buyer agent\u2019s duties toward the \u201cclass\u201d of buyers, we nevertheless agree with Zuazua that subpart 313(4)(a) acts to limit the buyer agent to only representing one buyer concerning a particular piece of property at a particular time. More precisely, we find that the obligation imposed by \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(a), MCA, to \u201cact solely in the <em>best interests </em>of the buyer\u201d is breached when a buyer agent simultaneously represents more than one buyer competing for the same property because the buyer agent is unable to act in the \u201cbest interests\u201d of competing buyers due to inherent conflicts of interest (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\u00b618  A conflict of interest is created when the buyer agent simultaneously represents multiple-buyers for the same property in at least two ways. First, if the buyer agent is prevented from revealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>confidential information (as Coldwell Banker claims is the case under \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(c)), then the buyer agent is prevented from revealing the most important piece of information she has to her buyers, i.e., the other buyer\u2019s competing bid. For example, assume a buyer agent represents buyer A and buyer B who, at the same time, wish to purchase property C. Buyer A submits a bid first, through the buyer agent, for $100,000. B then asks the buyer agent for advice concerning what B should bid for property C. Assuming no contingencies, B will only \u201cwin out\u201d over A\u2019s bid if B bids more than $100,000. The buyer agent, however, is constrained from revealing the most vital piece of information that B needs to obtain the property, how much A has already bid, because A\u2019s bid price and terms are confidential. Even worse, the buyer agent, unlike a dual agent, is under no obligation to disclose the conflict of interest. <em>See </em>\u00a7 37-51-313(7)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b619 Second, using the same scenario presented above but assuming the buyer agent is allowed to inform buyer B of A\u2019s bid, then the buyer agent is in a position to drive up the price by pitting B against A, with the result that the buyer agent receives a higher commission. Again, the buyer agent, unlike the dual agent, would not be obligated to disclose the conflict to either A or B.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b620 Amicus curiae Montana Association of Realtors\u00ae, Inc. (MAR), however, contends that there is no inherent conflict. MAR, noting that a dual agent is required to \u201cact solely in the best interests\u201d of both buyer <em>and </em>seller, translates \u201csolely in the best interests of the buyer\u201d to mean that a buyer agent \u201cmay not act adversely to his or her principal\u2019s interests.\u201d MAR then cites to numerous out-of-state cases which it claims show that agents may represent competing principals without adversely effecting the principal\u2019s interests. Although the underlying cases all discuss multiple sellers, not buyers, MAR claims that the reasoning is even more persuasive in the multiple buyer context because a buyer agent\u2019s role is merely to find properties that fit a buyer\u2019s wishes and to relay the buyer\u2019s offer to the seller, with \u2018little to no control over the end result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b621 Setting aside the fact that MAR\u2019s out-of-state authorities are distinguishable because they address multiple sellers rather than buyers, we disagree that acting \u201csolely in the best interests of the buyer\u201d is equivalent to not acting adversely to the principal\u2019s interest. To \u201cnot act adversely\u201d is a passive obligation requiring that a buyer agent not do anything to harm the buyer. To \u201cact solely in the best interests,\u201d however, is an active obligation requiring affirmative steps on the part of the buyer agent to achieve the goals of the buyer. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>question is not, therefore, whether a buyer agent\u2019s facilitative role allows the buyer agent to represent competing buyers without acting \u201cadversely\u201d to either buyer\u2019s interest (although our conflict of interest examples above indicate that it would). Rather, the proper question is whether a buyer agent representing competing buyers can, in an affirmative sense, act \u201csolely in the best interests\u201d of each of the buyers individually. As noted above, we conclude that, due to inherent conflicts of interest, a buyer agent cannot act solely in the best interests of competing buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u00b622 B. <em>Does the wording of\u00a7 37-51-313(4)(c), MCA, demonstrate clear legislative intent to allow a buyer agent to represent competing buyers?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AUh\">\u00b623 Coldwell Banker also argues that the language of \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(c), MCA, acknowledges that a buyer agent may represent competing buyers. Section 37-51-313(4)(c), MCA, obligates a buyer agent to \u201cdisclose all relevant and material information that concerns the real estate transaction and that is known to the buyer agent and not known or discoverable by the buyer, unless the information is subject to confidentiality arising from a prior or <em>existing agency relationship on the part of the buyer agent\u201d </em>(emphasis added). According to Coldwell Banker, the buyer agent could only have received the confidential information referred to in \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(c), MCA, from another buyer because a \u201cbuyer agent,\u201d by definition, represents only the buyer-side of a transaction, and thus the legislature clearly contemplated a buyer agent representing competing buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b624 We conclude, however, that the \u201cexisting agency relationship\u201d referred to in \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(c), MCA, refers to dual agency as described at \u00a7 37-51-313(7), MCA, because the obligations of a dual agent do not conflict with the obligation of a buyer agent under \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(a), MCA, to \u201cact solely in the best interests of the buyer.\u201d \u00b625 We have long recognized that \u201c[i]t is our duty to interpret individual sections of an act in such a manner as to ensure coordination with the other sections of the act.\u201d <em>Howell v. State, </em>263 Mont. 275, 286, 868 P.2d 568, 575 (1994) (citations omitted). Section 37-51-313(4)(c), MCA, first requires full disclosure of all relevant and material information to the buyer. Subpart 4(c) then uses the subordinating conjunction \u201cunless\u201d to signify an exception. The exception protects, from the full disclosure required in the first segment of subpart 4(c), confidential information obtained by the buyer agent arising from another agency relationship. At first glance, the exception seems to necessarily reference another buyer, because it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>another agency relationship of the buyer agent, especially if \u201cbuyer agent\u201d is limited by definition, as Coldwell Banker claims, to representing only the buyer-side. However, a \u201cbuyer agent\u201d is defined as \u201ca broker or salesperson who, pursuant to a written buyer broker agreement, is acting as the agent of the buyer.\u201d Section 37-51-102(6), MCA. Nothing in this definition limits the buyer agent to \u201conly\u201d representing the buyer-side of a transaction. In fact, \u201cdual agent\u201d is defined as \u201ca broker or salesperson who, pursuant to a written listing agreement or <em>buyer broker agreement </em>... acts as the agent of both the <em>buyer </em>and seller ....\u201d Section 37-51-102(10), MCA. A dual agent, therefore, acts as a buyer agent and a seller agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b626 A dual agent, under \u00a7 37-51-313(7), MCA, is \u201cobligated to a buyer in the same manner as a buyer agent under this section,\u201d subject to certain exceptions, listed in the section. Section 37-51-313, MCA, including subpart 4(c), thus speaks to <em>both </em>buyer agents (acting only as buyer agents) <em>and </em>dual agents. Further, the exceptions listed in \u00a7 37-51-313(7), MCA, specifically deal with disclosure of confidential information, requiring a dual agent to obtain consent before disclosing, for example, \u201cthe fact that the buyer is willing to pay more than the offered purchase price.\u201d Section 37-51-313(7)(b)(i), MCA. This fits succinctly into subpart 313(4)(c) where a dual agent, in his or her capacity as buyer agent, is required to disclose all material information, except for confidential information obtained from the dual agent\u2019s other existing agency relationship, the seller. Finally, reading subpart 313(4)(c) as referring to a dual agent and not to a buyer agent representing competing buyers provides more protection for the buyer, because subpart 313(7), unlike subpart 313(4), succinctly outlines for the dual agent the requirements of confidentiality, disclosure and consent in regards to representing competing principals.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u00b627 Accordingly, we conclude that the language \u201cexisting agency relationship\u201d in \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(c), MCA, references a dual agent\u2019s relationship with a seller. This interpretation coordinates \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(c), MCA, with \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(a), MCA, and Chapter 51 as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b628 The dissent sees inconsistencies in the Court\u2019s interpretation. Any such inconsistencies, however, are rooted in the statutory scheme and are not of our making. For example, while \u00a7 37-51-313(4), MCA, clearly speaks to buyer agents, it also speaks to dual agents, because a dual agent \u201cis obligated to a buyer in the same manner as a buyer agent under this section ....\u201d Further, the inconsistencies the dissent finds between the obligations of a buyer agent under subpart 313(4)(c) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the obligations of a dual agent under subpart 313(7) are the result of internal inconsistencies within subpart 313(7), as explained <em>supra, </em>at footnote 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b629 Finally, in response to the dissent\u2019s claim that the reference to \u201cprior\u201d agency relationships in \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(c), MCA, prevents subpart 313(4)(c) from applying to dual agents, we note that \u00a7 37-51-313, MCA, addresses real estate agents who often wear many hats. An agent may one week represent a seller, the next a buyer, and the week after represent a different buyer and seller as a dual agent. Thus, it is no surprise that \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(c), MCA, addresses confidentiality with respect to \u201cprior\u201d relationships as well as \u201cexisting\u201d relationships. Moreover, the opinion focuses on the reference to \u201cexisting\u201d relationships because the certified question, our opinion in general, and our analysis of subpart 313(4)(c) is not concerned with \u201cprior\u201d agency relationships, but with whether a buyer agent may simultaneously represent competing buyers-in other words, with a buyer agent\u2019s \u201cexisting\u201d relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b630  In the face of statutory inconsistencies, we have chosen an interpretation which honors the overriding policy stated in \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(a), MCA, that a buyer agent must \u201cact solely in the best interests of the buyer,\u201d something the interpretation arrived at by the dissent would not accomplish. The dissent does not address whether \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(a), MCA, precludes a buyer agent from representing competing buyers. Instead, the dissent argues that \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(c), MCA, \u201cdemonstrates that the Legislature anticipated a buyer agent may represent more than one buyer,\u201d and therefore subpart 313(4)(c) acts to qualify the buyer agent\u2019s obligation to \u201cact solely in the best interests of the buyer.\u201d However, such a broad exception would not simply qualify the buyer agent\u2019s duty to \u201cact solely in the best interests of the buyer,\u201d but swallow the rule entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\u00b631  We hold that a buyer agent breaches his obligation to a buyer under \u00a7 37-51-313(4), MCA, when a buyer agent simultaneously represents more than one buyer competing for the same property.</p>\n<judges id=\"b212-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-16\"> Judge Molloy, in his order, recognizes that this Court, as the receiving court, may reformulate the certified question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b207-12\"> For example, while subpart 313(7)(a), which the dissent highlights, requires that a dual agent disclose any adverse material facts regardless of any confidentiality considerations, subpart 313(7)(b) lists confidential information that the dual agency may not disclose without written consent.

Coldwell Banker argues that this provision demonstrates that the Legislature anticipated a buyer agent may represent more than one buyer. The Court rejects this argument, concluding that the reference to other relationships \u201cof the buyer agent\u201d refers to only those situations in which a buyer agent is acting as a dual agent, that is, simultaneously representing both a buyer and a seller. For the following reasons, I believe the Court\u2019s conclusion is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b634 First, the Court\u2019s interpretation requires the conclusion that the Legislature listed within the buyer agent subsection duties which apply only to dual agents, even though the Legislature specified the duties for dual agents in its own subsection. Section 37-51-313(7), MCA. In interpreting a statute, we are to consider \u201cthe statute\u2019s text, language, structure, and object[,]\u201d <em>S.L.H. v. State Compensation Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>2000 MT 362, \u00b6 16, 303 Mont. 364, \u00b6 16, 15 P.3d 948, \u00b6 16, but the Court here discards the clear structure of the statute. Although a dual agent takes on the obligations of a buyer agent to a buyer and of a seller agent to a seller pursuant to \u00a7 37-51-313(7), MCA, the Court eliminates the stand-alone confidentiality obligation of a buyer agent who is not a dual agent, even though this obligation is set forth within the buyer agent subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b635 In its statement that \u201cthe \u2018existing agency relationship\u2019 referred to in \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(c), MCA, refers to dual agency as described in \u00a7 37-51-313(7), MCA,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00b6 24, the Court splices a critical phrase from its analysis. The statute actually reads that confidential information need not be disclosed to the buyer \u201carising from <em>a vrior or </em>existing agency relationship on the part of the buyer agent.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, a buyer agent may not disclose information to his or her buyer arising from <em>either </em>a prior <em>or </em>an existing agency relationship. Though the Court posits that the term \u201cexisting relationship\u201d is comparable to dual agency, the Legislature\u2019s use of the \u201cprior relationship\u201d concept demonstrates the statute is referring to something different. A dual agent \u201cacts as the agent of both the buyer and seller with written authorization.\u201d Section 37-51-102(10), MCA. A dual agent thus represents a buyer and seller simultaneously. Such simultaneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>representation is incompatible with the concept of a buyer agent\u2019s \u201cprior\u201d relationships and demonstrates that \u00a7 39-51-313(4)(c), MCA, cannot be referring exclusively to dual agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b636 More broadly, the reference in \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(c), MCA, to \u201cbuyer agent\u201d cannot mean \u201cdual agent\u201d because a buyer agent cannot act as a dual agent. At the moment an agent, through a disclosure process based upon \u201cwritten authorization,\u201d becomes a dual agent, the agent is representing both a buyer and seller and no longer acting as a buyer agent. <em>See </em>\u00a7 37-51-102(10), MCA. This is further evident in a comparison of statutory duties. The duties owed to a buyer by a buyer agent are inconsistent with the duties owed to a buyer by a dual agent. Under \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(c), MCA, a buyer agent is prohibited from disclosing to the buyer \u201cinformation subject to confidentiality arising from a prior or existing agency relationship on the part of the buyer agent.\u201d In contrast, a dual agent \u201chas a duty to disclose to a buyer or seller any adverse material facts that are known to the dual agent, <em>regardless of any confidentiality considerations.\u201d </em>Section 37-51-313(7)(a), MCA (emphasis added). The only exceptions to this duty are for those matters, listed in \u00a7 37-51-313(7)(b), MCA, which first require that the dual agent obtain written consent before disclosing them. Obviously, it is impossible to keep information from a prior relationship confidential while at the same time disclosing information \u201cregardless of confidentiality considerations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b637 Moreover, the Court\u2019s errors appear to inevitably lead to a collision with the interpretation of the administering agency. As pointed out by Amicus Montana Association of Realtors\u00ae, Inc., the Board of Realty Regulation has adopted regulations which acknowledge that a buyer agent may represent more than one buyer within the same transaction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">Licensees acting as listing agents shall not disclose the name of a person making an offer or the amount or terms of an offer to other persons interested in making offers except that this shall not prohibit the listing agent from disclosing that an offer has been made. <em>If a buyer broker has principals making offers on the same property, the buyer broker cannot tell a buyer the terms and provisions of the competing buyer\u2019s offer.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">M. Admin. R. 24.210.641(p) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">\u00b638 Finally, in \u00b6 26, the Court states that \u00a7 37-51-313(4)(c), MCA, \u201cspeaks to <em>both </em>buyer agents (acting only as buyer agents) <em>and </em>dual agents.\u201d (Emphasis in the Court\u2019s opinion.) Here, the Court reverses itself. If, in any way, this provision speaks to buyer agents acting only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>as buyer agents-which is precisely Coldwell Banker\u2019s argument and the position of this dissent-then Defendant Stone, acting as a buyer agent and not a dual agent, could properly represent more than one buyer, and she was merely prohibited from disclosing confidential information in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b639 I would answer the question posed by the Federal Court as follows: \u201cNo, \u00a7 37-51-313(4), MCA, does not prohibit a buyer agent from simultaneously representing more than one buyer competing for the same property.\u201d Thus, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b215-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY and JUSTICE COTTER concur in the dissent of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
