R. App. P. 44:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">Under Montana\u2019s liberal construction of exemptions, is a debtor allowed to trace proceeds from the sale of the debtor\u2019s home when the debtor had not filed a homestead declaration prior to selling the home?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">We accepted the certified question by order filed on March 22, 2006. For the reasons set forth below, we answer the question \u201cyes, if the homestead is otherwise eligible for exemption pursuant to \u00a7 70-32-216, MCA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">\u00b62 Mary A. Snyder filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on October 12, 2005. She claims a right to exempt $22,000 in proceeds traceable to the sale of a Bozeman, Montana, home from the bankruptcy estate, under Montana\u2019s statutory homestead exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">\u00b63 Snyder had sold the home for which she claimed the homestead exemption in February of 2005, some six months before she filed her bankruptcy petition. In the declaration of homestead she filed on September 29,2005, she stated she resided at the home but she listed her address as one other than that for which she claimed the homestead exemption. For purposes of our consideration of the certified question, Snyder has stipulated that, at the time she filed her declaration of homestead, she \u201cresided at\u201d a different address than the address for which she was filing the homestead declaration. The bankruptcy trustee claims the homestead exemption is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">\u00b64 The bankruptcy court determined no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision or Montana statute answers the question of whether Snyder may claim the homestead exemption. For that reason, the bankruptcy court certified the question of law to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">\u00b65 Under Montana\u2019s liberal construction of exemptions, is a debtor allowed to trace proceeds from the sale of the debtor\u2019s home when the debtor had not filed a homestead declaration prior to selling the home?</p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u00b66 The filing of a bankruptcy petition under Title 11 of the United States Code creates an estate consisting of \u201call legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1). In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, property deemed an asset of the bankruptcy estate may be administered by the bankruptcy trustee for the benefit of the creditors unless the debtor is entitled to remove the property from the bankruptcy estate through the exemption process. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 323, 522, 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b67 Property which may be exempted from the bankruptcy estate is set forth at 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522. Montana has exercised its option under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(3)(A) to opt out of the federal exemption plan, however, and grant bankruptcy exemptions based on state law. Exemptions allowed under Montana law include the Montana homestead exemption set forth in Chapter 32 of Title 70, MCA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 31-2-106(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b68 Montana law has long allowed a homestead exemption for \u201cthe dwelling house or mobile home, and all appurtenances, in which the claimant resides, and the land, if any, on which the same is situated, selected as provided in this chapter.\u201d Sections 70-32-101 and -201, MCA. The maximum amount allowed as a homestead exemption has been raised several times over the years; since 2001, the maximum is $100,000. Section 70-32-104, MCA. To obtain the benefit of the homestead exemption, the homeowner must file a declaration of homestead with the county clerk and recorder\u2019s office. The declaration must contain a description of the premises and a statement that the declarant resides there and claims it as a homestead. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 70-32-105, -106 and -107, MCA. Under the homestead exemption, up to $100,000 in proceeds of the sale of a homestead are protected for 18 months after a judgment execution sale. <em>See </em>\u00a7 70-32-213, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u00b69 In 1987, the Montana Legislature enacted general revisions to laws relating to property exempt from execution. 1987 Mont. Laws 595. Section 6 of those revisions, which is codified as \u00a7 70-32-216, MCA, provides for protection of proceeds traceable to property. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">Tracing homestead proceeds. (1) If property or a part of property that could have been claimed as an exempt homestead has been sold or taken by condemnation, as provided in Title 60, chapter 4, or Title 70, chapter 30, or has been lost, damaged, or destroyed and the owner has been indemnified for the property, the owner is entitled for 18 months to exemption of the proceeds that are traceable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>(2) Proceeds are traceable under this section by application of the principles of first-in first-out, last-in first-out, or any other reasonable basis for tracing selected by the judgment debtor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMt\">Section 70-32-216, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b610 This provision changes Montana\u2019s traditional homestead exemption in two significant ways. First, it expands the kinds of proceeds which maybe protected by the exemption. While \u00a7 70-32-213, MCA, only protects proceeds from a judgment execution, \u00a7 70-32-216, MCA, also protects proceeds from properties which have been <em>\u201csold </em>or taken by condemnation ... or had been lost, damaged or destroyed[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) Second, it provides protection for traceable proceeds from such properties if the properties <em>\u201ccould have been claimed </em>as an exempt homestead\u201d (emphasis added) at the time of disposal. This statutory change created the right to claim a homestead exemption, in the delineated circumstances, after the property has been disposed of, and after the person claiming a homestead exemption has vacated the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b611 In arguing against allowing Snyder\u2019s claimed homestead exemption, the bankruptcy trustee relies upon another statutory provision which the 1987 Montana Legislature did not amend when it enacted \u00a7 70-32-216, MCA. Section 70-32-106, MCA, requires that \u201c[t]he declaration of homestead must contain a statement that the person making it is residing on the premises[.]\u201d That requirement does not appear to allow for a declaration of homestead as to premises where the declarant no longer resides.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u00b612 In this respect, while \u00a7\u00a7 70-32-106 and -216, MCA, do not expressly conflict, they are inconsistent. We must resolve that inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\u00b613  As Snyder points out, the Montana Constitution directs the Montana Legislature to enact liberal homestead and exemption laws. <em>See </em>Mont Const. art. XIII, \u00a7 5. As she farther points out, exemption laws should be liberally construed in the debtor\u2019s favor. <em>See, e.g., In re Zimmermann, </em>2002 MT 90, \u00b6 15, 309 Mont. 337, \u00b6 15, 46 P.3d 599, \u00b6 15 (citation omitted). Moreover, when interpreting several provisions, we must adopt a construction, if possible, which gives effect to all. Section 1-2-101, MCA. Applying these rules of statutory construction, we conclude that while the statement required in a declaration of homestead pursuant to \u00a7 70-32-106, MCA, does not reflect the possibility that a person may no longer reside on a premises which nevertheless maybe claimed as a homestead pursuant to \u00a7 70-32-216, MCA, that in itself does not invalidate a homestead declaration filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>under \u00a7 70-32-216, MCA. We invite the Legislature\u2019s attention to this inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b614  The answer to the certified question is \u201cyes, if the homestead is otherwise eligible for exemption pursuant to \u00a7 70-32-216, MCA.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"A6\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
