Less than five years later, after he turned 21 and after the remainder of his sentence had been suspended, Mainwaring committed felony assault on a minor. Following the filing of assault charges in the Yellowstone County District Court, the State filed notice of its intent to designate Mainwaring as a \u201cpersistent felony offender\u201d (PFO). Mainwaring moved to strike this notice but the Yellowstone County District Court denied his motion. The District Court subsequently sentenced Mainwaring as a PFO. Mainwaring appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issue is whether the Yellowstone County District Court erred in sentencing Mainwaring as a persistent felony offender predicated upon his 1999 felony conviction under \u00a7 41-5-206, MCA, of the Youth Court Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">\u00b63 Mainwaring was initially charged in 1999 with deliberate homicide and aggravated assault. Shortly after the Information was filed in the Valley County District Court, the court held a hearing under \u00a7 41-5-206, MCA, to determine whether Mainwaring\u2019s case should remain in district court or be returned to youth court. The court determined the case would remain in district court and that Mainwaring would be tried as an adult. Counsel was appointed to represent Mainwaring and he entered a not guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">\u00b64 As part of a subsequent plea agreement, a copy of which is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>available in the record of the current case, the State amended the Information to add the charge of mitigated deliberate homicide.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mainwaring entered a guilty plea to this charge. The Valley County court accepted the plea, ordered a pre-sentence investigation and set a sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b65 After approximately ten hours of evidence and argument was presented at the sentencing hearing, the Valley County District Court informed Mainwaring that it would not follow the sentencing recommendation set forth in the plea agreement. As a result of this decision, the court offered Mainwaring the opportunity to withdraw his plea. After consulting with counsel, Mainwaring declined to withdraw his plea. The Valley County court then proceeded to sentence Mainwaring under \u00a7 41-5-2503(1)(a), MCA, of the Criminally Convicted Youth Act (CCYA), which expressly provides that the district court \u201cshall impose any sentence allowed by the statute that established the penalty for the offense of which the youth is convicted as if the youth were an adult and any conditions or restrictions allowed by statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b66 In 2002, upon Mainwaring\u2019s motion and as provided for in \u00a7 41-5-2510, MCA, the Valley County District Court reviewed and then suspended the remainder of Mainwaring\u2019s original sentence upon a finding that Mainwaring had been \u201csubstantially rehabilitated.\u201d The court replaced the original sentence with various terms, conditions and restrictions. Approximately eighteen months later in October 2003, and just after turning 21 years old, Mainwaring violated the conditions of his suspended sentence by assaulting a young child. The Valley County District Court revoked his suspended sentence, and the State brought a felony \u201cassault on a minor\u201d charge against Mainwaring in the Yellowstone County District Court. The State also filed a timely notice to seek PFO designation for Mainwaring predicated upon his 1999 felony conviction. Mainwaring sought to strike the PFO designation but the Yellowstone County court denied his motion. The court thereafter designated him a PFO and sentenced him to 20 years at Montana State Prison (MSP), to run concurrently with his reimposed Valley County District Court sentence. Mainwaring filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b67  We review criminal sentences for legality. When reviewing sentences for \u201clegality,\u201d one thing we determine is whether the sentencing court had statutory authority to impose the sentence; in other words, whether the sentence falls within the parameters set by the applicable sentencing statutes. We review such questions of law de novo. <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u00b68 The primary question before this Court is whether a district court can properly designate an adult offender a PFO based upon a prior felony conviction that was obtained under \u00a7 41-5-206, MCA, (hereinafter referred to as \u201c206 transfer\u201d statute) of the Youth Court Act. Mainwaring contends, on constitutional grounds, that it cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"ADa\">\u00b69 The following statutes <em>axe </em>relevant to our analysis: Persistent Felony Offenders, \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-501, et seq., Youth Court Act, \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-101, et seq., and Criminally Convicted Youth Act, \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-2501, et seq. We start by setting forth the pertinent provisions of these statutes, beginning with the definition of a PFO.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\"><em>Section 46-18-501, </em>MCA (2003)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">A \u201cpersistent felony offender\u201d is an offender who has previously been convicted of a felony and who is presently being sentenced for a second felony committed on a different occasion than the first.

Mainwaring misstates the nature of his conviction. While Mainwaring was, by definition, a \u201ccriminally convicted youth,\u201d he was <em>not </em>convicted under the CCYA.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">\u00b613 As indicated above, in 1999, Mainwaring entered a guilty plea in Valley County District Court as an adult. He was, therefore, <em>convicted </em>in district court, under the \u201c206 transfer\u201d statute, of mitigated deliberate homicide which is a violation of \u00a7 45-5-103, MCA. He was subsequently <em>sentenced </em>\u201cas if [he] were an adult\u201d in accordance with \u00a7 41-5-2503(1)(a), MCA, of the CCYA. See also <em>State v. Whiteman, </em>2005 MT 15, 325 Mont. 358, 106 P.3d 543, affirming the propriety of prosecuting and sentencing certain youthful offenders in district court as adults. With the exception of the prohibition against confining a youth under age 16 in a state prison facility, a conviction in district court under \u00a7 41-5-206(6), MCA, is equivalent to any other adult felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>prosecution or conviction. By contrast, the CCYA is not an act under which a youth is convicted; rather, it is a procedural mechanism comprised primarily of a sentencing provision applicable to youths convicted in the adult system, \u00a7 41-5-2503, MCA, and a sentence review provision available to them until they turn 21, \u00a7 41-5-2510, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b614 We now turn to Mainwaring\u2019s argument that the Yellowstone County District Court erred in designating him a PFO, thus entitling him to be re-sentenced. He first claims that the Legislature did not intend the PFO statute to apply to a criminally convicted youth because the PFO statute, the CCYA statutes, and the \u201c206 transfer\u201d statute do not reference each other. While this is true, we are not persuaded that this precludes application of the PFO statutes to cases such as this. There is no language in the Youth Court Act or the CCYA that expressly precludes application of the PFO statutes to youthful offenders. Additionally, the PFO statutes do not contain language precluding their application to criminally convicted youths. In fact, the PFO statutes do not distinguish between felony convictions obtained against youths and adults in district court. Again, as stated above, with a few exceptions, a youth who is tried, convicted and sentenced under the \u201c206 transfer\u201d provision is treated as an adult offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b615 As we have previously articulated, when interpreting a statute, we must follow the rule set forth in \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA \u2014 we must simply ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted. <em>Montana Power Co. v. Public Service Com'n, </em>2001 MT 102, \u00b6 26, 305 Mont. 260, \u00b6 26, 26 P.3d 91, \u00b6 26 (citation omitted). There is simply no language in any of these statutes that would preclude their application to cases falling under the other statutory schemes. Section 46-18-501, MCA, clearly defines \u201cpersistent felony offender.\u201d In <em>State v. Damon, </em>2005 MT 218, \u00b6 37, 328 Mont. 276, \u00b6 37, 119 P.3d 1194, \u00b6 37 (citations omitted), we held that \u201c[a] district court possesses the authority to designate and sentence a persistent felony offender pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-502, MCA, when the underlying charge meets the definition of a felony and the State has provided proper notice of its intent to seek persistent felony offender status under \u00a7 46-13-108, MCA.\u201d Despite Mainwaring\u2019s protestations and policy arguments to the contrary, his case falls squarely within this framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\u00b616 While it is a fundamental violation of due process to predicate a criminal sentence on materially false information (See <em>Bauer v. State, </em>1999 MT 185, \u00b6 27, 295 Mont. 306, \u00b6 27, 983 P.2d 955, \u00b6 27), Mainwaring acknowledges that the information regarding his 1999 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>conviction was <em>not </em>false. Due process requires that an offender be given an opportunity to explain, argue, and rebut any information, including pre-sentencing information that may lead to a deprivation of life, liberty, or property. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 22 (citation omitted). Mainwaring was represented by counsel throughout his 1999 proceeding, and a Butler<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> hearing was held providing Mainwaring a full opportunity to present evidence and arguments concerning the appropriate forum for the prosecution of his case. <em>State v. McKee, </em>2006 MT 5, \u00b6 21, 330 Mont. 249, \u00b6 21, 127 P.3d 445, \u00b6 21. There is no evidence or allegation to the contrary. Nor is there any claim that either the Valley County District Court or the Yellowstone County District Court relied on materially false information in sentencing Mainwaring for either felony; thus there is no due process violation requiring re-sentencing. Moreover, Mainwaring received the statutorily-required notice when the State filed timely notice, as required by \u00a7 46-13-108, MCA, of its intent to designate Mainwaring a PFO.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b617 The remainder of Mainwaring\u2019s \u201cdue process\u201d argument appears to be that he did not as a minor have adequate \u201cnotice\u201d that he could one day be subject to PFO designation, and therefore he did not have the opportunity to conform his conduct in accordance with such notice. In this connection, Mainwaring also argues that the CCYA and the PFO statutes, taken together, are void for vagueness as applied to him and in general. This assertion rests on the argument that these statutes, particularly the definition of \u201cfelony offender,\u201d do not explicitly advise a criminally convicted youth that his or her conviction obtained before becoming an adult can qualify him or her for a PFO designation in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b618  The test for \u201cvagueness\u201d of a criminal law is whether a person is required to speculate as to whether his contemplated course of action may be subject to criminal penalties. <em>State v. Brogan, </em>272 Mont. 156, 168, 900 P.2d 284, 291 (1995). We do not agree with Mainwaring\u2019s argument that the statutory schemes contain \u201chighly technical, legal language which is obscure to the ordinary adult,\u201d and youth in our society. As discussed above, the relevant statutes adequately indicate what conduct is proscribed and what penalty may be imposed. The statutes are written using common terms and everyday language, and therefore it is presumed that a reasonable person of average intelligence can comprehend them. <em>State v. Martel, </em>273 Mont. 143, 150, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>902 P.2d 14, 18-19 (1995). Moreover, Mainwaring was represented by counsel throughout his 1999 proceeding. The Judgment expressly stated that the Valley County court would retain jurisdiction over Mainwaring\u2019s case until he reached the age of 21, and that Mainwaring would be under the supervision of the Adult Probation and Parole Bureau for the duration of his sentence, i.e., until he was approximately 47 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b619  Mainwaring was 21 years old at the time he assaulted a 20-month old child. The PFO statute clearly and unequivocally establishes the grounds under which the State may seek PFO status. We conclude the challenged statutes are not void for vagueness, nor do they provide deficient notice of the situations to which the PFO designation could apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u00b620 Finally, Mainwaring argues for the first time on appeal that his equal protection rights were violated. We have previously held that \u201c[a] constitutional issue is waived if not presented at the earliest opportunity.\u201d <em>In re Custody of Arneson-Nelson, </em>2001 MT 242, \u00b6 37, 307 Mont. 60, \u00b6 37, 36 P.3d 874, \u00b6 37 (citing <em>Billings Deaconess Hosp. v. Angel, </em>219 Mont. 490, 495, 712 P.2d 1323, 1327 (1986)(superseded by statute as stated in <em>Haider v. Frances Mahon Deaconess Hosp., </em>2000 MT 32, 298 Mont. 203, 994 P.2d 1121); <em>Dodd v. City of East Helena, </em>180 Mont. 518, 523, 591 P.2d 241, 244 (1979)). Mainwaring did not previously object at the hearing or in any post-hearing motions that his sentence violated the Equal Protection Clause. We conclude that he did not raise this claim at the earliest opportunity and therefore waived it. We decline to invoke the doctrine of plain error to review this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\u00b621 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b354-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-6\"> A subsequent order issued by the Valley County District Court, and made a part of the record in the case before us, summarizes in detail Mainwaring\u2019s 1999 proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\"> <em>State v.
