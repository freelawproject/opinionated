The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"AB7\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that she understood this and stated that she wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"Azm\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are sufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is clearly excessive in light of sentences given toward similar crimes around the state and that the State recommended to run the charges concurrent in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"AXU\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be amended as follows: Charge I: Ten (10) years in the Montana Women\u2019s Prison, with no time suspended and no parole restriction; Charge II: Ten (10) years in the Montana Women\u2019s Prison, with no time suspended, to run concurrently with Charge I; and Charge III: A commitment to the Ravalli County Detention Facility for a term of six (6) months, with no time suspended, to run concurrently with Charges I and II. The restitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>requirements and conditions shall remain the same as imposed in the October 27, 2005 judgment.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"An_g\">DATED this 14th day of April, 2006.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"AAE\">Done in open Court this 7th day of April, 2006.</p>\n<judges id=\"AC2\">Chairperson, Hon.
