Defendant American Economy Insurance Company (American Economy) moved for partial summary judgment based in part on its argument that the definition of the term \u201cdirect loss\u201d in the insurance contract at issue precluded Frontline from recovering many of the damages that it claims are covered and payable under the policy. The District Court denied summary judgment in July 2005, on the basis that there was no clear Montana precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">\u00b62 By order dated September 27, 2005, and pursuant to M. R. App. P. 44, the United States District Court for the District of Montana, Great Falls Division, certified the following question to this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvK\">Does the term \u201cdirect loss\u201d when used in the context of employee dishonesty coverage afforded under a businessowner\u2019s liability policy, include consequential damages that were proximately caused by the alleged dishonesty, or is the construction of the term \u201cdirect loss\u201d limited to those damages that directly result from the alleged employee dishonesty?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">\u00b63 We accepted the question in our order dated October 12, 2005, and for the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the term \u201cdirect loss\u201d when used in the context of employee dishonesty coverage afforded under a business owner\u2019s liability policy, means all losses proximately caused by an employee\u2019s dishonesty.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">\u00b64 In accordance with M. R. App. P. 44, the United States District Court certified the facts set forth below in paragraphs 5-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">\u00b65 Frontline is a credit card processing company based in Bozeman, Montana. Chris Kittler is the owner and president of Frontline.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">\u00b66 Ron Reavis was employed as Frontline\u2019s Chief Financial Officer until February 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u00b67 Frontline purchased a special Businessowner\u2019s Policy (Policy) from American Economy in August 1999. At that time, Frontline also purchased $250,000.00 in optional coverage for employee dishonesty.</p>\n<p id=\"Aak\">\u00b68 During his employment at Frontline, Reavis was allegedly responsible for filing Frontline\u2019s payroll taxes, corporate income taxes, and Kittler\u2019s personal income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b69 Frontline claims that while employed at Frontline, Reavis engaged in dishonest acts such as forging Kittler\u2019s signature on Frontline checks, using the company credit card for his own purposes, and deliberately failing to file Frontline\u2019s payroll taxes and corporate income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b610 As a result of the alleged dishonest acts of Reavis, Frontline retained Heartland Business Intelligence (Heartland) to conduct a forensic examination of Reavis\u2019s computer activities to determine the degree and extent of Reavis\u2019s alleged theft. Frontline claims Heartland\u2019s fees in the amount of $24,050.20 are covered under the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u00b611 Frontline similarly retained Karen S. Runyon (Runyon) to perform a forensic handwriting analysis of certain Frontline checks to determine which ones, if any, Reavis forged. Frontline claims that the $3,812.50 fee for Runyon\u2019s analysis is also covered under the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"A48\">\u00b612 Frontline also retained Galusha, Higgins &amp; Galusha (Galusha) to investigate, evaluate, and rectify the financial situation that Reavis allegedly had caused. It claims that Galusha\u2019s fees in the amount of $57,654.81 are covered by the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\u00b613 Frontline also seeks coverage costs, interest, penalties, and fees assessed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as a result of Reavis\u2019s alleged deliberate failure to pay Frontline\u2019s and Kittler\u2019s taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\u00b614 The \u201cemployee dishonesty\u201d coverage afforded by the Policy provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-9\">A. Employee Dishonesty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">i. We [American Economy] will pay for direct loss of or damage to Business Personal Property and \u201cmoney\u201d and \u201csecurities\u201d resulting from dishonest acts committed by any of your employees acting alone or in collusion with other persons (except you or your partner) with the manifest intent to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-11\">1. Cause you to sustain loss or damages; and also</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-12\">2. Obtain financial benefit (other than salaries, commissions, fees, bonuses, promotions, awards, profit sharing, pensions or other employee benefits earned in the normal course of employment) for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>a. Any employee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-3\">b. Any other person or organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">(Emphasis added by the U. S. District Court.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b615 American Economy maintains that the costs, fees, interest and penalties assessed by the IRS, as well as the fees paid to Heartland, Runyon, and Galusha, are not \u201cdirect losses\u201d within the meaning of the phrase, and are therefore not covered losses under the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u00b616 Frontline maintains that the Policy does afford coverage for costs, fees, interest and penalties assessed by the IRS, as well as fees paid to Heartland, Runyon, and Galusha because Frontline alleges these losses were proximately caused by Reavis\u2019s dishonest conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ASY\">\u00b617 For purposes of this certified question only, American Economy concedes that Reavis had \u201cmanifest intent\u201d as defined in the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"AQj\">\u00b618 Based on these facts, the federal court certified the question to this Court. Under M. R. App. P. 44(c), this Court may answer a question of law certified to it by another qualifying court. Therefore, our review is purely an interpretation of the law as applied to the agreed facts underlying the question. <em>Rich v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 51, \u00b6 11, 314 Mont. 338, \u00b6 11, 66 P.3d 274, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">\u00b619 Frontline argues, among other things, that several jurisdictions have interpreted \u201cdirect loss\u201d to mean all losses proximately caused by an employee\u2019s dishonest activity. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Jefferson Bank v. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., </em>965 F.2d 1274, 1281 (3rd Cir. 1992); <em>Auto Lenders v. Gentilini Ford., </em>854 A.2d 378, 386-87 (N.J. 2004); <em>Mid-America Bank of Chaska v. American Cas. </em>Co., 745 F. Supp 1480, 1485 (D. Minn. 1990). It maintains that the disputed claimed expenses were losses proximately caused by Reavis\u2019s actions. Frontline further avers that incurrence of the disputed claimed expenses was mandated by the policy\u2019s investigation and mitigation of damages provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">\u00b620 American Economy counters that the losses Frontline is claiming are consequential, not <em>direct </em>losses, and therefore are not covered by the policy. It relies on cases from jurisdictions that have expressly declined to apply a proximate cause analysis to the term \u201cdirect loss,\u201d holding instead that a narrower standard was appropriate. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Tri City Nat. Bank v. Federal Ins. Co., </em>674 N.W.2d 617, 625 (Wis. App. <em>2003); RBC Mortg. Co. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>812 N.E.2d 728, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>733 (Ill. App. 1st Dist. 2004). American Economy further maintains that the disputed claims represent monies that Frontline owes to third parties, thus making them third party liabilities and not direct losses. Relying on <em>Vons Companies, Inc. v. Federal Ins. Co., </em>212 F.3d 489 (9th Cir. 2000), and numerous other cases from the First, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Circuits, American Economy urges us to adopt the Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule that \u201cdirect means direct\u201d and that in the absence of a third party claim clause, a policy covering \u201cdirect losses\u201d does not provide indemnity for vicarious liability for tortious acts of a dishonest employee. Additionally, the insurer argues that the policy did <em>not </em>require Frontline to incur the expenses it is claiming.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b621 As noted above, the policy before us insures Frontline against direct losses caused by the dishonesty of its employees. Many jurisdictions have construed \u201cdirect loss\u201d or similar language in a fidelity bond or insurance policy. A fidelity policy, also known as an employee dishonesty policy, is a form of insurance in which the insurer agrees \u201cto indemnify an employer against a loss arising from the lack of integrity or honesty of an employee ....\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 804 (Bryan A. Garner, ed., 7th ed., West 1999). Under a liability policy, by contrast, the policy holder is insured against or indemnified for, vicarious liability to a third party claimant. <em>RBC, </em>812 N.E.2d at 733. The policy before us is clearly the former-i.e., it is an employee dishonesty, or fidelity, policy. See \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b622 The claims asserted by Frontline are for business expenses and losses it incurred as a result of its employee\u2019s dishonesty. While American Economy equates the claims for which Frontline seeks recovery-those of the analysts, the accountants and the IRS-with the classic third party claims for which there would typically be no coverage under a fidelity policy, Frontline maintains that these are losses proximately caused by the employee\u2019s dishonest conduct which the policy was intended to cover. We turn to the cases cited by the parties for guidance in answering this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b623 In <em>Vons, </em>upon which American Economy relies, Vons was insured for employee dishonesty by Federal Insurance Company. The policy coverage was limited to Vons\u2019 direct losses incurred as a result of employee misconduct. An employee of Vons engaged in a dishonest act which resulted in Vons being sued by defrauded third parties. Vons settled these third party claims, and then submitted a proof of loss to recover the amount it paid in the settlement. Vons argued the loss from the settlement of the liability suit was a \u201cdirect loss\u201d incurred due to the actions of the employee. <em>Vons, </em>212 F.3d at 490-91. The Ninth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Circuit rejected this argument, finding that coverage did not extend to Vons\u2019 liability settlement of third party claims for losses arising out of the tortious conduct of its employees. <em>Vons, </em>212 F.3d at 492. The federal court continued that \u201cdirect means direct\u201d and the third party claims were not direct. <em>Vons, </em>212 F.3d at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\">\u00b624 Similarly, in <em>Tri City Nat. Bank, </em>employees of a branch of the Tri City Bank participated in a scheme to obtain fraudulent mortgage loans for insufficiently funded borrowers. Ultimately, these borrowers defaulted on the fraudulently-obtained loans, the scheme was discovered, and the mortgage companies sued Tri City to recover their losses. Tri City sought confirmation from Federal Insurance Company (Federal) that the fidelity bond in place covered Tri City for either judgments or settlements paid to the mortgage companies resulting from the fraud. Federal denied coverage on the ground that the bond covered only those losses \u201cresulting directly from dishonest or fraudulent acts\u201d of Tri City employees. Tri City settled the claims brought by the mortgage companies and then sought indemnity from Federal for the settlement amounts. Federal again denied coverage. <em>Tri City, </em>674 N.W.2d at 617-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b625 The Wisconsin Court of Appeals noted that Tri City\u2019s claimed losses arose from settlements with third parties and were not the direct result of its employees\u2019 dishonesty; in fact Tri City\u2019s liability to the mortgage companies did not come into being until nearly three years after the fraudulent conduct occurred. <em>Tri City, </em>674 N.W.2d at 623. See also <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Kidder, Peabody, </em>676 N.Y.S.2d 559, 246 A.D.2d 202 (N.Y. A.D. 1 Dept. 1998) (If an employee\u2019s dishonesty causes losses to a third party, which then leads to litigation concluding in a judgment or settlement, the insured has not incurred a \u201cdirect loss\u201d under a fidelity bond; the insured\u2019s loss is \u201cindirect.\u201d); <em>RBC; </em>and <em>Finkle v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., </em>2002 WL 1359672 (D. Conn.) (not reported in F. Supp.2d).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b626 Here, unlike in the cases above, Frontline\u2019s disputed claims are not the result of lawsuits by or settlements made to third parties. Rather, as argued by Frontline, they arise from costs incurred to investigate the extent of Reavis\u2019s alleged dishonest conduct and to mitigate and remedy the discovered damage. In making this argument, Frontline relies in part upon three cases from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals<em>-Jefferson Bank v. Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>965 F.2d 1274 <em>(1992); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., </em>205 F.3d 615 (2000), and <em>Scirex Corp. v. Federal Ins. Co., </em>313 F.3d 841 (2002). In these cases, the courts employ a \u201cproximate cause\u201d standard in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>determining whether the claim presented by the insured is or is not the type of \u201cdirect loss\u201d covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\u00b627 <em>In Jefferson Bank, </em>plaintiff Jefferson Bank sought indemnification for direct losses resulting from a loan created with the aid of an imposter notary, who affixed her invalid notarization to the mortgage, and then failed to record it. The customer subsequently placed other mortgages on the same property, at least one of which was recorded, and when the customer defaulted on all loans, Jefferson Bank was unable to take possession of the property. <em>Jefferson Bank, </em>965 F.2d at 1275-76. Progressive, the defendant insurer, argued that the Bank\u2019s loss was not covered under the bond\u2019s coverage for losses \u201cresulting directly from\u201d fraudulent signatures, because the loss was not caused by the notary\u2019s forged signature, but rather by the fact that the building was so heavily encumbered. <em>Jefferson Bank, </em>965 F.2d at 1280-81. The Third Circuit held that under Pennsylvania law, the \u201cdirect cause of a loss\u201d does not have to be the \u201csole\u201d or \u201cimmediate\u201d cause, but need only be a proximate or substantial cause. The Federal Court opined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">\u201c[D]irect cause\u201d or \u201cimmediate cause\u201d is a nebulous and largely indeterminate concept, and one that does not enjoy favor under Pennsylvania law. As we have suggested, Pennsylvania, consistent with general notions of proximate causation, requires that plaintiffs in negligence cases show substantiality, rather than immediacy, in order to demonstrate proximate cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGK\"><em>Jefferson Bank, </em>965 F.2d at 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b628 Also, in <em>Scirex, </em>the Third Circuit applied the proximate cause standard, relying on <em>Jefferson, </em>stating, \u201cPennsylvania law equates \u2018direct cause\u2019 with \u2018proximate cause.\u2019\u201d <em>Scirex, </em>313 F.3d at 843-44. In <em>Scirex, </em>nurse employees for the insured, Scirex (a pharmaceutical-testing company), failed to follow protocol and engaged in deceptive record keeping, both of which rendered certain drug studies worthless. As a result, Scirex was unable to procure and produce results for its contracted sponsor, and Scirex was forced to replicate the studies using $1.2 million of its own funds. Scirex sought indemnity for the replication costs from its insurer, Federal, under a blanket employee dishonesty policy. Federal denied the claim, prompting Scirex to sue Federal for the losses. The federal district court held that \u201cScirex\u2019s losses were directly tied to these studies, and by rendering those studies worthless, the nurses\u2019 behavior proximately, and therefore directly, caused Scirex\u2019s losses.\u201d <em>Scirex, </em>313 F.3d at 843-45, 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u00b629 In 2004, the New Jersey Supreme Court was asked to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>whether the use of a proximate cause test for evaluating the nature of a loss was appropriate under an employee dishonesty policy that requires a direct loss. <em>Auto Lenders, </em>854 A.2d 378. The New Jersey Court noted that \u201cthe majority of federal courts that have addressed this question have concluded that the term \u2018direct loss\u2019 or its equivalent does, in fact, call for the application of a proximate-causation standard.\u201d <em>Auto Lenders, </em>854 A.2d 386. Citing <em>Scirex </em>(applying proximate cause test to \u201cdirect loss\u201d), <em>F.D.I.C. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>205 F.3d 66, 76 (2d Cir. 2000) (applying proximate cause test to policy language covering \u201closs resulting directly from\u201d employee dishonesty), <em>Resolution Trust Corp., Jefferson Bank, </em>and <em>First Nat. Bank of Louisville v. Lustig, </em>961 F.2d 1162, 1167-68 (5th Cir. 1992), the New Jersey Court adopted \u201cthe conventional proximate cause test as the correct standard to apply when determining whether a loss resulted from the dishonest acts of an employee.\u201d It stated, \u201c[o]ur interpretation comports with our general principles of insurance law, including our practice of interpreting coverage provisions broadly. . . . There being no sound reason why a proximate-cause analysis should not be employed when determining whether a loss is direct under a fidelity insurance policy, we will apply that approach to such policies, including the policy at issue in this appeal.\u201d <em>Auto Lenders, </em>854 A.2d at 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\">\u00b630  We are persuaded that a proximate cause analysis is appropriate in determining whether a loss is \u201cdirect\u201d under a fidelity insurance policy. Such a position comports, as well, with our tradition of applying a causation standard to various types of losses claimed under insurance policies. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Green v. Milwaukee Mechanics\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>77 Mont. 505, 252 P. 310 (1926) (Insurer of a fire insurance policy containing an \u201cexplosion\u201d exemption, is liable for both the fire and explosion damage where the explosion is caused by a pre-existing fire \u201csince the fire is the proximate cause of the whole loss and the explosion is a mere incident.\u201d); <em>Newman v. Kamp, </em>140 Mont. 487, 493-94, 374 P.2d 100, 104 (1962) (For claimant to prevail in industrial accident claim, he must establish by a preponderance of evidence that such injury was the proximate cause of his present condition.); <em>Life Ins. Co. of North America v. Evans, </em>195 Mont. 242, 247, 637 P.2d 806, 808 (1981) (In a negligence action, where an accidental injury aggravates or triggers a pre-existing dormant disease or physical infirmity, the accident may be said to have been the proximate cause of the resulting disability within the terms and meaning of an ordinary accident insurance policy.).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>\u00b631  For the foregoing reasons, we answer the certified question by concluding that the term \u201cdirect loss\u201d when used in the context of employee dishonesty coverage afforded under a business owner\u2019s liability policy, applies to consequential damages incurred by the insured that were proximately caused by the alleged dishonesty. We do not address or resolve the question of whether all of the claims presented by Frontline for payment under the policy were proximately caused by the dishonest actions of Reavis, as this is beyond the scope of the certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b632 Question answered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b224-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, MORRIS, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-10\"> For purposes of this certified question only, American Economy admits these losses were occasioned by Reavis\u2019s alleged dishonesty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
