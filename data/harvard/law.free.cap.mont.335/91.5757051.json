The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"AdD\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that she understood this and stated that she wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"ASfn\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are sufficient due to the March 23, 2005 Pre Sentence Investigation recommendation of Probation/Parole Officer, Cathy M. Dorle that the defendant be recommended for placement in a state run health care facility due to the defendant\u2019s mental/cognitive status. The Sentence Review Division was informed by Mr. LaFontaine that the defendant has been diagnosed with Stage II of Dementia at the Montana Women\u2019s Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"A0e\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the matter be remanded to the district court for the district court to consider the Defendant\u2019s most recent psychological report and to either affirm its original judgment committing the Defendant to the Montana Department of Corrections or commit the Defendant to the Department of Public Health and Human Services pursuant to Section 46-14-312, MCA, as the case maybe.</p>\n<p id=\"Afx\">Done in open Court this 6th day of October, 2006.</p>\n<judges id=\"AIR\">Chairperson, Hon.
