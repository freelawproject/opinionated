The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"Azy9\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"AJFa\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are sufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is clearly excessive with respect to this term running consecutively with Cause No. DC-91-104, which was a felony theft of $300.00. This was a crime that was committed by the Defendant in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"AZh\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be modified to run concurrently to Lake County Cause No. DC-91-104. Otherwise, the term of the sentence and the conditions shall remain as imposed in the July 6, 2006 Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"ASPq\">Done in open Court this 3rd day of November, 2006.</p>\n<judges id=\"A84Y\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Chairperson, Hon.
