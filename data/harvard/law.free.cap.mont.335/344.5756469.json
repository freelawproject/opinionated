We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b62 Law enforcement and probation officers performed a probation search of Kotwicki\u2019s house in Great Falls. Kotwicki was not present at the search. Officers seized prescription pills, drugs, paraphernalia, and cash from Kotwicki\u2019s house. Officers arrested Kotwicki the next day pursuant to a warrant for an alleged violation of his probation based on the results of the probation search. Officers found more drugs, paraphernalia, and cash on Kotwicki and in his car at the time of his arrest. Officers seized a total of $5,303.84 from Kotwicki.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b63 The State charged Kotwicki with five felony counts of criminal possession of dangerous drugs and four misdemeanor drug offenses. The State did not charge Kotwicki, however, with possession of dangerous drugs with intent to distribute. Kotwicki was convicted on all charges following a bench trial. The State asked the court to sentence Kotwicki to prison time and recommended that the court impose a fine of $25,000. Kotwicki objected to the imposition of the $25,000 fine on the grounds that it would unfairly minimize the credit for time he spent in custody before trial. Kotwicki did not object to the fine on the grounds that the District Court failed to inquire whether he had the ability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u00b64 The District Court classified Kotwicki as a persistent felony offender and sentenced him to prison terms for each of the five felony possession counts and jail time for the misdemeanor counts with the sentences to run concurrently. The court further sentenced Kotwicki to pay a fine of $25,000 and applied 391 days of time served toward the fine. The court also applied the $5,303.84 seized from Kotwicki toward his fine, leaving a balance of $1,010.31 for Kotwicki to pay. Kotwicki appeals on grounds that the District Court imposed an illegal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">\u00b65 We review a criminal sentence for legality only; that is, whether the sentence falls within the statutory parameters. <em>State v. Borsberry, </em>2006 MT 126, \u00b6 11, 332 Mont. 271, \u00b6 11, 136 P.3d 993, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">\u00b66 <em>Whether the District Court imposed an illegal sentence on Kotwicki.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">\u00b67 Kotwicki argues that his sentence is illegal on two grounds. Kotwicki argues first that his sentence is illegal because the District Court failed to inquire and make specific findings as required by \u00a7 46-18-231(3), MCA, on Kotwicki\u2019s financial resources before imposing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>$25,000 fine. Second, Kotwicki argues that the court\u2019s failure to consider the factors stated in \u00a7 46-18-231(3), MCA, renders the court\u2019s application of the seized $5,303.84 toward the $25,000 fine a violation of due process that also results in an illegal sentence. Kotwicki concedes that he did not object on these grounds at sentencing, but maintains that he may raise these issues for the first time on appeal based on our decision in <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 602 P.2d 997 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">\u00b68  We generally refuse to review on appeal an issue to which the party failed to object at the trial court. <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 341, 602 P.2d at 999. Our decision in <em>Lenihan, </em>however, provides an exception to the general rule and allows appellate review of a criminal sentence that is alleged to be illegal or in excess of statutory mandates, even if the defendant raised no objection in the trial court. <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">\u00b69 Kotwicki argues that our decision in <em>State v. McLeod, </em>2002 MT 348, 313 Mont. 358, 61 P.3d 126, compels application of the <em>Lenihan </em>rule in this case. We applied the <em>Lenihan </em>rule and reviewed the legality of McLeod\u2019s sentence on appeal, even though McLeod lodged no objection to his sentence before the sentencing court. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 16. McLeod challenged the legality of his sentence on appeal on grounds that the sentencing court erroneously relied on misinformation in imposing his sentence. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 16. We upheld McLeod\u2019s sentence based on the fact that McLeod\u2019s failure to object to the mistake constituted a waiver. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\u00b610 We then considered McLeod\u2019s challenge to the legality of the $1,000 fine that the sentencing court imposed, arguing that the court failed to comply with its statutory duty under \u00a7 46-18-231, MCA, to consider whether he had the ability to pay such a fine. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 28. We reversed the sentencing court\u2019s imposition of the $1,000 fine, because the record failed to demonstrate that the sentencing court considered McLeod\u2019s ability to pay a fine. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\u00b611 Kotwicki raises the <em>Lenihan </em>rule on identical grounds as those raised in McLeod\u2019s challenge to the $1,000 fine imposed by the sentencing court. Kotwicki contends that the District Court failed to consider his ability to pay a $25,000 fine as required by \u00a7 46-18-231(3), MCA, thereby imposing an illegal sentence. Kotwicki contends that because we reviewed McLeod\u2019s claim of an illegal sentence, we also must do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">\u00b612 We note, however, the absence of a <em>Lenihan </em>analysis in the Court\u2019s review of McLeod\u2019s challenge to the $1,000 fine. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>28-35. A closer look at <em>McLeod </em>reveals that we considered the <em>Lenihan </em>exception only in the context of McLeod\u2019s argument that the sentencing court considered misinformation contained in a presentence report in imposing his allegedly illegal sentence. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 16. Without any analysis, we apparently extended the <em>Lenihan </em>rule to McLeod\u2019s challenge to the imposition of the $1,000 fine, presumably because McLeod alleged it to be illegal. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u00b613  A defendant generally need only allege that the court imposed an illegal sentence in order to invoke the <em>Lenihan </em>rule. <em>State v. Garrymore, </em>2006 MT 245, \u00b6 14, 334 Mont. 1, \u00b6 14, 145 P.3d 946, \u00b6 14. We consistentlyhave held that a sentence is not illegal if it falls within statutory parameters. <em>Garrymore, </em>\u00b6 9. We also have determined that a sentencing court\u2019s failure to abide by a statutory requirement rises to an objectionable sentence, not necessarily an illegal one that would invoke the <em>Lenihan </em>exception. <em>See State v. Nelson, </em>274 Mont. 11, 20, 906 P.2d 663, 668 (1995); <em>State v. Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. 479, 482, 918 P.2d 296, 298 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u00b614 Both <em>Nelson </em>and <em>Swoboda </em>involve situations where the trial court failed to consider sentencing alternatives as required by \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA, before imposing a prison sentence upon a nonviolent offender. The defendants in each case failed to object to the court\u2019s error at the sentencing hearing. The court in both instances sentenced the defendants to a term of imprisonment. <em>Nelson, </em>274 Mont. at 20, 906 P.2d at 668; <em>Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. at 482, 918 P.2d at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b615 The defendants in <em>Nelson </em>and <em>Swoboda </em>both attempted to invoke the <em>Lenihan </em>rule on appeal, arguing that the Court should review their sentences, even though they failed to raise an objection in district court. Each defendant argued that the district court imposed an illegal sentence in light of the court\u2019s failure to abide by the statutory requirements. <em>Nelson, </em>274 Mont. at 20, 906 P.2d at 668; <em>Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. at 482, 918 P.2d at 298. In each case, we held that the court, after considering the requirements of \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA, legally could have sentenced Nelson and Swoboda to prison, thus the sentences failed to meet the illegality requirement for applying the <em>Lenihan </em>rule. <em>Nelson, </em>274 Mont. at 20, 906 P.2d at 668; <em>Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. at 482, 918 P.2d at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u00b616  We decline to apply the <em>Lenihan </em>rule here based on our reasoning in <em>Nelson </em>and <em>Swoboda. </em>The District Court, had it considered the statutory requirements of \u00a7 46-18-231(3), MCA, legally could have imposed a $25,000 fine upon Kotwicki. Section 46-18-231, MCA, authorizes the court to impose a fine not to exceed $50,000 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>each felony offense in addition to or in lieu of a term of imprisonment. Kotwicki\u2019s fine of $25,000 falls within the parameters of that statute, and thus Kotwicki\u2019s sentence is not an illegal sentence for the purposes of invoking the <em>Lenihan </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b617 The Dissent suggests that our decision to exclude Kotwicki\u2019s argument from <em>Lenihan </em>review \u201cconflicts with our decision in Garrymore.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00b6 24. Our decision to deny <em>Lenihan </em>review of Kotwicki\u2019s claim, however, neither overturns <em>Garrymore, </em>nor contradicts our pronouncement in <em>Garrymore </em>that \u201cit would ultimately undermine the efficacy of the sentencing process to reject appellate review of sentences where the defendant objected in the district court and changed his theory on appeal, yet allow appellate review of sentences where no objection is made, thereby creating an institutional incentive for defendants to remain silent during sentencing.\u201d <em>Garrymore, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b618  Conversely, allowing appellate review of objectionable, but otherwise legal sentences that had not been raised in district court also would encourage silence during the sentencing process. Appellate review under the <em>Lenihan </em>exception, therefore, depends only on whether the defendant raises a plausible allegation that his sentence is illegal, not whether such an argument constitutes a change of theory on appeal. <em>Lenihan, </em>in fact, allows review of a change of theory on appeal, regardless of whether the defendant raised the objection at sentencing, as long as such a change of theory alleges that the sentencing court imposed an illegal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u00b619 We employed <em>the Lenihan </em>exception and allowed appellate review in <em>Garrymore </em>because the defendant raised a plausible argument that the district court imposed an illegal sentence that fell outside of the statutory parameters. The State argued against application of the <em>Lenihan </em>exception on the grounds that Garrymore\u2019s sentence fell within statutory parameters. <em>Garrymore, </em>\u00b6 15. The State offered no analysis, however, in support of its contention that Garrymore\u2019s sentence fell within the statutory limits. <em>Garrymore, </em>\u00b6 15. We decided, therefore, to review Garrymore\u2019s constitutional challenge to his sentence based on his argument that the sentence exceeded statutory bounds. <em>Garrymore, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">\u00b620 Garrymore argued that a parole eligibility restriction amounted to an illegal sentencing enhancement because it required a factual determination by a jury, not a sentencing judge. <em>Garrymore, </em>\u00b6 16. Garrymore contended that his sentence exceeded statutory parameters authorized by \u00a7 45-5-102(2), MCA, and violated his rights under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article II of the Montana Constitution. Garrymore\u2019s claim of an illegal sentence allowed us to address the merits of his claim that the parole eligibility restrictions imposed by the district court violated the rule set forth in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (2000). <em>Garrymore, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u00b621 Kotwicki makes no colorable claim here for an illegal sentence. Kotwicki\u2019s sentence does not fall outside statutory parameters based on our reasoning in <em>Nelson </em>and <em>Swoboda. </em>We recognize that \u00a7 46-18-231(3), MCA, requires the District Court to consider Kotwicki\u2019s ability to pay a fine as well as other factors, including the burden imposed by the fine and the nature of the offense. The record indicates that the District Court actually may have considered such factors in imposing the fine against Kotwicki. For example, Parole and Probation Officer James Clancy (Clancy) testified at Kotwicki\u2019s sentencing hearing that Kotwicki maintained employment as a construction worker. Clancy also testified that Kotwicki explained that the cash found in his possession recently had been withdrawn from his personal savings account. The court noted that it was \u201cquite a sum of money,\u201d and that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that Kotwicki had earned and saved the cash through his job as a laborer. The court could have considered Kotwicki\u2019s ability to pay through the determination that Kotwicki had maintained employment over the years and had in his possession a large sum of cash. We will never know for sure, however, if the court considered such factors because the court made no specific findings as to Kotwicki\u2019s ability to pay. As a result, we assume that the court failed to consider Kotwicki\u2019s financial condition. We conclude that the court\u2019s failure to consider the factors as stated in \u00a7 46-18-231(3), MCA, however, constituted an objectionable sentence, not an illegal sentence. Kotwicki did not object to the court\u2019s sentence on the grounds that it failed to consider his financial position to pay such a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b622  Kotwicki\u2019s failure to object to the court\u2019s oversight of Kotwicki\u2019s ability to pay the $25,000 fine constituted a waiver that prevents us from reviewing the issue on appeal. A failure to raise an issue before the district court bars the defendant from raising the issue on appeal. Section 46-20-104, MCA. Kotwicki, although alleging an \u201cillegal sentence,\u201d fails to present a colorable claim that his sentence fell outside statutory parameters as to warrant our review under the <em>Lenihan </em>rule. Thus, we decline to consider Kotwicki\u2019s sentence on appeal on both grounds raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"AC5\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"Axe\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao0\">\u00b624 I agree with the Court that the threshold question before us is whether Kotwicki has raised <em>\u201ca </em>plausible allegation that his sentence is illegal\u201d under <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 602 P.2d 997 (1979). <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 18. However, I disagree with the Court\u2019s ultimate answer to this question. If we were to adhere to the doctrine of stare decisis and to our recent decision in <em>State v. Garrymore, </em>2006 MT 245, 334 Mont. 1, 145 P.3d 946, we would reach the merits of Kotwicki\u2019s sentencing claim. Unfortunately, the Court embarks on a new course that rests on erroneous interpretations of our <em>Lenihan </em>cases and conflicts with our decision in <em>Garrymore, </em>thereby creating further confusion and unpredictability in our <em>Lenihan </em>jurisprudence. I therefore dissent from the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b625 Generally, this Court will not consider an issue to which a timely objection was not made in the district court. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46-20-104(2), - 701(2), MCA; <em>State v. Brister, </em>2002 MT 13, \u00b6 15, 308 Mont. 154, \u00b6 15, 41 P.3d 314, \u00b6 15. However, in <em>Lenihan, </em>we recognized the following exception to the timely objection rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">It appears to be the better rule to allow an appellate court to review any sentence imposed in a criminal case, if it is alleged that such sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory mandates, even if no objection is made at the time of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\"><em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">\u00b626 As the Court notes, Kotwicki objected in the District Court to the imposition of the $25,000 fine; however, he did not base that objection on the legal theory he now raises on appeal-namely, that the District Court failed to inquire whether he had the ability to pay the fine, as required by \u00a7 46-18-231(3), MCA. Rather, his objection in the District Court was that imposition of the fine would unfairly minimize the credit for time he spent in custody before trial. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 3. As a result, Kotwicki relies on <em>Lenihan </em>to obtain review of his sentencing claim in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">\u00b627 The State argues that \u201cKotwicki is abusing this Court\u2019s <em>Lenihan </em>jurisdiction by changing theories on appeal.\u201d I agree with the Court, however, that \u201c[ajppellate review under the <em>Lenihan </em>exception . . . depends only on whether the defendant raises a plausible allegation that his sentence is illegal, not whether such an argument constitutes a change of theory on appeal.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 18; <em>see also Garrymore, </em>\u00b6 13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>(rejecting a virtually identical argument made by the State in that case); <em>Garrymore, </em>\u00b6 63 (Nelson, J., specially concurring) (\u201c[I]f a challenge to a sentence comes within the meaning of Lenihan\u2019s \u2018illegal or exceeds statutory mandates\u2019 concept, then it would be counterintuitive for us to refuse to consider that challenge on the ground that the appellant objected in the district court under one legal theory but now (on appeal) advances a different legal theory.\u201d); <em>Garrymore, </em>\u00b6 66 n.5 (Nelson, J., specially concurring) (\u201cThe allegation must, of course, conform to our rules and precedents requiring proper argument and citation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b628 The relevant question, therefore, is whether Kotwicki has made a plausible or colorable allegation of illegality for <em>Lenihan </em>purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u00b629 We have long held that a court lacks authority to impose a criminal sentence in the absence of statutory authority. <em>See State v. Hatfield, </em>256 Mont. 340, 346, 846 P.2d 1025, 1029 (1993) (\u201cWe have long held that a district court has no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority.\u201d (citing <em>State v. Stone, </em>40 Mont. 88, 105 P. 89 (1909), and <em>State v. Openshaw, </em>172 Mont. 511, 565 P.2d 319 (1977))). Indeed, our cases are legion and our law well-settled that a sentencing court\u2019s authority to impose a criminal sentence derives from the law; it is not inherent. Thus, a court\u2019s authority to sentence exists only to the extent authorized by sentencing statutes. <em>See State v. Hicks, </em>2006 MT 71, \u00b6 41, 331 Mont. 471, \u00b6 41, 133 P.3d 206, \u00b6 41 (\u201cA district court\u2019s authority in sentencing a criminal defendant is defined and constrained by statute, and the court has no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority.\u201d (citing <em>State v. Ruiz, </em>2005 MT 117, \u00b6 12, 327 Mont. 109, \u00b6 12, 112 P.3d 1001, \u00b6 12)).</p>\n<p id=\"ANb\">\u00b630 Consistent with these well-established principles, we formulated the <em>Lenihan </em>rule from the following language in <em>State v. Braughton, </em>561 P.2d 1040, 1041 n.2 (Or.App. 1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">Where, as in this case, it is alleged that a sentencing court has exceeded its statutory authority in imposing a specific sentence, an objection below is not a prerequisite to the challenging of the sentencing order alleged to be void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-8\"><em>See Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 342, 602 P.2d at 1000. Thus, we established that we will review a sentence that is alleged to be void on the ground that the sentencing court lacked statutory authority to impose it.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">\u00b631 Here, the District Court ordered Kotwicki to pay a fine of $25,000. The source of the court\u2019s authority to do so is \u00a7 46-18-231, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Specifically, \u00a7 46-18-231(1)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\">Except as provided in subsection (1)(b), whenever, upon a verdict of guilty or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, an offender has been found guilty of an offense for which a felony penalty of imprisonment could be imposed, the sentencing judge may, in lieu of or in addition to a sentence of imprisonment, impose a fine <em>only in accordance with subsection </em>(3). [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Section 46-18-231(3), in turn, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">The sentencing judge <em>may not </em>sentence an offender to pay a fine <em>unless </em>the offender is or will be able to pay the fine. [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Thus, while subsection (l)(a) authorizes the judge to impose a fine, the judge may do so \u201conly in accordance with subsection (3),\u201d which states that the judge \u201cmay not\u201d impose a fine \u201cunless\u201d the offender is or will be able to pay it. In other words, the judge simply has no authority to impose a fine under \u00a7 46-18-231 until a determination of ability to pay has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">\u00b632 We have previously held that a court\u2019s authority to impose a sentence may be contingent on certain prerequisites. For instance, in <em>State v. Pritchett, </em>2000 MT 261, \u00b6 7, 302 Mont. 1, \u00b6 7, 11 P.3d 539, \u00b6 7, we held that \u201c[d]istrict courts are <em>not authorized </em>to impose a sentence of restitution <em>until </em>all [the]... statutory requirements [found in \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-241 to -249, MCA,] are satisfied\u201d (emphases added). Under such a statutory scheme, therefore, any sentence imposed by the court <em>before </em>the prerequisites to its authority have been fulfilled will be in the absence of statutory authority. A defendant who alleges that his sentence is invalid for this reason may pass through the <em>Lenihan </em>gateway and have his claims reviewed on appeal. <em>See Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 342, 602 P.2d at 1000 (\u201c Where, as in this case, it is alleged that a sentencing court has <em>exceeded its statutory authority </em>in imposing a specific sentence, an objection below is not a prerequisite to the challenging of the sentencing order alleged to be void.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Braughton, </em>561 P.2d at 1041 n.2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">\u00b633 Kotwicki has made such an allegation. Quoting \u00a7 46-18-231(3), MCA, he points out that a sentencing judge may not sentence an offender to pay a fine \u201c \u2018unless the offender is or will be able to pay the fine.\u2019 \u201d He then alleges that the sentencing judge in this case \u201cfailed to follow the statutory mandate before imposing the $25,000 fine\u201d because the judge \u201cdid not undertake a serious inquiry or separate determination regarding Kotwicki\u2019s resources or his ability to pay a fine, or the burden of having to do so.\u201d (In this regard, Kotwicki notes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>that the PSI contained no comment on whether he would be able to pay a fine.) In addition, Kotwicki points out that the fact that the total amount of the fine ultimately was reduced by credit for time served \u201cdoes not remedy the [District Court\u2019s] failure to follow the statutory mandates prior to imposing a fine.\u201d Thus, he alleges, the $25,000 fine \u201cwas not authorized\u201d and \u201cthe resultant sentence is illegal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b634 Kotwicki\u2019s allegations are confirmed by the record before us, which reflects no determination whatsoever by the District Court that Kotwicki is or will be able to pay a $25,000 fine. Indeed, this Court observes in \u00b6 21 that the District Court \u201cmade no specific findings as to Kotwicki\u2019s ability to pay.\u201d Thus, because \u00a7 46-18-231(3) explicitly prohibited the court from imposing a fine until it actually determined that \u201c[Kotwicki] is or will be able to pay the fine,\u201d and because such a determination was never made, the court lacked authority to impose the fine-plain and simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b635 Accordingly, because Kotwicki alleges that the District Court lacked statutory authority to impose the $25,000 fine because it failed to make the ability-to-pay determination required by \u00a7 46-18-231(3), MCA, he has raised a plausible allegation that his sentence is illegal and he may obtain review of his sentencing claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\u00b636 In reaching the opposite conclusion that \u201cKotwicki makes no colorable claim here for an illegal sentence,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 21, the Court makes a number of critical errors. First, the Court interprets \u201cillegal\u201d under <em>Lenihan </em>inconsistently with our decision in Garrymore. Second, the Court misapplies its new statutory-parameters test to Kotwicki\u2019s claim. And third, the Court misapprehends the critical difference between the statutory language at issue in <em>State v. Nelson, </em>274 Mont. 11, 906 P.2d 663 (1995), and <em>State v. Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. 479, 918 P.2d 296 (1996), and the statutory language at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">\u00b637 As noted above, we held in <em>Lenihan </em>that an appellate court may \u201creview any sentence imposed in a criminal case, if it is alleged that such sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory mandates, even if no objection is made at the time of sentencing.\u201d <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000. Applying this rale in <em>Garrymore, </em>we reached the merits of Garrymore\u2019s Sixth Amendment and state law claims notwithstanding his failure to raise those claims in the district court. <em>See Garrymore, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10, 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u00b638 Garrymore was able to pass through the <em>Lenihan </em>gateway and have his claims reviewed on appeal even though his sentence fell within statutory parameters. Indeed, Garrymore received a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, which was within the parameters of \u00a7 45-5-102(2), MCA (authorizing a sentence of life imprisonment) and \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA (authorizing a sentencing court to restrict an offender\u2019s parole eligibility). <em>See Garrymore, </em>\u00b6 24. Yet, notwithstanding our decision in <em>Garrymore, </em>the Court reasons in the case at hand that because \u201cKotwicki\u2019s fine of $25,000 falls within the parameters of [\u00a7 46-18-231, MCA], . . . Kotwicki\u2019s sentence is not an illegal sentence for the purposes of invoking the <em>Lenihan </em>rule.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16. Thus, under the Court\u2019s approach today, a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cis not an illegal sentence for the purposes of invoking the <em>Lenihan </em>rule\u201d if it \u201cfalls within the parameters of [the pertinent] statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u00b639 This approach is inconsistent with our decision in <em>Garrymore, </em>where we reached the merits of the claims raised on appeal even though Garrymore\u2019s sentence \u201c[fell] within the parameters of [\u00a7\u00a7 45-5-102(2) and 46-18-202(2), MCA].\u201d Thus, the Court\u2019s decision today exacerbates an already intolerable situation. As I explained in my special concurrence in <em>Garrymore, </em>our applications of the <em>Lenihan </em>exception over the past 27 years have not been consistent with respect to any one conceivable definition of \u201cillegal or exceeds statutory mandates.\u201d <em>See Garrymore, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 48, 73-76, 84-101 (Nelson, J., specially concurring). Indeed, our present jurisprudential cafeteria offers up a precedent for whatever version of <em>Lenihan </em>best serves a party\u2019s particular theory in a given case. And today\u2019s decision adds yet another dish to the already cluttered buffet.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u00b640 For evidence of the inconsistency furthered by today\u2019s decision, one need only look as far as \u00b6 13 of the Court\u2019s Opinion. The Court points out that a defendant \u201cneed only allege that the court imposed an illegal sentence\u201d in order to invoke the <em>Lenihan </em>exception, and that \u201c[w]e consistently have held that a sentence is not illegal if it falls within statutory parameters.\u201d Thus, according to today\u2019s decision, an illegal sentence for <em>Lenihan </em>purposes is one which falls outside statutory parameters. As support for this statutory-parameters interpretation of <em>Lenihan, </em>however, the Court cites <em>Garrymore, </em>even though <em>Garrymore </em>conflicts with this very interpretation of <em>Lenihanl</em></p>\n<p id=\"AqE\">\u00b641 We can only expect to see even more confused arguments from parties in future cases than we already see at present if this Court itself cannot manage to provide a cogent and consistent foundation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the <em>Lenihan </em>exception. It is time that this Court either overrules the exception or starts applying it in a manner that is understandable and predictable. The ad hoc approach evidenced by the Court\u2019s decision today serves no one.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u00b642 After enunciating its statutory-parameters interpretation of <em>Lenihan, </em>the Court then proceeds to misapply it in the case at hand. The Court reasons that \u201cKotwicki\u2019s fine of $25,000 falls within the parameters of [\u00a7 46-18-231, MCA], and thus Kotwicki\u2019s sentence is not an illegal sentence for the purposes of invoking the <em>Lenihan </em>rule.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16. This assertion begs the question: What are the parameters of \u00a7 46-18-231? The Court states that \u00a7 46-18-231 \u201cauthorizes the court to impose a fine not to exceed $50,000 for each felony offense in addition to or in lieu of a term of imprisonment.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16. True, $50,000 is one of the parameters of \u00a7 46-18-231. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-231(4), MCA (\u201cAny fine levied under this section in a felony case shall be in an amount fixed by the sentencing judge not to exceed $50,000.\u201d). But, it is not the <em>only </em>parameter. Another parameter-the one at issue here-is that the fine must be one that the offender has the ability to pay. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-231(3), MCA (\u201cThe sentencing judge may not sentence an offender to pay a fine unless the offender is or will be able to pay the fine.\u201d). In other words, the upper parameter of \u00a7 46-18-231 is not merely $50,000; rather, it is the amount the offender \u201cis or will be able to pay,\u201d but no more than $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u00b643 To ignore this requirement is to render the ability-to-pay language superfluous; the Legislature could simply have stated: \u201cThe sentencing court may impose a fine not to exceed $50,000.\u201d Period. Moreover, the Court\u2019s reasoning leads one to ask: What if the subsection (4) limitation of $50,000 did not exist? Would \u00a7 46-18-231 then be parameter-less? Would we in such circumstance ignore the ability-to-pay limitation provided in subsection (3) (as the Court seems to do here) and declare that any fine imposed-even a $25 million fine-is not an illegal sentence for the purposes of invoking the <em>Lenihan </em>exception because it falls within the parameters of \u00a7 46-18-231, which are $0 to infinity? This obviously absurd result is, nonetheless, the logical extension of the Court\u2019s failure to acknowledge <em>all </em>of the statutory parameters set forth in \u00a7 46-18-231.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">\u00b644 It is intellectually dishonest for this Court to assert that Kotwicki\u2019s sentence falls within the parameters of \u00a7 46-18-231 because his sentence falls within <em>some, </em>though not necessarily <em>all, </em>of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>parameters. Unfortunately, the Court today either has elected to ignore an essential parameter of \u00a7 46-18-231, MCA, or has determined, on its own, that Kotwicki is, in fact, able to pay the $25,000 fine imposed by the District Court. Even if I agreed with the Corut\u2019s statutory-parameters approach in this case-which I do not, <em>see Garrymore, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 66-72, 84-89, 102-04 (Nelson, J., specially concurring)-I would not join the Court in ignoring statutory language or assuming facts not in the record. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA (\u201cIn the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or <em>to omit what has been inserted.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)); <em>State v. Ditton, </em>2006 MT 235, \u00b6 81, 333 Mont. 483, \u00b6 81, 144 P.3d 783, \u00b6 81 (Nelson, J., dissenting) (\u201c[W]e should not be \u2018infer[ring]\u2019 the answers to the dispositive legal questions before us.\u201d (second alteration in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b645 Lastly, setting aside the Court\u2019s deviation from our decision in <em>Garrymore </em>and the Court\u2019s ill-conceived statutory-parameters test (which does not withstand close scrutiny as applied to the facts of this case), I disagree with the strained analogy the Court draws between the case at hand and our decisions in <em>Nelson </em>and <em>Swoboda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u00b646 In both <em>Nelson </em>and <em>Swoboda, </em>the defendants argued on appeal that because they qualified as nonviolent felony offenders, Montana law required the respective sentencing judges to consider alternatives to incarceration when sentencing them. However, neither Nelson nor Swoboda had raised this issue in the lower courts. <em>See Nelson, </em>274 Mont. at 17-18, 906 P.2d at 666-67; <em>Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. at 481, 918 P.2d at 297-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\u00b647 In addressing the applicability of the <em>Lenihan </em>exception <em>ioNelson, </em>we reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">Sections 46-18-201(11) and 46-18-225, MCA, do not preclude a court from sentencing a nonviolent felony offender to prison. . . . Although these statutes require consideration of alternatives to imprisonment, such consideration would not have necessarily changed the court\u2019s final sentence for Nelson. Nelson\u2019s sentence of ten years is not in excess of the maximum <em>statutorily authorized </em>by \u00a7 45-5-202(3), MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">Sections 46-18-201(11) and 46-18-225, MCA, impose an affirmative duty upon the court to take certain matters into consideration in sentencing. If the court fails to abide by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>requirement, the sentence is subject to challenge or objection. That does not mean, however, that in the absence of an objection, the sentence is thereby illegal. The District Court, after considering the criteria in \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA, and stating its reasons why alternatives to imprisonment were not selected as required by \u00a7 46-18- 201(11), MCA, <em>could still have legally sentenced Nelson to ten years in prison. </em>Thus, Nelson\u2019s sentence does not come within the exception found in <em>Lenihan </em>and <em>Hatfield.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><em>Nelson, </em>274 Mont. at 19-20, 906 P.2d at 668 (emphases added). We reached the same conclusion in <em>Swoboda </em>based on essentially the same reasoning. <em>See Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. at 482, 918 P.2d at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b648 <em>Nelson </em>and <em>Swoboda </em>make clear that an allegation that the sentencing court did not impose a <em>particular </em>sentence within the range <em>authorized </em>by the applicable punishment statutes is not the kind of error for which the <em>Lenihan </em>exception may be invoked. However, Nelson\u2019s and Swoboda\u2019s situations are readily distinguishable from Kotwicki\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u00b649 Nelson\u2019s and Swoboda\u2019s sentences of ten years and fifteen years, respectively, were authorized by \u00a7 45-5-202(3), MCA (Nelson) and \u00a7 45-5-625(2)(b), MCA (Swoboda). <em>See Nelson, </em>274 Mont. at 20, 906 P.2d at 668; <em>Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. at 482, 918 P.2d at 298. In imposing these sentences, the sentencing courts each had an \u201caffirmative duty\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(11) and -225, MCA, to consider alternatives to imprisonment. However, an affirmative duty is quite different from a limitation or condition on the court\u2019s authority to act. Sections 46-18-201(11) and -225 required consideration of alternatives to imprisonment, but they did <em>not </em>state that the sentencing judge \u201cmay not\u201d sentence a nonviolent felony offender to prison \u201cunless\u201d alternatives to imprisonment are inappropriate for or inapplicable to the offender. Indeed, we explained in <em>Nelson </em>that \u201c[s]ections 46-18-201(11) and 46-18-225, MCA, do not preclude a court from sentencing a nonviolent felony offender to prison.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>274 Mont. at 19, 906 P.2d at 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\u00b650 The statutory language at issue here, by contrast, <em>does </em>preclude a court from imposing a fine. Specifically, \u00a7 46-18-231(3) provides that \u201c[t]he sentencing judge <em>may not </em>sentence an offender to pay a fine <em>unless </em>the offender is or will be able to pay the fine\u201d (emphases added). This is the crucial distinction between <em>Nelson/Swoboda </em>and the case at hand-a distinction which, unfortunately, has eluded the Court today. Whereas consideration of alternatives to imprisonment was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>a prerequisite to or limitation on the judge\u2019s authority to impose a sentence of imprisonment in <em>Nelson </em>and <em>Swoboda, </em>a determination that the offender is or will be able to pay <em>is </em>a prerequisite to and limitation on the judge\u2019s authority to impose a fine on Kotwicki.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b651 Even under the Court\u2019s statutory-parameters test, <em>Nelson </em>and <em>Swoboda </em>are readily distinguishable from the case at hand. Nelson\u2019s sentence of ten years fell within the parameters of \u00a7 45-5-202(3), MCA (1993) (authorizing a sentence \u201cnot to exceed 10 years\u201d in the state prison), and Swoboda\u2019s sentence of fifteen years fell within the parameters of \u00a7 45-5-625(2)(b), MCA (1993) (authorizing a sentence \u201cnot to exceed 50 years\u201d in the state prison). However, the statutory parameters at issue here are the amount Kotwicki \u201cis or will be able to pay\u201d and \u201cnot to exceed $50,000.\u201d Section 46-18-231(3), (4), MCA. Unless we engage in our own fact-finding-an action of dubious propriety-there is simply no way for us to know on the record before us whether Kotwicki\u2019s sentence falls within these parameters, since the District Court made no specific findings as to the amount Kotwicki \u201cis or will be able to pay.\u201d If the most Kotwicki \u201cis or will be able to pay\u201d is, in actual fact, $10,000, then the statutory parameters are $0 to $10,000, and the $25,000 fine is not within statutory parameters. (It falls within the parameters of subsection (4), but not subsection (3).)</p>\n<p id=\"A3F\">\u00b652 The Court contends that \u201c[t]he District Court, had it considered the statutory requirements of \u00a7 46-18-231(3), MCA, legally could have imposed a $25,000 fine upon Kotwicki.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16. This, however, is a flat-out misstatement of the statutory language, since a court\u2019s legal authority to impose a fine does not arise from mere \u201cconsideration\u201d of the statutory requirements of \u00a7 46-18-231(3). For instance, assume that the District Court \u201cconsidered the statutory requirements of \u00a7 46-18-231(3),\u201d and that, in so doing, the court determined that Kotwicki is or will be able to pay a fine of only $10,000. In this scenario, even though the court did as this Court posits-namely, \u201cconsidered the statutory requirements of \u00a7 46-18-23 l(3)\u201d-it legally could <em>not </em>have imposed a $25,000 fine upon Kotwicki. The relevant question, therefore, is whether the District Court legally could have imposed a $25,000 fine upon Kotwicki <em>without </em>first determining that Kotwicki is or will be able to pay it. The answer to this question, as \u00a7 46-18-231(3) makes clear, is a resounding No!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A3o\">\u00b653 To be sure, I do not disagree with the Court\u2019s analogy between <em>Nelson/Swoboda </em>and the <em>second </em>sentence of \u00a7 46-18-231(3), which states as follows: \u201cIn determining the amount and method of payment, the sentencing judge shall take into account the nature of the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>committed, the financial resources of the offender, and the nature of the burden that payment of the fine will impose.\u201d Taking these factors into account is <em>not </em>a prerequisite to or limitation on the court\u2019s authority to impose a fine; rather, the specific contingency on the court\u2019s authority is contained only in the <em>first </em>sentence of \u00a7 46-18-231(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u00b654 The plain language of the statute makes this distinction clear. \u201cThe sentencing judge <em>may not </em>sentence an offender to pay a fine <em>unless </em>the offender is or will be able to pay the fine.\u201d Section 46-18-231(3), MCA (emphases added). Once the judge makes that determination, the judge has the authority to impose a fine up to the amount the offender is or will be able to pay, but no more than $50,000. Next, \u201c[i]n determining the amount and method of payment, the sentencing judge <em>shall </em>take into account the nature of the crime committed, the financial resources of the offender, and the nature of the burden that payment of the fine will impose.\u201d Section 46-18-231(3), MCA (emphasis added). However, failure to take these factors into account when determining the amount and method of payment does not divest the court of its authority to impose the fine in the first place; rather, taking these factors into account is merely an \u201caffirmative duty\u201d in the same sense that consideration of alternatives to imprisonment was an \u201caffirmative duty\u201d in <em>Nelson </em>and <em>Swoboda. </em>Whether the court fulfills that duty or not, its authority to impose the fine (within the limits provided elsewhere in \u00a7 46-18-231) still exists.</p>\n<p id=\"A8v\">\u00b655 For these reasons, Kotwicki\u2019s sentencing claim is distinguishable in all material respects from the sentencing claims at issue in <em>Nelson </em>and <em>Swoboda, </em>and the result the Court reaches here is, therefore, not supported by those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u00b656 In conclusion, the Court\u2019s resolution of Kotwicki\u2019s sentencing claim conflicts with our decision in <em>Garrymore. </em>The Court relies on a statutory-parameters interpretation of the <em>Lenihan </em>exception, which is inconsistent with our reaching the merits of Garrymore\u2019s sentencing claims. As a result, the Court creates further confusion and uncertainty in an already muddled <em>Lenihan </em>jurisprudence.

The Court has misapplied the exception and, therefore, has erroneously refused to review the merits of Kotwicki\u2019s claims, which are quickly disposed of, as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"AhA\">\u00b658 Because the District Court failed to determine that Kotwicki \u201cis or will be able to pay the fine,\u201d as required by \u00a7 46-18-231(3), the court had no authority to impose the fine. Moreover, as a result of the court\u2019s omission, we do not know whether, as applied to Kotwicki, the upper parameter of \u00a7 46-18-231 is $50,000 or something less (corresponding to what Kotwicki \u201cis or will be able to pay\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b659 Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court should be reversed as to this portion of Kotwicki\u2019s sentence and the case should be remanded for resentencing pursuant to a proper application of \u00a7 46-18-231, MCA. \u201cIf this Court will not hold district courts ... to the requirements so clearly spelled out by the Montana Legislature, who will?\u201dIn re AS., 2006 MT 281, \u00b6 64, 334 Mont. 280, \u00b6 64, 146 P.3d 778, \u00b6 64 (Gray, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b660 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
