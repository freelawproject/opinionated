The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"ADk\">Before hearing the application, counsel for the defendant advised the Sentence Review Division that he was recently appointed to represent the defendant and he wished to continue the sentence review hearing as he still has not received the sentencing transcripts and requires additional time to prepare for the sentence review hearing. Ravalli County Attorney, George Com, was notified prior to the hearing that there would be a request for a continuance in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"AfD\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the application for review of sentence shall be continued to the next available hearings in November 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"AOe7\">Done in open Court this 10th day of August, 2006.</p>\n<judges id=\"ALhv\">Alt.
