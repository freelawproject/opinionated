The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"AVNX\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, hut also increase it. The defendant was farther advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"AXXD\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are sufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is clearly excessive in that the original sentence was a Department of Corrections commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"Az73\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be modified to a Department of Corrections commitment for a term of three (3) years. The terms and conditions shall remain as imposed in the June 15, 2006 Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"A95\">Done in open Court this 3rd day of November, 2006.</p>\n<judges id=\"AsRx\">Chairperson, Hon.
