The State filed a motion in limine seeking to prohibit any testimony or evidence regarding West's belief that the victim was over the age of consent. After oral argument, the trial court granted the State's motion in limine. The trial court then granted West's certificate of immediate review, and this Court granted West's application for interlocutory appeal from this order. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   A motion in limine is a pretrial method of determining the admissibility of evidence. By its very nature, the grant of a motion in limine excluding evidence suggests that there is no circumstance under which the evidence under scrutiny is likely to be admissible at trial. In light of that absolute, the grant of a motion in limine excluding evidence is a judicial power which must be exercised with great care. A trial court's ruling on a motion in limine is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (Citation and punctuation omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Forsyth County v.

In its motion in limine, the State indicated that West was read his Miranda rights and then consented to undergo a recorded interview by Investigator Wayne Luke and Investigator Walter Kegley on September 14, 2015. During this recorded interview, West admitted to having sex with the victim on multiple occasions. However, he claimed that he thought she was 17 years old at the time of the acts, but learned later that the victim was only 15 years old. In its motion, the State sought to prohibit West from eliciting any testimony or presenting any evidence about West's beliefs regarding the victim's age at the time of the sexual\n   acts.
