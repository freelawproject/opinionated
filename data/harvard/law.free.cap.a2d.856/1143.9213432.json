The men forced their way into Mr. Robinson\u2019s apartment and bedroom where he and his girlfriend, Lora Watkins, and their six-month-old daughter were sleeping. Mr. Robinson shook Ms. Watkins and asked if she heard a noise. She heard \u201cthree loud bangs\u201d and Mr. Robinson \u201cjumped up\u201d and saw men with guns. Two men with hooded jackets and ski masks ran into the bedroom, turned on the light, and demanded money. The taller of the two gunmen, identified as David Parker, directed Mr. Robinson out of the bedroom and into the living room.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Ms. Watkins remained in the bedroom with the child. Mr. Hager asked if she knew \u201cwhere any money was.\u201d When she replied, \u201cno,\u201d he instructed her to get down on the floor. She removed the baby from the bed and \u201claid on top of her.\u201d Shortly thereafter she heard Mr. Robinson express willingness to give the intruders what they wanted. Mr. Parker demanded money and Ms. Watkins heard a loud struggle in the living room. She also heard gunshots and Mr. Parker\u2019s call for help. As Mr. Hager ran to the living room, Ms. Watkins heard Mr. Robinson call for his mother who lived upstairs in the four-apartment building, followed by more shots and the sound of men exiting the apartment. There were more gunshots outside the building. Ms. Watkins went upstairs with the baby, spoke with Mr. Robinson\u2019s mother, did not see Mr. Robinson, and ran back downstairs and out the front door of the building. She found Mr. Robinson breathing on the sidewalk but unresponsive. He had been shot eight times in his back and arms and soon died. Ballistics evidence revealed that two guns were used during the intrusion into Mr. Robinson\u2019s apartment and his murder, a .40 caliber Glock semi-automatic pistol, and a SWD 11 semi-automatic pistol.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The SWD 11 was found in Mr. Robinson\u2019s living room, and government witness Lloyd Johnson had seen Mr. Parker with a .40 caliber Glock prior to the murder. Two fingerprints lifted from the magazine clip of the SWD 11 matched those of Mr. Hag-er\u2019s \u201cright little finger.\u201d In the aftermath of the incident, Mr. Hager and Mr. Parker made incriminating statements to Charles Johnson, also a government witness, and Lloyd Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">\n<em>The Eyewitness Identiftcation Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-10\">Mr. Hager contends that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his \u201cmotion <em>in limine </em>to admit expert testimony on the lack of correlation between the confidence in and accuracy of eyewitness identifications.\u201d The government argues there was no abuse of discretion since the trial court presented \u201csound reasons for denying the motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-11\">Ms. Watkins did not formally identify Mr. Hager as an assailant until almost two years after Mr. Robinson\u2019s murder. Ms. Watkins had first noticed Mr. Hager in late 1993, and for well over a year saw him on a daily basis outside Mr. Robinson\u2019s apartment building but did not know his name. She exchanged greetings with him and heard him converse with other people. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>She explained that she did not identify Mr. Hager immediately after Mr. Robinson\u2019s murder in part because she feared retaliation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> She claimed, however, that she reported Mr. Hager\u2019s first name to a detective shortly after the crime, asked whether he could check Tommy out, and said he committed the murder.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">The investigation of Mr. Robinson\u2019s murder became dormant after May or June 1995. Then, around April 1997, the police resumed the investigation. A detective contacted Ms. Watkins and displayed a nine-picture photo array to her. She immediately identified Mr. Hager as one of the assailants. Although he wore a ski mask during the crimes, Ms. Watkins identified Mr. Hager at his first trial based on facial features that could be seen in spite of the mask \u2014 his \u201ceyes, mouth, complexion, height, buil[d] and voice.\u201d At that trial, she asserted that she was \u201creal sure\u201d that Mr. Hager was one of the assailants. During the second trial she stated that she was \u201c[o]ne hundred percent sure\u201d that Mr. Hager was in the apartment with a gun on the night of Mr. Robinson\u2019s murder. She identified him by his \u201cbuild,\u201d \u201ccomplexion,\u201d \u201cheight\u201d and \u201cvoice.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">Prior to the commencement of his second trial, Mr. Hager proposed to introduce the testimony of Dr. Solomon Fulero. That testimony would be directed only to Lora Watkins\u2019 identification of Mr. Hager as the person who fatally shot Mr. Robinson.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Dr. Fulero holds a doctorate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>psychology and a law degree. He specializes in legal psychology.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">A hearing on Mr. Hager\u2019s motion occurred on September 1, 2000, and on October 5, 2000, the trial court issued a memorandum opinion and order denying the motion. Following a review of decisions in this jurisdiction relating to the eyewitness identification issue, the trial court declared: \u201c[T]he proffered expert testimony is not beyond the ken of the average lay person and would not be helpful to the trier of fact.\u201d The court pointed out that Ms. Watkins was not identifying a stranger, and as Dr. Fulero had acknowledged in another case, \u201cin situations when the witness knows the suspect expert testimony in this area is less helpful.\u201d Furthermore, Dr. Fulero\u2019s psychological studies concentrated on \u201csituations where the eyewitness is identifying a stranger.\u201d The court also noted \u201cother factors that [Mr. Hager] may use and has used to discredit the accuracy of the witness\u2019s identification, such as, the witness\u2019s relationship with the decedent, the lighting conditions, the witness\u2019s inability to view the suspects because they wore masks, and the stress and fear caused by the event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">\u201cAs we have often reiterated in a number of contexts, the admission of expert testimony is committed to the broad discretion of the trial court and a ruling either admitting or excluding such evidence will not be disturbed unless manifestly erroneous.\u201d <em>Green v. United States, </em>718 A.2d 1042, 1050 (D.C.1998) (citing <em>Dyas v. United States, </em>376 A.2d 827, 831 (D.C.1977)) (quoting <em>Salem v. United States Lines Co., </em>370 U.S. 31, 82 S.Ct. 1119, 8 L.Ed.2d 313 (1962)) (internal quotation marks and other citations omitted). \u201c[E]xpert testimony is admissible to help the jury to do its work and not to do the jury\u2019s work for it.\u201d <em>Steele v. D.C. Tiger Market, </em>No. 01-CV-1193 (2004), 854 A.2d 175, 181, 2004 D.CApp. Lexis 384 at *11-12. Thus, \u201c[i]n a jury trial the judge must exercise discretion to decide whether the proffered expert testimony is likely to assist the jury in the performance of its duties \u2014 that is to say, in understanding the evidence, determining the facts that must be found and rendering its verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 181, 2004 D.CApp. Lexis 384 at *10 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">While we have considered previously whether trial courts have abused their discretion in excluding expert psychological testimony on the reliability of eyewitness identifications, including \u201cunconscious transference and photo-biased identifications,\u201d <em>see Green, supra, </em>718 A.2d at 1050-51, 1053, we have not yet considered the precise issue presented in this case, whether a trial judge abuses his or her discretion in excluding proffered psychological expert testimony concerning the correlation between witness confidence and accuracy in eyewitness identifications. However, another jurisdiction has addressed a situation in which \u201cthe testimony of a \u2018psychological expert\u2019 [was proffered] for the purpose of explaining to the jury the factors that may influence the perception and memory of a witness and affect the reliability of identification testimony\u201d; the court found no abuse of discretion in its exclusion, <em>People v. Lee, </em>96 N.Y.2d 157, 726 N.Y.S.2d 361, 750 N.E.2d 63, 65 (2001). There, \u201c[t]he expert also would testify about the absence of correlation between eyewitness confidence and the accuracy of an identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66. In reaching its decision, the New York Court of Appeals first pointed out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-9\">Despite the fact that jurors may be familiar from their own experience with factors relevant to the reliability of eyewitness observation and identification, it cannot be said that psychological studies regarding the accuracy of an identification are within the ken of the typical juror. Moreover, in recognition that expert testimony of this nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>may involve novel scientific theories and techniques, a trial court may need to determine whether the proffered expert testimony is generally accepted by the relevant scientific community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 66-67 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the appellate court declared that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the expert testimony since \u201c[it] was in a position to weigh the request against other relevant factors, such as the centrality of the identification issue and the existence of corroborating evidence,\u201d and did so. <em>People v. Lee, </em>at 67. Similarly, in <em>United States v. Lumpkin, </em>192 F.3d 280 (2d Cir.1999), appellant \u201csought to offer testimony from his expert witness ... that the degree of confidence a witness purports to have in his or her identification does not correlate to the accuracy of that identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288. The court applied the legal principle that \u201c[a] decision to exclude expert testimony rests soundly with the discretion of the trial court and shall be sustained unless \u2018manifestly erroneous,\u2019 \u201d and held: \u201c[T]he trial court committed no error when it decided to exclude [the expert\u2019s] testimony on witness confidence in identifications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">Our decision in <em>Dyas, supra, </em>follows an approach similar to that of the court in <em>Lee, supra. </em>As <em>Green, supra, </em>indicates, we follow a three-prong test articulated in <em>Dyas </em>in evaluating the admissibility of expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-10\">(1) the subject matter \u201cmust be so distinctively related to some science, profession, business or occupation <em>as to be beyond the ken of the average layman\u201d;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-11\">(2) \u201cthe witness must have sufficient skill, knowledge, or experience in that field or calling as to make it appear that his opinion or inference <em>mil probably aid the trier in his search for truth\u201d; </em>and (3) expert testimony is inadmissible if \u201cthe state of the pertinent art or scientific knowledge does not permit a reasonable opinion to be asserted even by an expert.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-12\"><em>Green, supra, </em>718 A.2d at 1050 (citing <em>Dyas, </em>376 A.2d at 832) (quoting E. Cleary, McCoRmick on Evidence \u00a7 13, at 29-31 (2d ed. 1972)) (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-13\">Here, with respect to the first <em>Dyas </em>factor, the correlation between witness confidence and accuracy, as reflected in psychological studies authored by Dr. Fulero and others may well be beyond the ken of the average layperson, as the court concluded in <em>Lee, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But, as the trial court in this case pointed out, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>studies on which Dr. Fulero would have relied concern the reliability of a stranger identification, not an identification of a person known to the witness, as in this case. Thus, it is highly questionable on this record whether the existence or state of scientific knowledge in the area of psychological studies relating to the correlation between witness confidence and accuracy of non-stranger identifications would have permitted a reasonable opinion to be asserted by Dr. Fulero, and hence, as the trial court declared, it is also doubtful that Dr. Fulero\u2019s testimony would have been helpful to the jury. <em>See Green </em>and <em>Steele, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">Equally important, in the instant case the government presented evidence corroborating Ms. Watkins\u2019 identification of Mr. Hager, and in cases where such corroboration of identification exists, the exclusion of the proffered expert testimony by the trial court generally does not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>See Commonwealth v. Santoli, </em>424 Mass. 837, 680 N.E.2d 1116, 1119 (1997) (\u201cIn a relatively small number of cases, the exclusion of expert testimony on eyewitness identification has been characterized as an abuse of discretion. The opinions that rule that the exclusion of the expert testimony was or may have been error are typically those where there was little or no evidence to corroborate the eyewitness identification.\u201d) (citations omitted). One piece of corroborating evidence in the case before us was pivotal. Two latent fingerprints, lifted from the magazine clip of the SWD 11, matched those of Mr. Hager\u2019s right little finger. The SWD 11 was found in the living room of Mr. Robinson\u2019s apartment, and during the crimes, Mr. Parker had called Mr. Hager into the living room to help him with a struggling Mr. Robinson. Another aspect of the corroborating evidence consisted of statements made by Mr. Hager and Mr. Parker sometime after the murder of Mr. Robinson. Mr. Hager told Charles Johnson that he and Mr. Parker \u201cwent to go rob the Bama [apparently Mr. Robinson] and he bucked [refused to give them any money].\u201d Lloyd Johnson, who had seen Mr. Parker with a .40 caliber Glock gun, maintained that sometime after the March 30, 1995 murder, he saw Mr. Hager and Mr. Parker talking, after which Mr. Hager told him that he \u201chad killed a dude on Nelson Place ... [and consequently] ... he got rid of the Glock.\u201d Such corroborating evidence \u201cundercuts the need, except in the most compelling cases, for expert testimony on eyewitness identifications.\u201d <em>United States v. Hall, </em>165 F.3d 1095, 1107 (7th Cir.1999) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-9\">In short, we cannot say on this record that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding Dr. Fulero\u2019s expert testimony, or that such exclusion was \u201cmanifestly erroneous.\u201d <em>Green, supra, </em>718 A.2d at 1053. The trial court clearly exercised its discretion and did not misapprehend the relevant principles. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>398 A.2d 354 (D.C.1979). Before making its ruling it considered \u201crelevant studies provided by the defendant on eye<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>witness testimony; the transcripts of [Dr. Fulero\u2019s] expert testimony in a separate case ... and the ruling of the trial court in that case on the admissibility of such testimony; [Ms. Watkins\u2019] testimony in [Mr. Hager\u2019s] first trial in this case; and the relevant case law.\u201d In addition, other evidence was introduced corroborating Ms. Watkins\u2019 identification of Mr. Hager as an assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">\n<em>The Motion to Suppress on Sixth Amendment Grounds</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">Mr. Hager contends that his constitutional Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated by the admission of statements he made to government witness Lloyd Johnson while the two were confined in a courthouse holding cell. He argues that the statements, made in the absence of his counsel, in effect were deliberately elicited by the government through its \u201cagent,\u201d Johnson. The government responds that no Sixth Amendment violation occurred because it had filed a written request to separate Mr. Johnson from Mr. Hager during their detention and hence it did not make a deliberate effort to elicit statements from Mr. Johnson that would implicate Mr. Hager in the murder of Mr. Robinson. In denying the motion to suppress, the trial court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1184-6\">[T]he separation order was to keep Mr. Johnson away from Mr. Hager at all times during the trial, including transportation to and from the jail and the court, so I don\u2019t find that the Government placed Mr. Johnson in a position to hear Mr. Hager. Indeed the Government tried to keep him apart from Mr. Hager. So, I don\u2019t believe there was any government attempt to deliberately elicit anything from Mr. Hager. So that there\u2019s no government action that needs to be punished by suppressing evidence. So the motion to suppress is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adg\">On review of the denial of a suppression motion, this court \u201cwill not disturb the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous, and those findings will only be set aside if they lack substantial support in the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>761 A.2d 845, 850 (D.C. 2000) (citing <em>Morris v. United States, </em>728 A.2d 1210, 1215 (D.C.1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u2018We must accept the trial judge\u2019s findings of evidentiary fact and ... resolution of conflicting testimony.\u201d <em>Brown v. United States, </em>590 A.2d 1008, 1020 (D.C.1991). We review the record in the light most favorable to the government, which' prevailed in the trial court. <em>Peay v. United States, </em>597 A.2d 1318, 1320 (D.C.1991) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">To determine whether there has been a Sixth Amendment violation requiring the suppression of a defendant\u2019s statement, we look to applicable precedents decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, including <em>United States v. Henry, </em>447 U.S. 264, 100 S.Ct. 2183, 65 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980) and <em>Massiah v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964). <em>See Simpson v. United States, </em>632 A.2d 374, 380 (D.C.1993). Our analysis in this case is controlled by what we said in <em>Simpson: </em>\u201cOnce formal criminal proceedings begin, the Sixth Amendment renders inadmissible in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief, statements \u2018deliberately elicited\u2019 from a defendant without an express waiver of the right to counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Our review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>record in this case satisfies us that the government did not deliberately elicit from Mr. Hager the statements implicating him in the murder of Mr. Robinson. To the contrary, the government sought to ensure Mr. Hager\u2019s separation from Mr. Johnson by requesting that the U.S. Marshal\u2019s service keep them apart \u201cat all times\u201d during the proceedings against Mr. Hager. Thus, Mr. Johnson was not a government agent within the meaning of <em>Massiah. </em>Moreover, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s factual finding that the government took steps to ensure no contact between the two men while Mr. Hager was awaiting trial and in trial. Mr. Hager knew Mr. Johnson was scheduled to testify against him but nevertheless initiated conversation with him in the holding cells at the courthouse the day before Mr. Johnson\u2019s testimony. Mr. Johnson testified that Mr. Hager \u201ccalled out [his] name\u201d and indicated that Mr. Johnson was scheduled to testify against him, not Mr. Parker. He asked Mr. Johnson to \u201cdo anything to mess the trial up\u201d so that there would be a \u201cmistrial or something like that.\u201d When Mr. Johnson asked whether Mr. Hager was with Mr. Parker at the time of the murder, Mr. Hager responded: \u201cYes, but I ain\u2019t telling you [anything].\u201d On the return trip to the jail in a van, Mr. Hager told Mr. Johnson: \u2018You know, it is all on you, champ. It\u2019s up to you. You could [mess] the whole trial up.\u201d In sum, the record supports the trial court\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusion that the government did not deliberately elicit incriminating statements from Mr. Hager; that is, the government did not \u201cintentionally creatfe] a situation likely to induce [Mr. Hager] to make incriminating statements without the assistance of counsel,\u201d <em>Henry, supra, </em>447 U.S. at 274, 100 S.Ct. 2183, and hence, the trial court properly denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">Finally, Mr. Hager maintains that \u201cthe carrying a pistol without a license statute ... unconstitutionally infringes upon the right to bear arms bestowed by the Second Amendment [to the Constitution],\u201d as well as \u201cviolates the Fifth Amendment protections of due process and equal protection.\u201d The government claims that Mr. Hager waived both of these arguments. We agree. <em>See Mitchell v. United States, </em>746 A.2d 877, 885 n. 11 (D.C.2000). At any rate, Mr. Hager\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by our decisions in <em>Austin v. United States, </em>847 A.2d 391 (D.C.2004) (per curiam), and <em>Sandidge v. United States, </em>520 A.2d 1057 (D.C.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">.

Ms. Watkins also attributed the delay in her identification to the initial effort of the police to implicate her in the murder of Mr. Robinson, accusing her of \"setting [Mr. Robinson] up.\u201d Although the police told Ms. Watkins that she would be taken to the hospital right after Mr. Robinson was shot, they instead took her to the police station. At that time, she did not know Mr. Robinson's condition and was worried about him. In addition, she did not know Mr. Hager\u2019s name at that time. The day after the murder, she was certain Mr. Hager was one of the intruders but by then he had befriended Mr. Robinson's family and she did not think anyone would believe that he had been involved with the murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">. At another point in her direct testimony at the second trial Ms. Watkins was asked whether in 1995 she \"ever [told the police] it was Tommy Hager, why haven't you arrested him or anything of that nature?\u201d She replied, \"No.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">. She stated that Mr. Hager was 5'4\" in height, the same as her height. On cross-examination, Ms. Watkins was confronted with her statement to the police hours after the crimes, that the shorter of the two assailants was 5'9\". She responded that 5'9\" \"was an incorrect statement.\u201d She identified the taller of the assailants as 6' tall, the exact height of Mr. Parker.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1180-10\">.Mr. Hager\u2019s motion stated that Dr. Fulero \"will tell the jury that controlled experiments have led him and other leading experts in the field to draw the following general conclusions\u201d;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-11\">a.

A witness may over time become increasingly confident in the accuracy of his identification. The apparent growth in confidence may result from (1) suggestions by the authorities \u2014 either explicit or implicit, either proper or improper \u2014 that the defendant is in fact guilty, (2) actions by the suspect, such as flight, (3) the eyewitness\u2019 own desire to \"get\u201d someone for what happened, and/or (4) the \"rehearsal effect\u201d\u2014 the relaxation, ease, and confidence that a witness feels as he repeats his story and begins to feel more comfortable with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-15\">e.

Although we are a <em>Frye </em>jurisdiction, our cases involving the admission of expert testimony have rested on the discretion of the trial judge, rather than on the admissibility of \"novel scientific evidence.\u201d <em>See Frye v.

An additional factor supports the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude the testimony of Dr. Fulero. Mr. Hager had an opportunity to cross-examine Lora Watkins and to attack her eyewitness identification testimony.
