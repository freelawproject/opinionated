The Board adopted the opinion of the IJ concluding Lohbeng failed to present credible evidence establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1158 (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2003); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). We have reviewed the administrative record, the IJ\u2019s decision, and the Board\u2019s conclusion, and find that substantial evidence supports the IJ in his ruling that Lohbeng failed to establish refugee status. We have reviewed the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations and conclude that they are supported by specific, cogent reasoning, and therefore are entitled to substantial deference. <em>Figeroa v. INS, 886 </em>F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-18\">Additionally, we uphold the Board\u2019s denial of Lohbeng\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The standard for receiving withholding is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Lohbeng has failed to establish refugee status, he cannot satisfy the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-19\">We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
