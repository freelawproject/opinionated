Scott, Texas prisoner # 762996, appeals from the dismissal without prejudice of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim. Scott alleged in his complaint that the defendants, who are state clerks of court, denied him access to the court by conspiring to withhold his state habeas corpus application. On appeal, Scott persists in this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-16\">Scott has not addressed the district court\u2019s conclusions that his claims against Groomer were in her supervisory capacity and failed to allege a causal connection between her actions and the denial of a constitutional right or that Scott failed to show how he was harmed by the alleged failure to process his pleading properly. Accordingly, Scott has abandoned those issues on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Moreover, a review of Scott\u2019s complaint shows that his bald allegations of a conspiracy are insufficient to survive dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>See Lynch v. Cannatella, </em>810 F.2d 1363, 1369-70 (5th Cir.1987); <em>see also Kane Enters. v. MacGregor (USA) Inc., </em>322 F.3d 371, 374 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-17\">Scott has filed motions for the appointment of counsel, for production of documents, and for transfer of custody. Those motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-18\">Scott\u2019s appeal is without merit and is frivolous. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of the appeal counts as a strike against Scott for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Scott is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b79-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
