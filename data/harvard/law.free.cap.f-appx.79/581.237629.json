As explained below, the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, and she offered sufficient rationale for crediting and discrediting the conflicting evidence of certain physicians. We therefore deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-16\">Harry Lilly worked underground in the coal mines of southern West Virginia for approximately eighteen years. He was most recently employed as a belt man at an Eastern mine near Bald Knob, West Virginia, until he was laid off in 1992. Mr. Lilly filed his initial claim for Black Lung disability benefits on September 14, 1993. That initial claim was denied, as was his motion for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-17\">In 1996, Mr. Lilly, a cigarette smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer and, as a result, the upper lobe of his right lung was removed. Although this surgery was largely successful in removing his primary cancer, within three months doctors discovered that the cancer had metastasized to Mr. Lilly\u2019s bones and spine. Because the cancer had reached an advanced stage, Mr. Lilly was not treated with radiation or chemotherapy. Instead, he was placed under hospice care to make his final months more bearable. Mr. Lilly subsequently developed pneumonia and died on November 2,1996. '</p>\n<p id=\"b612-18\">After Mr. Lilly\u2019s death, his wife Judy filed a claim for Black Lung survivor\u2019s benefits, which was denied. Mrs. Lilly then appealed the denial of both her claim for survivor\u2019s benefits and her husband\u2019s claim for disability benefits. An ALJ heard Mrs. Lilly\u2019s appeal and, on January 29, 1999, granted benefits on both claims (the \u201cALJ Decision\u201d). Eastern appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the ALJ Decision to the BRB, contending that the ALJ erred by mechanistically according greater weight to the opinions of Dr. Donald Rasmussen, Mr. Lilly\u2019s treating physician, and Dr. Antonio Dy, the prosector of Mr. Lilly\u2019s autopsy. Eastern also claimed that the ALJ erred in failing to offer a sufficient explanation for her decision to discredit the evidence of several other physicians. The BRB agreed with Eastern and, on April 7, 2000, remanded the matter to the ALJ with instructions that her rationale for crediting and discrediting the evidence of the physicians be explained. On December 22, 2000, the ALJ offered a further explanation of her rationale and again awarded benefits to Mrs. Lilly (the \u201cALJ Remand Decision\u201d). Eastern again appealed to the BRB, which, by its Order of January 24, 2002 (the \u201cBRB Decision\u201d), upheld the ALJ\u2019s award of benefits. Eastern now petitions for review of the BRB Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">This court reviews a BRB decision to determine whether it properly concluded that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. <em>Milburn Colliery Co. v. Hicks, </em>138 F.3d 524, 528 (4th Cir. 1998). As we have explained, \u201c[sjubstantial evidence amounts to \u2018more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance.\u2019\u201d Weis <em>Mkts., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>265 F.3d 239, 243 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Pirelli Cable Corp. v. NLRB, </em>141 F.3d 503, 514 (4th Cir.1998)). <em>See also Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938) (holding that substantial evidence \u201cmeans such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d). In conducting our review of a BRB decision, we are obliged to make an independent examination of the record, bearing in mind that \u201c \u2018a reviewing body may not set aside an inference merely because it finds the opposite conclusion more reasonable or because it questions the factual basis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doss v. Director, OWCP, </em>53 F.3d 654, 659 (4th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Smith v. Director, OWCP, </em>843 F.2d 1053, 1057 (7th Cir. 1988)). In making this determination, we must ensure that the ALJ has adhered to her statutory duty \u201cto analyze\u2019 all of the relevant evidence\u2019 and to provide a sufficient explanation for [her] \u2018rationale in crediting certain evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bill Branch Coal Corp. v. Sparks, </em>213 F.3d 186, 190 (4th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Milburn Colliery Co., </em>138 F.3d at 528).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">In order to succeed on a claim for Black Lung disability benefits, \u201ca claimant must prove that (1) he has pneumoconiosis; (2) the pneumoconiosis arose out of his coal mine employment; (3) he has a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary condition; and (4) pneumoconiosis is a contributing cause to his total respiratory disability.\u201d Mi<em>lburn Colliery Co., </em>138 F.3d at 529; <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202 .204. In order to secure survivor\u2019s benefits, a surviving spouse must demonstrate, in addition to (1) and (2) above, that her decedent\u2019s death was \u201cdue to pneumoconiosis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 718.205(a). Under the applicable regulations, a miner\u2019s death \u201cwill be considered to be due to pneumoconiosis if ... pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause or factor leading to the miner\u2019s death.... \u201d <em>Id. \u00a7 </em>718.205(c)(2). The regulations further explain that \u201c[p]neumoconiosis is a \u2018substantially contributing cause\u2019 of a miner\u2019s death if it hastens the miner\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 718.205(e)(5). In this proceeding, the parties do not dispute that Mr. Lilly suffered from pneumoconiosis or that his pneumoconiosis arose out of his coal mine employment. Instead, they disagree over whether Mr. Lilly\u2019s pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of his disability and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">In determining whether there is substantial evidence of Mr. Lilly\u2019s disability and death due to pneumoconiosis, the ALJ was obliged to evaluate and choose between the conflicting medical opinions presented by two groups of physicians, one group supporting Mrs. Lilly\u2019s claims<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and another group refuting them on behalf of Eastern.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When such disputes arise, an ALJ\u2019s judgment is restricted only by the rules that she must not base her determination on any impermissible grounds and that she must fully explain her rationale. <em>See Bill Branch Coal Corp., </em>218 F.3d at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Eastern first asserts that the ALJ based her determination on two impermissible grounds: (1) Dr. Rasmussen\u2019s status as treating physician; and (2) Dr. Dy\\s status as prosector of the autopsy. In this regard, Eastern correctly posits that \u201can ALJ should not \u2018mechanistically credit[ ], to the exclusion of all other testimony,\u2019 the testimony of an examining or treating physician solely because the doctor personally examined the claimant.\u201d <em>Milburn Colliery Co., </em>138 F.3d at 533 (quoting <em>Sterling Smokeless Coal Co. v. Akers, </em>131 F.3d 438, 441 (4th Cir.1997)). At the same time, a treating physician\u2019s opinion is entitled to \u201cgreat, though not necessarily dispositive, weight.\u201d <em>Grigg v. Director, OWCP, </em>28 F.3d 416, 420 (4th Cir.1994). Eastern is also correct that \u201cALJs are not to credit the opinions of an autopsy prosector, to the exclusion of all other experts, solely because the autopsy prosector was the only physician to examine the whole body near the time of death.\u201d <em>Bill Branch Coal Corp., </em>213 F.3d at 192. Like the BRB, however, we are satisfied that the ALJ did not mechanistically credit the opinions of Drs. Rasmussen and Dy, to the exclusion of all other evidence, based solely on their status. Instead, as explained below, her decisions provided a reasoned analysis of why she found these physicians\u2019 opinions credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">Upon remand from the BRB, the ALJ explained that she credited the evidence of Dr. Rasmussen for several reasons: (1) he has extensive clinical experience treating coal miners; (2) he has published numerous articles on coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis; (3) his diagnosis was based on objective arterial blood gas studies performed by himself and others; and (4) his diagnosis was confirmed by the autopsy. ALJ Remand Decision at 6. The ALJ further explained that she credited Dr. Rasmussen\u2019s opinion because she found it well documented and well reasoned. <em>Id. </em>It was clearly within the ALJ\u2019s discretion to find, based on the foregoing, that Dr. Rasmussen was more credible than other physicians who, according to Eastern, possess superior academic qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">The ALJ similarly offered sufficient explanation as to why she credited the evidence of Dr. Dy, the prosector of the autopsy. The ALJ carefully explained that she credited the prosector\u2019s opinion, not mechanistically based on his title alone, but because he listed specific observations that led him to conclude that Mr. Lilly\u2019s left lung contained moderate pneumoconiosis and his right contained mild pneumoconiosis. <em>Id. </em>at 3. In particular, Dr. Dy observed a macule measuring one centimeter, pleural interstitial fibrosis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>and intra-alveolar anthraeotic macrophages. <em>Id. </em>The ALJ was entitled to find that Dr. Dy\u2019s opinion was well supported because it was based on these direct observations. As explained below, the ALJ sufficiently justified her decision to discount the opinions of the physicians who expressed contrary views. The ALJ thus did not mechanistically credit the opinion of the prosector to the exclusion of all other experts. <em>See Bill Branch Coal Corp., </em>213 F.3d at 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Eastern also maintains that the ALJ erred in according lesser weight to the opinions of physicians who expressed views contrary to those of Drs. Rasmussen and Dy. Because the ALJ explained her reasoning in that regard and did not rely on any impermissible bases, we must defer to her discretion and judgment in assessing the conflicts in the evidence. <em>Stiltner v. Island, Creek Coal Co., </em>86 F.3d 337, 342 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">First, the ALJ did not improperly discredit the opinion of Dr. Peter Tuteur. Dr. Tuteur reviewed certain of Mr. Lilly\u2019s medical reports, x-ray reports, and pulmonary function studies, and he concluded that Mr. Lilly did not present clinically, physiologically, or radiologically significant pneumoconiosis. The ALJ reasonably discounted Dr. Tuteur\u2019s opinion because he issued his report two years prior to Mr. Lilly\u2019s death. In that circumstance, it was not inappropriate for the ALJ to accord less weight to an opinion premised on incomplete information. The ALJ analyzed Dr. Tuteur\u2019s opinion and explained why she found it less than convincing. Nothing more is required of her. <em>See Milburn Colliery Co., </em>138 F.3d at 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The ALJ was also unconvinced by the opinions of Drs. Jerome Kleinerman, Joseph Renn, and Greg Fino because they failed to explain to her satisfaction why they had characterized Mr. Lilly\u2019s pneumoconiosis as mild when Dr. Dy\u2019s autopsy report described it as moderate in the left lung. In addition, the ALJ explained that she credited Dr. Fino\u2019s opinion less because he did not examine the autopsy slides and because he is not a pathologist. She further explained that she discounted Dr. Renn\u2019s opinion because, upon diagnosing emphysema, he refused to consider whether pneumoconiosis also could have played some role in Mr. Lilly\u2019s death. None of these were improper bases for discounting a physician\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">Eastern also complains that the ALJ erred in declining to credit the opinion of Dr. James Lockey, who opined that Mr. Lilly\u2019s pneumoconiosis was \u201cnot a materially contributing factor\u201d in his death. As the ALJ explained, she accorded Dr. Lockey\u2019s opinion little weight because he did not discuss the role that pneumoconiosis played in Mr. Lilly\u2019s chronic lung disease and, more importantly, because Dr. Lockey did not define what he meant by \u201cmaterially.\u201d ALJ Decision at 16. Contrary to Eastern\u2019s assertion, the ALJ did not premise her decision to disregard this evidence on impermissible grounds. She simply found Dr. Lockey\u2019s opinion to be of little assistance in making her determination because she did not know what Dr. Lockey meant by \u201cmaterially.\u201d Under the regulations, Mr. Lilly\u2019s death was \u201cdue to pneumoconiosis\u201d if pneumoconiosis hastened his death at all, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(c)(2), (5), yet Dr. Lockey may have considered a mere hastening of death to be medically immaterial. Because Dr. Lockey did not explain what he meant by \u201cmaterially,\u201d his opinion failed to aid the ALJ in her efforts to reach a legal conclusion; therefore, she did not err in disregarding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">Next, Eastern asserts that the ALJ erred in discounting the opinion of oncologist Dr. Raymond Weiss. Dr. Weiss stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>ed that the median lifespan for a patient with lung cancer in Stage IV is seven months and that, because Mr. Lilly survived five months in that stage, his survival was within the expected range.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dr. Weiss\u2014who is not a pulmonologist<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\u2014concluded that Mr. Lilly\u2019s pneumoconiosis therefore could not have hastened his death. The ALJ accorded little weight to Dr. Weiss\u2019s testimony because he did not address the vital issue in the case: whether pneumoconiosis was a factor in the lung impairment that led to Mr. Lilly\u2019s death. There was nothing improper in the ALJ disregarding an expert\u2019s opinion that did not address the important issues in the case. More important, though, Dr. Weiss\u2019s testimony should be disregarded for another reason: it suffers from a serious logical flaw. Although Mr. Lilly\u2019s lifespan was as expected for a man with Stage IV lung cancer, he may have lived longer had he not suffered from pneumoconiosis. Dr. Weiss failed to recognize and address this possibility; therefore, the ALJ properly disregarded his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The ALJ was also correct in giving no weight to the opinion of Dr. Mohammed Ranavaya, who simply placed the word \u201cNo\u201d on a form asking whether pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of Mr. Lilly\u2019s death. The ALJ did not err in according Dr. Ranavaya\u2019s opinion little weight because he provided no rationale or support for it. <em>See Milburn Colliery Co., </em>138 F.3d at 532 n. 9 (noting that \u201c[a]n ALJ has discretion to disregard an opinion unsupported by a sufficient rationale\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Finally, Eastern complains that the ALJ improperly discredited the evidence of Dr. George Zaldivar because she found that he expressed no opinion on the extent of Mr. Lilly\u2019s respiratory impairment. Eastern is correct that the ALJ\u2019s characterization of Dr. Zaldivar\u2019s report was inaccurate, as Dr. Zaldivar found that \u201c[f]rom a pulmonary stand-point Mr. Lilly is not capable of performing his usual coal mining work. He would not be capable of performing more than light work on a continuous basis.\u201d Despite this apparent oversight, our decision in this proceeding remains unchanged. The ALJ analyzed Dr. Zaldivar\u2019s report only in the context of her discussion of whether Mr. Lilly was totally disabled, an issue on which the physicians largely agreed. She did not purport to credit or discredit Dr. Zaldivar\u2019s opinion on other issues based on this assessment. We must therefore conclude that this isolated mischaracterization does not warrant the relief Eastern seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">Having determined that the ALJ\u2019s methodology for interpreting the evidence was not improper, we turn to the issue of whether the award of benefits to Mrs. Lilly by the BRB and the ALJ is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Milburn Colliery Co., </em>138 F.3d at 528. In reviewing for substantial evidence, we are mindful that mechanically tallying the number of physicians on each side is improper. <em>Sterling Smokeless Coal Co., </em>131 F.3d at 440. Additionally, we do not substitute our judgment for that of an ALJ, even if we might have reached the opposite result. <em>Doss, </em>53 F.3d at 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">Our review of the physicians\u2019 reports and testimony convinces us that the ALJ\u2019s award of benefits is supported by substantial evidence. Dr. Rasmussen found that Mr. Lilly was totally disabled due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>chronic lung disease, which was caused in part by pneumoconiosis. Dr. Rasmussen offered concrete, specific reasons for this conclusion: (1) a chest x-ray indicated pneumoconiosis, which was confirmed by the autopsy; and (2) Mr. Lilly\u2019s gas exchange impairment was much greater than his ventilatory capacity impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Similarly, Dr. Rasmussen affirmatively concluded that coal dust exposure contributed to Mr. Lilly\u2019s death because coal dust produces emphysema and interstitial fibrosis. Dr. Rasmussen\u2019s report reflects that cigarette smoking and coal dust were both risk factors, but that the latter was \u201cat least a major and probably the most significant cause of his lung disease.\u201d Dr. Rasmussen reached this conclusion because Mr. Lilly\u2019s gas exchange impairment was much greater than his ventilatory capacity impairment, which suggested significant interstitial lung disease. According to Dr. Rasmussen, this lung disease made Mr. Lilly more susceptible to and less capable of surviving the pneumonia that eventually killed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Certainly, Eastern submitted evidence supporting the proposition that Mr. Lilly\u2019s blood gas studies did not indicate impairment caused by pneumoconiosis. As discussed above, however, the ALJ permissibly found Dr. Rasmussen to be more credible. And Dr. Rasmussen\u2019s diagnosis was not premised on mere conjecture; it was supported by specific reasoning and interpretation of blood tests. His opinion, therefore, was appropriately considered as evidence supporting the award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Dr. Rasmussen\u2019s opinion is buttressed by that of Dr. Maria Boustani, who also treated Mr. Lilly. Dr. Boustani found that both tobacco smoke and coal dust contributed in an unknown ratio to Mr. Lilly\u2019s impairment. She reached this conclusion because, significantly, Mr. Lilly\u2019s smoking history and the amount of emphysema in his lungs were insufficient to explain the degree of impairment he exhibited. Dr. Boustani thus concluded that pneumoconiosis contributed to Mr. Lilly\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Finally, Dr. Dy\u2019s autopsy confirmed the presence of macroscopic pneumoconiosis in Mr. Lilly\u2019s lungs. In fact, Mr. Lilly\u2019s lungs probably once contained even more pneumoconiosis than Dr. Dy discovered because pneumoconiosis, according to Dr. Kleinerman, would more likely have been present in the portion of Mr. Lilly\u2019s right lung that had been removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">In light of the foregoing, Mrs. Lilly presented such evidence as was necessary to convince a reasonable mind that pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of Mr. Lilly\u2019s death and disability. <em>See Consol. Edison Co., </em>305 U.S. at 229; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(c)(2). Drs. Rasmussen and Boustani offered definitive testimony that, in their considered medical opinions, Mr. Lilly\u2019s pneumoconiosis contributed to his disability and death. Although certain other physicians opined that coal dust does not cause emphysema, and some stated that it causes a type of emphysema distinguishable from that caused by tobacco smoke, it is for the ALJ to determine which of the conflicting medical opinions are to be credited. <em>Stiltner, </em>86 F.3d at 342. Because the ALJ did not improperly credit or discredit the physicians\u2019 opinions, and because her decision is supported by substantial evidence, the award of Black Lung disability and surviv- or benefits to Mrs. Lilly is not to be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we deny Eastern\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">\n<em>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-13\">.
