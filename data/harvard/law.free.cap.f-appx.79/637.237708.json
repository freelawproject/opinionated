For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">Guthrie sued Defendants Mark Buckley and Diane Porter, Buckley\u2019s attorney, for malicious prosecution. Guthrie based the suit on the actions of Defendants in a previous suit. In the previous suit, Buckley, represented by Porter, sued to enforce a child custody order. The motion included 19 criminal contempt-of-court counts demanding incarceration. The court granted Buckley\u2019s motion to enforce the child custody order, finding Guthrie in violation of various provisions of the order, but the court did not hold Guthrie in contempt of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-16\">Guthrie bases her malicious prosecution claim on the underlying court\u2019s refusal to find her in contempt. However, the controlling Texas law disallows her suit. Therefore, the district court properly granted the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-17\">Texas law holds that \u201can attorney does not have a right of recovery, under any cause of action, against another attorney arising from conduct the second attorney engaged in as part of the discharge of his duties in representing a party in a lawsuit in which the first attorney also represented a party.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To allow otherwise would \u201cfavor <em>tentative </em>representation, not the <em>zealous </em>representation that our profession rightly regards as an ideal and that the public has a right to expect.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This principle has been extended to suits by opposing parties against attorneys.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An attorney or an opposing party may seek sanctions for the opposition\u2019s allegedly meritless or malicious acts, \u201c[b]ut the law does not provide a cause of action.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-18\">Based on this law, the district court properly granted Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss in relation to Porter. Porter\u2019s pleadings, which attempted to hold Guthrie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>in contempt of court, were acts within the discharge of her duties as an attorney. Accordingly, Guthrie has no cause of action based on Porter\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Similarly, Texas law does not allow one party to sue an opposing party for an attorney\u2019s allegedly wrongful conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To be liable for the attorney\u2019s conduct, a client must be \u201cimplicated in some way other than merely having entrusted his legal representation to the attorney.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This rule recognizes that most clients are not qualified to monitor their attorney\u2019s actions during representation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Guthrie\u2019s suit is based on Porter\u2019s pleadings, which sought to hold her in contempt of court. There is no allegation or evidence that Buckley did anything more than hire an attorney to zealously represent him in enforcing a child custody order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, Texas law will not allow a cause of action against Buckley arising out of Porter\u2019s representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b668-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

Contrary to Guthrie\u2019s allegation, the district court\u2019s dismissal did not require it to resolve a disputed fact. Guthrie attempted to hold Buckley liable based on the pleadings filed by Porter. Without more, Porter's pleadings show only that Buckley entrusted his legal representation to her.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
