In No. 03-1057, he challenges the district court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Tillman v. Resolution Trust Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1032, 1034 (4th Cir.1994). Having reviewed the record and finding no reversible error, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Siegel v. Arlington County Dep\u2019t of Community Planning, </em>No. CA-02-902 A (E.D. Va. filed Dec. 2, 2002 <em>&amp; </em>entered Dec. 5, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-16\">In No. 03-1220, Siegel appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(a), (b)(4). We review denial of a motion to correct a clerical mistake, Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(a), for abuse of discretion. <em>Kocher v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>132 F.3d 1225, 1229 (8th Cir.1997). We find no such abuse of discretion. Siegel also moved for relief from judgment pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4), asserting that the judgment was void. We review Rule 60(b)(4) motions de novo. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. v. Brown, </em>84 F.3d 137, 142 (5th Cir.1996). Having reviewed Siegel\u2019s allegations and the district court\u2019s ruling de novo, we conclude that the district court\u2019s order dismissing the action was not void or otherwise subject to attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-17\">We deny Siegel\u2019s motion to remand. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
