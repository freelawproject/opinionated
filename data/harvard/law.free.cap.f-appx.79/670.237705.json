Hartsell asserts that he should have received more money from the policy after he suffered a back injury, and that Bassett should not have reduced his payment due to his receipt of Social Security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">Hartsell\u2019s brief contains no meaningful legal argument and no record references, though he attaches some medical records to it. The brief is inadequate to raise any issues that we can comprehend on appeal. <em>Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994). Further, while Hartsell\u2019s reply brief is more factually detailed, we cannot consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">Even if we were to address Hartsell\u2019s appeal on the merits, we would agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion and reasoning that Bassett complied with the disability agreement and paid Hartsell what he was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-16\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b701-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
