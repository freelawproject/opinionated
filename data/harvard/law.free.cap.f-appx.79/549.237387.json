To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence [s]he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Omar fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that Omar seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-20\">Omar also contends that the Board failed to provide a comprehensible reason for its decision in affirming the decision of the immigration judge without opinion, after review by a single Board member, in accordance with the procedure set out at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2003). We find that by explicitly adopting the immigration judge\u2019s decision as the agency\u2019s final determination, the Board has fulfilled the requirement of providing a reasoned basis for its decision. <em>Cf. Gandarillas-Zambrana v. Bd. of Immigration Appeals, </em>44 F.3d 1251, 1255 (4th Cir.1995) (upholding the Board\u2019s practice of adopting, without further explanation, the reasoning of the immigration judge and stating that the immigration judge\u2019s decision then becomes the sole basis for this court\u2019s review).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-21\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
