Rhea argues that under the reasoning of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>580 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2848, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), his base offense level for sentencing purposes should have been determined with reference only to the drug quantity alleged in count one of his indictment, the count to which he pleaded guilty. Rhea acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent but raises it to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Rhea does not dispute that his 135-month prison term and five-year term of supervised release are within the statutory maximum for his offense. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(viii); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3559(a)(2), 3583(b)(1). Because Rhea\u2019s sentence is within the statutory maximum, <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated. <em>See United States v. Fort, </em>248 F.3d 475, 483 (5th Cir. 2001) <em>(Apprendi </em>not implicated where sentence was within relevant range for drug quantity alleged in indictment and stipulated to by defendant). This court \u201chas expressly rejected the argument that <em>Apprendi </em>applies to enhancements based upon the sentencing guidelines, whether tied to quantity or some other relevant fact, which do not cause the sentence to exceed the statutory range.\u201d <em>United States v. Clinton, </em>256 F.3d 311, 314 (5th Cir.2001) (jury trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b83-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
