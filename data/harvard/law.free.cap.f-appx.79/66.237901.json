We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-25\">To prevail on a claim that his right of access to the courts has been violated, a prisoner must demonstrate prejudice by showing that his ability to pursue a \u201cnon-frivolous,\u201d \u201carguable\u201d legal claim was hindered by the defendants\u2019 actions. <em>See Christopher v. Harbury, </em>536 U.S. 403, 415, 122 S.Ct. 2179, 153 L.Ed.2d 413 (2002) (internal quotations omitted); <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). Belton has not demonstrated that the claims he would have raised in his petition for discretionary review were arguable or nonfrivolous; he therefore cannot prove a constitutional violation. Because he cannot prove a constitutional violation, judgment was appropriately awarded in favor of the defendants, and it was unnecessary for the district court to reach the exhaustion issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b97-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
