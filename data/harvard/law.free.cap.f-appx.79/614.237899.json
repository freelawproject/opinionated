He raises several constitutional claims pertaining to his discipline for refusing to submit a DNA sample in conformity with Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 411.148 (Vernon Supp.2003). The district court found that Fuhrman had not lost good-time credits and that he was ineligible for release to mandatory supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-22\">Furhman, however, provided the district court with several inmate time slips, which support his contention that he lost good-time credits in disciplinary proceedings other than disciplinary case # 20010015552 as a result of his persistent refusal to give a DNA specimen. Moreover, Fuhrman provided the district court with his mandatory supervision release certificate, rendering debatable the issue whether he is eligible for release to mandatory supervision. Texas prisoners eligible for mandatory release who allege that they were erroneous<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>ly denied good-time credit that, if restored, would effect sooner release from prison may seek relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>Malchi v. Thaler, </em>211 F.3d 953, 956 (5th Cir.2000). Fuhrman has met his burden of showing that \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">We therefore grant Fuhrman a COA, vacate the district court\u2019s judgment, and remand for a definitive finding whether Fuhrman lost good-time credits in any disciplinary cases other than #20010015552 for refusing to submit a DNA specimen. Should this be the case, the district court is instructed to order the Respondent to brief the issues (1) whether Furhman is eligible for release to mandatory supervision and (2) whether his forfeiture of good-time credits contravenes \u00a7 411.148(d)\u2019s provision that \u201c[a]n inmate may not be held past a statutory release date if the inmate fails or refuses to provide a blood sample,\u201d and, if so, whether there are constitutional implications necessitating habeas relief. COA is denied in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The district court opined that Fuhrman\u2019s Georgia offense did not, on its face, support a finding that he was required to submit to DNA testing, because there was no indication that the burglary was committed with the intent to commit the felonies formerly enumerated in \u00a7 411.148. We note, however, that \u00a7 411.148 was amended in 1999 to delete the provision that had required DNA eligible burglaries to have been committed with the intent to commit the crimes enumerated in \u00a7 411.148(a)(1). <em>See </em>Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 411.148(a)(1), (2) (Vernon Supp.2003); <em>see also </em>Act of June 19,1999, ch. 1368, \u00a7 1, 1999 Tex. Legis. Serv. (amending \u00a7 411.148 effective September 1, 1999). Consequently, there is no indication that the Georgia offense of burglary of a habitation was not a DNA eligible offense, given that it involved conduct punishable under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(c)(2), which provides that the crime of burglary is a \u201cfelony of the second degree if committed in a habitation.\u201d Tex. Penal Code. Ann. \u00a7 30.02(c)(2) (Vernon 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">COA GRANTED; VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
