The IJ denied Ljuljanovic\u2019s requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Ljuljanovic argues that: (1) the BIA violated his due process rights by summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s decision; (2) the IJ erred in concluding that he failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution; and (3) the IJ erred in concluding that he was not entitled to relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-26\">Ljuljanovic\u2019s due process challenge to the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedure is without <em>merit. See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-27\">The IJ\u2019s finding regarding that Ljuljanovic failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution was based upon Ljuljanovic\u2019s overall lack of knowledge concerning the political and social changes in Montenegro. This conclusion was based on the evidence presented and is substantially reasonable. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s determination must be upheld. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Ljuljanovic also argues that the IJ erred in denying him relief under the CAT. Considering the evidence presented, the record does not compel the finding that Ljuljanovic met his burden to show that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured in Montenegro. <em>See id. </em>at 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Accordingly, Ljuljanovic\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b671-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
