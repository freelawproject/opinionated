Houser fails to show that the district court abused its discretion when it dismissed Houser\u2019s claim that the defendants retaliated against him for filing grievances and litigation. Houser\u2019s allegations about the defendants\u2019 retaliatory motive in charging him in a disciplinary report are conclusional, and he fails to show that the defendants violated a specific constitutional right. <em>See Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Houser\u2019s claim that he was denied access to the courts is frivolous because he has not shown that his position as a litigant was prejudiced. <em>See McDonald v. Steward, </em>132 F.3d 225, 230 (5th Cir.1998). Houser\u2019s claims surrounding the process he received at the disciplinary hearing are not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 646-48, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997); <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Houser\u2019s claim that the defendants intentionally allowed his property to be stolen is frivolous because Houser has an adequate remedy under state law for this claim. <em>See Murphy v. Collins, </em>26 F.3d 541, 543 (5th Cir.1994). Last, this court need not review Houser\u2019s claim that the defendants denied him adequate medical care because he did not raise the claim until he filed a postjudgment motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). <em>See Excavators &amp; Erectors, Inc. v. Bullard Engineers, Inc., </em>489 F.2d 318, 320 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The district court\u2019s dismissal of the present case and this court\u2019s affirmance of the dismissal count as one strike against Houser for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Houser accumulated two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) in <em>Houser v. Mooney-ham, </em>No. 01-50112, 273 F.3d 1101 (5th Cir. Aug.22, 2001) (unpublished). Because Houser has accumulated three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he is now BARRED from proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b685-40\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
