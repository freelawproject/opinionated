The State of Texas, the respondent-appellee in this action, has moved for leave to supplement the record. This motion is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The respondent also moves for dismissal of the appeal, asserting that because the district court lacks jurisdiction, this court lacks jurisdiction as well. This court may review a district court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a case. <em>See Home Builders Ass\u2019n of Miss. v. City of Madison, Miss., </em>143 F.3d 1006, 1010 (5th Cir.1998). However, a review of the arguments presented by the respondents, of the appellate brief submitted by Arballo, and of the record reveal that Arballo\u2019s arguments against the district court\u2019s rulings are frivolous. Because Arballo is no longer \u201cin custody\u201d for his state sentences, he may not proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See Pleasant v. Texas, </em>134 F.3d 1256, 1258 (5th Cir.1998). Arballo may not proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 because he is challenging errors occurring before his trial and sentencing rather than the execution of his sentence. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1001, 122 S.Ct. 476, 151 L.Ed.2d 390 (2001). Arballo may not proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because he did not file his action in the sentencing court and because he did not name his current custodian as the respondent. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 1; <em>Pleasant, </em>134 F.3d at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">This court may dismiss an appeal upon review of an interlocutory motion if the appeal appears frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Therefore, the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED, and Arballo\u2019s appeal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b755-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
