The district court determined that Contreras\u2019s attorney had filed a semi-standard brief in the district court that did not address the issue for which the case was remanded and that an award of attorney\u2019s fees would be unjust. Our review of the record reveals that the district court\u2019s denial of Contreras\u2019s petition for attorney\u2019s fees was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See State of La., ex rel. Guste v. Lee, </em>853 F.2d 1219, 1221, 1224 (5th Cir.1988); <em>see also Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 435, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983); <em>U.S. v. 27.09 Acres of Land in Town of Harrison, </em>43 F.3d 769, 773-74 (2d Cir.1994). Contreras\u2019s attorney did not brief the issue that served as the basis for the remand and the attorney\u2019s efforts did nothing more than to keep Contreras\u2019s case alive. The attorney\u2019s fees were thus expended \u201cefforts that achieved no appreciable advantage;\u201d the attorney \u201cmade no contribution\u201d to the claim upon which Contreras\u2019s case was remanded; and the attorney is not entitled to fees for simply keeping the case alive to allow for the district court to reverse and remand the ALJ\u2019s decision based upon a case to which the attorney drew no attention and which may no longer require remand. <em>27.09 Acres, </em>43 F.3d at 773; <em>see Milton v. Shalala, </em>17 F.3d 812, 814 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also Frank v. Barnhart, </em>326 F.3d 618, 619 (5th Cir.2003). The Court AFFIRMS the denial of the petition for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b738-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
