For the first time on appeal, he argues that \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">As conceded by Fuentes, his challenge to the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which was not overruled by <em>Apprendi. See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Moreover, the indictment specifically charged that Fuentes had previously been convicted of an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b60-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
