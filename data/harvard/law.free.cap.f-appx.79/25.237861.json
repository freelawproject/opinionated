By moving for IFP status, Howard is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP status should not be granted on appeal because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">Howard has not shown that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 866 (5th Cir.2003). Because Howard has not shown that the district court erred in certifying that his appeal is not taken in good faith, his request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">Howard is cautioned that the district court\u2019s dismissal of this action, and this court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal, both count as \u201cstrikes\u201d pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Howard is advised that if he accumulates three strikes, he will be barred from bringing a civil action or an appeal proceeding IFP unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b56-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
