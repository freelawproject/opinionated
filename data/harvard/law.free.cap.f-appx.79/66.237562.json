Nunez\u2019s suit stemmed from the termination of her employment contract as a teacher with the El Paso Independent School District. Following the assertion of qualified immunity by the defendants, the district court dismissed the suit on the basis that Nunez had not alleged the violation of a clearly established constitutional right as she had no property interest in her continued employment as a teacher. This court affirmed the dismissal. <em>See Nunez v. Simms, </em>341 F.3d 385, 386 (5th Cir.2003). While the appeal on the merits was pending, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d), finding that Nunez\u2019s lawsuit was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-22\">Although Nunez\u2019s lawsuit and her appeal on the merits were unsuccessful, her case was not so lacking in merit that it was groundless. <em>See Nunez, </em>341 F.3d at 387-92; <em>United States v. Mississippi, </em>921 F.2d 604, 609 (5th Cir.1991). Accordingly, the district court clearly erred in finding that the lawsuit was frivolous, and abused its discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to the defendants. <em>See Mississippi, </em>921 F.2d at 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-23\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b96-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
