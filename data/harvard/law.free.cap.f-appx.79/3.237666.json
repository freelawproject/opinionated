He reasserts his argument that prison officials denied him access to the courts in violation of his constitutional rights by not providing him with certain statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-23\">Freeman fails to demonstrate a \u201crelevant actual injury\u201d stemming from the defendants\u2019 alleged unconstitutional conduct. <em>Lewis v. Casey, 518 </em>U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). The federal statutes Freeman requested, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1495 <footnotemark>**</footnotemark> and 2513, are simply not relevant to the appeal of his state conviction and come into play only after a defendant has succeeded in overturning his federal conviction and is seeking damages for wrongful conviction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1495 and 2513. Therefore, the district court did not err in dismissing Freeman\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-24\">Freeman\u2019s argument that he needed the requested statutory authority in order to do preliminary research for his federal habeas petition is raised for the first time on appeal, and this court will not review it. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). Furthermore, the statutes would likewise not be relevant to a federal habeas action, as they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>are relevant only after a defendant\u2019s federal conviction has been overturned. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1495, 2513.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir. 1996). Freeman is WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Freeman\u2019s motion for appointment of appellate counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b33-17\"> Pursuant to <em>5m Cir. R. 47.5, </em>the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b33-25\"> Although Freeman has identified 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, which relates to contract actions against the United States, as one of the statutes he requested, it is presumed that he meant to refer to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1495.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
