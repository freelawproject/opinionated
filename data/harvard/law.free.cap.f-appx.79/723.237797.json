Given that 41.04 grams of cocaine base, which has a street value of $500 an ounce, does not reflect the amount of cocaine base Flores would have to sell to earn $16,920, the amount of drugs seized did not accurately reflect the scale of Flores\u2019s offense. Thus, the district court did not err when it applied Note 12 to \u00a7 2D1.1 to convert the cash to a drug equivalent in determining Flores\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>254 F.3d 543, 544 (5th Cir. 2001); <em>United States v.
