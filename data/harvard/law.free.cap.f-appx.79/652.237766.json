Willis argues that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his complaint and that its judgment should be reversed and his case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-21\">The district court dismissed Willis\u2019 complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e because he failed to provide documentation verifying his allegations that he had exhausted his administrative remedies. As set forth in our decision in <em>Underwood v. Wilson, </em>151 F.3d 292, 296 (5th Cir.1998), however, \u201c[dismissal under \u00a7 1997e is made on pleadings without proof,\u201d and when \u201cthe plaintiff has alleged exhaustion with sufficient specificity, lack of admissible evidence in the record does not form the basis for dismissal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-22\">Here, although Willis was unable to produce a copy of his Step 2 grievance form, he specifically alleged that he exhausted both steps of the grievance procedure. In explaining why he was unable to submit a copy of the form, Willis never denied that he filed a Step 2 grievance form and offered an explanation regarding why he was unable to produce a copy of the form. Because Willis alleged exhaustion with sufficient specificity, <em>Underwood </em>requires that the district court\u2019s judgment be VACATED and the case REMANDED for further proceedings. The district court is not precluded from revisiting the exhaustion issue \u201cbased upon a response by the defendants.\u201d <em>Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 868 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-23\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined, that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
