Because Adderly had no pending challenge to his sentence and no court had ordered his resentencing, we affirm the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked jurisdiction to grant the motion for a downward departure. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
