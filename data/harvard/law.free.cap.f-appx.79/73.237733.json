Although the record does not contain written consent by the defendants to proceed before the magistrate judge as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c), we may infer their consent from the record as a whole. <em>See Roell v. Withrow, </em>538 U.S. 580, 123 S.Ct. 1696, 1701-04, 155 L.Ed.2d 775 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">In light of the violent nature of the crime for which Bejaran was being arrested (aggravated assault with a deadly weapon), as well as Bejaran\u2019s guilty-plea conviction for felony assault of Officer Cruz during the arrest at issue, the facts pleaded in Bejaran\u2019s complaint failed to show that the force used was clearly excessive to the need and the excessiveness of the force was objectively unreasonable. <em>See Ikerd v. Blair, </em>101 F.3d 430, 433-34 (5th Cir.1996). The district court did not err in dismissing Bejaran\u2019s excessive-force claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Bejaran\u2019s admission in his complaint that the prison medical staff took x-rays of his back and that Mrs. Osha gave him \u201cgeneric,\u201d \u201cmild medications\u201d refute his assertion of deliberate indifference to his medical needs. <em>See Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). Moreover, Bejaran has not shown that he faced a substantial risk of harm or that prison officials failed to take reasonable measures to abate it. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Reeves v. Collins, </em>27 F.3d 174, 176 (5th Cir.1994). Thus, the district court did not err in dismissing Bejaran\u2019s claim that he was denied medical attention at the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Bejaran\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and for summary judgment are hereby DENIED. His motion for change of venue is also DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b103-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
