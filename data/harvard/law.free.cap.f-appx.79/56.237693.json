Taylor, </em>117 F.Bd 197, 199-202 (5th Cir. 1997). Shirley argues that the district court was not correct in its perception of the primary issue in the complaint. The federal courts have a long-standing policy of abstaining from the exercise of diversity jurisdiction in cases involving intrafamily relations, including child custody actions, known as the domestic relations exception. <em>Congleton v. Holy Cross Child Placement Agency, Inc., </em>919 F.2d 1077, 1078 (5th Cir.1990). Although Shirley argues that her allegations do not place her case within this exception, the district court did not err in construing her complaint as essentially concerning the custody of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The district court\u2019s certification that Shirley\u2019s appeal is not taken in good faith is upheld, Shirley\u2019s motion for IFP is DENIED, and this appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 and n. 24.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b87-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
