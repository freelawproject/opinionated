The district court disposed of Dotson\u2019s action and the motions he filed by orders entered July 14, 2003 and September 22, 2003. Accordingly, although we grant Dotson\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny his motion to incorporate, and deny as moot his petition for mandamus relief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
