He contends that the district court erred in admitting into evidence the government\u2019s charts as summary exhibits. We have reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs and find no abuse of discretion by the district court in admitting the challenged charts. <em>See United States v. Strissel </em>920 F.2d 1162, 1163-64 (4th Cir.1990) (providing standard). Accordingly, we affirm Villanueva\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
