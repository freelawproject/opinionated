Smith pled guilty before a magistrate judge to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g), 924(a)(2) (2000). The district court sentenced Smith to a ninety-four-month prison term to be followed by three years of supervised release. Smith appeals his conviction and sentence. Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising two issues but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Smith was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-19\">Counsel first questions whether the magistrate judge properly conducted the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that there is no plain error in the plea proceeding. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 524-25 (4th Cir.) (discussing standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 899, 123 S.Ct. 200, 154 L.Ed.2d 169 (2002). The magistrate judge fully complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Smith\u2019s guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Osborne, </em>345 F.3d 281, 283 (4th Cir.2003) (No. 02-4089) (holding that taking guilty plea is permissible as \u201cadditional duty\u201d for magistrate judge and that de novo review by district court not required unless parties so demand).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-20\">Next, counsel raises as a potential issue the calculation of Smith\u2019s sentence. We find no plain error in the calculation of Smith\u2019s total offense level or criminal history category. <em>See id. </em>(stating standard of review). Further, Smith\u2019s ninety-four-month sentence is within the applicable sentencing guidelines range and is below the ten-year statutory maximum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2) (setting forth statutory maximum for violation of \u00a7 922(g)). Smith\u2019s challenge to the court\u2019s imposition of a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range does not state an appeal-able question under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) (2000). <em>United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-21\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Smith\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>lieves that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
