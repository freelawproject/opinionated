The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Davenport that failure to file timely, specific objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Davenport failed, with one exception, to file specific objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Am, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Davenport has therefore waived appellate review by failing to file specific objections after receiving proper notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">Davenport did specifically object to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation as to the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction in the underlying action. As to this claim, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1) (2000); <em>Willingham v. Morgan, </em>395 U.S. 402, 406, 89 S.Ct. 1813, 23 L.Ed.2d 396 (1969). Accordingly, we grant Davenport\u2019s motion to amend his informal brief and affirm the judgment of the district court. We deny Davenport\u2019s motions to void the judgment, for sanctions, and for an en banc hearing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
