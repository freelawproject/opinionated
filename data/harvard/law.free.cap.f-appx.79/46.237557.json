He argues that he is entitled to a reduction in sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 for his acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-24\">Section 3582(c) limits sentence modification only to certain narrow circumstances, none of which are applicable in Marion\u2019s case. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(l)(A)(on motion of Bureau of Prisons); \u00a7 3582(e)(l)(B)(clerical error or, on Government\u2019s motion, substantial assistance); \u00a7 3582(c)(2)(sentencing range subsequently lowered by Sentencing Commission). Marion\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion therefore was unauthorized and without a jurisdictional basis, and, thus, the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain it. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-25\">Marion has not demonstrated a nonfrivolous issue for appeal, and, therefore, he cannot proceed IFP. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 24(a) Because his appeal is without arguable merit, it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-26\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b76-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
