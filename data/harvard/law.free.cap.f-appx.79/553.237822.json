Yost appeals the district court\u2019s order accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to deny Social Security disability benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d), asserting (1) the ALJ erred by finding that he retained the residual functional capacity to perform a limited range of light work; (2) the ALJ erred in his weighing of the medical evidence; and (3) the ALJ erred in his credibility determination. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">We must uphold the district court\u2019s disability determination if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Hays v. Sullivan, </em>907 F.2d 1453, 1456 (4th Cir.1990). Contrary to Yost\u2019s argument, we find that the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity finding is supported by substantial evidence. The record actually contains evidence that Yost can perform the physical demands of medium work. Thus, the ALJ gave Yost the benefit of the doubt by finding that he could perform only a limited range of light work. Moreover, the ALJ imposed all of the exertional and non-exertionai limitations supported by the record. Finally, we find that Yost\u2019s activities of daily living, including caring for his dogs, watching television, visiting family and friends, attending church services, driving short distances, and occasional hunting support the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">Next, Yost argues that the ALJ erred in his weighing of the medical evidence. We disagree. Yost contends that the ALJ erred by rejecting the opinions of a case manager (\u201cGoddard\u201d) and a physical therapist (\u201cBrewer\u201d) with regard to his physical impairments. However, neither Goddard nor Brewer is an acceptable medical source under the Social Security regulations to determine whether Yost suffers a medically determinable impairment. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 1513(a) (2002). Moreover, Goddard\u2019s opinion was rendered on June 13, 1997, nearly three months after March 31, 1997, Yost\u2019s date last insured, and Brewer\u2019s opinion was rendered on July 31, 1997, exactly four months after the date Yost was last insured. Thus, the ALJ did not err by rejecting these opinions in determining Yost\u2019s disability for DIB purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">With regard to his mental impairment, Yost argues that the ALJ erred by rejecting the opinion of his treating psychiatrist, Dr. Massenburg. Again, we disagree. First, Dr. Massenburg evaluated Yost on only one occasion. Thus, he is not Yost\u2019s treating psychiatrist. Furthermore, his findings are contradicted by those of Yost\u2019s treating physician and his treating psychologist. Thus, even if Dr. Massenburg were considered Yost\u2019s treating psychiatrist, his opinion would not be entitled to controlling weight. <em>See Coffman v. Bowen, </em>829 F.2d 514, 517 (4th Cir.1987) (holding that treating physician\u2019s opinion is entitled to great weight if not contradicted by persuasive evidence). Finally, Dr. Massenburg\u2019s opinion was rendered on July 22,1997, nearly four months after the date Yost was last insured. Thus, it is not relevant to a disability determination for DIB purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Lastly, Yost argues that the ALJ erred by finding his subjective allegations of pain and their impact on his ability to work not entirely credible. This argument fails. The ALJ\u2019s credibility finding was based on inconsistent statements by Yost regarding his motivation to work, as well as the lack of objective medical evidence to support his subjective allegations. In particular, Yost stated at his hearing that he would \u201cpick up pop cans if [he could] make a living at it,\u201d but further stated that he was not willing to relocate for work. Moreover, the record reveals a lack of objective medical findings to support Yost\u2019s subjective allegations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(a) (2002); <em>see also Mickles v. Shalala, </em>29 F.3d 918, 923 (4th Cir.1994) (holding that allegations of pain, without more, are insufficient to find disability); <em>Parris v. Heckler, </em>733 F.2d 324, 327 (4th Cir.1984) (holding that subjective evidence of pain cannot take precedence over objective medical evidence or lack thereof). Yost\u2019s x-rays and MRI\u2019s were consistently normal, a physical therapist noted no correlation between Yost\u2019s subjective pain and his demonstrated physical ability upon testing, and his activities of daily living, as noted previously, further undermine such allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Yost also contends that the disability award from the West Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board as of June 13, 1997, should be considered in assessing his credibility. The standards for finding a claimant disabled under West Virginia law and under the Social Security Act are entirely different. Thus, a state award of benefits does not bind us in establishing proof of disability for DIB purposes. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1504. We therefore find that the ALJ properly evaluated Yost\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying benefits. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
