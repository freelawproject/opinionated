Dudley argues that his CCE conviction was invalid under <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999), and that, if 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 relief is not available, the district court should have recharacterized his petition as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and transferred the motion to the sentencing court in the Western District of Texas. His remaining arguments have been abandoned on appeal. <em>See Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Although Dudley could proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 if he demonstrated that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 relief was \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d under the latter statute\u2019s \u201csavings clause,\u201d he has failed to make such a showing. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 829-31 (5th Cir.2001). Moreover, as Dudley advised the district court that he had previously filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to transfer Dudley\u2019s case to the Western District of Texas. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1404, 1406; <em>Caldwell v. Palmetto State Sav. Bank, </em>811 F.2d 916, 919 (5th Cir.1987); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b759-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
