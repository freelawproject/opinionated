We find no abuse of discretion. <em>See In re Liljeberg Enters., </em>304 F.3d 410, 453 n. 113 (5th Cir .2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-18\">Insofar as Dixon contends that he has supplied the necessary documentation of exhaustion to both the Brownsville and Houston Divisions of the Southern District of Texas, neither court\u2019s docket supports that contention. Moreover, not only has Dixon failed to provide any documentary evidence in support of his motion to reopen his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit, he has never provided a more definite statement as requested by the district court. In light of the foregoing, it cannot be said that he suffered an injustice when the district court refused to reopen his case. <em>See In re Liljeberg Enters., </em>304 F.3d at 453 n. 113. The issue whether Dixon exhausted his administrative remedies is not before us; Dixon dismissed his appeal to this court from the judgment dismissing his complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See Dixon v. Scott, </em>No. 02\u201440800 (5th Cir. July 9, 2002) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-19\">Dixon\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit and is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Dixon is informed that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), <em>see Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir. 1996), and he is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-20\">APPEAL DISMISSED; THREE-STRIKES WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b656-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not. be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
