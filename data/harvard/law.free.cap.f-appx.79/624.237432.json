He argues for the first time on appeal that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional because it does not require the prior aggravated felony conviction used to increase his sentence to be alleged in the indictment and proven as an element of the offense. He argues that because the indictment did not allege his prior aggravated felony conviction, his sentence to more than two years of imprisonment and one year of supervised release is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-21\">Reyes-Rodriguez acknowledges that his arguments are foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issues for Supreme Court review in light of the decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-22\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Reyes-Rodriguez\u2019s arguments are foreclosed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b654-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
