King\u2019s notice of appeal is effective only as to the denial of post-trial motions filed under Fed. R. Crv. P. 60(b). King has shown no particularized need for transcripts at government expense because no reference to the transcripts is needed to determine that King does not advance any argument relative to the denial of those motions. <em>See Harvey v. Andrist, </em>754 F.2d 569, 571 (5th Cir.1985). The motion for transcripts is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-21\">King\u2019s motion for a restraining order pending appeal is also DENIED. Fed. R.App. P. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-22\">King has not timely appealed the dismissal of his underlying 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action, and he advances no argument relative to the denial of his post-trial motions. King\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-23\">ALL MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b661-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
