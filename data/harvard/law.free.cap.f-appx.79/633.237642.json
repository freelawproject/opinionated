Rodney Jones, prisoner #244189, is an inmate in the South Carolina Department of Corrections. Jones appeals the dismissal of his suit alleging gross negligence as frivolous. Because Jones fails to address the district court\u2019s determination that his claims are frivolous, any challenge to that determination is, therefore, deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Jones\u2019s argument that the magistrate judge had a duty to issue a report and recommendation after service on the defendant is without merit inasmuch as the district court was not required to appoint a magistrate judge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636. Accordingly, the instant appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-21\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of the present case and this court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal count as two strikes against Jones for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); <em>see, e.g., Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Jones is WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b663-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
