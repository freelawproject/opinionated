Lee argues on appeal that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized both incident to a warrantless arrest and as the result of a search of his residence pursuant to a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>The district court correctly determined that officers entered Lee\u2019s hotel room to arrest him upon the voluntary consent of a third party with actual or apparent authority to consent. <em>See United States v. Jaras, </em>86 F.3d 383, 389 (5th Cir.1996). The district court was also correct in its determination that the search of Lee\u2019s residence was based upon objectively reasonable, good-faith reliance upon a search warrant. <em>See United States v. Satterwhite, </em>980 F.2d 317, 320 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b752-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
