The district court granted Hudler a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the issue whether Hudler is entitled to the benefit of the doctrine of equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-22\">Hudler argues that the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to stay the one-year limitations period of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) led him to believe that he would be permitted to file an out-of-time 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. Hudler has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that the order did not provide grounds for equitable tolling. <em>See Molo v. Johnson, </em>207 F.3d 773, 775 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Patterson, </em>211 F.3d at 932. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-23\">The remaining issues raised by Hudler in his appellate brief exceed the scope of the COA. As Hudler has not requested an expansion of the COA grant, this court will not consider those issues. <em>See Lackey v. Johnson, </em>116 F.3d 149, 151 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b704-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
