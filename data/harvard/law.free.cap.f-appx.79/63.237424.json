R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion. Richardson contends that he is entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(3) &amp; (6), because Lieutenant Mike Lightsey allegedly gave perjured summary judgment affidavit testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-22\">Even if Richardson\u2019s assertions of perjury were accepted as true, we would set aside the judgment only if we found that Lightsey\u2019s actions precluded Richardson from \u201cfully and fairly presenting] [his] case.\u201d <em>See Diaz v. Methodist Hospital, </em>46 F.3d 492, 497 (5th Cir.1995) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Richardson made the same allegations during the summary judgment proceedings, and, therefore, Richardson was not prevented from \u201cfully and fairly present[ing][his] case.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Moreover, the issue whether Lightsey perjured himself was immaterial to the resolution of his appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 relief. <em>See Richardson v. One Black Female, </em>64 Fed.Appx. 418 (5th Cir.2003) (unpublished). Richardson has therefore not shown an abuse of discretion on the part of the district court. <em>See Diaz, </em>46 F.3d at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Richardson\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Richardson is informed that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; THREE-STRIKES WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b93-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir, R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
