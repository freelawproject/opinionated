Petitioners contend that the BIA\u2019s decision offered no specific reasons for upholding the IJ\u2019s decision and, therefore, was insufficient to deny relief and to provide a basis for this court\u2019s review. We have previously held that the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedures do not deprive the court of a basis for judicial review and do not violate due process. <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003). Therefore, the petitioner\u2019s argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Petitioners also contend that any mixed motivation to harm Tzoc should have been construed in their favor and that the IJ erred in concluding that Tzoc could have relocated within Guatemala. These issues lack merit and in any event were not raised before the BIA and hence have not been administratively exhausted. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Finally, petitioners assert that the BIA\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. After reviewing the record and the briefs, we conclude that the decision is supported by substantial evidence and that the evidence in the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302-04 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b760-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
