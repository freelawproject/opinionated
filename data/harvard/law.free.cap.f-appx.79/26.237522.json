He argues that the Government improperly relied on his prior deportation as an element of his offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 because that prior deportation was the result of a due process violation. Because the district court was without authority to modify the imposed term, the denial of the motion for a sentence reduction is AFFIRMED. <em>See United States v. Bridges, </em>116 F.3d 1110, 1112 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b57-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
