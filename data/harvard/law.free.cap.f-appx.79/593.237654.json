Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-24\">In 2001, William Hewlett pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1344 and 2 (2000). The district court sentenced him to time served and imposed a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-25\">In November 2002, Hewlett\u2019s probation officer filed a petition to revoke supervised release based on several violations of the conditions of Hewlett\u2019s supervised release. At his revocation hearing, Hewlett admitted to the violations. The district court then found that Hewlett had committed the alleged violations and revoked Hewlett\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-26\">Because Hewlett\u2019s underlying offense is a Class B felony, the statute mandates that the term of imprisonment imposed upon the revocation of supervised release not exceed three years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000). Pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a) (2002), the suggested imprisonment range for a defendant with Hewlett\u2019s criminal history category coupled with his supervised release violations is five to eleven months. The Chapter 7 policy statements, however, are non-binding. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995). After consideration of the applicable policy statements and the relevant factors, a district court has the discretion to sentence a defendant outside the suggested guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 639 n. 1, 642-43. The record reflects that the court considered both the policy statements and the relevant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-27\">Because Hewlett\u2019s sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum term set forth in \u00a7 3583(e) and there is no applicable binding sentencing guideline, we review the sentence only to determine whether it is \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3742(a)(4), 3742(e)(4) (2000). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Given the facts of this case, we cannot say that a twenty-four month sentence is plainly unreasonable. Therefore, we affirm Hewlett\u2019s sentence. Because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court, Hewlett\u2019s motion for oral argument is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
