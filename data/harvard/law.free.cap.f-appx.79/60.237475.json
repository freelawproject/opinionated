Herrington, appointed to represent Jose Daniel Cordova-Munoz (\u201cCordova-Munoz\u201d), has requested leave to withdraw and has filed a brief as required by <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Cordova-Munoz has filed a response. He contends that the district court was unaware that it had the authority to grant a downward departure and that the sentencing enhancements in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) &amp; (b)(2) are unconstitutional based on the holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-22\">Cordova-Munoz knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence except if his punishment exceeded the statutory maximum, if the district court upwardly departed from the applicable sentencing guidelines range, or if there were any mathematical errors in his sentencing. <em>United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292 (5th Cir.1994). Cordova-Munoz thus waived the right to raise the argument regarding the district court\u2019s failure to grant a downward departure, and his argument regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)(1) &amp; (b)(2) is foreclosed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number><em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Our independent review of the brief, the record, and Cordova-Munoz\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">MOTION GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b90-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
