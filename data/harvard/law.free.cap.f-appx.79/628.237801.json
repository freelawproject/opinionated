Rivera appeals his guilty-plea conviction for possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. In his sole argument on appeal, Rivera challenges the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir. 2000); however, he raises the issue in order to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Rivera\u2019s argument regarding the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is indeed foreclosed by <em>Slaughter, </em>which specifically rejected the argument that <em>Apprendi </em>rendered 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 facially unconstitutional. <em>Id. </em>This court is bound by its precedent absent an intervening Supreme Court decision or a subsequent en banc decision. <em>See United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, Rivera\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b658-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
