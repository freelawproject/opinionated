GARZA, Circuit Judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">In this appeal we review the district court\u2019s decision granting Defendants\u2014Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff\u2014Appellant, Lawrence Alford\u2019s (hereinafter, \u201cAlford\u201d), claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. For the following reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b720-13\">On December 17, 1998, Alford was involved in an altercation with another prisoner, Rodney James (hereinafter, \u201cJames\u201d), in which Alford stabbed James. Shortly after the altercation, Alford began reporting to prison officials that James was threatening him. On December 29, 1998, Alford wrote a letter to DefendantsAppellees, Kelly Ward, Ray Hanson, and Jamie Fussell (hereinafter collectively, \u201cprison officials\u201d), informing them of James\u2019 threats and requesting a transfer to another facility. Alford also filed an administrative grievance regarding the threats. Prison officials responded to Alford\u2019s complaints by stating that because Alford was on extended lockdown and was escorted by security each time he was out of his cell block, he was as safe as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-18\">On May 21, 2001, Alford was told that he was being assigned to the another cell block because he was leaving lockdown. At that time, Alford did not inform security personnel of his need for protection from James or file a written request pursuant to the prison facility\u2019s internal protection procedures. On May 23, 2001, Alford was placed in the same cell block as James, where James attacked and injured Alford. Alford subsequently filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that prison officials failed to uphold their Eighth Amendment duty to protect him from another inmate. The district court granted Defendant-Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, ruling that prison officials had not been advised of Alford\u2019s safety concerns in the two years prior to the housing assignment and attack. The court concluded that prison officials did not exhibit deliberate indifference towards Alford\u2019s safety. This appeal timely followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-20\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b720-21\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Stults v. Conoco, Inc., </em>76 F.3d 651, 654 (5th Cir.1996). Summary judgment is proper if, viewing the facts in favor of the nonmovant, there is no genuine issue of material fact. FED. R. CIV. P 56(c). All inferences that can be made from the facts are made in favor of the nonmovant. <em>Anderson v. Liberty </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number><em>Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Prison officials have a duty under the Eighth Amendment to protect inmates from violence at the hands of other inmates. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 833, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). But not every injury suffered by one inmate at the hands of another inmate gives rise to constitutional liability for prison officials. <em>Id. </em>at 834. Prison officials violate the Eighth Amendment when: 1) the inmate shows that he is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm, and 2) prison officials act with deliberate indifference. <em>Id. </em>at 834; <em>Neals v. Norwood, </em>59 F.3d 530, 532 (5th Cir.1995). Prison officials act with deliberate indifference when they know of and disregard an excessive risk to an inmate\u2019s health or safety. <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 837. The prison official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and they must also draw that inference. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Alford\u2019s summary judgment evidence is insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether prison officials acted with deliberate indifference when they transferred Alford to the same cell block as his assailant. The latest documented complaint of James\u2019 threats was on December 29, 1999. One and one-half years passed between Alford\u2019s last documented complaint and the transfer. The failure by prison officials to remember Alford\u2019s complaints and perceive a risk is not sufficient to support Alford\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim. <em>Id. </em>at 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">rv.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-14\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
