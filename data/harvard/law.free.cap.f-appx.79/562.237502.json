We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-20\">We review dismissals under \u00a7 1915A de novo. <em>See Veney v. Wyche, </em>293 F.3d 726, 730 (4th Cir.2002). The district court dismissed Billups\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous because it had previously dismissed a claim filed by him based on the same issues and brought against the same defendants. <em>See Billups v. Lofton, </em>03-CV-71 (E.D. Va. Feb 3, 2003). Billups did not appeal the disposition of this earlier dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-21\">We find that Billups\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim is barred by the applicable two-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions in Virginia. <em>See Harvey v. Horan, </em>278 F.3d 370, 384 (4th Cir.2002); <em>see also </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01-243. Moreover, his claims of negligence on the part of the defendants do not support recovery under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Baynard v. Malone, </em>268 F.3d 228, 236 (4th Cir.2001); <em>see also Grayson v. Peed, </em>195 F.3d 692, 695 (4th Cir.1999). Thus, we find that the district court\u2019s dismissal under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) was proper, and we affirm the district court\u2019s order on the modified grounds noted herein. We also deny Billups\u2019s motions for oral argument and for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
