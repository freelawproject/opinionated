As an initial matter, Canady\u2019s motions to supplement, which request that the record be supplemented with documents already part of the record on appeal, are DENIED. His motion to file a supplemental reply brief is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Canady argues that he was denied a speedy trial. Although the 17-month delay is \u201cpresumptively prejudicial,\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>995 F.2d 556, 560 (5th Cir.1993), and Canady timely asserted his right to a speedy trial, our review of the record reveals that Canady failed to satisfy the other factors (reason for the delay and resulting prejudice) announced in <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 515, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972). <em>See Nelson v. Hargett, </em>989 F.2d 847, 852 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>Cowart v. Hargett, </em>16 F.3d 642, 647 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b752-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
