Vasquez alleged that Casarez filed disciplinary charges against him in retaliation for a complaint Vasquez alleged against Casarez. The district court, adopting the recommendations of a magistrate judge, dismissed Vasquez\u2019s action on the grounds that he failed to properly exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, the district court concluded that, although Vasquez administratively raised due process arguments, he never presented his claim of retaliation to the prison grievance process.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Vasquez, however, alleged in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation that he specifically exhausted his retaliation claims by filing the requisite forms in accordance with the grievance procedures established by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Although he did not provide the court with copies of the forms, he nonetheless alleged with \u201csufficient specificity\u201d that he exhausted his claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the defendant presented no evidence disputing the plaintiff\u2019s assertion, there does not appear to be a proper basis at this time for dismissal for failure to exhaust. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is VACATED, and Vasquez\u2019s claims are REMANDED to the district court for further consideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b666-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
