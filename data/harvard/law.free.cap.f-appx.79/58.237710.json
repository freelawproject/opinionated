RodriguezQuintana contends that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) define separate offenses. He argues that the prior conviction that resulted in his increased sentence is an element of a separate offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) that should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>alleged in Ms indictment. Rodr\u00edguez-Quintana maintains that he pleaded grnlty to an mdictment wMeh charged oMy simple reentry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). He argues that Ms sentence exceeds the term of imprisonment and supervised release which may be imposed for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 </em>U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the enhanced penalties m 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are sentencmg provisions, not elements of separate offenses. The Court further held that the sentencmg provisions do not violate the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 239-47. Rodriguez-Qumtana acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>but asserts that the decision has been cast into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He seeks to preserve Ms argument for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cuMess and until the Supreme Court itself determmes to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (mternal quotation marks and citation omitted).
