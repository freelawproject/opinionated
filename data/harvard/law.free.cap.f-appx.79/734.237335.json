Ali argues that the BIA erred by upholding the IJ\u2019s determination that he had failed to demonstrate that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that his life or freedom would be threatened because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, if he were returned to Pakistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-24\">When the BIA, as here, adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of review applies to the IJ\u2019s factual determinations, while questions of law are reviewed <em>de novo. Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002). The substantial-evidence standard requires only that the decision have some basis in fact in the record and does not require this court to agree with the decision. <em>Renteria-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>322 F.3d 804, 816 (5th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-25\">Substantial evidence support\u2019s the IJ\u2019s determination that Ali was not subjected to past persecution in that neither of two 1999 incidents described by Ali was directly connected to his political opinion. <em>See Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 906; <em>Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-26\">Ali has abandoned any contention made under the United Nations Convention Against Torture by failing to brief such claim in his petition for review. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-27\">Ali\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b764-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
