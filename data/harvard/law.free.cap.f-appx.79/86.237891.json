Challenger argues that the district court erred in enhancing his base offense level by two after finding that some of his victims were \u201cvulnerable vic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>tims\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l). The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level increase in the base offense level \u201c[i]f the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l). \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines <em>de novo; </em>we review a finding of unusual vulnerability for clear error and to determine whether the district court\u2019s conclusion was plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>119 F.3d 1205, 1218 (5th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The district court\u2019s determination that Challenger knew or should have known that some of his victims were vulnerable victims was \u201cplausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). It was not clear error for the district court to enhance Challenger\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l). <em>See United States v. Scurlock, </em>52 F.3d 531, 541-42 (5th Cir. 1995); <em>see also United States v. Brown, </em>7 F.3d 1155, 1160-61 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Accordingly, Challenger\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b116-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
