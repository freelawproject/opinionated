His sole contention is that the district court erred when it did not sentence him to the low end of the Guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-22\">With respect to imprisonment after violation of supervised release, the Guidelines Manual sets forth \u201cpolicy statements only.\u201d <em>See </em>Guidelines Manual, Chapter 7, Pt. A, \u00b6 1. Thus, this court will uphold Cornelison\u2019s sentence unless it is in violation of law or plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Pena, </em>125 F.3d 285, 287 (5th Cir.1997). The argument that a sentence promulgated after probation revocation is in error because it is not at the low end of the Guideline range is foreclosed by our holding in <em>United States v. Teran, </em>98 F.3d 831, 836 (5th Cir.1996), in which we held that there are no applicable Guidelines for sentencing after revocation of probation. <em>See Pena, </em>125 F.3d at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-23\">The district court implicitly considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Pena, </em>125 F.3d at 286-87. Additionally, Cornelison\u2019s original offense, possession with intent to distribute amphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), is a Class C felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). A defendant whose supervised release term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>is revoked may not be required to serve more than two years in prison if the charge that resulted in the term of supervised release is a Class C felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Thus, the 24-month sentence did not exceed the maximum provided by statute and was therefore legal. <em>See Pena, </em>125 F.3d at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b32-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
