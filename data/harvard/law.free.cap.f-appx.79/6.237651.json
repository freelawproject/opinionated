Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). In his complaint, Castellano alleged that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his future safety when they effectively labeled him a snitch and failed to protect him against future harm by continually assigning him to units where it was known that he was a snitch.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-17\">The district court did not err in dismissing Castellano\u2019s complaint as frivolous. Castellano\u2019s failure-to-protect claim fails because he concedes that he suffered no actual physical injury resulting from the prison officials\u2019 purported failure to protect. <em>See Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 326 (5th Cir.1999). Castellano\u2019s transfer to a different prison unit also rendered moot his claim for injunctive relief. <em>See Cooper v. Sheriff Lubbock County, Tex., </em>929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-18\">Castellano\u2019s appeal from the dismissal of his complaint lacks arguable merit, and the district court did not err in finding that the instant appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983) (lack of nonfrivolous issue on appeal precludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>finding of \u201cgood faith\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 and Fed. R.App. P. 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Accordingly, Castellano\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of Castellano\u2019s appeal as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Castellano that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b37-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
