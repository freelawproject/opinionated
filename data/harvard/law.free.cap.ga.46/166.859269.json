Parker, plaintiff in error <em>vs. </em>The Fulton Loan and Building Association, defendant in error.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b166-11\">Where a suit to recover usury paid was brought against a Loan and Building Association, chartered by the Superior Court in favor of one who had been a member and borrower, and who failing to comply with the rules, as to the payment of his monthly dues, had, by way of settlement, conveyed to the company certain real estate at an agreed price in full discharge of his obligations aud it appeared in proof that the company consisted of two thousand shares ; that $1 00 per month was to be paid upon each share until the accumulations should make each share worth $200 00 ; that the monthly receipts were to be used in advancing to the shareholders on their ultimate interest at such rates of premium as the money might bring at auction, and that each shareholder, taking an advance, was to pay $1 00 extra upon each share advanced upon, giving a real estate mortgage to secure the performance by him of his agreement to pay his dues as the constitution of the company required:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b166-12\"><em>Meld, </em>1. That the contract of a member taking an advance according to the rules, was not usurious <em>upon its face, </em>whatever might be the premium at which he agreed to take the advance.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b166-13\">2. Whether such a contract, though <em>legal </em>upon its face, was, in fact, illegal, would depend upon the object of the association. If it were, in truth, a mere devise to evade the usury laws, then it would be illegal, if in fact more was taken for the use of money than seven per cent, per annum. But if the organization were in fact and <em>bona fide </em>a plan with the real intent and object of \u201c accumulating a fund by monthly subscriptions or savings of the members thereof, to assist them in procuring for themselves such real estate as they may deem proper,\u201d then it would not be illegal; and this being a question of fact, depending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>upon evidence, it was proper for the Judge to leave it to the finding of the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b167-5\">3. When no other facts appear to the jury, by the proof, going to show the object of such an association than the Constitution, and the contract made in accordance therewith, a verdict of the jury that the contract is not illegal, is not only supported by, but is required by the evidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b167-6\">4. If a contract claimed by one of the parties to be usurious and by the other not, is compromised and settled between them, the question of dispute as to the usury, forming a distinct item of the settlement, this is an accord and satisfaction even as to the usury, and the money paid cannot be recovered back, but a mere compromise and settlement of the debt without a distinct reference to the dispute as to the illegality of the contract is not a bar to a suit to recover back the usury paid.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b167-7\">5. This Court will reluctantly interfere with the discretion of the Judge below in his direction of the business of the Court, and never unless manifest injustice have come to the party complaining.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-8\">Loan and Building Associations. Usury. Accord and satisfaction. Practice. Before Judge Hopkins. Fulton Superior Court. October Term, 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-9\">Andrew M. Parker brought assumpsit against the Fulton Loan and Building Association, a corporate body incorporated by an order of the Superior Court of Fulton county, th declaration containing substantially the following allegations: That said Association is indebted to plaintiff in the sum of $4,605 75 as principal debt, with interest on the same from March 8th, 1868, for so much money by the said plaintiff paid, laid out and expended to and for the use of the said defendant, and at its special instance and request, the said sum of money having been paid to said defendant as usurious interest for the use of money over and above the legal rate of interest. The declaration contained a second count for $4,605 75 money had and received by the defendant for plaintiff\u2019s use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-10\">The defendant pleaded the general issue, and that if plaintiff ever had any demand against said defendant, the same has been by accord and satisfaction, settled and adjusted between defendant and plaintiff, by the purchase of a certain house and lot by defendant from plaintiff at a price agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>on between the parties, and on payment of the balance of $740 00 by defendant to plaintiff, all matters in dispute between them were by such accord settled and determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-5\">The following evidence was introduced uponj the trial: Plaintiff testified that he joined the defendant, and took a few shares of stock. His object in joining was to borrow money from it, knowing that no one could borrow money without having stock to pledge as collateral. As he wished to borrow, from time to time, he got more stock through J. R. Wallace, sometimes paying him par and sometimes a little over par; told Wallace when he wished him to get him stock that he wished to buy it and borrow on it; at various times from September 13th, 1866, to March 8th, 1868, he got money from defendant; first got $190; bid it off at eighty-one per cent; the last gotten was $740 on a settlement in part payment for the land which he conveyed to defendant. He does not remember the dates nor amounts of the several separate loans received from defendant, but the total received by him amouuted, in principal and legal interest on it to 8th of March, 1868, to something over $5,000, and paid them back various sums at dates and in amounts not remembered, aggregating, with legal interest added up to 8th March, 1868, to something over $9,000, leaving a balance over paid of $3,398. On said settlement defendant paid him $740 cash, and he conveyed to defendant property valued on the settlement at $6,500 in settlement of defendant\u2019s demands against him. The payments were in consideration of the money he had gotten from defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-6\"><em>Cross-examined: </em>When hejoined defendant, he was furnished with a printed copy of its constitution and by-laws, and a certificate of stock; each stockholder had to pay $1 00 per share per month on his stock, and a fine of ten cents for failure, whether such stockholder had borrowed or not, and $1 00 per share per month was paid by him to keep his stock; this stock was like any other stock so liable, on market, for fluctuating prices; when a loan was made, one dollar per month on each share bid off had to be paid for interest, and ten cents on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>per month on failure to pay it; when payments were made, defendant\u2019s treasurer gave receipts showing the amount paid itemized. Plaintiff made up the account sued on from said receipts and other data in his possession; cannot remember any sums or the dates, except the first and the last, but knows that the aggregate is about as aforesaid; there is one error in said account, attached to the declaration of $1,200, in my favor, in one place, and some smaller and immaterial errors in calculations. Money kept up so high in the Association that, at any time within a year from the first borrowing by plaintiff, he could have paid back the identical sum received by him, and gotten his mortgages discharged, and had his stock reinstated, and gotten the accumulation on his stock; the money would thus have cost him no interest; at any time after that, he could have paid back what he had borrowed, <em>plus </em>such sum as, at the then rating rate of premium, would have made a mortgage by some other person equal to his, and gotten his mortgage released, and his stock pledged as collateral also released, and the accumulation on his stock would have exactly equaled the sum required by the Association to be paid in by him. This is not only so theoretically, but plaintiff knows it to be so practically. Had plaintiff kept his whole contract, he would have made, by the accumulation on stock, just what he would have lost by paying the installments required, but he had not the money with which to pay up according to his contract, and for that reason, lost by the contract. On the 8th of March, 1868, he had failed to pay, for five months, his monthly dues, then $200 per month; he then had a settlement with J. R. Wallace, who was acting for the company, and in that settlement all the items on the bill of particulars sued on were taken into consideration and passed upon. On that day, plaintiff agreed upon the settlement according to the paper exhibit. Defendant then bought plaintiff\u2019s stock, as therein shown, paid him $740 cash, and gave up all his mortgages and transferred his stock to defendant, and thus had a full settlement of all their but in that settlement was said about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>but plaintiff knew what their claim was, and on what account their claim was, what he had gotten and what he had paid ; had been a member of such an association before, and was familiar with all its operations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-5\"><em>Re-direct: </em>Being unable to raise money to pay his monthly dues of $200 per month, for five months, and monthly fines of ten per cent, on the dues, and defendant threatening to sue him, he made said settlement to prevent suit. The average premium on all money borrowed by him was seventy-six per cent. Defendant began business in June, 1866. The amount of cash obtained depended on premium bid. Mortgage for any number of shares bid off was for $200 per share, without reference to the sum of money actually gotten. The amount procured was ascertained by deducting the price bid from $100 and doubling the remainder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-6\">Here plaintiff closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-7\">Defendant introduced J. R. Wallace, who testified as follows: All the stock of the Association was taken (he first night. Parker did get him to buy stock for him, and this he did as he bought other things on commission; he isa real estate dealer, purchaser and seller of stocks, etc. Defendant authorized him to settle with Parker, and he made the settlement; the basis of it was as shown by the paper shown him; it is signed by Parker. That settlement was in full of all difference between the parties. Defendant\u2019s board of directors had often discussed whether a borrower could successfully plead usury, and, while he is not certain, thinks he and plaintiff spoke of it before settling; he, acting for the company, thought the settlement covered usury, if there was any in the transaction. Nominally, the defendant held plaintiff\u2019s obligations for near $20,000, but plaintiff knew that that was but nominal, and that he was only required to pay his installments. Defendant was well posted about the operations of the Association. The real estate priced in the settlement at $6,500 was not then worth more than $5,000; the building on it was very inferior, and property was dull; it was then leased out, and there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>some liens on it; Parker secured them against these liens by a mortgage on his Broad street property, and afterwards paid off the liens. About six months after the settlement, defendant sold said property for $6,500. Property had increased in value; has often seen a greater increase in six months in Atlanta. Defendant had paid $120 taxes on it, meanwhile. The paper shown was written by witness, except that Parker signed it. What plaintiff got, and what he had paid, witness did not know. Under the usual operations of such an association, it would reach the end contemplated, <em>i. </em>e., when each share would be worth $200, less forty per cent., in sixty-six months from its organization.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-4\">Defendant then put in evidence said paper, which was as follows.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-5\">\u201cAtlanta, March 17th, 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>M.

Nothing was said about usury then, or before, to him, and the matter of usury was not covered by that settlement. He had not demanded any deduction from defendant\u2019s claims on the ground of usury. The written proposition was the only one ever made by defendant to him for a settlement, and contains all the matters settled. He did not then know that he had any claim for usury against defendant. He thought the settlement a hard one, but supposed defendant had the advantage of him, and that he could do no better. He had complained of the ambiguity of one article of the constitution, by which a borrower upon settling, as he was, met with harder terms than he might anticipate, but yielded to defendant on that point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-11\">His property was worth $6,500 and more, in cash, at the time he conveyed it to defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-12\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant.

Because the verdict of the jury is strongly and decidedly against the weight of the evidence and unsupported by the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-5\">2d. Because the verdict is contrary to law, equity and justice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-6\">3d. Because the Court erred in refusing to allow plaintiff to show his pecuniary condition and monetary necessities at the time he obtained the money from defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-7\">4th. Because the Court erred in refusing to allow plaintiff's counsel to place in the hands of plaintiff, when on the stand as a witness, the bill of particulars annexed to the declaration for the purpose of enabling plaintiff to refresh his memory as to the dates and amounts of the items thereof, after plaintiff had stated he could not, from mere memory, state the dates and amounts of most of said items.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-8\">5th. Because the Court erred in permitting J. E. Wallace when on the stand as a witness for defendant, over the objection of plaintiff, to testify as to the value of the real estate conveyed by plaintiff to defendant, in pursuance of the settlement of March the 8th, 1868, with the view of showing said real estate to have been worth less than the price agreed upon by the parties at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-9\">6th. Because the Court erred in charging the jury \u201cThat the papers which have been submitted to you in this case do not show a usurious contract, but the contract, as shown by the papers, is not usurious. Look at all the circumstances and see if the contract, as shown by the papers, was made in good faith ; if so, the transaction is not usurious. If you should find that the contract was not an artifice resorted to for the purpose of concealing the true character of the transaction, then the plaintiff could not recover; but if you believe the contract was an artifice or contrivance designed to conceal the true nature of the transaction, then plaintiff would be entitled to recover the usury paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-10\">7th. Because the Court erred.in charging the jury thus: \u201cIf the contract was that plaintiff was to obtain money, and it was contemplated that in a certain contingency that might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>arise, Parker might not have to pay more than principal and legal interest, then it is not usury; each took his chance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Anr\">8th. Because the Court erred in charging the jury thus: \u201cIf there had been transactions between the parties and they met together and, by agreement, plaintiff conveyed real estate to defendant for the purpose of paying defendant\u2019s demand, also to obtain, as part purchase money of the land, a further sum of money, which real estate defendant received in satisfaction of defendant\u2019s demand, and defendant paid to plaintiff the balance of the estimated value of the land in money, plaintiff could not recover in this action unless before suit commenced defendant had converted said land into money by sale.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-5\">9th. Because the Court erred in charging the jury thus <em>\\ </em>\u201cIf the jury find that there was an adjustment between the parties, mortgages and notes given up by defendant, and land conveyed by plaintiff in pursuance of that adjustment, and in that adjustment all the money paid by Parker was taken into consideration directly or indirectly, that ends the matter; whether it was called usury or not makes no difference, such would be an accord and satisfaction.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-6\">10th. Because the Court erred in refusing to charge the jury as requested in writing by plaintiff\u2019s counsel as follows, to-wit: \u201cThe subsequent taking of more than lawful interest is presumptive evidence of an original usurious contract.\u201d 11th. Because the Court erred in refusing to charge the jury as requested in writing by plaintiff\u2019s counsel as follows, to-wit: \u201c There must be a usurious intention or there is no usury <em>\u2022 </em>but if one makes a bargain for more than legal interest, believing that he has a right to make such a bargain or that the law gives him all that he claims, this is a mistake of law and does not save the party from the effect of usury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AuN\">12th. Because the Court erred in refusing to charge the jury as requested, in writing, by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, as follows, to-wit: \u201cIf the jury believe, from the evidence, that plaintiff conveyed to defendant real estate in payment of the demand then held by defendant against plaintiff, and the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>real estate was received as payment by defendant, then such payment would have the same effect in this case as if so much money had been paid and received.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-5\">13th. Because the Court erred in refusing to charge as requested by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in writing, as follows, to-wit: \u201c That the price of the real estate, so conveyed and received, which the parties placed upon it was binding upon them in this suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-6\">14th. Because the Court erred in refusing to give to the jury, as requested, in writing, by plaintiff\u2019s counsel^ the following charge, to-wit: <em>\u201cA </em>settlement does not necessarily amount to a compromise, nor to an aceord and satisfaction; there may be a settlement without a compromise, or without accord and satisfaction.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-7\">15th. Because the Court erred in refusing to charge the jury as requested, in writing, by the counsel for plaintiff, as follows, to-wit: \u201cTo sustain the plea of accord and satisfaction in this case, it must appear from the evidence, to the satisfaction of the jury, that the matter of usury was in controversy between both plaintiff and defendant at the time of settlement, and that the same was taken in and actually settled between the parties, and that, in and by said settlement, some advantage, legal or equitable, enured to plaintiff. If the matter of usury was not, on the part of each party, intentionally settled and adjusted in said settlement, then such settlement is no aceord and satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s claim for usury, sued for in this action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-8\">16th. Because the Court erred in refusing to charge as requested, in writing, by plaintiff\u2019s counsel: \u201cThat there is no special form or expression necessary to constitute a usurious bargain. If the intention is, substantially, that one should loan his money to another, who shall therefor, in any manner whatever, pay to the lender more than legal interest, it is a case of usury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-9\">17th. Because the Court erred in refusing to charge the jury, as requested, in writing, by plaintiff\u2019s counsel: \u201c That if the jury should believe, from the evidence, that the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>tract between the parties was usurious, and that the matter of usury was not compromised in any settlement, then plaintiff would be entitled to recover the amount, whatever it is, which the evidence shows plaintiff paid defendant over and above the principal borrowed and legal interest thereon, to time of payment, with interest on said excess from the date of the payment of said excess.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-5\">18th. Because the Court erred in refusing to charge the jury as requested, in writing, by plaintiff\u2019s counsel: <em>\u201c </em>That if the jury should believe, from the evidence, that, at the time of settlement, defendant\u2019s demand exceeded principal and lawful interest, and plaintiff settled with defendant without setting up any objection of usury or claim of usury, such settlement would not bar plaintiff\u2019 from afterwards suing for and recovering the usury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-6\">19th.

Was the Court, construing the papers as they were presented, without other testimony, wrong in saying that the contract was not usurious in form ? We think this contract on its face to be a mere sale by the plaintiff of his right to a share in the ultimate division of the accumulations. That is clearly the <em>form </em>of the contract. The plaintiff was the owner of stock or shares; they paid nothing, and were to pay nothing, until the accumulations amounted to a certain sum, when, as is the result of the provision for winding up, that sum was to be divided between such of the shareholders as had not sold. Having such shares, the plaintiff <em>sold </em>them to the company, the company advancing him a certain sum of money and he binding himself to do certain other things. That is clearly the <em>form </em>of the contract. It is not a loaning of money at all, nor is it forbearance for the use of money, but a sale of certain shares of stock in the company to the company. We do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>not, at present, mean that beneath this form, apparently legal, there may not lurk a device for covering up usury; we only say that, upon the face of the contract, it is simply a sale of the plaintiff\u2019s stock to the company, at such a price as he saw fit to take and the company to give, and that is all. If there is usury, it is concealed, covered up; the contract does not indicate it. The plaintiff was a subscriber to the stock; he had paid in a portion of his assessments, and he agreed to sell out his stock, or, rather, to sell out to the company his interest in the final dividend.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">It must be remembered that the evidence shows <em>two </em>contracts: one is the <em>taking </em>of the stock and the contract to pay for it, monthly, as stipulated; and the other is the <em>sale </em>of it. They were not cotemporaneous; one was complete without the other. The taking of the stock, and the obligations then assumed, were not dependent at all upon the sale. The plaintiff might or might not sell. Doubtless, some of the stockholders will not sell. It is not a part of the stock contract that they shall sell. It is at their option. The contract, as stockholder, is a separate, independent thing, complete in itself, and, with all its obligations, is prior to, and in no necessary way has anything to do with the subsequent contract of sale. A stockholder, who had paid ten monthly installments, might certainly have sold to a stranger \u2014 one who was not a stockholder \u2014 all his interest in the company, contracting, at the same time, that he would continue to pay the monthly installments, as they fell due, and, no matter how low the price, or at how great a sacrifice he sold, there would be nothing in the <em>form </em>of the contract to show usury. In other words, as the facts in the record show, the plaintiff subscribed for a certain number of shares in the stock of the company. By the terms of that subscription, he was to pay, monthly, on each share, a certain sum until the accumulations should reach a fixed figure, when the assets were to be divided among the stockholders then holding stock. There was no usury or illegality here, but only a simple subscription for stock, with the obligation to pay according to the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>the contract. The subscriber becomes the owner of the stock as he would be the owner of-any other stock subscribed for. \"Why may lie not sell it as he may other stock, to a stranger or to the company, and contract that the purchaser shall have it, free from any liability to calls or monthly payments ? This is the stock contract, and it is a legal, natural contract on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Having made this contract, the stockholder has his option to keep it or to sell it, to hold on for his final division, or to sell for what he may deem its present worth in cash, he contracting to keep the purchaser harmless from the demand for monthly payments. This second contract, this sale, is purely optionary. The stockholder may make it or not, and for this reason this contract of sale has no necessary connection with the subscription. The contract of sale on his part is simply that he will pay $1,00 per share extra each month, and will comply with his original undertaking. There is absolutely nothing in either of these two contracts, upon <em>the face of them, </em>that is usurious, and we see no error in the Court so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Whether the scheme, taken as a whole, is or is not a device to avoid the usury laws, is a question of fact for the jury under the proof. The Court so charged the jury, and the finding is in effect that it was not such a device. We think the jury found rightly under the evidence. As we have shown there is nothing in the form of the contract, nothing on its face, to make it usurious. Was this form a mere trick or device by which to hide or cloak the real intent?</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The object of the Association is, as expressed in the articles, to enable the members to acquire, by the payment of small sums monthly, houses and homes. The whole affair is simply this: A certain number of persons agree among themselves that they will each advance, to make up a fund, a certain sum monthly; that each will bind himself to continue to make that monthly advance until the gross value of the whole fund shall amount to a certain agreed sum, when it shall be divided among those who have continued to pay and have not sold out their interest. Having thus secured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>a monthly fund and arranged for its continuance, it is further agreed that at each monthly meeting the money on hand shall be employed in buying up the interest \"of any stockholder who may be willing to sell any of his stock, the seller continuing his regular monthly payments, and paying also, each month, one dollar for each share he has sold. <em>Whenever </em>the accumulation on hand \u2014 whether derived from regular monthly payments or from profits thus made by the purchase of the stock \u2014 reaches a certain per cent., the whole affair winds up. The monthly payments cease, and the money on hand is divided to the stockholders who remain. It must be added, also, that each stockholder, when he sells to the company his ultimate interest, still retains his right to vote and act as a member. Now, as we have said, there is nothing, either in the form or in the nature of the contract of subscription, or in the contract of sale, that is illegal. Both of them occur every day, and were the <em>sale </em>of the ultimate interest made to a stranger or to another member of the company, there would be no pretense of usury, however low the price. Can the fact that the sale is made to the company itself make any difference ? If there is any difference it is only in this, that the seller is himself interested in the purchase, and continues, as we shall see, to be interested in every sale and purchase until the final winding up of the enterprise. What the stockholder agrees to pay for the money he gets when he takes money, is dependent on what he and others agree to take the money at. So soon as the accumulations reach a certain per centage \u2014 that is, will divide $200 to each stockholder \u2014 all payments stop and the concern winds up. If the money at each monthly meeting is in demand and stockholders take it at a high premium, the accumulations increase rapidly and the end comes soon. If the rates are low, the end is a long way off and the monthly payments must be continued a long time. If the company gets its maximum accumulation in two years, the monthly payments are $24 per share. If it takes four years to reach that point, then their payments are $48 per share. Hence, all parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>are interested in high rates. Even on the rates at which this plaintiff sold out, it is in testimony that if the rates could have been kept up to that figure he would have only had to pay seven per cent, for his money; in other words, the end would have come so soon that his monthly payments would not have been more than the money he actually got and seven per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Even on the idea that he was borrowing the money, and was merely selling his interest in the dividend, it was wholly a matter of contingency whether he paid seven per cent., or more or less than that, for the money. This fact, this uncertainty or contingency, introduces into the transaction an element wholly foreign to an agreement to pay so much for the use of money. It may be that the borrower pays nothing; it may be that he does not really pay the whole of the principal. It may happen that he shall have to pay one, or two, or thirty per cent. It all depends on how soon the end comes; how high <em>the average </em>rates are. The contract is not a contract for the loan of money with interest, since the lender (if it is a loan) does not know what he will get back, or rather what the taker will eventually pay, since that depends entirely on how long it will take to reach the point of final winding up. The profits to the lender, or loss to the borrower, may be less or more than seven per cent on the amount received.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Treating this sale of the ultimate interest as a borrowing, let us see how it would be under, say, the rate of forty per centum premium. At forty per centum average sales, through the whole period, the concern will come to an end and the payments <em>stop </em>in aboutsix years. Suppose one holding five shares, on the first meeting, takes an advance at forty per cent, premium, this would be $400 on the $1,000, or five shares. This would leave him $600 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">His account would stand thus with the company:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">\n<em>Company Cr.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">By cash,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\n<em>Company Dr.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">Six years\u2019 monthly payments of one dollar per share</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">on five shares..........................................$360 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">Six years\u2019 monthly payments of one dollar per share</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">on five shares (interest).............................. 360 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">Amount paid in all...................................$760 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-10\">Now suppose he had borrowed $600 00 at seven per cent?., and kept it six years and paid it, the account would be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-11\">Six years\u2019 interest on $600 00, at seven per cent.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-12\">$42 00 per year................................. $252 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-13\">Add the principal.......................................... 600 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-14\">Amount paid in all...................................$852 00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">So that in the Association plan he pays $108 00 less than seven per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">The settled rule is, that if any other element \u2014 as risk of losing the whole or risk of getting less than the legal rate, is a part of the contract, it is not usury. Usury is the taking of more than the legal rate for <em>One forbearance. </em>If the lender undertakes any risk, if the contract is of such a character as that the borrower or taker of the money may not have to pay the principal or may not have to pay as much as the legal rate, then it is not usury. Now it is apparent \u2014 first, that the great leading idea of this Association was, that it was an advantage to its members to pay in small sums monthly, with the right to anticipate their ultimate interest by selling that out for its present worth at auction; and, second, that <em>bona fide, </em>really and truthfully, it depended entirely upon the <em>average price </em>the ultimate interests sold at, what rate each purchaser was paying for his money. If the average price was high, the end would soon come when the payments would stop; if low, it would take a longer time, and the rate of interest would be low or high accordingly. Each purchaser had an interest in the profits \u2014 in the price of all the sales \u2014 since, as that price was on the average, high or low, so would his monthly payments continue long or end quickly.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>In such a scheme as this, the great element of usury is wanting, to-wit: oppression \u2014 ad vantage taken by one of the necessities of another. The person getting the money in this case, being, in fact, interested himself in having the sales as high as possible. To permit the usurer himself to set up the usury, after the contract has been executed, would be contrary to all principle. The person wronged is allowed so to do, hilt not the wrong doer, and if the plaintiff here recovers he will recover a part of the advantage which came to himself, from the high rates at which <em>others </em>sold their interest in the ultimate dividend. <em>We </em>can easily see how a society of this kind might be used by schemers, to get money for themselves. But there is not a particle of proof that this was the case here. All seems to have been carried on according to the professed object, to-wit: to enable individuals under an agreement to pay small monthly payments, to sell out for a present respectable sum, the ultimate share of each, in the final accumulation. And we think the jury did rightly in finding there was no proof that this scheme was a mere device to evade the usury laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Assuming, therefore, that in the taking and in the sale of the stock in the contract the parties made, there was no violation of the law, it only remains to inquire, if <em>in </em>the settlement made there was usury. The plaintiff admits that if he had <em>complied </em>with his <em>contract, </em>there would have bee.,.none. Has he done anything more than this? It was ditA^ctly agreed from the first that any stockholder who failed to comply with the rules, should be subject to certain penalties or forfeitures. Nothing more was exacted in the settlement than the rules required. Indeed, the settlement was more liberal than was provided by the regulations in case of failure. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">We do not think the charge of the Judge, on the question of accord and satisfaction, was proper. We agree that if there be a dispute, <em>bona fide, </em>as to whether or not any particular contract is tainted with usury, that the parties may, by accord and satisfaction, settle that dispute; but the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>ment of the usury is not such a settlement. It must appear that there was a <em>bona fide </em>dispute \u2014 uncertainty, doubt as to the existence of the usury \u2014 that the parties must have that doubt, dispute, distinctly in view in the settlement, and the resolution of the doubt must be a point of the settlement. We do not think there is any proof here to justify the inference of such a settlement, and we think the charge does not submit the law fairly to the jury under the proof. But, as we are satisfied that the contract was not usurious \u2014 as the jury must, under the law, have found there was no proof of usury \u2014 we will not reverse the judgment for this error.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
