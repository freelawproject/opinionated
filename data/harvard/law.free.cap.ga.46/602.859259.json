Harris brought case against the Western and Atlantic Railroad for $5,000 damages, alleged to have been sustained by plaintiff by reason of the negligence and carelessness of the- defendant in the transportation, as a common carrier, of a blooded stallion by the name of \u201cBrattleboro,\u201d from the city of Atlanta to the town of Kingston, along the line of said railroad, by which said stallion was permanently injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-11\">Upon the trial the depositions of Julius A. Peck, L. Q,. Stone, Augustus R. Jones, and Peter C. Harris, taken under one commission, were introduced in evidence for the plaintiff. The commission was executed on the 7th day of April, 1871, in the usual form. Under the jurat, attached to the answers, was the following language, to-wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-12\">\u201cFor further answer to sixth interrogatory, P. C. Harris <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>answers: This horse \u2018Brattleboro\u2019 belongs to that family of world renowned trotting horses, known as the Morgan breed, one of which (\u2018Dexter\u2019) was sold to Bonner for $30,000. \u2018Brattleboro\u2019is, or was remarkable for his speed, action and size; and, as a stallion, ought to command as much as \u2018Dexter\u2019 or any other horse. I am confident that if this horse \u2018Brattleboro\u2019 had not been injured, he could have commanded forty or fifty mares, at $40 each, per season, and the said horse, when injured, was worth not less than $3,000. I would prefer raising from him to any horse living.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-5\">(Signed) \u201cPETER C.

Harris, which had been answered after the formal execution of the commission, the signature-of all the witnesses and of the commissioners, the commissioners having no power to continue or extend the examination after such formal closing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-13\">The motion was overruled and defendant excepted, and assigns said ruling as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b603-14\">L.

Was it error in the Court to refuse to rule out the addition made by the commissioners? We are not prepared to say that the power of the commissioners is exhausted when they have once examined the witness and affixed their signatures to the certificate. Under proper circumstances they may have a right to set down additional answers. But in our judgment it must affirmatively appear that the additional answer is taken as part of the original transaction, at the same time and place. The other side has a right to ask, for instance, and know who is present at the taking of the answers, and if the commissioners may, at their pleasure, re-examine the witness it would be easy to evade such questions. -We think this addition formed no legal part of the commissioners\u2019 report, because it failed to show that it was taken at the same time and place, and as part of the principal examination. It is of the utmost importance that every possible guard be thrown around this kind of testimony to, avoid imposition, and very rigid rules ought to be held to. We the more readily grant the new trial in this case, because, although we do not suppose the was any fraud by the commissioners, yet the verdict is a very heavy one under the proof, and it is clear that the interests of the State have not been properly seen to on this trial. We know this was not the fault of the attorneys <em>now </em>representing the State, but it is very apparent that somebody is to blame.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
