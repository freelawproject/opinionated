On the trial of an indictment for murder, where there is a general plea of not guilty, it is not error as against the prisoner for the Judge to charge the jury as to the law of justifiable homicide, even though, from the evidence, it is plain that the prisoner is in any event guilty of manslaughter. An error of the Court in his charge to the jury, which could not, in any view of it, have injured the prisoner under the evidence, is no ground for a new trial.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b148-12\">2. When the evidence showed that, without any considerable provocation, the prisoner \u201cwent at the deceased with an axe,\u201d and the deceased, standing in his place, picked up a heavy oak stick, and was stricken by the prisoner with the axe and killed as he was raising the stick, and the Judge charged the jury that if the deceased picked up the stick to defend himself, the prisoner was guilty of murder; but if the deceased picked it up for <em>mutual combat, </em>the prisoner was guilty only of manslaughter ; and the jury found the defendant guilty of murder:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b148-13\"><em>Held, </em>That the charge was not one of which the prisoner could complain.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b148-14\">3.

I think he hit him with the head of the axe; it appeared like a pretty heavy blow; knocked him down; the wound was about an inch and a half wide and three and a half or four inches long; can\u2019t tell how deep it was; the skin was broken in one small place; was not able to get up; they took him up, spoke to him, called him and he did not answer. They carried him into the house and laid him down; he was knocked down on Tuesday and he lived until Thursday morning; he died in this county. I did not see the commencement of the difficulty between them two; the fuss commenced about some \u201cjowering\u201d about some children; the women were West\u2019s wife, Muly and July, Jeff\u2019s uncle\u2019s wife; West, was there before Jeff. came. When the killing took place Jeff, came up and set his basket down and goes in the house and gets a drink of water; when he got the water he came out and walked to the wagon, where his basket was; he stood some few minutes leaning against the wagon, when - he spoke to West, and said to him, \u201cI don\u2019t think it right for you to curse another man\u2019s wife in her yard ;\u201d don\u2019t remember what he had been saying before that; don\u2019t remember what West, was doing; the women and defendant got in a great rage; Jeff, spoke to defendant first; he told defendant that he did not think it was right for one man to be cursing and talking about killing another man\u2019s wife in her yard; West, asked him, \u201cDid he take it up?\u201d Jeff, told him, \u201cNo! he didn\u2019t take it up in particular, more than he didn\u2019t think it was right;\u201d West. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>then told Jeff. \u201c That he would hit his wife,\u201d and Jeff told him \u201cI reckon not;\u201d Jeff, said, \u201cI think God give you more sense than to hit his wife if he were in some foreign country;\u201d there was some few words passed between West, and Jeff, that I don\u2019t recollect. West, started to Jeff.; I never saw him ; I heard him walking and talking back behind me; don\u2019t think that from the time until West, got half way there was another word spoke between them; I was sitting with my back to West, and face towards Jeff ; when I looked I saw Jeff, stoop after the double-tree, and as the double-tree was coming up I saw West.\u2019s axe coming under the double-tree; he had raised the double-tree up when he struck; by the time he got the double-tree nearly straight West, struck Jeff, on the right side of his head with his axe; Jeff and the double-tree all fell backwards and lodged on the hub of the wagon. At the time they commenced talking to each other I think they were fifteen or twenty steps apart, or more; don\u2019t think Jeff moved out of his tracks; didn\u2019t examine to see whether the skull was broke or not. After West, knocked Jeff, down he walked off from there very quickly; Jeff, was standing at the fore-wheel of the wagon ; the double-tree was separate from the wagon; he caught the double-tree up with both hands; it was a double-tree for a two-horse wagon, the usual size.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-5\"><em>Cross-examined: </em>I could kill a man with a weapon like that double-tree; I reckon the double-tree was nearly four feet long; it waslighter than a four-horse double-tree; the double-tree was lying on the ground, nothing attached to it; Jeff was on the left side of the wagon; the tongue was towards the house; Jeff was on the upper part of the wagon, on same side with witness, leaning against the fore-wheel; he was standing up between the front wheel and the tongue; there was no part of the wagon between witness and deceased ; witness was on the same side of the wagon with, deceased ; deceased was leaning against the basket of cotton and the wagon; the basket was sitting on the wagon wheel; the deceased and wagon were three or four steps from the witness ; I was sit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>ting on a work-bench some five or six steps from the house . don\u2019t know how long I had been there before the difficulty; when I got there there was a difficulty between Muly and July; heard them \u201cjabbering\u201d after I got there; they were \u201cjabbering\u201d about Muly\u2019s baby and July\u2019s brother; they had been quarreling; don\u2019t know how long they had been quarreling before West, came up ; witness hadn\u2019t been there very long before West, came up; they were quarreling about July\u2019s brother knocking down Muly\u2019s baby in play and hurting its face while they were playing; Muly was in the family way; she has had a baby since, so I have heard; I heard she had a baby the next night from the chat. When West, came up he picked a chunk and started to knock her down with it for the fuss his wife and she was in ; he never knocked her down that I saw; if he had have done it witness would have known it; didn\u2019t see West, when he came up; he came before Jeff.

Under the proof, we think it was no error in the Court to charge the law of justifiable homicide. The record shows a general denial of guilt, and it was not improper that the Judge should inform the jury under what circumstances one may lawfully kill another, and it would be a strong ease of hypercriticism to say, that a new trial ought to be granted if the Judge allude to instances of justification wholly unlike the case on trial. It is common for the Court to read the definition of justifiable homicide, \u201cthe taking a human life by <em>commandment </em>of law, or by <em>permission </em>of law, or in self-defense;\u201d surely it is not error in the Court to do this, even though the case is one one of self-defense alone. That the Judge in <em>this </em>case charged the jury in reference to the law of justifiable homicide, etc., was no harm to the prisoner. In the first place, his plea was \u201cnot guilty;\u201d the proof was very plain that the deceased was killed by him, and he was \u201cguilty\u201d unless justified. In the. next place, we have no evidence from the record, that his counsel waived his plea of not guilty, and stood only on the denial of the guilt of murder; as the record stands the denial was of any guilt. We are not prepared to say, that even if the record showed that the counsel had, in the argument, admitted guilt of manslaughter, that the charge of the Judge as to justifiable manslaughter would have been ground for new trial. At best the charge may in that event have been unnecessary. But we are not clear it could even then be said to have injured the defendant. We think the Judge</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>was in error in saying there must be mutual blows to constitute a mutual combat. There must be a mutual intent to fight. But we think if this exists, and but one blow be stricken, that the mutual combat exists, even though the first blow kills or disables one of the parties. Were there <em>any evidence </em>here of a mutual combat we should be constrained to reverse the judgment. But we are clear that there was before the jury nothing to authorize any doubt even upon their minds that this was not a mutual combat. The deceased showed no sign of a disposition to fight. Pie denied taking up the quarrel of the woman. He stood at his place; he had, or showed no arms. Indeed, he seems to have been very slow even in getting ready to defend himself, since the defendant had about twenty steps to go, and got to him and struck him before he got the double-tree picked up, and in a position even to defend himself. Had <em>he </em>got the first blow and that blow proved fatal, the killing would by him have clearly been justifiable. He sees a man coming at him with an axe, cursing him, threatening to show him what he could, and would do, and his picking up the double-tree and raising it was nothing but the promptings of that universal feeling of self-defense implanted in all animal nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The conviction is right; it was not justified only, but demanded by the testimony. The jury were bound, on their oaths, to find as they did, and we do not feel it to be our duty to grant a new trial, because the Judge gave the law wrongly, upou a state of facts which did not exist. Tin's offense was murder. There was no considerable provocation \u2014 nothing to bring it to the grade of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
