Green, executor, defendant in error.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b361-8\">1. Where a verdict is plain and unmistakable in its terms and legal effect, it is error in the Court to permit counsel for the party against whom the verdict is rendered to interrogate the jury, on the reading of the verdict by the Clerk, as to what they intended by their verdict. The verdict in such a case not being ambiguous must speak for itself.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b361-9\">2. Where a legatee files a bill against the executor of the will under which the complainant claims, to compel the payment of his legacy and the executor sets up the defense of <em>plene administravit prceter, </em>which is controverted by the complainant and the jury found the following verdict: \u201cWe the jury find the sum of $5,000, with legal interest thereon, from the 24th day of November, 1855, for the complainant, John Anderson, to be raised out of the estate of A. H. Anderson, deceased, in the hands of Moses P. Green, executor,\u201d the complainant is entitled to a judgment <em>de bonis testatoris et si non de bonis propriis.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b361-10\">8. The decree of the Chancellor should conform to the verdict. Where a decree was rendered by the Chancellor not conforming to the verdict and pending a motion by defendant for a new trial, complainant excepted to the decree rendered and brought the case to this Court, where the bill of exceptions was dismissed, as prematurely sued out, and at the hearing of the motion for a new trial, complainant again moved to reform the decree, so as to make it accord with the verdict, which motion to reform the Chancellor again entertained and overruled, and also granted the new trial, to all of which complainant excepted within the thirty days required by the statute, he is not estopped from assigning error upon the ruling of the Chancellor refusing to reform the decree.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b361-11\">4. Where the verdict of the jury is for a sum not more than the evidence shows the complainant is entitled to, a new trial will not be granted because they may have arrived at the result by an erroneous calculation \u2014 conceding that in this case the mode of calculation adopted by the jury was erroneous.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b361-12\">5. It is not error in the Court to refuse to strike from a panel of twenty-four jurors a juror somewhat deaf, at the instance of defendant, who himself struck the juror in selecting a jury, and from which refusal no damage is shown to have resulted to the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b361-13\">6. That there was a substitute for the juror selected by the parties, who answered to the name of his principal, is no ground for new trial, it not appearing that both substitute and principal were unknown to.defendant and his own counsel.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b361-14\">7. We find no error in the verdict.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b361-15\">8.

Probate of a will in common form unattacked for seven years, is conclusive, upon all parties in interest, except minor heirs-at-law.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b362-5\">10. A legatee is not barred from asserting his claim to a legacy against the executor where suit is brought within ten years after the legatee arrives at age.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b362-6\">11. Where a will has been proved in common form for more than seven years, a legatee does not waive the estoppel thereby created by filing his bill against the executor for an account and discovery.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b362-7\">12. Where the verdict is in no view for more than the complainant is entitled to recover, an immaterial charge as to.one item claimed in the bill is no ground for a new trial, even conceding such charge to be erroneous.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b362-8\">12. An executor who, by the will of his testator (probated in 1853, and by which a solvent estate of more than $200,000 is committed to his hands), is directed to move a slave to a free State, to be there manumitted, and to invest for such manumitted slave, on his arrival at age, which occurs in 1862, $3,000, cannot, after refusing to execute the bequest of his testator until the close of the war, free himself from liability by showing that the estate has perished on his hands from the results of the war and other causes.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b362-9\">l\u00e1. A provision in a will probated in 1853, directing a slave to be sent to a free State and there manumitted and provided for, was not in violation of the law of Georgia at that time.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b362-10\">15. The law presumes a testator, in making his will, to have had a legal intention in view until the contrary is shown.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b362-11\">16. If an executor buy land of his testator at his own sale, the purchase is voidable at the election of a legatee.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b362-12\">17. Where an executor relies on the defense of <em>jplene administravit, </em>it is not error in the \u00abCourt to charge the jury \u201c if you find from the evidence there has been no full and complete administration of the assets of the estate, then this plea of defendants fails, and your verdict may also be against the assets in his hands to be administered, or in default of such assets, against his personal goods.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b362-13\">18. The executor in this case, having made himself personally liable by his neglect for the payment of complainant\u2019s legacy, before any law existed authorizing him to invest in Confederate securities without an order of Court, the charge complained of in the 33d ground for new trial is immaterial.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b362-14\">19. An executor, who has willfully or negligently mismanaged the property in his charge to the injury of a legatee, cannot avail himself of the provisions of the Relief Act of October 13th, 1870, when sued by such legatee.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b362-15\">20.

The sixth and seventh items of his will were as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-9\">\u201cItem 6th.

If she choose then, in 1875, to go to a free State and be emancipated, my executors are directed to carry out her determination, and to invest and secure for her use as they may think best, the sum of $2,000, to be raised out of my estate, the interest of which she is to receive during life, and then her son John, if in life, is to have the benefit of said investment absolutely. If said slave Louisa shall determine not to go to a free State then I give her to my son-in-law, Moses P.

The defendant made sales of the property of the estate to the amount of $109,000, made no investment of the funds as required by the decree, and has made no returns to the Court. The defendant bought in most if not all of the real estate and now holds the same, to-wit: the \u201cHouse tract\u201d containing three thousand six hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>and eighty-seven acres, the \u201cEighty-three Station tract\u201d containing one thousand five hundred and one acres, and the \u201cNesbit tract\u201d containing ......... acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-5\">The defendant had failed to pay the legacies to complainant or to his mother, and had failed to make any provision for the execution of the bequest in the bill as to them. He had also failed to carry out the provisions of the decree of 1855 as to them. The bill prayed that the defendant be required to pay to complainant the legacies to him and to his mother, with the accumulated interest thereon, and also for discovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-6\">The answer denied that it was the intention of the testator that the bequest in favor of complainant should be carried out literally, as expressed in said will; that defendant had always claimed complainant as his slave until he was emancipated at the close of the late war; that testator intended that complainant, who was then of tender years, should remain with his mother until the time when, by the terms of said will, she was permitted to exercise her choice whether she would go to a free State herself, or remain, he believing, from her expressed opposition, she would never consent to go; that then, if said Louisa decided not to go to such free' State, the complainant and his said mother were to remain in this State, under the protection of defendant, be free and enjoy the bequests, so far as it was possible for them to do; that, in the meantime, testator desired that complainant and his mother should be as free as defendant could make them, without endangering their safety, under the laws then of force; that testator expressed his secret wishes and instructions respecting complainant and his mother repeatedly, both before and after the execution of the will, and earnestly and solemnly enjoined upon this defendant the special trust and confidence that he would execute the same, so far as they were concerned, not as therein directed, but according to his wishes and intentions so expressed to this defendant; that defendant paid to Louisa, annually, the sum directed by said will; that the 6th and 7th items of said will were void, as contrary to the public policy of the State; that, inasmuch as Louisa died <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>at the time set forth in the bill, the contingency upon which she was to have and receive the legacy of $2,000 never happened, and therefore complainant acquired no interest in the same; that the sale under said decree was made, as charged, for the sum mentioned, but only a portion of said sale was for cash, and the remainder on a credit of one and two years, and that all the funds collected were expended in the payment of the debts of the deceased, except a part of the credit proceeds, which was invested by him in notes, mortgages and judgments, for the benefit of the estate, and a part of which is now in his hands, in shape of Confederate bonds; that defendant did purchase some of the property sold, through another, and is now in possession of the same, but that the full market value was paid for all property thus bought by him; that defendant made his annual returns to the Court of Ordinary of Burke county regularly until the year 1859, after which time, receiving nothing on account of said estate, the returns were discontinued; that, as executor of deceased, he has fully administered all and singular the goods and chattels, rights, credits and effects which were of the estate of the said Augustus H. Anderson, deceased, at the time of his death, and which came to the hands of defendant to be administered. That there is now due by said estate a trust debt in favor of Augustus H. Anderson, in right of his wife, Susan J. Anderson, amounting, originally, to $........., which has been reduced, by payments, to $.........; that, by the 8th item of said will, testator bequeathed to defendant the privilege of using, free from charge, all the lands loaned to him by testator in his lifetime, until January 1st, 1875, and that, by the decree of 1855, defendant was allowed to retain, for his own use, such sum as should, in the opinion of the solicitors named, be a sufficient consideration for the release of the privilege bequeathed to him; that defendant made such release, but said solicitors failed to make the aforesaid estimate; that said lands were of the value of $20,000 at the date of said decree, and of the yearly value of $2,000, making, for the twenty years intervening between the date of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>said decree and the year 1875, the sum of $40,000, besides interest due to this defendant for the release aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-5\">That defendant denies that he owns the \u201cNesbit tract\u201d of land as charged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-6\">That if complainant be entitled to a decree for any amount defendant prays that it may be taken against the assets of the estate remaining in his hands as executor; that said decree may bo taken subject to the aforesaid trust debt of Augustus H. Anderson, in right of his wife, Susan J. Anderson; that if the aforesaid assets may prove insufficient, that the legacy in favor of the complainant may abate <em>pro rata </em>with that of this defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-7\">The evidence is unnecessary to an understanding of the questions of law passed upon by . the Court, as the foots of the ease are fully reported in the bill, answer and motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-8\">The jury returned the following verdict: \u201cWe, the jury, find the sum of $5,000 with legal interest thereon from the 24th day of November, 1855, for the complainant, John Anderson, to he raised out of the estate of A.

Because Allen Boyd served as a juror throughout the trial of the eause when he had not been selected by either party as a juror, said Boyd answering to the name of John F.

Because said verdict is contrary to evidence and the principles of justice and equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-9\">4th. Because said verdict is contrary to the law and the evidence, for that the jury included in said verdict the legacy of $2,000 claimed for Louisa, mother of complainant, under the seventh item of the will of the testator, when the undisputed proof was that said Louisa died long anterior to the time when she was to make her election to go to a free State, it being a legacy entirely dependent upon her election in the year 1875 to go to a free State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-10\">5th. Because the Court erred in excluding as evidence all that portion of defendant\u2019s answer which relates to the se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>cret trust imposed upon defendant by the testator, as not responsive to the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-5\">6th.

For the sake of convenience, I will consider the first and twenty-first points decided by the Court, together. To permit a party against whom a verdict is rendered, when it is plain and unambiguous in its terms and legal effect, to examine the jury as to their meaning, is to give great advantage to a litigant of influence and position in his county, when opposed by one of little or no influence. The jury room is the proper place for the jurors to give their views as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>to wliat the verdict should be, and having there come to a conclusion as to the rights of the parties, they have but one more duty to perform, and that is to return their finding into Court. To suffer the jurors to be interrogated as to what legal effect their verdict is to have, is closely allied to, if not identical with, calling a juror to impeach a verdict rendered by him. To justify such a course, the verdict must, at least, be so ambiguous as to convey no definite meaning upon one or more of the issues involved. An award and a verdict have been held by this Court as very analagous to each other. In <em>Goodin et al. vs. Mitchell et al., </em>3 <em>Moore, </em>241, (4 E. C. L. R., 432,) the Court of Common Pleas held that, \u201c if the terms of an award be clear upon the face of it, the Court will not admit an affidavit of one of the arbitrators to explain their intention.\u201d See <em>Settle vs. Allison, </em>8 <em>Georgia, </em>208, and quotation there found from <em>Spencer vs. Golter, </em>1 H. <em>Bl., </em>79. In <em>Murphy vs. Giiggs, </em>41 <em>Georgia, </em>464, this Court held it was no such error as entitled the party cast to a new trial, where the Court refused, on request of counsel, to ask the jury if they had agreed upon a verdict, unless counsel would state some legal reason for making the request. And the judgment of the Court below, granting a new trial on this ground, was reversed. The tendency of this case is to show that no unnecessary questions should be asked the jury, even by the Court, much less should counsel bring the pressure of public opinion to bear upon the jury by demanding, in open Court, from them, an explanation of the plain, unambiguous result of their deliberations in the jury room. Especially is this true in this case. The attempt of counsel was to show that the jury did not mean to hold the defendant personally liable. Their attention had been specifically called to this view of the case in the charge set forth in the tenth ground for new trial, and yet they had declined to find as therein instructed, as they should have done if they entertained the view that counsel, by his examination, was seeking to commit them to. Upon the whole, we see no substantial difference between the course pursued in this case and the calling upon a juror <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>to impeach a verdict rendered by him. And this has been repeatedly held by this Court to be inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">2. The main issue involved in the case was made by the defense of <em>plene administravit prceter, </em>set up by the executor in his answer. The attention of the jury was distinctly called to this defense by the Court in his charge, and instructions given them how to find if they should sustain it. Prom the verdict, and by that alone we are to be guided, it is very plain that they did not sustain this defense. There can be no dispute that they have found a verdict for $5,000 and interest for complainant. \"Whenever an executor or administrator is sued and pleads <em>plene administravit prceter, </em>and a verdict is had against him the judgment must necessarily be <em>de bonis testatoris et si non de bonis propriis, </em>or a judgment <em>quando </em>for the whole (if the assets admitted to be on hand are worthless) or a part of the amount found due, (if the assets in. hand are available to some extent) accordingly as the verdict may be: Code 3515. Is it possible to enter a judgment <em>quando </em>on the verdict in this case? Every reasonable construction is to be adopted in favor of a verdict: 17 <em>Ga., </em>361. Would it not require a very unreasonable construction of this verdict to found the judgment <em>quando </em>upon it? Is it not plainly a finding of the issue presented by his defense against the executor? It is trifling to say the verdict means that $5,000 and interest are to be raised out of assets not worth five cents, with the exception of the Nesbit mortgage, which, if fully paid, will scarcely satisfy half the verdict, and the executor in his answer seems to rank this among his other insolvent assets. If the intention of the jury was to exonerate the defendant from personal liability, they should have found a verdict upon which a judgment <em>quando </em>could have been entered. The amount found is \u201cto be be raised out of the estate of A. H. Anderson, deceased, in the hands of M. P. Green, executor,\u201d that is, in his hands now, when the verdict is rendered. But the defense of the executor was that he had no such amount in his hands. This verdict says as plainly as language can say that he did have, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>or ought to have, and his own evidence shows that he did have. It will be remembered that the Court charged the jury, and charged them correctly, that \u201cif you find from the evidence that Green, as executor, either in person or through another, bought lands at his own sale neither legates, or (nor) creditors of testator\u2019s estate are estopped thereby, but may repudiate his purchase, so far as their rights are to be affected thereby, and he holds said lands subject to their rightful claims.\u201d By defendant\u2019s own admission he \u201cdid purchase some of the property sold through another, and is now in possession of the same;\u201d and it appears from his returns that said property consisted of three thousand six hundred and eighty-seven and four-tenths acres, which the executor, through another, bid off at $19,358 85. This property was not included in the assets admitted by the executor to be still in his hands as belonging to the estate. Here was one item alone then, after making due allowance for the depreciation in the value of the laud by the results of the war, which would probably pay the amount found by the jury, and which they were justified in treating as assets in his hands under the charge. If it be said that he testifies that he paid all of this $19,358 to the debts of the estate, and is therefore equitably entitled to stand in the shoes of the creditors whom he paid, the reply is that by his own testimony the debts amounted only to some $50,000; that under the decree of November, 1855, he sold property to the amount of $109,-000, part cash, the balance on one and two years credit; that \u201cthe cash received from the various sales was applied to the payments of debts, <em>and there was not quite enough for that purpose.\u201d </em>If the whole of his purchase is to be treated as cash received and included in the above statement, as it must be, as all the land was sold for cash, still he ultimately got in enough to pay all the debts and more, for he says in his testimony the scheduleof assets now offered by him as all the assets remaining in his hands \u201crepresents the sale notes and <em>such funds as were received by witness in payment of the sale notes, and afterwards loaned out,\u201d </em>etc. Conceding for the purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>of the argument, that he might claim to stand in the shoes of the creditors whom he had thus paid with his private funds, yet he knew, or should have known, that the sale to himself was voidable, and the legatees could require of him to return the land to the estate and look to the cash assets for reimbursement for whatever amount he may have used of his private funds to pay the debts. He chose to take the risk, and must abide by it. It is true he does not state how much of these sale notes were paid, and so loaned out by him, but it appears from his own return of sales made by him on May 5th, 1857; that on the 12th, 13th and 14th of February, 1856, he sold $68,136 85 worth of land and negro'es. All that he did not get in cash he took notes for, according to his own testimony. In the schedule of assets which he now presents as the entire assets remaining in his hands, there are but five notes bearing date so early as February 12th, 13th and 14th, 1856, to-wit: M. A. Thompson\u2019s, two notes for $268 each, dated February 12th, 1856; T. A. Parsons, note for $144 40, same date; I. B. Jones\u2019 note, of same date, for $43 60, and Ramsom Lewis\u2019 note, dated February 1st, 1856, for $698 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">All the notes, then, which were given on the days of sale by \u25a0 the purchasers, were either paid or renewed, with the above insignficant exception. In addition to the land and negroes, he sold, at the same time, personalty to the amount of $10,255 66, no one item of which sold for as much as $300; as the land sold for cash, it is presumed these small items were also sold in the same way, though that does not affirmatively appear. In comparing the list of purchasers of the land and negroes with the list of makers of notes in the schedule of assets now set forth, very few of the purchasers\u2019 names appear in the present schedule, and those that do so appear, owe small amounts. It would seem to follow that most of the original purchase notes have been paid by the makers, and not renewed, and that most of the notes now set forth in his schedule represent <em>\u201c </em>such funds as were received by witness in payment of the sale notes, and afterwards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>loaned out.\u201d Without pausing to make the exact calculation, it abundantly appears in this way that he must have received in payment of the sale notes far more than he gave for the land purchased by him, and the money so received, as he testifies, he afterwards loaned out. How, then, does his equitable claim, to be considered as subrogated to the rights of those creditors whom he paid with the money bid for the land, stand? Pie made a voidable purchase at his own sale; he paid creditors with the money he bid. Afterwards, he received, in cash, far more than enough to reimburse himself. Instead of doing so, he loaned the money out and the borrowers became insolvent. Who should lose, himself or the legatees? Here, then, are assets, not admitted in his answer, which his own evidence shows to be still in his bauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">It also appears from the credits upon A. H. Anderson\u2019s note alone \u2014 such credits amounting <em>to </em>more than $16,000 \u2014 that the only debt now set up as existing against the estate could have been canceled, or very nearly so, by the trustee creditor as a debtor to the estate in his individual character. Instead of thus paying this debt, which is of the highest dignity, this money seems also to have been loaned out and thus lost. Who should suffer, the executor or the legatees? The award of Charles J. Jenkins and Thomas M. Berrien, made November 1853, makes the principal of this debt $8,120 82. A. H. Anderson\u2019s note is dated June 13th, 1857. The first credit on it is $9,405, without date. Two other credits, one for $2,550, the other for $4,310 66, are also without date; but by Anderson\u2019s receipts, dated in March and October, 1862, we learn that the two last credits were appropriated to the payment in full of all interest due upon the trust debt. Why was not the other credit of $9,405, also paid to the trust debt? Had it been, the debt would have been extinguished, or nearly so, after making allowance for a payment presently to be noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">If the excuse be that he paid it once to other creditors, the reply still is, that he must have collected more than enough from the sale notes given for the negroes sold in February, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>1856, alone (not to notice later sales,) to pay all the debts left after appropriating the cash sales to that purpose, which cash he testifies was not qnite enough to pay off all the debts. Here, then, seems to be a <em>devastavit </em>to the extent of the payment by Anderson. If he loaned it out, he did it at his own risk. If the payment to W. J. Rhodes, trustee of Mrs. S. J. Anderson, charged against the estate in the return for 1858^ and amounting to $2,392 63, is fo be taken as a part of this fund, somewhat over $7,000 is still not appropriated, as it should have been. It may or it may not have been a part of that fund; neither the date of the credit, nor of Rhode\u2019s voucher, is shown by the record. If the voucher antedates the credit, the payment to Rhodes is not a part of the latter. The claim of the executor to be a creditor, on the score of his surrender of the <em>usufruct </em>of the realty bequeathed to him, does not deserve serious consideration. If one legatee can so transform himself into a creditor, to the disadvantage of the others, and without their consent, it would be very easy for a legatee of an estate, unable to pay all the legacies, to get the advantage of the others, especially if he were executor. Again, whether we consider the executor bound by the decree of 1855, or by the will, each equally enjoin upon him to pay the complainant\u2019s expenses to a free State, and to educate and maintain him until he arrived at age, which occurred in 1862, at which time he was to invest $3,000 for him. This trust he refused to execute, and he cannot now set up the loss of the funds to exonerate himself, which occurred subsequent to the time during which the boy was to be educated and then provided for. The executor neglected his duty at his peril. Here, also, is a <em>devastavit </em>to the extent of the cost of maintenance and education, and $3,000, directed to be invested. Again, the defendant says, in one of the amendments to his answer, that he received, on the sale notes given for negroes and other property, the sum of $23,975, in Confederate treasury notes. He does not say <em>when </em>he received them. It is assumed that he did not do so after prudent men had de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>cliued them in payment of debts due themselves. He sold, on credit\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">In January, 1859, perishable property to the</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">amount of..........................................$ 651 93</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">In January, 1860, he sold land, on credit, to the</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">amount of.......................................... 8,500 00</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">In March, 1859, he sold negroes, on credit, to</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">amount of about................................. 8,500 00</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">In February, 1856, he sold negroes, on credit, to</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">the amount of.................................... 39,759 00</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">Total ............................................$57,413 93</p>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">Deduct the amount received on these notes in</p>\n<p id=\"b382-15\">Confederate money............................... 23,975 00</p>\n<p id=\"b382-16\">Remainder.......................................$33,438 93</p>\n<p id=\"b382-17\">received by him in gold, on his credit sales, before the war. Here is a fund ample enough to have paid the trust debt and the complainant\u2019s legacy in gold, besides the small amount of debts left unpaid after the proceeds of the cash sales had been appropriated to the payment of the debts. If, instead of doing so, the executor loaned the money out, whose loss should it be if the borrowers became insolvent? As little as the unpaid legatee can ask is, that he take the $23,975, received by him in Confederate money, in payment of the amount bid by him for the land purchased at his own sale, and which, he says, was used in payment of debts due by the estate. If the estate owed money, and the creditors refused to receive Confederate money in payment, he should have refused to receive it in payment of the sale notes. And he, at best, can only stand in the shoes of a creditor to the extent of his private funds used to pay the debts, and if willing to receive Confederate money for debts due the estate, should have been equally willing to receive the same currency in payment of the debt of the estate to him, created by his violation of duty in purchasing at his own sale. The verdict, then, when viewed alone, being unambiguous in its terms, and, as we understand it, binding the executor personally to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>of the <em>devastavit </em>shown, and, when examined in the light of the evidence, being just such a verdict as should have been rendered, (upon the hypothesis that it is a finding against the defendant\u2019s defense of <em>plene administravit prceter,) </em>we are of opinion that the complainant is entitled to a judgment thereon <em>de bonis testatoris et si non de bonis propriis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">3. Such being the view we take of the verdict, it follows that the decree rendered thereon is erroneous and should be reformed so as to be made to correspond with the verdict: Code 3504, 4153; Rawlins <em>vs. </em>Shropshire, decided March 26th, 1872. Neither do we think that under the facts of this case the plaintiff in error is estopped from moving to reform the decree, nor from alleging error upon the refusal of the Chancellor to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">4. In one view of this case, the verdict is not for too much, even conceding that the complainant is not entitled to recover the $2,GOG left to his mother for life, with remainder to himself. He was entitled to his freedom and eight years of schooling. He got the former by emancipation in 1865. The latter he has never received. We do not think $5,000 with interest thereon from November, 1854, an unreasonable price for twelve years of slavery, a deprivation of education, and three thousand dollars in cash, and the interest on the last mentioned sum from February, 1862, from which time complainant was entitled to the interest, as he then arrived at age. Nor are we prepared to say that he was not entitled to the $2,000 left to his mother for life, more especially after 1875, the time at which she was to make her election, (had she lived and emancipation had not in the mean time been brought about), as to whether she would go to a free State or not. If he had a vested remainder in it, then to fall in, it was surely worth something at the time of the verdict. Upon the whole, we are satisfied the verdict is not for more than, under the evidence, the complainant is entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">To the fifth, sixth and seventh points decided by the Court, nothing need be added.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>8th and 9th. Defendant complains of the ruling of the Court, that that part of his answer setting up a secret trust is not responsive to the bill. While we do not think it is responsive, there is yet another reason for excluding it. The defendant is estopped from setting it up. It is said that estoppels must be mutual. Granted. The sufficient reply here is \u2014 this estoppel is mutual. The complainant is as much bound by the judgment of the Court of Ordinary, declaring this paper writing to.be the will of Augustus H. Anderson, as is the defendant. The judgment of the Ordinary, probating a will, is a judgment <em>in rem, </em>and binds all the world, immediately, if in solemn form. After seven years (minor heirs at law specially excepted by statute), if only in common form, even minor legatees (as such) are bound by the lapse of seven years, unless they be held to fall within the equity of section 2390, of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">But supposing the executor could yet attack this will. Can he do so collaterally in the present forum ? Must he not go into the Court of Ordinary for that purpose. I think so : Tarver <em>vs </em>Tarver, 9 Peters, 174; Cowen &amp; Hill\u2019s Notes to Phil. Ev., part 2, n. 42; Code, 3700.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">10. Nothing need be added to the tenth point decided by the Court. Sections 2871 and 2875 of the Code are conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">11. Very little need be said in support of the decision on the eleventh point. If a legatee by filing a bill calling on an executor for a discovery, opened the door for the executor to attack the will, then all an executor, who had proved a will in solemn form, would have to do, in case he desired for any reason to reopen the judgment of probate, would be to refuse to execute the will, and force parties interested to file a bill against him, which must, in the nature of things, be a bill for discovery nine times out of ten.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">12. Believing as we do the verdict to be for no more than the complainaant was entitled to recover, the charge of the Court as to complainant\u2019s right, under the decree of 1855, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>recover the $2,000 legacy left to his mother, conceding it to be error, is an immaterial one.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">13. Had tire executor performed his dutjq and faithfully discharged the trusts of the will at the proper time, he would have had abundant assets for the purpose of giving complainant his maintenance, education and $3,000. The estate, \u25a0when it passed into his hands, was worth more than $200,000, and perfectly solvent. He continuously refused to execute this trust from 1853 until the present time. The estate remained entirely solvent until the war closed. He cannot now shelter himself from personal liability, by the subsequent insolvency of the estate occuring long after he should have performed his trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">14. In support of the 14th point decided, it is only necessary to refer to the decison made in this case, when once before brought to this Court, in 38 <em>Georgia, </em>655.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">15. The presumption of the law is in favor of the legality of testator\u2019s intention in making the will, and the will is valid on its face. The time has passed within which the executor could have attacked it as void, for the reasons set forth in his answer, even if he could do so at all collaterally.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">16. It has been too repeatedly held, that a purchase by an executor at his own sale is voidable, at the election of a legatee, to require more than a statement of the proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">17. The defense of <em>plene administravit </em>having been relied on by the defendant, the charge quoted on this point was pertinent and correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">18. The charge of the Court that the defendant had no right to invest the funds of the estate represented by him in Confederate securities without an order of Court, was made through an oversight on the part of Court and counsel in omitting to note the Act of March, 1864, allowing such investments of Confederate money on hand, prior to April 1st, 1864, without such an order. But this Act was passed near the close of the war, and long after the defendant, by his neglect to execute the trust, had rendered himself personally liable. The charge, therefore, was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>19. Tlie Relief Act of 1870 expressly exempts from its benefits executors, and other trustees who have unfaithfully, or negligently mismanaged the property in their charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">20. The thirty-fifth ground for new trial is as follows: \u201cBecause the name of \"William C. Palmer, one of the jurors who tried the case, is not upon the jury list of the county, as made up in conformity to the Act of the General Assembly, approved February 15th, 1865; which fact was unknown to the defendant or his counsel until after the trial and the verdict.\u201d Precisely this objection is made in <em>Gormley vs. Laramore, </em>40 Georgia, 253; and the disqualification held to be <em>one propter defectum, </em>which must be taken advantage of \u201cbefore the county has put itself to the trouble to try the case. The fact that the party objecting was not informed of the</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">' want of qualification of the juryman does not help the case. With proper diligence he could have been informed. The list is on file, subject to the inspection of all, and it is his own want of diligence that kept him in the dark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Let the judgment of the Court below be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
