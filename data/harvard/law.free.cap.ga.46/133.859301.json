Allen, Eugenia C. Dunlap, and James M. Ward, in right of his wife Cornelia Ward, said supplies and money being advanced for the purpose of carrying on the farm for the year 1870, in the county of Houston, in said State,\u201d <em>\u201c </em>to secure said James W. Lathrop and Company for the same.\u201d The mortgage was dated January 12th, 1870. The rule <em>nisi </em>recited that there was due to plaintiffs on January 10th, 1871, $4,858 21.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-6\">James H. Allen objected to the foreclosure of said mortgage upon the following grounds, to-wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-7\">1st. Because he holds said realty as executor of Hugh Allen, deceased; said estate has never been settled, and the said land has not been turned over to the legatees of said Hugh Allen; that there are now outstanding debts against the estate of said Hugh Allen, and it will be necessary for defendant, as executor as aforesaid, to administer upon said land for the payment of said debts, and that said land is, by the will of Hugh Allen, deceased, charged with the payment of certain legacies in said will set forth, which will be sufficient to exhaust the whole of said land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-8\">2d. That as guardian for S. W. Allen, G. E. Allen, and N. L. Allen, minors of Newton Allen, deceased, he is entitled to a distributive share of said land, and that by the conditions of the last will and testament of said Hugh Allen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>said land so mortgaged, as aforesaid, is given for the sole and separate use of the several legatees in said will mentioned, and that none of the defendants to the above rule had any legal right to sell said land or create any incumbrance thereon, the same being trust property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-5\">The remaining mortgagors also filed objections to the foreclosure unnecessary here to be set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs for the sum of $4,858 21, with interest from January 10th, 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-7\">The defendants assign the following errors upon the trial, to-wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-8\">1st. The Court erred in not granting a continuance upon the ground that James H. Allen, as guardian for the minors of Newton Allen had, after filing objections to said foreclosure and before the trial, been removed from his guardianship and no other guardian had been appointed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-9\">2d. The Court erred in allowing said mortgage to be introduced in evidence, said mortgage describing no debt with sufficient accuracy and being given to secure the payment of debts not in existence at the time of the execution.of the mortgage, and for debts of an indefinite amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-10\">3d. The Court erred in rejecting as evidence the last will and testament of Hugh Allen, deceased, sought to be introduced for the purpose of showing that the lands included in the mortgage comprised all of the lands mentioned in the will, and that the minors of Newton Allen were legatees under said will and interested in said realty ; that there had been no settlement of the estate, and the lands were incumbered with the payment of debts and legacies which were still unsettled; that there had not been any assent of the executor to the execution of the mortgage; that by the terms of the will the mortgagors were prevented from selling or incumbering said realty, and that they had no interest in the land to mortgage.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-11\">Duncan &amp; Miller; Poe, Hall <em>&amp; </em>Poe, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1\">1st.

But it is said that our Code changes this rule. Its language is, section 1945 : \u201c No particular form is necessary to constitute a mortgage. It must clearly indicate the creation of a lien, specify the debt to secure which it is given and the property on which it is to take effect.\u201d But this is, in truth, nothing more than the common law required, and amounts only to saying that the form of the undertaking is immaterial. If the material elements of a mortgage are there \u2014 sufficient certainty as to what the parties intend \u2014 the paper is good as a mortgage, though there be no words of conveyance or any other of the usual forms of a mortgage. In Leeds <em>vs. </em>Cameron, 3 Sumner\u2019s Reports, 492, Judge Story, in commenting upon very similar language in a statute of New Hampshire, the words were: \u201cstating thesum of money to be secured,\u201d says it can hardly be supposed that it was the intent of the Legislature to make void all mortgages for in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>demnity, and yet this would be true if we are to give this language the restrictive meaning contended for, since it can never be known precisely what is the debt to be secured in such eases, it depending altogether on future events. And so we say as to this section of the Code. It is to have a reasonable construction, and is to be construed in reference to its intent, to-wit: to facilitate and not to hamper and restrict mortgage liens. It requires that the debt or duty of the mortgagor shall be specified ; it does not say that such <em>duly shall he </em>specific and precise. It may be indefinite, as to indemnify a surety for whatever he may pay in a certain event, or to hold one harmless for whatever may happen under certain circumstances. The paper must point out what the parties intend. Here the intent expressed is that the <em>mortgagor </em>shall pay to <em>the mortgagee </em>any moneys he may advance to him for the purpose of carrying on his farm for 1870. <em>This debt </em>or duty is plainly pointed out and specified. And, though the precise amount of the debt does not appear, since it was and, from its nature, must have been indefinite, yet the means o'f finding what it was when due are plain. If this is not a good mortgage under the Code, then all mortgages for indemnity are bad. And we cannot think it was the intent to destroy the right of mortgage in the very class of cases in which they are most useful and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">If there be anything in law called an estoppel, it would seem that one who makes a mortgage upon land is estopped from denying he had title to the land, or at least such a right to it as authorized him to make the mortgage. It is, in the first place, a deed, and it is a settled rule that one is estopped by his deed even if the donee have not acted on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Again, in this case it is clear that the mortgagee advanced his money on the faith of this deed, and this would make it a good estoppel <em>in pais. </em>So far, therefore, as the mortgagees are concerned, they are estopped from denying their right to make this mortgage according to its terms, unless, indeed, they set up fraud in the mortgagor, which they do not do. As to the other parties they have no business here. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>are dot creditors of the mortgagors and do not, therefore, come in under section 3903 of the Code, or the amendment of 1866, section 3892. And even were they creditors I, for myself, doubt if they would not have to show fraud or intent to defraud them. But these parties come in as claimants to the land. They cannot be heard in this contest. This is a proceeding to make effective upon the rights of the mortgagors in this land a lien they have put upon it. The judgment binds them and those claiming under them, them and their privies, and nobody else. If they have no title, the mortgagee has nothing; if they have title, he gets in this proceeding a judgment authorizing that title and nothing else to be sold. The issue is between the mortgagors and mortgagee, and other claimants to the land have nothing to do with it. The mortgagees have a right to go on, get their judgment, levy on the land and sell it. After the judgment the other parties may, under our claim laws, claim it, or they may stand by their rights as owners in an action of ejectment. None of these parties except the mortgagors have any rights in this proceeding, nor are any of their rights or interests affected by it. Judge Cole was right, therefore, in refusing the continuance, and the judgment is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
