Because no contract was ever made with defendant by plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-16\">2d. Because plaintiff is a contractor and not a mechanic.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>3d. Because plaintiff\u2019s lien, if lie has any, exists by virtue of the proper record of his lieu in the Clerk\u2019s office of the Superior Court, and can only be enforced by ordinary suit at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-5\">Upon the trial Daniel S. Printup, Esq., a witness for the defendant, testified as follows, to-wit: There was a written contract between the Selma, Rome and Dalton Railroad Company and A. D. Breed, signed in duplicate, Breed taking one copy and the officers of the road the other. Witness had, at some time, but not with reference to this case, applied to the officers of the road in New York for their copy but it was mislaid and he had failed to get it. He had not applied to Breed, who resides in the State of Ohio, for his copy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-6\">Plaintiff, at this point, objected to the witness\u2019 stating the contents of said contract. The objection was overruled, and plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-7\">The Court charged the jury as follows, to-wit: \u201cIf you are satisfied, from the evidence, that Nagle did the work as a mechanic for Breed, and that he whs the lessee of the road, he would be entitled to a verdict. If you think, from the evidence, that plaintiff did not perform the work, and that Breed was not the lessee of the road at the time the work was done, you will find for the defendant. If the evidence shows that Nagle was the contractor merely, and not the mechanic, then, as a contractor, he would not have a right to enforce his claim in 'this way. A mechanic may be a contractor, and if he does work as a mechanic (for others and himself as contractors) for a railroad company, he would be entitled to enforce his lien as a mechanic. A mechanic\u2019s lien is recognized by the Constitution; such a lien attaches at the time the labor is performed and the material furnished. The affidavit, the order of the Judge, the execution, are the means simply by which the lien is enforced.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-8\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff moved for a new trial upon the following, among other grounds, to-wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-9\">1st. Because the Court erred in admitting the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>of Daniel S. Printup, Esq., as to the contents of said written contract. \\</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-4\">2d. Because the verdict was contrary to law and the charge of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-5\">3d. Because the verdict was contrary to the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-6\">The Court sustained the motion and ordered a new trial. Defendant excepted and assigns said rulings as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-7\">Printup &amp; Fouche, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIC\">A contractor has no lien: Footman <em>vs. </em>Pussey, Jones &amp; Co., decided January Term, 1872. Nagle\u2019s lien, if he has any, is upon the property of his employer, viz: Breed\u2019s leasehold interest: Ga. Cons., Art. I., sec. 30; Acts of 1869, 135; 11 Ga. R., 45; 19 Ga.

Although the testimony of Printup, as to the contents of the written contract, was improperly admitted, still, in our judgment, the verdict was right, under the evidence and the law applicable thereto, independent of Printup\u2019s testimony. The laborer or mechanic who <em>does the worlc </em>for his employer, <em>and furnishes the materials, </em>is the person who is entitled to the lien upon the property of his employer, under the provisions of the Act of 1869, and then he is not entitled to a lien on any greater interest in that property than his employer had in it at the time the work was done thereon; his lien is upon <em>the property of his employer </em>for the labor done and materials furnished, under the provisions of the Act. The property levied on to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s lien by the sheriff does not appear, by the sheriff\u2019s entry on the <em>fi. fa., </em>to have been levied upon as the property of the defendant therein, or that he had any interest in the property levied on. If the defendant was the lessee of the railroad, and not the owner of it, then his interest as such lessee of the road could only be levied on and sold for his debts and liabilities to the extent of such an interest as he had in it as such lessee. The verdict being right, under the law and facts of the case, it was error to grant the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">Let the judgment of the Court below be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
