A. Harrison, of said county, did, at the October Term, 1871, of the Superior Court of said county, obtain a judgment against Mark Johnston for $148 20 principal, besides interest and costs, upon which execution was issued and levied upon seven hundred pounds of seed cotton, yielding four ^bales ginned and packed, on November 10th, 1871; the same was sold on the first Tuesday in December, 1871, for $306, which sum is now before the Court in the hands of the sheriff. And, whereas, Sidney O. Shivers did, on November 17th, 1871, sue out his distress warrant, which was levied the same day upon the same cotton by the sheriff, alleging that there was due him, as rent of the land on which said cotton was raised, four bales of lint cotton of the value of $297, besides interest and cost. And, whereas, Alexander Guill did, on November 27th, 1871, sue out and levy, by the sheriff, his distress warrant upon the same cotton, alleging to be due him as rent of the land upon which said cotton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>was produced, four bales of cotton of the value of $297, besides interest and costs. And, whereas, T. O. and D. L. Turner did, on November 14th, 1871, place in the hands of the sheriff a <em>fi.fa. </em>in favor of said firm <em>versus </em>the said Mark Johnston, claiming that said <em>fi. fa., </em>issued upon the foreclosure of a lien for provisions furnished said defendant, in the sum of $147 16, besides interest, costs and attorney\u2019s fees. And on the same day E. P. Clayton &amp; Company placed in the hands of the sheriff of Hancock county their <em>fi. fa., </em>claiming that the same issued upon the foreclosure of a lien against said Johnston, in their favor, for commercial fertilizers furnished, for the sum of $294, besides interest, costs and attorney\u2019s fees. And, whereas, it is agreed between all the parties above mentioned that the laud upon which this cotton, so levied upon and sold, was raised, was the property of Alexander Guill, who, for <em>the </em>year <em>1871, </em>rented the same to Sidney C. Shivers, as will appear by the written contract between said Guill and Shivers, now in Court, and that the said Shivers subsequently, and for the same year, and without the consent of the said Guill, sub-let the land aforesaid to Mark Johnston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\"><em>\u201c </em>Now, for the purpose of procuring a distribution of the fund arising from the sale of said cotton, according to the law, and which fund is in the sheriff\u2019s hands, all the parties to this agreement, while contending for the priority each of his own claim, and resisting the validity of every other claim, and especially the pleadings upon which said claims are based, have agreed upon the above statement of facts, and, waiving a jury, to submit all questions to the decision of the presiding Judge, consenting that he may hear evidence as to attorney\u2019s fees, provided he should hold that the execution which brought the money into Court should not be first paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-6\">(Signed) \u201c C.

If the final judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Court was right, all these are immaterial. We see no error in the action of the Court in refusing to dispose of this money until the landlord could get his distress warrant into shape. The cotton was made on the land, and the lien of the landlord for his rent was the highest claim upon it: Code, section 2260. As to the actual cultivation of the soil, Guill was the landlord \u2014 (see the case of <em>Burnett &amp; Company vs. Rich, </em>January Term, 1872,) \u2014 -and was entitled to the money this cotton sold for. It would be a very lame tribunal, if a Court was compelled to direct money, going properly to one person, to be paid to another, when it was possible, by an hour or two delay, to adjudge it to its right owner. In the distribution of money raised by its own process, even common law Courts sit as Courts of equity, aud especially is that true in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
