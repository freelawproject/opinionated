Beatie filed his bill against James O. Harris, sheriff, and A. M. Perkerson and <em>W. </em>D. Brown, deputy sheriffs, praying that the sale of certain property levied on under a tax execution in the hands of the defendant Brown, be enjoined. The bill and affidavits read on the hearing of the application for injunction made the following case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-8\">Hannibal I. Kimball absconded from the State of Georgia, in the fall of 1871, owing to complainant $3,718 75, and has since remained absent from said State in a hopelessly insolvent condition. At the time Kimball left he owned a large amount of property in the city of Atlanta, including the hotel known as the \u201cH. I. Kimball House.\u201d On November 13th, 1871, complainant sued out an attachment upon the debt due to him, which was levied upon certain personal property belonging to said Kimball. Kimball had not paid his State and county taxes for the year 1871, amounting to $6,000 or $7,000, and being chiefly the taxes due upon the IT. I. Kim-ball House, which was assessed as of the value of $650,000. In January, 1872, the tax collector issued an execution which was immediately placed in the hands of deputy sheriff W. D. Brown, with instructions to collect the taxes from the first money received from the sale of Kimball\u2019s property. On the first Tuesday in February thereafter, A. M. Perkerson, another deputy sheriff, sold the H. I. Kimball House under what were claimed to be mechanics\u2019 liens of Healey, Berry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>&amp; </em>Co. <em>et al., </em>to Dr. Joseph Thompson, B. H. Hill and George Adair, for the sum of $15,010. Brown notified Perkerson before and at the sale, that the said execution was in his hands for collection, and that the money when received must first be applied to its satisfaction. Before the money was paid out Mr. Hill went to Perkerson and subsequently to the tax collector, and proposed that if Perkerson would pay out the money in discharge of the mechanics\u2019 liens first, that he would point out other property upon which no creditor had a lien, from the sale of which the taxes could be made. The tax collector refused to make any such arrangement, as he stated he expected the taxes to be paid from the money already in hand, but Mr. Hill, by indemnifying Perkerson, or by some other means, induced him to appropriate the money to the satisfaction of the mechanics\u2019 liens, and at once caused the tax execution to be levied upon the same property upon which complainant\u2019s attachment had been previously levied. If the proceeds of this property is applied to the satisfaction of the tax execution, complainant will lose his debt. The bill prayed that the sale under said levy be enjoined, and that said tax execution be entered satisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-5\">The Chancellor refused the injunction and complainant excepted, and assigns said ruling as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b460-6\">L.
