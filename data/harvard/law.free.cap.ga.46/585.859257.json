An affidavit by an officer or employee on any steamboat, made under section 1969 of the Code, for the purpose of foreclosing a lien on such boat for any debt that the affiant may have against the owner or lessee of the boat, must state the name of the person or persons owing the debt, as well as eomply with the other requirements of the statute. This is necessary to give the State authorities, who cannot proceed solely <em>in rem. </em>in such a ease, jurisdiction.

Torrent and others had not been satisfied out of the funds arising from the sale of the steamboat Governor Worth. In answer to said rule, the said sheriff showed for cause that the said steamboat had been sold under foreclosure of mortgage, at the instance of the Cape Fear Steamboat Company, and that the sale did not produce a sufficiency of money to pay said execution; and that payment of the above-named <em>fi. fas. </em>was resisted by the said Cape Fear Steamboat Company, upon various grounds.

Hardee, upon proceedings under lien, and also legal costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>After hearing argument, on the 13th of April, 1872, the Court pronounced the following decision :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-5\">\u201cJoseph F. Torrent <em>et al., vs. </em>Steamboat Gov. Worth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-6\">\n<em>Buie against Sheriff.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-7\">\u201c Under a <em>jd. fa., </em>on foreclosure of mortgage at the suit of the Cape Fear Steamboat Company, the steamer Governor Worth was levied on as the property of Robert Erwin and Charles S. Hardee, and sold. Creditors claiming liens against the said steamboat, and owners under the Code, section 1968, intervene and claim a right to the fund superior to. the mortgage, and rule the sheriff. The rule is resisted by the mortgagees on the ground that these creditors have not proceeded to enforce their liens in the manner prescribed by the Code. In the view taken of the Code, and of the decisions in other cases affecting the enforcement of liens on steamboats, I hold that the liens in all the cases before me, which <em>aver a demand upon the agent </em>and name him, sufficiently comply with the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-8\">\u201cThe Code, section 1969, provides that there must be a demand on the owner, agent or lessee, and a refusal to pay, and such demand and refusal must be averred. The disjunctive \u2018 or\u2019 indicates that the demand must be made on the owner <em>or </em>on the agent; a demand on either is sufficient. And in the case in 6 <em>Georgia Reports, </em>the Court says, \u2018the affidavit ought to state that the demand was made, and name the owner <em>or </em>the agent.\u2019 The affidavits before the Court containing this averment are deemed sufficient in this respect. So far as the form of the affidavit made by these lien creditors are concerned, I believe the objection is the failure to give the names of the owners. All the other averments are made in accordance with the statute, except in the affidavit, where no bill of particulars is attached; but in these cases, the amount is stated specifically, and a demand on the agent, and a refusal on his part to pay it, is averred. The sum sworn to be due is not traversed; and, therefore, the absence of the bill of particulars is not, in my opinion, a fatal defect. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>The statute only requires that the amount claimed to be due must be sworn to, and if the amount is not denied, the creditor is entitled to have judgment for the amount sworn to. Defects in the <em>fi. fas. </em>are amendable; but as the filing of the affidavit operates as a judgment in the case, and as these creditors claim, under their liens, a fund brought into Court by other process, it was not necessary that <em>fi. fas. </em>should be issued so as to entitle them to come in and claim the fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-5\"><em>\u201c </em>Let an order be taken in compliance with the above rulings, distributing the fund amongst such of the lien creditors as come within the provisions of section 1968 of the Code.

Error of Clerk in issuing <em>fi. fa. </em>cannot affect lien.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Montgomery, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">1. It is only by considering the proceedings against steamboats under section 1969 of the Code, as proceedings <em>in personam, </em>and not strictly proceedings <em>in rem, </em>that the jurisdiction of the State Courts can be maintained for the enforcement of the liens provided for by the preceding section: 40 <em>Qa., </em>177. If proceedings <em>in personam, </em>necessarily the judgment must be against the <em>person </em>of the debtor. Under the Act of 1870, amendatory of the 1969th section of the Code, the affidavit is the judgment. It follows that the affidavit must set out the names of the owners or lessees, as the case may be, who owe the debt, as well as comply in other respects with the statute. And where the affidavit avers that the demand was made upon the agent, it should state that he is the agent of the pei\u2019sons owing the debt. It is said this is not in strict accordance with the grammatical construction of the section. That the Act says \u201cthere must be a demand on the owner or agent or lessee for payment,\u201d etc., and that this can only mean the owner of the boat, the agent of the boat, etc. Doubtless this is true, but is it anything more than the common figure of speech known to rhetoricians as personification, in which the owners or lessees are represented through the property thus impersonated ? A boat is incapable of having an agent. We speak of the agent of a hotel, of a railroad, etc. Who is the principal in such a case ? True, in proceedings <em>in rem </em>in maritime Courts vessels may be said to have agents. But to take this view of it would be to oust the State Courts of jurisdiction, as already indicated. And unless it is very plain that the Legislature mean to give judgment against one without a hearing, Courts will not give that construction to any Act which may bring about such a result. To hold that a demand upon the agent of the <em>boat, </em>as distinguished from the owner or lessee, is sufficient to authorize this summary proceeding, would be to decide that, in some cases, such a judgment might be rendered \u2014 as, for instance, in case the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>boat is leased, after service rendered by an employee for which he has not been paid, and a demand upon the agent of the boat while so leased. The old Act of 1841 only required that a demand should be made for payment, without stating upon whom or how it was to be made: See second section of the Act, 5 <em>Georgia, </em>197-8. This Court held it must be <em>made personally </em>upon the owners or their agent, and that even a demand upon the captain of the boat was insufficient: <em>Butts et al. vs. Guthbertson, </em>6 <em>Georgia, </em>159; <em>30th, </em>474. In view of these former rulings of this Court, and the very doubtful manifestation of an intention on the part of the Legislature to change the law as thus interpreted, we think that when the Code says <em>\u201c </em>there must be a demand on the owner or agent or lessee for payment and a refusal to pay ; and such demand and refusal must be averred,\u201d that it means a demand upon the agent of the owner or lessee, whichever may owe the debt. 2. The affidavit being the foundation of the proceeding \u2014 the judgment, in fact \u2014 the execution must conform to it, and cannot supply its defects. Where the affidavit contains all the requirements of the law, the execution, if defective, may be made to conform to it by amendment, if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
