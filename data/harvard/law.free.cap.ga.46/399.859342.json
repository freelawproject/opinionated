Where a will, executed in July, 1850, the testator dying in 1859, conveys property in trust, the proceeds to be applied to the benefit of certain slaves, and provides that the survivor shall receive the whole benefit, the clause is inconsistent with the provisions of the fourth section of the Act of 1818, against manumission, and therefore void, (it.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b399-10\">2.

The probate of the will concludes all parties in interest, as does also their acquiescence: 4 Ga. R., 445 ; Code sec. 3519. 2d. The third clause of Mr. Cotton\u2019s will is not contrary to Acts of 1801, 1818: Prince, 787, 794. 3d. Those Acts were only to inhibit four things: 4 Ga. R., 91. 4th. The rule of <em>stare decisis </em>cannot be invoked: 4 Ga. R.; 76; 18 Ga. R., 563; 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Ga. R., 539; 42 Ga. R., 175; 15 Ga.

If the intention of Mr. Cotton cannot be literally carried out, the doctrine of \u201cCypres\u201d should be invoked: Adam\u2019s Eq., 68; Code, secs. 3099,3100. 6th.

The defendant demurred to the bill, on the gound that this clause of the testator\u2019s will was void under the laws of this State, at the time of making it, and at the time of the death of the testator. The Court sustained the demurrer, and refused to grant the injunction; whereupon, the complainants excepted. The fourth section of the Act of 1818 dolares that \u201call and every will and testament, deed, whether by way of trust or otherwise, contract, agreement, or stipulation, or other instrument in writing or by parol, made and executed for the purpose of effecting or endeavoring to effect the manumission of any slave or slaves, either directly, by conferring or attempting to, confer freedom on such slave or slaves, indirectly or virtually, by allowing and securing, or attempting to allow and secure to such slave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>or slaves the right or privilege of working for his, her, or themselves free from the control of the master or owner of such slave or slaves, or of enjoying the profits of his, her, or their labor or skill, shall be and the same are hereby declared to be utterly null and void.\u201d The complainants who were slaves at the time of the death of the testator, are now seeking to enforce that clause of the testator\u2019s will which conveyed the two lots of land to Jones in trust for their use and benefit. This clause of the testator\u2019s will must be construed under the law as it existed at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Whilst we have labored to carry out the intention of the testator, and to secure the property for the benefit of the complainants, if it could be done consistently with the law, still, we are forced to come to the conclusion that the mandatory requirements of the statutes of this State, which must control the question, leaves us no discretion but to declare the third clause of the testator\u2019s will null and void. The enjoyment and control of the profits of the two lots of land by the complainants as slaves, and the application of the property to their use and benefit would have been entirely inconsistent with their condition as such slaves, and in the very teeth of the provisions of the Act of 1818, which was the law of the State when the will took effect at the death of the testator, and must therefore control our judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Let the judgment of the Court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
