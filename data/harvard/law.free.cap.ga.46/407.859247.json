Barrett, as the administrator upon the estate of A. P. Bailey, deceased, filed his bill against Joseph J. Printup and others, creditors of said estate, for the purpose of marshaling the assets, Printup, in his answer, set up that the complainant\u2019s intestate was indebted to him in the sum of $2,893, besides interest on certain promissory notes for the securing the payment of which he elaimed a lien on the Oothcaloga Mills, by virtue of an understanding with said intestate, that if defendant would let him have the money to rebuild said mills, said mills and mill seat should stand good for the sum advanced, and that defendant should have a lien on said property for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-6\">C. D. McCutehen,Esq., was appointed Master in Chancery, and the claim of said Printup referred to him. He made the following report:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-7\">\u201cJ. J. Printup\u2019s four notes are allowed as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-8\">\u201c.Note for principal sum of $1,632, with interest from 1st of May, 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-9\">\u201cNote payable in gold for $200, with interest from 1st of May, 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-10\">\u201cNote for principal sum of $261, with interest from 7th June, 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-11\">\u201cNote for principal sum of $800, with interest from 18th December, 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-12\">\u201cThe said gold note of $200 may be discharged in currency by adding ten per cent, to the principal and interest for the premium on gold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-13\">\u201c I find that these notes of J. J. Printup were given by A. P. Bailey for cash borrowed to be used in and about the construction of the mills known as the Oothcaloga Mills, and that the money was so used, but the testimony did not satisfy me that there was ever any definite or distinct understand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>ing between Bailey and Printup, that Bailey was to give any mortgage or lien to Printup on the mills to secure the payment of the notes; no such lien was in fact ever executed, and the lien claimed by him on said mill property is not allowed, and his claims are to grade only as promissory notes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-5\">Printup excepted to said report. A jury was impanneled to try the issue thus formed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-6\">Defendant introduced the notes above set forth, and offered to prove by E. D. Hudgins that said A. P. Bailey came to witness\u2019 house in the latter part of the spring or first of the summer of 1866, and said that he had gone as far as he could in rebuilding his mills on Oothcaloga creek, which had been burnt during the war, unless he could find a man who would let him have some money; that he had been riding about to find some one, but had failed; asked witness if he knew of any one from whom he could get $2,000 or $3,000; said that if he could find any one who was willing to let him have the money, he would give a lien on the mills and mill property to secure the debt; witness told him that he thought plaintiff had some money, and probably he might get it from him; Bailey said he would go to see him, and if defendant would let him have the money he would give him a lien on his mill, and mill property to secure him, and if necessary, give him a mortgage thereon; that Bailey went off in the direction of Printup\u2019s, and in the evening of the same day came back from towards defendant\u2019s, and told witness that he got about $2,000 from defendant, but had very hard work to get it and could only obtain it by agreeing to let defendant have a lien on said mills and mill property, and that defendant would not let him have the money without an understanding and agreement that he was to have said lien to secure the same; that he felt thankful to defendant for letting him have the money on these terms, as it would enable him to go on rebuilding his mills.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-7\">This evidence was objected to upon the ground that a lien on real estate could not be created and proven by parol contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>and agreement. The objection was sustained, the evidence excluded and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\">The defendant offered to prove substantially the same admissions made by Bailey by the witnesses, J. M. Jones, M. M. .Anderson, J. F. C. Martin, James Staggs, William Chamolin, Jesse Monon, and .........Yanhoru.

Walker, by brief, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZD\">Lien on land is an interest in or concerning it and must be in writing : Code, sec. 1940. This is not an implied trust: Code, sec. 2290. Nor is it an express trust: Code, sec. 2284. Even if fraud were charged it is doubtful whether it would sustain the claim made here: 6th Ga. R., 599. If a party omits to take a writing he must submit to the consequences : 2d Story\u2019s Eq., 768; 1st Vernon, 151; 1st Bro. Ch. R., 565; Hil. on Mor., 453; Coote on Mor., 222.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b410-11\">McCay, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">We have examined the cases referred to as sustaining the claim set up by the plaintiff in error. But none of them go as far as is necessary even to furnish a principle on which this claim can be based. In the case of King\u2019s Heirs <em>vs. </em>Thompson, 9th Peters, 204, the person claiming the lien was in possession, claiming the property in good faith as his own, and had expended money to improve it. And so of all the cases of a claim of lien on this ground. There are some English cases where a lien has been allowed in equity when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the person claiming it can be said to stand within the reason of the rule giving a vendor of real estate a lien where he has taken no security. But as our Code has abolished this vendor\u2019s lien, it seems to follow that, although liens 'which only can be sustained because they come within the equity of the vendor\u2019s lien ought to fall with it. If the greater \u2014 the exemplar \u2014 does not exist, can it be said that the other does ? We do not, therefore, see how this lien can be sustained on general principles of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Had the defendant, in his answer setting up this lien, stated or alleged that it was agreed there should be a written mortgage \u2014 that his money was advanced with this agreement, and that, by some fraud of Bailey or by some accident, the written mortgage was prevented from being executed, there would be some ground to stand on. Fraud or accident opens the door for a reply to the statute of frauds. But see <em>Price vs. Cutts, 29th Georgia, </em>147. But here is no such proof nor any such obligation. It is true, one of the witnesses states that Bailey told him he was to give a mortgage ; but Mr. Printup, who is presumed to have stated his case as strongly in his answer as he could, says nothing of any agreement that there should be a <em>writing. </em>And even if this were stated the element of fraud or accident would still be wanting. The agreement may have been had, that the written mortgage was to be given, and the failure to have it done been mere neglect of both parties. The statute is imperative, that mortgages and express trusts must be in writing : Irwin\u2019s Revised Code, sections 1945-2284. Equity will only interfere when the setting up of the statute would be to protect a <em>fraud </em>or prevent relief against an <em>accident. </em>Neglect\u2014 inattention to one\u2019s own business \u2014 mere failure to see to it that an agreement is made and <em>signed, </em>as stipulated, is not such an accident as equity will relieve against. It does not come to the aid of the sleeper, but of him who, though awake, has been entrapped by fraud or been prevented from getting his agreement put into writing by inevitable accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
