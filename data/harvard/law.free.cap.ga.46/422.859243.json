C.

Woolfolk, Walker <em>&amp; </em>Company, thereby releasing defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-8\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs for the sum of $1,353 27, with interest from February 2d, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-9\">The defendant moved for a new trial upon the following grounds, to-wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-10\">1st. Because the Court erred in charging the jury that \u201cthe instrument sued on was a bill of exchange drawn by R. F.

F. Woolfolk could not set it up as a defense to this action, or plead it as a set-off to the draft sued on, though it was proved that Woolfolk, Walker &amp; Company were insolvent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-12\">3d. Because the Court erred in refusing to charge, as requested by defendant, that \u201cif plaintiffs had given to Wool-folk, Walker &amp; Company time upon the draft sued on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>without the consent of R. F. Woolfolk, who was only an accommodation drawer, he was relieved from liability thereby,\u201d and in giving such charge with the qualification, <em>\u201c </em>that the time given must be a specified time, during which plaintiffs could not sue.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\">4th. Because the Court erred in refusing to charge the jury, as requested by defendant, that \u201c if plaintiffs sued out a possessory warrant for the cotton, under which one of the firm of Woolfolk, Walker <em>&amp; </em>Company was arrested, and such warrant was dismissed without the consent of R. F. Woolfolk, he being an accommodation drawer, he was relieved from liability thereby,\u201d and in giving such charge with the qualification, \u201cthat to relieve such accommodation drawer, it must be made to appear that the cotton had been seized under the warrant before its dismissal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">It was admitted that Woolfolk, Walker <em>&amp; </em>Company had been declared bankrupts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b424-7\">Whittle <em>&amp; </em>Gustin, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5M\">submitted the following brief: 1. The charge of the Court, that \u201cthe instrument sued on was a bill of exchange, drawn by R. F. Woolfolk, and accepted by Woolfolk, Walker <em>&amp; </em>Company, and if the acceptors failed to pay it when due, the drawer was bound to do so,\u201d is erroneous, and the verdict of the jury is contrary to the law and evidence. Plant &amp; Son were bound to use every means in their power to secure the application of the cotton to the payment of the draft, Woolfolk having become liable, at least to some extent, upon the representations made by them, and being only a surety under section 2123 of the Code: Matheson <em>vs. </em>Jones, 30 Ga., 306. Dismissing the possessory warrant instead of using the means pointed out by law to force the production of the cotton, and extending the time of payment, even indefinitely, were such acts as increased the risk of the surety, and therefore discharged him: Code, section 2126; Toomer <em>vs. </em>Dickinson, 37 Ga., 428. 2. The usurious interest paid by Woolfolk, Walker <em>&amp; </em>Company to Plant &amp; Son constituted an equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>set-off, and was a good defense, <em>pro tanto, </em>and should have been deducted from the amount recovered: Code, sec. 3084; Mordecai <em>vs. </em>Stewart, 37 Ga., 364; Pope <em>vs. </em>Solomon, 36 Ga., 541.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b425-5\">Lanier &amp; Anderson,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amm\">represented by R. E. Lyon, submitted the following brief: There is no certificate of the presiding Judge that his charge is correctly set out in the motion for a new trial in this case. We claim, therefore, that the only two questions to be considered are: 1st. Did the Court do right to allow the jury, who had found generally for the plaintiffs, to insert, after they came into Court, the amount of their finding in the verdict? See 17 Ga., 340. 2d. Is the verdict contrary to law and the evidence? The pleas were three in number \u2014 first, that the signature of Woolfolk to the draft was procured by the false representations of Plant; second, that Woolfolk, being a surety, had been discharged by indulgence given to the acceptors of the draft; third, that the acceptors had, in other transactions with Plant &amp; Son, paid them large amounts of usurious interest, (the plea names no sum whatever,) which Woolfolk claims as an equitable set-off, the acceptors being insolvent. The evidence was, to say the least of it, conflicting as to the first two pleas, and the verdict as to them will not, therefore, be disturbed. As to the third, (the usury plea,) it may be remarked, first, that it is too defective to justify any evidence being allowed under it, and second, that Woolfolk, the drawer, was not entitled to credit for usury the acceptors had paid in other transactions with which he was not connected: 1 Kelly, 140. The proof showed that the acceptors were bankrupts. If Plant &amp; Son owed them for usury paid, it was a part of their assets in bankruptcy, and belonged to the assignee. If the Court shall review the alleged charge of Judge Cole, we cite, in support of his charge relative to the liability of a drawer of a bill of exchange, complained of in the first ground of the motion for a new trial: Ross on Bills, etc., rnarg. pp., 12 and 13; Byles on Bills, pp. 2 and 3. In support of the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>relative to usury, complained of in the second ground of the motion, we cite: 1 Kelly, 140. See, also, what is said above in reference to the right of the assignee in bankruptcy to sue for usury paid. In support of the charges relative to indulgence given the acceptors, complained of in the third and fourth grounds of the motion, we cite: Smith\u2019s Mercantile Law, 582, 583; 22 Ga., 385; 30 Ga., 112, 249.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b426-5\">Montgomery, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">If ordinarily a surety is entitled, when sued on the debt upon which he is surety, to set-off usury paid by his principal to the creditor on contracts other than the one sued on, (as to which see <em>Whitehead vs. </em>Peck, 1 <em>Kelly, </em>140; <em>Mordecai vs. Stewart, </em>37 <em>Georgia, </em>364,) he certainly is not entitled to do so after his principal has been adjudged a bankrupt. The fourteenth section of the Bankrupt Act provides that \u201call debts due the bankrupt * * * shall, in virtue of the adjucation of bankruptcy and the appointment of his assignee, be at once vested in such assignee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">2. Indulgence to the principal, to discharge the surety, must be for a definite period and for a valuable consideration : Parnell vs. Price, 3 Rich., 121; Washington vs. Gary, 7 S. &amp; Marshall, 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">3. We do not see how the dismissal of the possessory warrant increased the risk of the accommodation indorser in this case. It had failed to perform its office \u2014 the cotton was not to be found ; nor did it appear that it was <em>\u201c </em>in the possession, power, custody or control of the defendant, or any agent or friend of his, or any one acting for or entrusted with the same for him.\u201d What, then, was to be done? The defendant could not be imprisoned \u2014 the cotton was not to be found. The warrant had expended its force and could be of no further service. Its dismissal did no damage. Upon all the points taken we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
