He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his <em>pro se </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-24\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number><em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cWe review de <em>novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant who was sentenced pursuant to a guideline range \u201cthat has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding \u201cdoes not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing.\u201d <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220. In considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis. \u201cFirst, the district court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s guideline sentencing range based upon the relevant amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines; none of the other guideline determinations made during the original sentencing may be reconsidered or altered.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 927 (11th Cir.2009). Second, the district court must decide whether in its discretion, based on the 3553(a) factors, \u201cto impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended guidelines or retain the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). This requirement, however, \u201cis triggered only by an amendment ... that lowers the applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">\u201c[A] reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where \u2018the amendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g. a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (emphasis omitted)). This is true because, to the extent that the mandatory minimum is greater than a portion of the guideline range, the mandatory minimum replaces its lower boundary, and where the mandatory minimum \u201cis greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range,\u201d it becomes the guideline sentence. <em>See United States v. Pope, </em>58 F.3d 1567, 1568 n. 1 (11th Cir.1995); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b), (c)(2); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1341-42 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a defendant sentenced to the statutory minimum was not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Saldana contends that he was entitled to a sentence reduction based on Amendments 599 and 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. \u201cAmendment 599 was enacted in order to clarify under what circumstances a weapons enhancement may properly be applied to an underlying offense when the defendant has also been convicted for the use or possession of a firearm pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).... \u201d <em>United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1179 (11th Cir.2003). Amendment 706 reduced by two levels the base offense level for crack cocaine sentences calculated pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e). <em>See Smith, </em>568 F.3d at 926. The district court was not authorized to reduce Saldana\u2019s sentence based on those amendments. Saldana had two prior felony drug convictions, and thus he was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 851. Because his sentence was not based on the sentencing guidelines, he was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28; <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1341-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Saldana also contends that the district court should have reduced his sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>tence based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and because the government failed to satisfy the notice requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. We will not address those arguments because a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 782 (concluding that a district court may not consider extraneous resentencing issues, including constitutional claims, during \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings). The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Saldana\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
