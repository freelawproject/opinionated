Johnson argues that the district court erred in (1) dismissing her complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, (2) failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on Ocwen Loan Servicing\u2019s (\u201cOcwen\u2019s\u201d) motion to dismiss, (3) denying her motions for recusal, (4) denying her motion for reconsideration, and (5) allowing Ocwen to charge her $600 to enter into a settlement agreement that Ocwen later rescinded. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Johnson, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a complaint against Ocwen alleging violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692 <em>et seq.; </em>the Real Estate and Settlement Procedure Act (\u201cRESPA\u201d), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601, <em>et seq.; </em>the Truth in Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601, <em>et seq.; </em>the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, 815 ILL. Comp. Stat. 505/1, <em>et seq.; </em>\u201cviolations under Mortgage Servicing Rights, and violations under the Office of Thrift Supervision, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.1, <em>et seq.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Johnson asserted in her complaint that Ocwen had acquired a mortgage on an East Saint Louis residence belonging to her mother who, in 1958, divorced her husband and changed her name to Ida Mae Pai'ks. In 2003, and again in 2007, Parks transferred the East Saint Louis property to Johnson and Johnson\u2019s sister, Grace Christian Goss, via a quitclaim deed. Johnson contended that, when Ocwen acquired the mortgage, it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJa\">immediately began failing to post payments, failing to acknowledge [the] name change of Ida Mae Johnson to Ida Mae Parks, refused to acknowledge [the] Quit Claim Deed, refused to acknowledge [the] Assumption Request for Paula Johnson and Grace Goss to assume the mortgage, changed the payment due date from the 15th to the 6th of each month, ... and placfed] forced insurance on [the] property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Ocwen filed a motion to dismiss Johnson\u2019s complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), asserting that Johnson lacked standing to bring the lawsuit, because Johnson was not the debtor and had no legal obligation on the loan. Ocwen argued that Johnson lacked standing to bring suit under the FDCPA, RESPA, TILA, and the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, because she was not a \u201cconsumer\u201d or \u201cborrower\u201d on the loan, and was not otherwise obligated on the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">Johnson filed a \u201cmotion for leave of court to resolve defendant\u2019s settlement proposal,\u201d in which she stated that she had paid Ocwen $600.00 in connection with a written settlement proposal. Ocwen responded that it had extended a written settlement offer to Johnson, but the offer had not been accepted and had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Johnson filed a subsequent \u201cmotion for leave of court to resolve defendant\u2019s settlement proposal,\u201d in which she requested 30 days in which to resolve a written settlement proposal. The court denied both of Johnson\u2019s motions, noting that Ocwen had informed the court that the settlement offer had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">Johnson then submitted an \u201caffidavit,\u201d stating that she had not been notified that any settlement proposal had been withdrawn or denied, and that she paid Ocwen $600. She attached to the document a letter from Ocwen to Parks, which stated that Ocwen would agree to modify Parks\u2019s mortgage if it received a $600 down payment and Johnson and Parks signed a settlement and release agreement dismissing their claims against Ocwen. The letter stated that if Parks did not contact Ocwen to accept the offer by close of business on March 18, 2009, it would proceed with defending the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">Johnson filed a motion in opposition to Ocwen\u2019s motion to dismiss, arguing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>the court had jurisdiction to consider her claim because it involved a federal question, there was complete diversity between the parties, and the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000. Johnson attached to her motion a January 5, 2009 letter from Ocwen to Johnson, which stated that Ocwen had received Johnson\u2019s request for an assumption packet, but had determined, after review, that the loan was not assumable.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Johnson filed a motion \u201cto appear tele-phonically\u201d and \u201cto set pending matters for hearing,\u201d arguing that she was legally disabled, air flight travel expenses would create a financial hardship for her, and her communications and arguments would be brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The district court denied Johnson\u2019s motion to appear telephonically and to hold a hearing, finding that Ocwen\u2019s motion to dismiss did not require a hearing and that such a hearing would not be an \u201cappropriate expenditure of the Court\u2019s time and resources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">The district court granted Ocwen\u2019s motion to dismiss, finding that Johnson failed to show the she had standing, because the statutes cited in her complaint protected specific groups of individuals, and Johnson was not a member of these groups. It dismissed Johnson\u2019s complaint with leave to file an amended complaint demonstrating standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Johnson filed an amended complaint, asserting that Ocwen violated \u00a7\u00a7 805-809 and 812 of the FDCPA, \u00a7 6 of the RESPA, the TILA, and the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. She also contended that Ocwen committed \u201cMortgage Servicing Rights\u201d violations by \u201crefus[ing] to supply an annual statement outlining the duties that were performed.\u201d Johnson asserted that Ocwen misapplied mortgage payments; charged bogus late fees and charges; prematurely launched foreclosure proceedings against homeowners; and forced high-cost homeowners insurance on borrowers despite receiving evidence that the borrowers already had insurance. She contended that Ocwen committed \u201coffice of thrift supervision violations\u201d by \u201cengaging] in false and misleading statements or omissions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">The district court dismissed Johnson\u2019s amended complaint. The court noted that Johnson\u2019s amended complaint failed to set forth facts showing that she had standing and failed to explain how Ocwen violated the cited statutes. It found that, because Johnson lacked standing, she failed to state a claim, and, therefore, the amended complaint was \u201cdue to be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).\u201d The court dismissed Johnson\u2019s complaint with prejudice, finding that no additional attempts to amend her complaint were warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">After the dismissal, Johnson filed a motion for recusal, arguing that the presiding judge\u2019s denial of her request to appear telephonically and to hold a hearing violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, because it deprived her of meaningful access to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">The district court denied Johnson\u2019s motion for recusal, stating that its denial of Johnson\u2019s motion to appear telephonically was based on its determination that no hearing was needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">Johnson then filed a \u201ctertiary recusal motion,\u201d asserting that the court was aware that Johnson and Parks were legally disabled and resided over a thousand miles away from the court, but nevertheless directed her and Parks \u201cto appear in person at any and all proceedings,\u201d in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">The district court denied Johnson\u2019s \u201ctertiary motion for recusal,\u201d again noting that it denied Johnson\u2019s motion to appear tele-phonically because it did not find just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>cause to conduct a hearing on Ocwen\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">Johnson filed a motion for reconsideration, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), stating that the district court abused its discretion in failing to refer her motions for recusal to another judge for resolution on the merits. She also asserted that Ocwen had misrepresented to the court that there was never a settlement proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The court denied Johnson\u2019s motion for reconsideration, again noting that it did not hold a hearing because one was not needed. The court also noted that it was not aware of any requirement that it refer motions for recusal to another judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">\n<em>Dismissal of Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Under section 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), a district court may dismiss a case filed <em>in forma pauperis </em>at any time if it \u201cfails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). A plaintiffs complaint \u201cshould not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of [her] claim which would entitle [her] to relief.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Mashburn, </em>746 F.2d 782, 784 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Questions of standing are reviewed <em>de novo. Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. Fla. State Athletic Comm\u2019n, </em>226 F.3d 1226, 1228 (11th Cir.2000). Standing involves both constitutional and prudential requirements. <em>Harris v. Evans, </em>20 F.3d 1118, 1121 (11th Cir.1994). To satisfy Article Ill\u2019s case or controversy requirement, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that she has suffered injury in fact; (2) that the injury is fairly traceable to the actions of the defendant; and (3) that the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. <em>Bennett v. Spear, </em>520 U.S. 154, 162, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 1161, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997). \u201cThose who do not possess Art. III standing may not litigate as suitors in the courts of the United States.\u201d <em>Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United, </em>454 U.S. 464, 475-76, 102 S.Ct. 752, 760, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">The prudential limits on standing provide that: (1) the plaintiff must assert her own rights and interests and may not rely on the rights and interests of others; (2) the federal courts will not adjudicate \u201cabstract questions of wide public significance\u201d amounting to \u201cgeneralized grievances,\u201d which are more appropriately resolved by the legislative branches; and (3) the plaintiffs complaint must fall within the \u201czone of interests\u201d to be protected by the statute in question. <em>Id., </em>454 U.S. at 475, 102 S.Ct. at 760. Although plaintiffs generally may assert only their own legal rights and interests, a plaintiff may bring an action on behalf of a third party if: (1) the plaintiff suffered an injury in fact so as to have a sufficient concrete interest in the case; (2) the plaintiff has a close relationship to the party; and (3) the third party faces an obstacle to protecting her own interests. <em>Harris, </em>20 F.3d at 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-15\">Johnson\u2019s amended complaint fails to establish Article III standing, because Johnson was not a borrower or otherwise obligated on the Ocwen loan and, therefore, did not suffer an injury-in-fact. <em>See Bennett, </em>520 U.S. at 162, 117 S.Ct. at 1161; <em>Stalley ex rel. U.S. v. Orlando Regional Healthcare Sys., Inc., </em>524 F.3d 1229, 1232 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that plaintiffs complaint must allege, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201can injury in fact \u2014 a harm suffered by the plaintiff that is concrete and actual or imminent,\u201d to establish Article III standing). In her complaint, Johnson asserts that Ocwen\u2019s conduct resulted in the following injuries: \u201cfraudulent overcharges, fraudulent service, fraudulent late fees, fraudulent escrow fees, harassment, loss or destruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>of borrower[\u2019]s insurance documents, placing insurance on an insured property, loss or destruction of borrower[\u2019]s tax documents, loss or destruction of borrower[\u2019]s court documents.\u201d Although Parks may have suffered these injuries, Johnson herself did not, because she was not a party to the loan. In fact, Johnson admitted in her original complaint that her name was never added to the loan, and the supporting documents that she submitted to the court confirm this.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Johnson also failed to meet the prudential requirements for standing, because she failed to show that her complaint was within the \u201czone of interests\u201d protected by the statutes she cited. <em>See Valley Forge, </em>454 U.S. at 475, 102 S.Ct. at 760. The specific provisions of the FDCPA that Johnson cites in her amended complaint\u2014 \u00a7\u00a7 805-09 and 812 \u2014 protect \u201cconsumers\u201d from abusive debt collection practices and other deceptive actions taken by creditors. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692c-g, 1692j. Section 6 of the RESPA specifically provides that \u201c[wjhoever fails to comply with any provision of this section shall be liable <em>to the bomwer </em>for each such failure.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(f) (emphasis added). The TILA provides a \u201ccivil cause of action <em>by a consumer </em>against a creditor who fails to make the required disclosures.\u201d <em>Tower v. Moss, </em>625 F.2d 1161 (5th Cir.1980) (emphasis added); <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a). Similarly, the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act protects \u201cconsumers,\u201d meaning \u201cany person who purchases or contracts for the purchase of merchandise.\u201d 815 III. Comp. Stat. 505/l(e). Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding that, because Johnson was not a debtor or \u201cconsumer\u201d of the loan, she was not protected by the statutes she cited and, therefore, lacked standing. Furthermore, Johnson was not entitled to bring an action on Parks\u2019s behalf, because, although she is closely related to Parks, Johnson failed to show that she suffered an injury in fact or that Parks faced an obstacle to protecting her own interests. <em>See Harris, </em>20 F.3d at 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">As noted above, a plaintiffs complaint \u201cshould not be dismissed [under section 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) ] unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Mashburn, </em>746 F.2d 782, 784 (11th Cir.1984). Here, it was clear that Johnson could prove no set of facts that would entitle her to relief, because she was not a party to the Ocwen loan and, therefore, lacked standing to bring any claim based on that loan. In both her first and her amended complaint, the only claims Johnson raised were based on the Ocwen loan. Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Johnson\u2019s complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">\n<em>Failure to Hold Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to rule on a motion to dismiss without an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion. <em>Sunseri v. Macro Cellular Partners, </em>412 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2005). The district court has \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in resolving jurisdictional issues and \u201cmay determine these issues by receiving affidavits, interrogatories, depositions, oral testimony, or any combination of the recognized methods of discovery.\u201d <em>Washington v. Norton Mfg., Inc., </em>588 F.2d 441, 443 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Johnson\u2019s request for a hearing. In her motion requesting a hearing, Johnson did not explain why a hearing should be held or what evidence she would present at such a hearing. Furthermore, because Johnson\u2019s complaint clearly showed that she lacked standing, the court reasonably determined that a hearing was not necessary. Because no hearing was held, the district court com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>mitted no error in denying Johnson\u2019s request to appear telephonieally.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">\n<em>Denial of Motions for Recusal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">A judge\u2019s denial of a motion to recuse himself is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 828 (11th Cir.2007). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), a federal judge must \u201cdisqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). \u201cUnder \u00a7 455(a), recusal is appropriate only if an objective, disinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 828 (quotations omitted). To disqualify a judge under \u00a7 455, the bias \u201cmust stem from extrajudicial sources, unless the judge\u2019s acts demonstrate such pervasive bias and prejudice that it unfairly prejudices one of the parties.\u201d <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>175 F.3d 966, 968 (11th Cir.1999) (quotations omitted). \u201c[Ajdverse rulings alone do not provide a party with a basis for holding that the court\u2019s impartiality is in doubt.\u201d <em>Byrne v. Nezhat, </em>261 F.3d 1075, 1103 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Here, the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Johnson\u2019s motions for recusal. Johnson failed to show that, under \u00a7 455, the judge was impartial or had a personal bias or prejudice against her. Johnson\u2019s claims of bias were based solely on the judge\u2019s denial of her motion to appear telephonieally and hold a hearing on Ocwen\u2019s motion to dismiss. However, this single adverse ruling is insufficient to establish that the judge was impartial. <em>See Byrne, </em>261 F.3d at 1103. Furthermore, the court explained that it denied Johnson\u2019s motion because it determined that a hearing was unnecessary. As noted above, the district court did not abuse its discretion in making that determination. Accordingly, because Johnson failed to show a bias stemming from an extrajudicial source, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for judicial recusal. <em>See Bailey, </em>175 F.3d at 968.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">\n<em>Denial of Motion for Reconsideration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">The denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Crapp v. City of Miami Beach, </em>242 F.3d 1017, 1019 (11th Cir.2001). Rule 60(b) provides that the district court may relieve a party from a final judgment or order based on, <em>inter alia, </em>mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; fraud, misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party; \u201cany other reason that justifies relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1), (3), (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">The district court has broad discretion in ruling on a Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Cano v. Baker, </em>435 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2006). A motion pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6) must demonstrate \u201cthat the circumstances are sufficiently extraordinary to warrant relief. Even then, whether to grant the requested relief is ... a matter for the district court\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d <em>Toole v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>235 F.3d 1307, 1317 (11th Cir.2000) (quotations omitted). We will not reverse a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b)(6) motion on appeal unless the appellant demonstrates that the district court was required to grant relief. <em>Cano, </em>435 F.3d at 1342.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">In her Rule 60(b) motion, Johnson requested relief from the district court\u2019s orders denying her motion for a hearing and her motion for recusal. As explained above, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Johnson\u2019s motion for a hearing and her motion for recusal. Because Johnson failed to show that the district court erred in denying these motions, she falls far short of demonstrating that the district court was required to grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>relief. <em>See Cano, </em>435 F.3d at 1342. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Johnson\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">\n<em>Settlement Agreement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">\u201cFailure to raise an issue, objection or theory of relief in the first instance to the trial court is generally fatal.\u201d <em>Denis v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>791 F.2d 846, 848-49 (11th Cir.1986). \u201cAs a general rule, an appellate court will not review a legal issue or theory not presented to the trial court, unless the issue is a pure question of law and the court\u2019s failure to consider it would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>NAACP v. Hunt, </em>891 F.2d 1555, 1563 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">We decline to exercise our jurisdiction to review Johnson\u2019s claim, because failure to consider the issue does not result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>Id. </em>First, although Johnson informed the district court that Ocwen had extended a settlement offer, she never requested that the court take action against Ocwen for extending a fraudulent offer. Second, the plain language of the settlement letter states that Johnson and Parks were required to sign a settlement and release agreement and contact Ocwen\u2019s counsel prior to 5:00 p.m. on March 18, 2009, in addition to making a $600 \u201cdown payment\u201d in order to accept the offer. Johnson does not allege that she signed the settlement and release agreement or contacted Ocwen\u2019s counsel to accept the offer. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Johnson\u2019s complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
