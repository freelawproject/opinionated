Popock appeals the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of his application for disability insurance benefits. The ALJ found that Popock had these \u201csevere impairments: Crohn\u2019s disease, lumbar disk disease, coronary heart disease, status post vessel bypass, plantar fasciitis, status post shoulder surgery, polyarthralgia, status post inguinal hernia, hypertension, and hy-perlipidemia.\u201d The ALJ also found, however, that the residual functional capacity assessments of Popock\u2019s treating physicians were not consistent with the medical evidence in the record, and he credited the assessments made by state agency medical consultants instead.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on that, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>ALJ concluded that Popock could perform light work, including his past work as a general manager or as a vice president of a textile company, which he had performed for twenty-one years.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">The Appeals Council denied Popock\u2019s request for review, making ALJ\u2019s decision the final decision of the Commissioner. <em>See Lewis v. Barnhart, </em>285 F.3d 1329, 1330 (11th Cir.2002). Popock sought review of that decision in district court. After the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation concluding that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s determination that Po-pock is not disabled and that he has the residual functional capacity to perform a full range of light work. Neither party filed objections, and the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision. This is Popock\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">The Commissioner contends that this appeal should be dismissed because Popock failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. When there are no objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, we review the findings of fact only for plain error or manifest injustice, but we still review <em>de novo </em>the report\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>See United States v. Roberts, </em>858 F.2d 698, 701 (11th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Warren, </em>687 F.2d 347, 348 (11th Cir.1982). The magistrate judge and the district court reviewed the ALJ\u2019s decision to determine if it was supported by substantial evidence. That review resulted in a legal conclusion instead of findings of fact, so despite Popock\u2019s failure to file objections, we review the ALJ\u2019s decision under the same standard. <em>See Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cOur standard of review is, as it is for the district court, whether the ALJ\u2019s conclusion as a whole was supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">Popock contends that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s determination that Popock is not disabled and that he has the residual functional capacity to perform the \u201clight work\u201d that he used to do. He argues that only the state agency\u2019s non-examining medical consultants concluded that he could perform light work, which is not enough to rebut the contrary opinions of his treating physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">In determining whether Popock was disabled based on impairments that met or equaled a listed impairment, the ALJ had good cause to determine that the opinions of Dr. Gieseke, one of Popock\u2019s examining and treating physicians, should be given less weight than the assessment of Dr. Griscom, the internist the ALJ appointed to evaluate Popock\u2019s medical records.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Gieseke had treated Popock infrequently, his assessment was inconsistent with his limited treatment notes, and medical evidence in the record supported a contrary finding. <em>See Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2004). The ALJ also did not err when he discounted the opinions of Dr. Feiss, another treating physician. The medical evidence did not support Dr. Feiss\u2019 residual functional capacity assessment, which was even more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>restrictive than Dr. Gieseke\u2019s. <em>See id. </em>(holding that good cause exists to accord less than substantial weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion when the evidence does not support the opinion or supports a contrary finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Dr. Griscom\u2019s assessment stated that Popock was a \u201c58 year old gentleman [who] has done well overall despite contending with some difficult and chronic problems.\u201d He determined that Popock could stand or walk at least 2 hours and could sit for about 6 hours in an 8-hour workday but that he would have to alternate sitting and standing to relieve pain or discomfort. Dr. Griscom concluded that Popock could \u201cdo at least sedentary work and possibly light work if suitably structured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Light work is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-7\">Light work involves lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds. Even though the weight lifted may be very little, a job is in this category when it requires a good deal of walking or standing, or when it involves sitting most of the time with some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls. To be considered capable of performing a full or wide range of light work, you must have the ability to do substantially all of these activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567. In addition, \u201clight work requires standing or walking, off and on, for a total of approximately 6 hours of an 8-hour workday.\u201d SSR 83-10, 1983 WL 31251.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">The ALJ found that \u201c[t]he medical review that Dr. Griscom provided is an accurate summary of [Popock\u2019s] various medical conditions.\u201d The ALJ also concluded, however, that \u201cDr. Griscom\u2019s assessment is slightly more restrictive than warranted.\u201d He did not explain why. Instead, he \u201cacceptfed] the residual functional capacity assigned by the state agency medical consultants,\u201d who concluded that Popock could perform the activities required for the full range of light work, including standing or walking for 6 hours in an 8-hour workday.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">None of the examining physicians determined that Popock had the residual functional capacity to perform light work. <em>See Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999) (explaining that if the claimant fails to show his impairments meet or equal a listed impairment, he must show that he is unable to perform his past relevant work). Dr. Griscom offered only a conditional opinion that Popock \u201cpossibly\u201d could perform light work in a \u201csuitably structured environment,\u201d and he concluded that Popock could stand or walk for 2 hours out of a 6 hour workday, which is inconsistent with the requirements for light work. <em>See </em>SSR 83-10. Only the non-examining state agency consultants determined that Popock could perform light work. The assessment forms filled out by those medical consultants, Andriole James and Gary Cater, do not indicate whether they are medical doctors. On both forms the space for \u201cmedical consultant\u2019s code\u201d is blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">Even if the consultants are physicians, \u201c[t]he good cause required before the treating physicians\u2019 opinions may be accorded little weight is not provided by the report of a nonexamining physician where it contradicts the report of the treating physician.\u201d <em>Lamb v. Bowen, </em>847 F.2d 698, 703 (11th Cir.1988). Furthermore, the ALJ offered no explanation for his decision to adopt the consultants\u2019 assessment over Dr. Griscom\u2019s, except to say that Dr. Gris-com\u2019s assessment was \u201cslightly more restrictive than warranted.\u201d Substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s decision to credit the opinions of the non-examining, state agency medical consultants over the other medical evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">The ALJ erred when he determined that Popock had the residual functional capaci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>ty to perform light work. We reverse and remand for further proceedings to determine whether, in light of Popock\u2019s inability to perform light work, there are jobs in the national economy that he can still perform. <em>See Jackson v. Bowen, </em>801 F.2d 1291, 1293 (11th Cir.1986) (\u201cIf the claimant cannot perform his past work, the burden shifts to the [Commissioner] to prove that other work exists in the national economy which the claimant can perform.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-19\">. \" 'Residual functional capacity' is a determination of a claimant\u2019s remaining physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>abilities to perform work.\u201d <em>Walker v. Bowen, </em>826 F.2d 996, 1000 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b926-8\">. At the first hearing on this matter, the ALJ observed that Popock had \"an extremely good work record\u201d and that there were \"no questions [Popock has] got multiple problems.\u201d Because Popock had \"so many medical issues,\u201d the ALJ sent his medical records to an internist to evaluate whether Popock was disabled, and there was a second hearing after Dr. Griscom completed that assessment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
