On appeal, Cruz argues that the district court erred when it added one criminal history point for a sentence imposed following a February 2005 Georgia misdemeanor conviction for possession of alcoholic beverages by a person below the legal age. He asserts that this conviction was presumptively void because he was not represented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>by counsel when he pled guilty, and did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to counsel. Cruz also argues that his 80-month sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">We review a district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Baker, </em>116 F.3d 870, 872 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">As a general rule, a sentencing court may not examine the constitutionality of a prior state court conviction being used to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>203 F.3d 1279, 1287 (11th Cir.2000). Nevertheless, when a defendant \u201csufficiently asserts facts that show that an earlier conviction is \u2018presumptively void,\u2019 the Constitution requires the sentencing court to review this earlier conviction before taking it into account.\u201d <em>United States v. Roman, </em>989 F.2d 1117, 1120 (11th Cir.1993) <em>(en </em>banc). The defendant must present enough to \u201clay a factual foundation for collateral review\u201d of the prior conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">The Supreme Court has held that an indigent criminal defendant does not have a right to appointed counsel in a case involving a misdemeanor conviction for which no term of imprisonment was imposed. <em>Scott v. Illinois, </em>440 U.S. 367, 373-74, 99 S.Ct. 1158, 59 L.Ed.2d 383 (1979). In so holding, the Court explained that \u201cactual imprisonment is a penalty different in kind from fines or the mere threat of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373, 99 S.Ct. 1158. The Supreme Court additionally has held that \u201can uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, valid under <em>Scott </em>because no prison term was imposed,\u201d may be used to enhance a defendant\u2019s punishment following a subsequent conviction. <em>Nichols v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 738, 749, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 128 L.Ed.2d 745 (1994). Based on these Supreme Court decisions, we have held that a district court should include uncounseled misdemeanor sentences for which no term of imprisonment was imposed in calculating a defendant\u2019s criminal history score. <em>Baker, </em>116 F.3d at 872; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (backg\u2019d) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">In this case, Cruz challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of one point to his criminal history score based upon his February 2005 Georgia misdemeanor conviction and sentence of a $200.00 fine for possession of alcoholic beverages by a person below the legal age. Based on Supreme Court and this circuit\u2019s precedent, even if Cruz was not represented by counsel when he pled guilty to the misdemean- or charge, he was only sentenced to pay a $200.00 fine, and thus, the district court did not err in adding one criminal history point for that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">Cruz also challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence. We review a sentence imposed by a district court for reasonableness, using an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>587 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2009). In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we must ensure, first, \u201cthat the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. <em>586, 169 </em>L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court is not required to specifically discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, provided that it is clear from the record that the court considered all of the factors. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number><em>States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">In this case, the district court followed the proper procedures in determining Cruz\u2019s sentence. Although Cruz asserts that the court focused exclusively on his criminal history, and failed to consider the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court stated that it had given careful consideration to all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and specifically cited the nature and circumstances of the offense, Cruz\u2019s history and characteristics, and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, provide deterrence, and protect the public. Thus, the record indicates that the court considered all of the statutory factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">We also cannot state that Cruz\u2019s 80-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. Cruz was removed to Mexico in April of 2007 after he was convicted of an aggravated assault charge which stemmed from an incident where he had fired a gun at a moving vehicle. Cruz returned to the United States shortly after his removal, and continued his involvement in criminal activity becoming involved with SUR-13, a criminal street gang. He was arrested on a second aggravated assault charge after he allegedly fired a handgun at three individuals. We cannot state that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing Cruz to a term of 80 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
