After review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">Iquique first asserts the Immigration Judge (IJ) erred when it denied his motion to reopen his asylum proceedings. We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, because the BIA did not adopt any part of the IJ\u2019s opinion, we do not review the IJ\u2019s opinion and Iquique\u2019s arguments pertaining to the IJ\u2019s errors are irrelevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">Iquique also asserts the BIA violated his statutory and due process right to file a motion to reopen with the IJ because 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3(e) is <em>\u201cultra vires </em>\u201d to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A). We review constitutional challenges <em>de novo. Contreras-Rodriguez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>462 F.3d 1314, 1316 (11th Cir.2006). Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), an \u201calien may file one motion to reopen\u201d his proceedings. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3(a)(1) provides that a party affected by an IJ\u2019s decision may appeal that decision by filing a Notice of Appeal with the BIA. However, \u201c[departure from the United States of a person who is the subject of deportation proceedings, prior to the taking of an appeal from a decision in his or her case, shall constitute a waiver of his or her right to appeal\u201d with the BIA. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1003.3(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">Iquique asserts the Attorney General went beyond the scope of its statutory authority, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), when it enacted a regulation that waived his right to file an appeal from outside the United States. However, Iquique has not presented any arguments that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3(e) exceeds the Attorney General\u2019s power to create regulations that govern immigration appeals. The BIA\u2019s authority comes from various statutes that permit the Attorney General to create an Executive Office for Immigration Review, 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 521(a), and the Attorney General\u2019s power to establish regulations and review administrative determinations in immigrations proceedings, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(g)(1), (2). Iquique\u2019s argument that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a prevents the Attorney General from promulgating 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1103 is unpersuasive as 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a deals with motions to reopen rather than notices of appeal to the BIA. Iquique has not presented any arguments that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3(e) exceeds the Attorney General\u2019s power to create regulations governing im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>migration appeals. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
