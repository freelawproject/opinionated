The IJ denied Osiba-mowo\u2019s request for cancellation of removal after concluding that Osibamowo had not demonstrated that his removal would cause his wife or sons exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. Osibamowo argues that the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services and the BIA improperly adjudicated and delayed adjudication of his wife\u2019s applications on his behalf for adjustment of status. He also argues that the IJ improperly denied his request for a continuance while the second of these applications was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-21\">A court can review a final order of removal only when \u201cthe alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). \u201cFailure to exhaust an issue creates a jurisdictional bar as to that issue.\u201d <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cAn alien fails to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to an issue when the issue is not raised in the first instance before the BIA \u2014 either on direct appeal or in a motion to reopen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Osibamowo did not raise the above issues before the BIA and does not argue due process violations \u201cexcept for procedural errors that are correctable by the BIA,\u201d we lack jurisdiction to consider these issues. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-22\">Next, Osibamowo argues that the IJ erred in finding that he had not demonstrated the requisite hardship under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). However, we lack jurisdiction to review this issue because the IJ\u2019s hardship determination was a discretionary decision rather than a legal or nondiscretionary decision. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B); <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-23\">Last, Osibamowo argues that the BIA erred by holding him to a new, non-retroactive standard in denying his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Although Osi-bamowo listed ineffective assistance of counsel in his notice of appeal as an issue he intended to appeal to the BIA, his brief to the BIA contained no argument on or analysis of that issue. \u201c[Wjhen a petitioner does file a brief, the BIA is entitled to look to the brief for an explication of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>issues that petitioner is presenting to have reviewed. Petitioner will therefore be deemed to have exhausted only those issues he raised <em>and argued </em>in his brief before the BIA.\u201d <em>Abebe v. Mukasey, </em>554 F.3d 1203, 1208 (9th Cir.2009) (emphasis added). As Osibamowo\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is unexhausted, we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See Roy, </em>389 F.3d at 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b566-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
