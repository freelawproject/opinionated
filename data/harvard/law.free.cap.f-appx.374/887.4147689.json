The district court enhanced Delcid-Delao\u2019s base offense level by 16 levels because his prior conviction for obstruction of an officer constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Delcid-De-lao challenges the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, claiming the district court should not have applied the full 16\u2014 level enhancement because his conduct that constituted the obstruction offense\u2014 elbowing and kicking an officer \u2014 is more akin to simple battery than it is to the crimes of violence specifically enumerated in \u00a7 2L1.2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, Delcid-Delao\u2019s sentence is affirmed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">In analyzing Delcid-Delao\u2019s challenge, this Court examines whether his sentence is reasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). This Court will not reverse his sentence unless it is \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191, 1203 (11th Cir.2008)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">In declining to depart downward from the Guidelines\u2019 range, the district court specifically considered Delcid-Delao\u2019s colorful criminal history, including multiple batteries and probation violations in addition to the felony obstruction of an officer. After considering the particular circumstances of the case, as \u00a7 3553(a) requires, the district court determined that a seventy-month sentence was appropriate. Del-cid-Delao has not met his burden of showing that this determination was in any way an abuse of discretion, especially consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>ing that the sentence was at the very bottom of the Guidelines\u2019 range of 70 to 87 months. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788 (holding when a district court applies a within-Guidelines sentence, this Court \u201cordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one\u201d). The sentence imposed was substantively reasonable and is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b910-12\">. Delcid-Delao does not argue that his felony obstruction conviction does not meet the legal definition of a \"crime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2; he argues only that the district court should have recognized the less-violent nature of his particular crime and should have accordingly departed downward from the Guidelines\u2019 range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b910-16\">. This Court reviews the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
