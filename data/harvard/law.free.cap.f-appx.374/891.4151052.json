Adley was also charged with attempting to possess with intent to distribute cocaine (Count 4), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(A)(ii) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; attempting to commit Hobbs Act robbery (Count 5), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951(a) and 2; and using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence and a drug trafficking crime (Count 6), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1) and 2. At trial, a jury found Adley guilty on all six counts. The district court sentenced him to 387 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-14\">On May 20, 2008, Adley filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2255 motion, claiming several instances of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The district court denied Adle/s \u00a7 2255 motion, concluding that Adley had failed to make a showing that his counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness or that, but for counsel\u2019s alleged errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. We granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-15\">Whether the district court erred concluding that Adley had failed to state a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel when he alleged his counsel failed to obtain evidence, specifically, his medical records and the testimony of three witnesses, which would have shown that he suffered from a broken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>leg during the time period when two of the alleged robberies occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Adley argues that his counsel was ineffective because he failed to adequately investigate his alibi defense and the police reports, and failed to call additional defense witnesses. Further, Adley argues that calling additional defense witnesses would have proven that he was not involved in several of the robberies. Finally, Adley contends that his counsel should have obtained his medical records, which showed that his leg was in a cast and that he was on crutches at the time of two of the robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">In reviewing claims under \u00a7 2255, we review factual findings for clear error and the application of these facts <em>de novo. Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (citation omitted). The Sixth Amendment gives criminal defendants the right to effective assistance of counsel. U.S. Const, amend. VI; <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 684-86, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2063, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must demonstrate (1) that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, i.e., the performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that he suffered prejudice as a result of that deficient performance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65. The court need not \u201caddress both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">The Supreme Court has defined prejudice as a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. To establish prejudice, the petitioner must show more than that the error had \u201csome conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Sec\u2019y Dep\u2019t of Carr., </em>476 F.3d 1193, 1209 (11th Cir.2007) (citation and quotation omitted). Rather, the petitioner must show that, without the erroneous actions of his counsel, the outcome of his case would have been different. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">Adley has not shown that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s performance. Although Adley contends that the outcome would have been different, he has not demonstrated how it would have been different. Specifically, even though Adley claims that he could not have participated in two of the robberies because of his broken leg, Adley has not contended that he was not involved in one of the carjacking incidents, which took place during the same time that he allegedly suffered from a broken leg. Further, Adley has not argued that he was not involved in the various other robberies, which he was convicted for when witnesses at trial testified that he was involved. Additionally, even if Adley\u2019s counsel had put forth the evidence that Adley asked him to obtain and called the witnesses that Adley wanted to call, in light of all the other evidence the government introduced at trial, the evidence of Adley\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. Thus, Adley has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s performance. Because Adley has not demonstrated prejudice, we need not decide whether his counsel was deficient. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">Upon careful review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-12\">. We affirmed Adley's convictions and sentences in <em>United States v. Brown, </em>227 Fed.Appx. 795 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
