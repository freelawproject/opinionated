Barasena-Brito pled guilty to one count of illegal reentry after removal and was sentenced on November 19, 2008 to 36 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by three years\u2019 supervised release. The district court granted a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 for substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-22\">Construing his <em>pro se </em>brief liberally, Barasena-Brito argues on appeal that his ineligibility for a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1 reduction for a \u201cFast-Track\u201d plea created an unwarranted sentencing disparity between otherwise identical defendants in other jurisdictions because an early disposition program had not been authorized in the district in which he pled guilty. Barase-na-Brito asserts-that the district court was permitted to vary downward because the guidelines are advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-23\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s jui'isdiction to re-sentence a defendant. <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1315 (11th Cir.2002). A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, except where expressly permitted by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 or by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582, and a district court lacks \u201cinherent power\u201d to re-sentence a defendant. <em>See id.; </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Under Rule 35(a), a district court may \u201ccorrect a sentence that resulted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>arithmetical, technical, or other clear error\u201d within 14 days after sentencing. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a). Under Rule 35(b), the government may move for a reduction of a defendant\u2019s sentence based on substantial assistance provided by the defendant. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). The only additional authorization for a district court to modify a sentence is upon (1) a motion by the Bureau of Prisons based on extraordinary circumstances or in eases involving an elderly prisoner or (2) a retroactive amendment to the guidelines that lowers the sentencing range of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c); <em>see United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 907 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that \u201c[a]ny retroactive reduction in sentence subsequent to a motion filed under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) must be \u2018consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Barasena-Brito\u2019s claim that the district court erred by denying his motion to reduce his sentence is without merit. Bar-asena-Brito\u2019s motion was made more than fourteen days after his sentence was imposed, and therefore, Rule 35(a) did not authorize the district court to modify his sentence. Further, neither the Bureau of Prisons nor the government has made a post-sentencing motion on Barasena-Brito\u2019s behalf on this basis. Although Barasena-Brito contends that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1 is applicable, a retroactive guideline amendment is required to invoke a guideline provision as a basis for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and no retroactive guideline amendment has been issued for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1. There is no statutory provision or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure that would have authorized the district court to reduce Bar-asena-Brito\u2019s sentence. Therefore, the district court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to reduce Barasena-Brito\u2019s sentence. <em>Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d at 1315. Barasena-Brito\u2019s argument that his sentence could have been reduced because the guidelines are advisory incorrectly assumes that the district court had jurisdiction to modify his sentence. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
