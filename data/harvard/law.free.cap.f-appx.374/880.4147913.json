Bowden argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">In 1990, Bowden was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and six counts of distributing cocaine base, <em>id.; </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The presentence investigation report provided a base offense level of 36 because Bowden\u2019s crimes involved at least 500 grams of cocaine base, United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3) (Nov. 1987), and the report increased that level by 4 points for Bowden\u2019s possession of a firearm, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), and his substantial role in the conspiracy, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(c). With a criminal history of IV, the report provided a sentencing range between 360 months and life imprisonment. The district court sentenced Bowden to 480 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">In January 2008, Bowden moved to reduce his sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Bowden requested a two point reduction of his base offense level, which provided an amended guideline range between 324 and 405 months of imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (Supp. Nov. 1, 2007). Bowden requested that the district court sentence him to 324 months of imprisonment. After the district court appointed counsel for Bowden, he requested a sentence below the guideline range based on the sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and the disparity among sentences imposed for offenses involving cocaine hydrochloride and cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">The district court granted Bowden\u2019s motion and reduced his sentence to 360 months of imprisonment. The district court explained that, except for the two level reduction of Bowden\u2019s base offense level, \u201call provisions of the judgment imposed on February 18, 1991, ... remained) in effect....\u201d Bowden moved for reconsideration. Bowden requested a \u201csentence not more than 324 months,\u201d or \u201c[i]n the alternative,\u201d for the district court to \u201cstate its reasons for declining to do so.\u201d The district court denied Bowden\u2019s motion summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">We review \u201cde novo a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may reduce a term of imprisonment when the guideline range is lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). When the district court recalculates the sentence under the amended guidelines, <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). The district court must decide, in the light of the statutory sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), \u201cwhether, in its discretion, it will elect to impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended guidelines or retain the original sentence.\u201d <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-14\">The district court did not err in reducing Bowden\u2019s sentence. Bowden argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>the district court failed to \u201cconsider and articulate\u201d the sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and the court failed to account for his background and rehabilitation, but the record refutes these arguments. The district court stated that it had reviewed Bowden\u2019s motion and \u201cconsidered the supplemental presentence report[,] ... the parties responses,\u201d and \u201cthe 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors before determining what was an appropriate sentence .... \u201d <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256-57 (11th Cir.2009). After it considered Bowden\u2019s arguments, the district court reduced Bowden\u2019s sentence to 360 months of imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. Bowden also argues that district court had discretion to reduce his sentence below the amended range under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), but those decisions do not apply to a motion to reduce a sentence. <em>See United States v. Melvin, 556 </em>F.3d 1190, 1191-93 (11th Cir.2009). Although Bowden asks that we reconsider our decision in <em>Melvin, </em>the holding of a prior panel \u201cis binding on all subsequent panels unless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this court sitting <em>en banc.\u201d United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Bowden\u2019s modified sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
