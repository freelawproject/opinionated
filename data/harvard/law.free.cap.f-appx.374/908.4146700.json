Biggins argues that the district court erred (1) in calculating the cocaine base quantity at his original sentencing hearing, (2) by failing to further reduce his sentence under <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough v. U.S., </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and (3) by failing to provide him with a revised Pre-sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d). Having found no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">On appeal, Biggins first argues that the sentencing court erred in its initial finding that he possessed more than 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base, and, therefore, his sentence is unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment, <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Biggins did not raise the issue to the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1018 (11th Cir.2005). To prove plain error, a defendant must show: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">A proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cIndeed, we have held that <em>all </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not plainly err when it declined to reconsider findings made at the original sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">Next, Biggins argues the district court erred in its application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because it applied the amended guideline range in a mandatory fashion in violation of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough. </em>Biggins also argues that the court erred by not shortening his sentence beyond the two-level reduction in offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-15\">The policy statement generally applicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings instructs the district court not to reduce a sentence below the newly calculated guideline range: \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guidelines range determined under [\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) ].\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7. lB1.10(b)(2)(A) (2008). In <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009), we upheld the sentencing guideline\u2019s restriction and concluded that neither <em>Booker </em>nor <em>Kimbrough </em>\u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not err by sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Biggins to a sentence at the top of the newly calculated guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Finally, Biggins argues that the district court erred when it failed to provide him with a revised PSI. He contends that he was prejudiced by his inability to object to the revised PSI prior to resentencing, and he challenges the district court\u2019s procedure in adjudicating his motion. Because there is no evidence that the probation office provided the district court with a new or revised PSI, Biggins\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
