On appeal, Taylor argues the district court erred when it denied as futile her request to file an amended complaint. Specifically, she argues she had the right to file an amendment as a matter of course, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15, because the defendants had not yet filed a responsive pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-15\">A district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend a complaint is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, although the underlying legal conclusion of whether a particular amendment to the complaint would be futile is reviewed <em>de novo. Corsello v. Lincare, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1008, 1012 (11th Cir.2005). A party may amend its pleading once, as a matter of course, before being served with a responsive pleading. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(1). For the purposes of this Rule, a motion to dismiss is not considered a responsive pleading. <em>Fortner v. Thomas, </em>983 F.2d 1024, 1032 (11th Cir.1993). Although the futility of a proposed amended complaint can be a justifiable reason for denying leave to amend, <em>see Moore v. Baker, </em>989 F.2d 1129, 1131 (11th Cir.1993), we have held, \u201c[wjhen the plaintiff has the right to file an amended complaint as a matter of course ... the plain language of Rule 15(a) shows that the [district] court lacks the discretion to reject the amended complaint based on its alleged futility,\u201d <em>Williams v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Georgia, </em>477 F.3d 1282, 1292 n. 6 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-16\">The record in this case demonstrates Taylor sought to amend her complaint after the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. Because a motion to dismiss is not considered a responsive pleading for Rule 15 purposes, <em>see Fortner, </em>983 F.2d at 1032, Taylor had the right to amend her complaint as a matter of course, <em>see Williams, </em>477 F.3d at 1292, n. 6. Thus, the district court lacked the discretion to reject her amended complaint based on alleged futility. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b972-17\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
