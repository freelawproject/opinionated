After the court imposed the 12-months\u2019 sentence, appellant filed a notice of appeal. He also moved the district court to modify the sentence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by adding one day in order to make him eligible for the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 good time credit. The court granted the motion and entered an amended judgment sentencing appellant to prison for 12 months and one day.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">In his brief to this court, appellant concedes that the court adhered to the Sentencing Guidelines, but argues that its sentence did not comply with the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Finally, he asserts that the mitigating factors he presented \u2014 his support of his mother and daughter \u2014 show that imprisonment was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We review a defendant\u2019s total sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1107 (11th Cir.2006). In doing so, we are guided by the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). Such review is deferential, requiring us to \u201cevaluate whether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), a district court may, upon finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release, revoke the term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering certain factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d at 1107. Specifically, the court must consider, among other things: (1) \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d; (2) \u201cthe need for the sentence ... to afford adequate deterrence!,] protect the public from further crimes!,] and ... provide the defendant with [education or training and medical care or treatment]\u201d; (3) the Chapter 7 policy statements; and (4) \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">The district court is not required to \u201cstate on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). If the court imposes a sentence within the Guidelines, it is not necessary to give a detailed explanation of its reasons, as long as it \u201cset[s] forth enough to satisfy [us] that [it] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">At the revocation hearing in this case, appellant did not contest the charges, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>did not object to the district court\u2019s calculation of the Chapter 7 sentence range of 6-12 months\u2019 imprisonment. Accordingly, the court initially sentenced him to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment, the top of that range. Although the court did not specifically mention the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, it did articulate part of its reasoning. By accurately stating and adopting the Chapter 7 sentence range, it considered that factor. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)-(5). Regarding the \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), the court noted that when it had sentenced appellant on the underlying conviction in 2002, it had imposed a sentence 10 months below the sentence range. It addressed the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense,\u201d <em>id., </em>when it found that appellant\u2019s violations undermined any expectation that he would not continue to commit criminal offenses (although it expressly denied that the sentence was based on post-release criminal conduct). The court addressed the need to deter appellant\u2019s potential for criminal behavior, and to protect the public, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B)-(C), noting that it hoped the long sentence would demonstrate to appellant that because of his criminal history, any further violations would result in serious sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Regarding the additional day that the court, at appellant\u2019s request, added to his sentence, the court did not comment on its reasoning. In granting the motion, however, the court implicitly adopted appellant\u2019s reasoning, which was essentially based on his history and characteristics (the minor and technical nature of his violations, the fact that they were his first violations, and the fact that he was helping to support his mother and daughter). In imposing this additional day, the court varied upward from the Chapter 7 guideline range, but these guidelines are not binding, <em>Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d at 1320, and a court may impose a sentence higher than the prescribed sentence range as long as it is reasonable, which it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\">. Because the motion to modify did not allege error and did not cite any authority, we construe it as a motion for reconsideration as provided for by the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Vicaria, </em>963 F.2d 1412, 1413\u201414 (11th Cir.1992) (citing <em>United States v. Dieter, </em>429 U.S. 6, 8-9, 97 S.Ct. 18, 19-20, 50 L.Ed.2d 8 (1976); <em>United States v. Healy, </em>376 U.S. 75, 84 S.Ct. 553, 11 L.Ed.2d 527 (1964)). As such, this motion tolled the running of the time to appeal, and appellant's notice of appeal was not effective until the district court ruled on the motion. Accordingly, we have appellate jurisdiction over both the original and amended judgments. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
