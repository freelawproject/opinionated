Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), this Court does not have jurisdiction to review Ma\u2019s and Lu\u2019s assertions that their asylum claims were not time-barred. <em>See Nakimbugwe v. Gonzales, </em>475 F.3d 281, 284 n. 1 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, their claims for asylum are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-23\">We will uphold the conclusion that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal if that conclusion is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). The substantial evidence standard requires that the decision be based on the record evidence and that the decision be substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). Under this standard, we will affirm the decision unless the \u201cevidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-24\">The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the petitioners\u2019 brief detention during times of public unrest in Burma failed to establish past persecution. This decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Abdel-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 584 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Fleurinor v. INS, </em>585 F.2d 129, 133-34 (5th Cir.1978). Substantial evidence also supports the conclusion that neither Ma nor Lu have shown that she or he will be singled out for persecution upon returning to Burma. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1),(2); <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 307 (5th Cir.2005). For the same reasons, Ma and Lu have not shown that they meet the high standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir .2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b637-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
