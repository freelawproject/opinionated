We find no reversible error; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">Defendant pled guilty to a one-count indictment charging him with illegal reentry into the United States. The Pre-Sentencing Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) proposed a sentencing range of 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment, based on the probation officer\u2019s finding that Defendant was removed from the United States after being convicted for trafficking cocaine, Defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, and Defendant\u2019s criminal history. The district court adopted the PSI\u2019s sentencing calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">At the sentencing hearing, Defendant argued for a below-Guidelines sentence, based on several mitigating factors, including his extreme remorse, his poverty-stricken upbringing in Honduras, his lack of relatives in Honduras, and the discrimination he suffered in Honduras because of his sexual orientation. The district court denied Defendant\u2019s request for a reduced sentence and imposed a sentence of 46 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">In announcing this sentence, the court stated that it had considered \u201cthe advisory recommendations of the ... Guidelines, and all the factors identified in ... Sections 3553(a)(1) through (7)\u201d and found \u201cno reason to depart from the sentence called for by application of the guidelines.\u201d The court noted that the sentence was at the \u201clow end of the guidelines\u201d and that Defendant\u2019s current problems stemmed from his prior trafficking conviction, \u201ca serious violation of our laws.\u201d The court also acknowledged that Defendant\u2019s entire family resided in the United States and noted that Defendant would be doing the same if he had not broken the law. Defendant objected to the sentence, arguing that it was \u201cunreasonable and an abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b993-15\">On appeal, Defendant argues that the sentence is unreasonable because the district court did not give real weight to the section 3553(a) mitigating evidence he presented at his sentencing hearing and that the sentence is greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing. Pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264-65,125 S.Ct. 738, 767,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.2006). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d and \u201cthe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Although we have said that a sentence within the Guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, we have noted that we would \u201cordinarily\u201d expect such a sentence to be reasonable.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>We will only remand for re-sentencing if \u201cthe district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">A review of the record shows that Defendant\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable because the district court considered Defendant\u2019s arguments on the section 3553(a) mitigating factors in imposing Defendant\u2019s sentence. The court was not required to analyze specifically and to accept or to reject each of Defendant\u2019s arguments. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324,1329 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[Njothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d). The district court heard testimony and argument from Defendant on the proposed mitigating factors and ultimately concluded that the factors did not outweigh the seriousness of Defendant\u2019s criminal history, an element accounted for in the Guidelines calculation. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1185-86 (11th Cir.2006) (upholding sentence as reasonable where the district court expressly acknowledged that it had considered the section 3553(a) factors and \u201cultimately decided to give considerable weight to the Guidelines in this case\u201d). Such a decision was within the sound discretion of the district court. <em>See Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363 (stating that we will not \u201csubstitute our judgment in weighing relevant factors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">And, when considering Defendant\u2019s criminal history as an aggravated felon and the twenty-years statutory maximum term of imprisonment, we cannot say that Defendant\u2019s sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range was substantively unreasonable. We therefore affirm Defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b994-5\"> The Supreme Court concluded recently that a federal appellate court may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a properly calculated sentence falling within the Guidelines range. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2463, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). We have noted that the rationale of <em>Rita </em>calls into question our reasons for not affording a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1314 n. 8 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
