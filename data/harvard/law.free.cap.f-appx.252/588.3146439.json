Hollie, Texas prisoner # 890306, proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. After conducting a hearing pursuant to <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985), the district court concluded that Hollie\u2019s claims lacked an arguable basis in fact or law.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">Hollie reasserts the factual allegation that he raised in his district court complaint and at the <em>Spears </em>hearing, contending that defendant Therease A. Kildow ignored his slow eating pass on May 10, 2005, when she ordered him to stop eating. Hollie disregarded the order and finished eating. He contends that the other defendants violated his constitutional rights by failing to intervene in the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">Hollie\u2019s complaint lacks an arguable basis in law; the facts alleged cannot establish that Hollie was deprived of the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities and thus were not a violation of his Eighth Amendment rights. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Davis v. Scott, </em>157 F.3d 1003, 1005-06 (5th Cir. 1998). Additionally, Hollie now asserts that he is pursuing claims under the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). He did not raise this claim in the district court. Hollie\u2019s conclusional assertions do not set forth a claim for violation of the ADA. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101; <em>Hall v. Thomas, </em>190 F.3d 693, 696 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-18\">Hollie\u2019s appeal is frivolous and is therefore dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. His motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-19\">The dismissal of this appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Hollie is warned that if he accumulates three strikes he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-20\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b613-14\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
