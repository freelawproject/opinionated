Mendoza argues that the district court erred in applying an enhancement to his base offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 based on letters he wrote to the government\u2019s cooperating witness. Mendoza further contends that the district court clearly erred in its denial of an acceptance of responsibility reduction to his offense level, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Finally, Mendoza asserts that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence under the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">On December 15, 2005, a government cooperator agreed to initiate a controlled purchase of cocaine hydrochloride from his source. After the cooperator initiated his request for the contraband, Mendoza, his wife, and a male accomplice arrived by car at the cooperator\u2019s residence whereupon agents arrested the trio and recovered over 500 grams of cocaine hydrochloride from the vehicle. The cooperator indicated that he had bought cocaine from Mendoza on four other occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">While incarcerated and awaiting his sentencing hearing, Mendoza wrote two letters to the government\u2019s cooperator, the first on May 2, 2006, and the second, on May 22, 2006. The first letter, in part, accused the cooperator of lying to authorities, informed the cooperator that his actions had destroyed Mendoza\u2019s life, and stated that \u201c[tjhere\u2019s a saying that \u2018snitches get stiches [sic].\u2019 \u201d The second letter requested the cooperator to write a statement that \u201cme and my wife never sold you any kilo\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Mendoza contended that a fellow inmate wrote the letters and, based on his limited English-language skills, he did not adequately understand the letters. Mendoza nonetheless admitted to approving the letters as written. Mendoza further contended that his intent was not to threaten the government\u2019s witness; rather, he only wanted the cooperator to elicit a statement that he and his wife merely served as interpreters, not as a principal source of the narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">In addition to the letters, the government presented testimony that Mendoza had released portions of the Presentence Investigative Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) that detailed the cooperator's status as an informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for reasonableness, with the Guidelines applied as advisory. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). The district court must follow a two-step process to determine a defendant\u2019s sentence by: (1) consulting the Guidelines and correctly calculating the guideline range; and (2) considering the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\n<em>I. Obstruction of justice enhancement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AiQ\">We review a district court\u2019s factual finding to support an enhancement to a defendant\u2019s offense level for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for clear error. <em>United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Singh, </em>291 F.3d 756, 763 (11th Cir.2002). We review the application of law to those facts <em>de novo. Singh, </em>291 F.3d at 763 (citation omitted). We \u201caccord great deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and citation omitted). Section 3C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">If (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">An example of conduct covered by this enhancement includes, \u201cthreatening, intimidating, or otherwise unlawfully influencing a ... witness ... directly or indirectly, or attempting to do so.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, n. 4(a). Generally, the government bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence the facts necessary to support a sentencing enhancement. <em>United States v. Cataldo, </em>171 F.3d 1316, 1321 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">In this case, the district court reviewed the letters written to the government\u2019s cooperator on Mendoza\u2019s behalf, as well as two separate letters written by Mendoza to the judge. Further, the district court listened to Mendoza speak in English, observed Mendoza\u2019s actions, and considered the entirety of the record before it. The court found that Mendoza: (1) had a \u201cgreater ability to communicate and express himself than most defendants that [come before the court];\u201d (2) \u201cexpressed] himself well and clearly in both English and Spanish;\u201d (3) showed no indication of \u201cconfusion or a misunderstanding on his part;\u201d and (4) was \u201cnot a man who is timid in his communications or sophomoric in his communications.\u201d In light of these findings, the court concluded that Mendoza intended his letters to be \u201ca not so veiled threat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">Furthermore, after considering the evidence relating to the release of the PSI, the district court found that the only reasonable inference of the evidence was that Mendoza \u201creleased portions of a copy of his presentence report.\u201d Based on the record evidence before it, the district court cannot be said to have clearly erred in applying an obstruction of justice enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">\n<em>II. Acceptance of responsibility reduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">We review \u201cthe district court\u2019s determination of acceptance of responsibility only for clear error.\u201d <em>Singh, </em>291 F.3d at 764 (quotation and citation omitted). Section 3El.l(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides \u201c[i]f the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense, decrease the offense level by 2 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). Under certain conditions and \u201cupon motion of the government,\u201d a defendant may receive an additional one-level decrease. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of clearly demonstrating acceptance of responsibility and must present more than just a guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Sawyer, </em>180 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.1999); <em>see also United States v. Shores, </em>966 F.2d 1383, 1388 (11th Cir.1992) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>(holding that an admission of involvement in the crime alone does not necessarily amount to an affirmative acceptance of responsibility). \u201cConduct resulting in an enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct. There may, however, be extraordinary cases in which adjustments under both \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1 and 3E1.1 may apply.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4). \u201cThe sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. For this reason, the determination of the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">In this case, the district court did not clearly err in denying Mendoza an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Mendoza primarily relied on his guilty plea, which is clearly insufficient under <em>Sawyer </em>and <em>Shores. </em>Moreover, in light of the obstruction of justice enhancement and Mendoza\u2019s failure to show extraordinary circumstances, the district court did not err, much less clearly err, in deciding that the acceptance of responsibility reduction was unwarranted. <em>See Singh, </em>291 F.3d at 765 (holding that defendant, who had received an obstruction of justice enhancement, failed to show extraordinary circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Mendoza also argued that the court incorrectly applied a 3-level enhancement in denying the acceptance of responsibility. This argument is without merit. Mendoza\u2019s baseline offense level was 28 and the only enhancement applied by the court was the 2-level obstruction of justice, giving Mendoza a total offense level of 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\n<em>III. Reasonableness of sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">As stated above, we review sentences for reasonableness, with the Guidelines applied as advisory. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 785. \u201c[Njothing in Booker or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). The factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing dispai'ities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-10\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). Although we have rejected a <em>per se </em>rule, we explained that a sentence within the applicable guideline range has the expectation of reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 788. Review for reasonableness is deferential, and there are a range of sentences that are reasonable. <em>Id. </em>The party who challenges the sentence has the burden of proving that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">In this case, the district court did not impose an unreasonable sentence. The court correctly calculated Mendoza\u2019s guideline imprisonment range, addressed Mendoza\u2019s arguments, and considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Mendoza complains that the sentence would have been much shorter had there been no ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>struction of justice enhancement and had he received a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. This is undoubtedly true, but as shown above, the enhancement and denial of the reduction were not clearly erroneous, and Mendoza\u2019s argument does nothing to show that the sentence is unreasonable. We accordingly hold that Mendoza\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\n<em>IV. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Upon careful review of the entire record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we hold that the district court did not err in its sentencing calculations and imposed a reasonable sentence. We affirm Mendoza\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
