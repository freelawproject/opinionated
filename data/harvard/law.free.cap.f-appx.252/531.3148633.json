He was sentenced to sixty-nine months\u2019 imprisonment and three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>years\u2019 supervised release. The sixty-nine months was near the middle of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range of imprisonment. On appeal, Zerkle contends the sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">We will affirm the sentence imposed by the district court as long as it is within the statutorily prescribed range and reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005). Although the guidelines are no longer mandatory, they must still be consulted and taken into account when sentencing. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). A sentence within a properly calculated advisory guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Gr-een, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness). This presumption can only be rebutted by showing the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert, denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3044, 168 L.Ed.2d 759 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">\u201cAfter <em>Booker, </em>sentencing requires two steps. First, the district court must consult the Sentencing Guidelines and correctly calculate the range provided by the Guidelines. Second, the court must consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and then impose a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Euro, </em>440 F.3d 625, 632 (4th Cir.2006) (citations omitted), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(June 20, 2006) (No. 05-11659). \u201cIn doing so, the district court should first look to whether a departure is appropriate based on the Guidelines Manual or relevant case law.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). \u201cIf an appropriate basis for departure exists, the district court may depart. If the resulting departure range still does not serve the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), the court may then elect to impose a non-guideline sentence (a \u2018variance sentence\u2019).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-14\">We find the sentence reasonable. Given the seriousness of the offense, the number of victims involved and the need to deter others from engaging in the same conduct, Zerkle failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
