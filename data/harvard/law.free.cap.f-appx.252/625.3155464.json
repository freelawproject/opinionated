On appeal, Avitu-Ramos argues that the 16-level crime-of-violence increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) was erroneous, because his Texas convictions of aggravated assault did not qualify as crimes of violence under either definition applicable to that provision. In <em>United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 199-201 (5th Cir.2007), this court held that aggravated assault under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.02(a) qualified as a conviction for an enumerated offense of aggravated assault and a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The 16-level crime-of-violence increase under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) was not imposed in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-16\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Avitu-Ramos challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pinedar-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Aug. 28, 2007) (No. 07-6202).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b650-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
