He contends that his sentence, which was the lowest in the guideline range, was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to properly consider specific mitigating circumstances. Johnson also argues that the increase in his base offense level due to a previous robbery conviction yielded a sentence that was too harsh given his minimal participation in that robbery. Finally, Johnson asserts that his youth, regret, and desire to support his infant son make the district court\u2019s refusal to award him a downward variance unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-18\">We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). Our review for reasonableness is deferential. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-19\">Unreasonableness may be procedural, such as occurs when the procedure the district court used does not meet the requirements found in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), or it may be substantive in nature. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006). After <em>Booker, </em>a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, must consider the correctly calculated advisory guideline range and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2006). After correctly calculating the advisory guideline range, the district court may impose a more severe or lenient sentence, so long as the resulting sentence is reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 750. \u201c[T]here is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose[,]\u201d and the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-20\">Here, Johnson\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable because the district court correctly calculated the guideline range and indicated that it had considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). The seventy-month sentence was also substantively reasonable. We note that the sentence imposed was at the very bottom of the advisory range, and \u201cordinarily we would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Additionally, given the frequency of Johnson\u2019s past criminal conduct and his apparent disregard for the rule of law, the district court\u2019s determination that a sentence within the guideline range was necessary to protect the public represents a thoughtful weighing of the statutory factors. Therefore, Johnson has not met his burden to show his sentence at the lowest point in the guideline range is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
