California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Navarrete has filed a response, in which he asserts that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that Navarrete is not a career offender because his prior convictions were de facto consolidated. Navarrete\u2019s ineffective assistance claim is without merit. <em>See United States v. Hayes, </em>342 F.3d 385, 388 (5th Cir.2003). Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Navarrete\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b725-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
