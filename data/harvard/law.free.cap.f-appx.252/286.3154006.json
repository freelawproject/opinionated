The action was remanded to the district court and concluded without an appeal. The Konikovs filed this suit, arising out of the same facts as <em>Konikov I, </em>against Orange County and other employees <em>(Konikov </em>II). The district court dismissed the suit with prejudice, based on res judicata. The Konikovs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s res judicata determination. <em>EEOC v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., </em>383 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2004). Whether a party is in privity with another for preclusion purposes is a question of fact reviewed for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-15\">A case is barred from re-litigation under the doctrine of res judicata if: \u201c(1) there is a final judgment on the merits; (2) the decision was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) the parties, or those in privity with them, are identical in both suits; and (4) the same cause of action is involved in both cases.\u201d <em>Ragsdale v. Rubbermaid, Inc., </em>193 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir.1999). The United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida adjudicated <em>Konikov I </em>to its final conclusion. Therefore, the res judicata question is whether the parties and causes of action are identical in <em>Konikov I </em>and <em>Konikov II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-16\">The County is a party in both actions. The Plaintiffs are the same party as well, since Joseph and Chana Konikov, as husband and wife, are in privity with each other. <em>See Jaffree v. Wallace, </em>837 F.2d 1461, 1467-68 (11th Cir.1988); <em>Cotton v. Fed. Land Bank of Columbia, </em>676 F.2d 1368, 1370-71 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-17\">The remaining individual Defendants are also identical in both lawsuits for res judicata purposes. \u201cMost other federal circuits have concluded that employer-employee or principal-agent relationships may ground a claim preclusion defense, regardless which party to the relationship was first sued....\u201d <em>Citibank, N.A. v. Data Lease Fin. Corp., </em>904 F.2d 1498, 1502 (11th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Lubrizol Corp. v. Exxon Corp., </em>871 F.2d 1279, 1288 (5th Cir.1989)). Privity exists where the non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>party\u2019s interests were adequately represented by the party in the original suit or \u201cwhere a party to the original suit is \u2018so closely aligned to a nonparty\u2019s interest as to be his virtual representative.\u2019 \u201d <em>NAACP v. Hunt, </em>891 F.2d 1555, 1560-61 (11th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>United Merchants &amp; Mfrs. v. Sanders, </em>508 So.2d 689, 692 (Ala.1987)). The employees sued in <em>Konikov II </em>handed out notices, collected evidence, testified before the CEB, and executed affidavits, which were all part of the County\u2019s preparation for <em>Konikov I. </em>We find no error in the district court\u2019s determination that the individual employees who are Defendants in <em>Konikov II </em>were in privity with the County for res judicata purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Seven of the eight counts of <em>Konikov II </em>were previously litigated in <em>Konikov I. </em>The only different claim is one for negligent supervision/retention. The actions of the individuals in <em>Konikov II </em>all occurred prior to the commencement of <em>Konikov I. </em>The events giving rise to this lawsuit existed at the time of the original complaint in <em>Konikov I. </em>Since this claim arose out of the same nucleus of operative fact as <em>Konikov </em>/, it is barred by res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of <em>Konikov II </em>with prejudice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\">. We reject Orange County\u2019s contention that there is no longer a case or controversy. And, we reject as meritless all other arguments presented by the Plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
