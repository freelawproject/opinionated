On June 18, 2004, weeks after Serafin\u2019s eighteenth birthday, Principal Brett Wilkinson summoned her and two other students to his office after they breached school rules and left campus during the school day. In accordance with school procedures, and over Serafin\u2019s protest, Wilkinson administered corporal punishment to each with a wooden paddle. In attempting to block the paddle with her hand, Serafin\u2019s hand suffered minor, temporary injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Seraf\u00edn brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against SEE and Wilkinson, alleging that her due process and equal protection rights were violated. She also raised several independent state law claims. The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and dismissed all federal claims against SEE and Wilkinson. The court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the surviving state claims and dismissed those without prejudice. Seraf\u00edn now appeals the dismissal of her federal claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Seraf\u00edn cannot prevail on her substantive due process or equal protection claims,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to Appellee SEE.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">It is well settled in this Circuit that corporal punishment of public school students is only a deprivation of substantive due process rights \u201cwhen it is arbitrary, capricious, or wholly unrelated to the legitimate state goal of maintaining an atmosphere conducive to learning.\u201d <em>Fee v. Herndon, </em>900 F.2d 804, 808 (5th Cir.1990) (citation omitted). As a matter of law, punishment is not arbitrary so long as the state affords local remedies for the alleged offensive conduct. <em>Moore v. Willis Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>233 F.3d 871, 874-75 (5th Cir.2000). This Court has ah\u2019eady decided that Texas affords adequate remedies for excessive corporal punishment claims such as this. <em>Id. </em>at 875-76. Because there are adequate local remedies, Serafin\u2019s substantive due process claims must fail as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">Serafin argues that this clear precedent should either (1) be revisited by this court, or (2) be held inapplicable because Serafin was not a minor at the time of the incident. As to the first suggestion, we generally refuse to revisit a prior panel\u2019s decision absent some compelling reason, and we find no such reason here. <em>See Free v. Abbott Labs., </em>164 F.3d 270, 272-73 (5th Cir.1999). As for the second, Seraf\u00edn argues that adults are not compelled to be at school and therefore, they maintain stronger due process rights than minors while there. This argument relies on the false premise that Seraf\u00edn was not required to comply with SEE\u2019s attendance policies on the day in question. Without doubt, she did not need to attend school after her eighteenth birthday and was at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>liberty to withdraw from SEE. However, having voluntarily chosen to attend classes after her eighteenth birthday and remain enrolled, she was not free to disregard school rules and attendance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">In Texas, \u201c[a] person who voluntarily enrolls in school or voluntarily attends school after the person\u2019s 18th birthday shall attend school each school day for the entire period the program of instruction is offered.\u201d Tex. Educ.Code \u00a7 25.085(e). Seraf\u00edn was a student at SEE at the time of this incident. Nothing in the caselaw exempts non-minors from the corporal punishment of students. Furthermore, the Texas statute governing the use of corporal punishment in schools, makes no differentiation between adults and minors, stating that all students are eligible to receive corporal punishment. Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 9.62. Because Seraf\u00edn was obligated to comply with school rules and subject to its disciplinary policies, we see no basis for affording her greater due process rights than her co-students. As this Court explained in <em>Fee: </em>\u201cwe have avoided having student discipline, a matter of public policy, shaped by the individual predilections of federal jurists rather than by state lawmakers and local officials ... [especially when] states, like Texas, have taken affirmative steps to protect their students from overzealous disciplinarians.\u201d 900 F.2d at 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In the alternative, Serafin argues that the equal protection rights of adult students are violated insofar as they are subject to corporal punishment while other adults are not. There is no merit to this claim. The Equal Protection Clause \u201cdoes not require things which are different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as though they were the same.\u201d <em>Plyler v. Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 216, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982) (citation omitted). Texas\u2019 unique statutory treatment of students is justified by the need to maintain a safe and secure educational atmosphere. <em>See id. </em>Students are not a suspect class and no fundamental right is at stake. There is a rational basis for allowing corporal punishment of students, and it is sufficient to survive an equal protection challenge. Texas did not compel Serafin to enroll in SEE or to attend after her eighteenth birthday, but once she chose to do so she was treated as all other students, adult or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Finding no bases for due process or equal protection claims, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment on all counts in regards to Appellee SEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-10\">. While this appeal was pending, a suggestion of bankruptcy was filed by Appellee Wilkinson, and as a result, this case was automatically placed in abeyance. The stay was lifted regarding Appellee SEE only, and thus this panel does not address the claims Appellant raised against Wilkinson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b709-14\">. It is undisputed that SEE is immune under Texas law from all of Appellant\u2019s other claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
