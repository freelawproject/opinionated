Town of Chapin, </em>No. 3:05-1398-MBS, 2006 WL 2711851 (D.S.C. Sept. 20, 2006) (the \u201cOpinion\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In May 2005, Chapin Furniture initiated this action in the District of South Carolina \u2014 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as nominal and consequential damages \u2014 challenging the Town\u2019s attempt to apply a zoning ordinance against Chapin\u2019s use of an electronic sign outside its place of business. Chapin contends that the court erred in ruling that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>the ordinance was content-neutral and did not contravene the First Amendment. Because the Town has revised the challenged ordinance to meet Chapin\u2019s contentions and will not reenact it, Chapin\u2019s claims are moot. As explained below, we vacate and remand for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Chapin Furniture, which operates a furniture store in the small town of Chapin, South Carolina, erected an electronic sign, called an electronic message center (the \u201cEMC\u201d), outside its store in August 2004. The EMC is designed to flash or scroll messages across its display screen. Chapin installed the EMC at the top of a sign post it shared with other businesses, located on Chapin Road between the Town\u2019s only two traffic lights. The EMC is the largest and tallest sign on the block and the only one of its type in the Town.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">When Chapin added the EMC to the sign post, the Town\u2019s zoning ordinance (the \u201cOrdinance\u201d) prohibited, inter alia, the installation of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">Flashing signs, signs with flashing or reflective disks, signs with flashing lights or lights of changing degree of intensity or color or signs with electrically scrolled messages (except government signs and signs which give time and temperature information). If a time and temperature sign alternates between a time message and a temperature message it shall continuously show one message a minimum of three (3) seconds in time before switching to the other message.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">Town of Chapin Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 901(G). The Ordinance required those wishing to replace or construct signs to first obtain a permit, but failed to specify a time within which the Town had to act on a permit application. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 900.2. Although the Town contends that the purpose of the restrictions spelled out in the Ordinance was to protect the rural aesthetics of the Town and, as a safety measure, to reduce distractions to drivers, the safety purpose was not specified in connection with the sign restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">On August 20, 2004, the Town\u2019s Zoning Administrator informed Chapin that its EMC was operating in a manner that violated the Ordinance. On September 21, 2004, the Administrator sent a letter to Chapin advising that its new sign was not in compliance with the Ordinance and that the EMC manufacturer had \u201cmisrepresented the nature of the sign when applying for a permit.\u201d J.A. 150.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Administrator concluded, after conferring with the Planning Commission, the Town Council, the Mayor, and others, that the \u201csign is unacceptable to everyone and an exception will not be made to allow it to remain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Administrator asked Chapin to \u201c[p]lease respect our ordinances and remove the sign.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Chapin failed to comply with her request to remove the sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-15\">Nearly six months later, on March 7, 2005, the Town\u2019s Mayor sent Chapin a second letter, again requesting that the sign be removed. The Mayor asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>that the sign violated the Ordinance because it did not \u201cprovide name and nature of store only .... [and] the sign must not flash, change degree of intensity or electrically scroll.\u201d J.A. 398. Concluding that the sign \u201cviolates all of the above,\u201d the Mayor requested that Chapin \u201cnot delay this matter any further\u201d and indicated that it had \u201cuntil March 31, 2005 to have [its] sign removed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Chapin also failed to comply with this request, but the Town took no action to enforce the Ordinance \u2014 it never cited, fined, or charged Chapin with violating the Ordinance, and never instituted any court proceedings or otherwise forced the EMC into disuse. Chapin has thus continued to use the EMC, but has modified the rate at which messages are flashed and stopped scrolling messages across the display screen.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">On May 12, 2005, Chapin filed a ten-count \u00a7 1983 complaint in the District of South Carolina, asserting that the Ordinance violated its rights under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The complaint requested declaratory and injunctive relief, plus nominal and consequential damages. The crux of Chapin\u2019s position is the allegation that \u201c[b]y enacting and enforcing the regulation of [EMCs], the Town of Chapin is willfully and unlawfully depriving [it], and other citizens and businesses in Chapin, of their right of free expression through this form of communication, as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d J.A. 13. Chapin contends that the First Amendment is contravened because: (1) the Ordinance, in allowing the government to utilize EMCs, and allowing the display of time and temperature information only, impermissibly regulates speech based on content and viewpoint; (2) the Town\u2019s stated purpose of protecting rural aesthetics fails to show an interest sufficient to permit it to regulate speech in this manner; and (3) the entirety of the Ordinance is an unconstitutional prior restraint, because its permit scheme fails to provide a defined time period for the Town to make permit decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">In February 2006, the Town filed a motion for summary judgment and Chapin filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment. On June 22, 2006, at a hearing on the summary judgment motions, the Town informed the district court that it was in the process of revising the Ordinance. As a result, the court obtained supplemental briefing on the mootness issue, which implicated its jurisdiction to address the issues raised by Chapin.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">On September 20, 2006, the district court issued the Opinion from which this appeal is taken, awarding summary judgment to the Town, denying Chapin\u2019s request for partial summary judgment, and concluding that Chapin\u2019s claims were not moot. On the mootness issue, the court explained that the Town had failed to meet its \u201cburden of demonstrating that [it] would not reenact the challenged provisions of the Ordinance.\u201d Opinion 4.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the merits, the court concluded that the Ordinance was a content-neutral regulation of speech that advanced legitimate governmental interests in preserving rural community aesthetics and avoiding traffic hazards. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6. It also determined that the Ordinance did not unconstitutionally restrict commercial speech or constitute a prior restraint thereon. <em>Id. </em>at 8-9. For these reasons, the court concluded that the \u201cOrdinance passe[d] constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>muster.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. On October 18, 2006, Chapin filed its notice of appeal, and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">On November 7, 2006, after the district court had awarded summary judgment to the Town and Chapin had initiated this appeal, the Town validly enacted its revised Ordinance (the \u201cRevised Ordinance\u201d). The Revised Ordinance includes a Statement of Purpose and Intent, <em>i </em>e., that the \u201cintent of these sign regulations\u201d is to preserve, inter alia, \u201cthe health, safety, welfare and general well-being of the community\u2019s citizens.\u201d <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Br., Addendum A, \u00a7 900.1. The Revised Ordinance now prohibits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">Flashing signs, signs with flashing or reflective disks, signs with flashing lights or lights of changing degree of intensity or color or signs with electrically scrolled messages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-8\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 901(G). The Revised Ordinance does not contain an exception for governmental signs or for signs displaying only time and temperature information. In addition, it provides that, upon receipt of all necessary information, permit requests will be acted upon by the Town within two weeks of receipt. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 900.2. Although Chapin fails to assert on appeal any First Amendment concerns regarding the Revised Ordinance, it maintains that the revisions were adopted in an effort to render its claims moot and that the Ordinance could be reenacted at any time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s award of summary judgment, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Seabulk Offshore, Ltd. v. Am. Home Assur. Co., </em>377 F.3d 408, 418 (4th Cir.2004). We also review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling concerning subject matter jurisdiction, including a ruling on mootness. <em>See Covenant Media of S.C., LLC v. City of N. Charleston, </em>493 F.3d 421, 428 (4th Cir.2007) (concluding that district court\u2019s conclusion regarding Article III jurisdiction is \u201clegal conclusion that we review de novo\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">Before assessing the merits of Ghapin\u2019s appellate contentions, we must first determine whether its claims have been rendered moot by the Town\u2019s adoption of the Revised Ordinance. This process is necessary because the Constitution limits our jurisdiction to the adjudication of actual cases and controversies. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 2; <em>DeFunis v. Odegaard, </em>416 U.S. 312, 316, 94 S.Ct. 1704, 40 L.Ed.2d 164 (1974) (per curiam). \u201c[A] case is moot when the issues presented are no longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d <em>Powell v. McCormack, </em>395 U.S. 486, 496, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969). The require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>ment that a case involve an actual, ongoing controversy extends throughout the pendency of an action. <em>See Preiser v. New-kirk, </em>422 U.S. 395, 401, 95 S.Ct. 2330, 45 L.Ed.2d 272 (1975). To satisfy the Article III case or controversy requirement, \u201c[a] litigant must have suffered some actual injury that can be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\u201d <em>Iron Arrow Honor Soe\u2019y v. Heckler, </em>464 U.S. 67, 70-71, 104 S.Ct. 373, 78 L.Ed.2d 58 (1983). When a ease or controversy ceases to exist, the litigation becomes moot and the federal court no longer possesses jurisdiction to proceed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">As a preliminary matter, Chapin maintains that we cannot dismiss its appeal as moot because the Town has waived any mootness contention in failing to file a cross-appeal, and in raising mootness only in its response brief. This contention is without merit, however, because mootness is a jurisdictional question that we are obliged, if necessary, to address sua sponte. <em>See Friedman\u2019s, Inc. v. Dunlap, </em>290 F.3d 191, 197 (4th Cir.2002) (noting that \u201cthe question of whether we are presented with a live case or controversy is a question we may raise sua sponte\u201d as mootness goes to heart of Article III jurisdiction (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also Mt. Healthy City Sch. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 278, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977) (concluding that \u201cwe are obliged to inquire sua sponte whenever a doubt arises as to the existence of federal jurisdiction\u201d). Accordingly, because we lack jurisdiction \u201cto decide questions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before [us],\u201d we must address whether the Town\u2019s adoption of the Revised Ordinance has mooted Chapin\u2019s case. <em>See NoHh Carolina v. Rice, </em>404 U.S. 244, 246, 92 S.Ct. 402, 30 L.Ed.2d 413 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">As spelled out above, Chapin has complained about multiple aspects of the Ordinance. <em>See supra </em>Part I.B. However, the Revised Ordinance undermines each of Chapin\u2019s contentions. It makes no exception for the government or for time and temperature EMCs, and its Statement of Purpose and Intent confirms that the \u201cintent of these sign regulations\u201d is to preserve, inter alia, \u201cthe health, safety, welfare and general well-being of the community\u2019s citizens.\u201d <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Br., Addendum A, \u00a7 900.1. Moreover, the Revised Ordinance requires the Town to approve or deny permit applications within two weeks of obtaining the necessary information. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 900.2. Because the challenged aspects of the Ordinance have been remedied, Chapin\u2019s claims for injunctive and declaratory relief appear to be moot. <em>See Coal, for the Abolition of Marijuana Prohibition v. City of Atlanta, </em>219 F.3d 1301, 1310 (11th Cir.2000) (noting that \u201csuperseding statute or regulation moots a case ... to the extent that it removes challenged features of the prior law\u201d). Our review of the mootness issue does not end here, however, because voluntary cessation of a challenged activity does not automatically deprive us of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">As we recognized in <em>Am. Legion Post 7 of Durham v. City of Durham, </em>\u201cthe mere amendment or repeal of a challenged ordinance does not automatically moot a challenge to that ordinance.\u201d 239 F.3d 601, <em>60S (4th </em>Cir.2001) (citing <em>City of Mesquite v. Aladdin\u2019s Castle, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 283, 289, 102 S.Ct. 1070, 71 L.Ed.2d 152 (1982)). Instead, we must assess the likelihood that the Town will reenact the Ordinance. <em>Id. </em>at 606. This is so because \u201c[a] case is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>moot, and the exercise of federal jurisdiction may be appropriate ... if a party can demonstrate that the apparent absence of a live dispute is merely a temporary abeyance of a harm that is \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brooks v. Vassar, </em>462 F.3d 341, 348 (4th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Mellen v. Bunting, </em>327 F.3d 355, 363-64 (4th Cir.2003)). Nevertheless, a lawsuit challenging a statute that no longer exists can become moot \u201ceven where re-enactment of the statute at issue is within the power of the legislature.\u201d <em>Am. Legion Post 7, </em>239 F.3d at 606. \u201cOnly if reenactment is not merely possible but appears probable may we find the harm to be \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review\u2019 and hold that the case is not moot.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>462 F.3d at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">In its evaluation of the mootness issue, the district court concluded that the Town had failed to meet its \u201cburden of demonstrating that [it] would not reenact the challenged provisions of the Ordinance.\u201d Opinion 4. Two important events have occurred since the court\u2019s Opinion of September 20, 2006. First, on November 7, 2006, the Town enacted the Revised Ordinance, despite having already been awarded summary judgment in this case. Second, the Town assured this Court at oral argument that it will not reenact the Ordinance. Accordingly, we are confident that the Ordinance will not be reenacted and that any alleged harm to Chapin is not \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>See Reyes v. City of Lynchburg, </em>300 F.3d 449, 453 (4th Cir.2002) (concluding overbreadth claim moot where city repealed challenged ordinance, promised not to reenact similar one, and there was \u201cno reasonable expectation\u201d that city would reenact it). The claims made in Chapin\u2019s complaint are therefore now moot. <em>Id. </em>at 453 (agreeing with lower court that case was \u201cmoot as to future application\u201d because City repealed ordinance and promised not to reenact similar one).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">Chapin contends, however, that even if its claims for declaratory and injunctive relief have been mooted by the Revised Ordinance, its claim for nominal damages yet presents a live controversy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Chapin posits that \u201cfor so long as the plaintiff has a cause of action for damages, a defendant\u2019s change in conduct will not moot the case.\u201d <em>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human, Res., </em>532 U.S. 598, 608-09, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001). This proposition is normally valid, and it has been applied where a plaintiff is only pursuing a claim for nominal damages. <em>See Henson v. Honor Comm. ofUniv. ofVa., </em>719 F.2d 69, 72 n. 5 (4th Cir.1983) (observing that withdrawal of disciplinary charges did not moot claim because plaintiff also sought nominal damages); <em>see also EH Outdoor, LLC v. Clay County, </em>482 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir.2007) (noting that, because nominal damages were requested, changes made to ordinance did not moot claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">Chapin\u2019s assertion of a nominal damages claim alone is insufficient to preserve a live controversy, however, as the Ordinance was never enforced against it and it has not suffered any constitutional deprivation. <em>See Tanner Adver. Group, LLC v. Fayette County, </em>451 F.3d 777, 786 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that \u201crequest for damages that is barred as a matter of law cannot save a case from mootness\u201d) (citing <em>Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, </em>520 U.S. 43, 69, 117 S.Ct. 1055, 137 L.Ed.2d 170 (1997)). The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 254, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978), \u201cobligates a court to award nominal damages when a plaintiff establishes the violation of [a constitutional right] but cannot prove actual injury.\u201d <em>Farrar v. Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103, 112, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992). As the Supreme Court has observed, \u201c[w]hatever the constitutional basis for \u00a7 1983 liability, such damages must always be designed to compensate injuries caused by the [constitutional] deprivation.\u201d <em>Memphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura, </em>477 U.S. 299, 309-10, 106 S.Ct. 2537, 91 L.Ed.2d 249 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, although Chapin need not prove an actual, compensable injury in order to recover nominal damages, it must nevertheless show that a constitutional deprivation occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 308 n. 11, 106 S.Ct. 2537; <em>see also Reyes, </em>300 F.3d at 453 (\u201cNominal damages may be available in a \u00a7 1983 case if a plaintiff was deprived of an absolute right yet did not suffer an actual injury.\u201d); <em>Williams v. Griffin, </em>952 F.2d 820, 825 n. 2 (4th Cir. 1991) (concluding that \u201cin the absence of a showing of actual injury, [plaintiff] would still be entitled to nominal damages upon proof of a constitutional violation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">In the absence of a constitutional deprivation, Chapin\u2019s nominal damages claim does not save this case from mootness. Moreover, the fact that Chapin could have suffered some constitutional deprivation if the Town had enforced the Ordinance does not save its claim for nominal damages\u2014 such damages are reserved for constitutional deprivations that have occurred, not those that are merely speculative. <em>See Tanner, </em>451 F.3d at 786-87 (concluding that claims of appellant could not be saved from mootness by claim for damages where sign ordinance had not caused harm); <em>see also Comm, for the First Amendment v. Campbell, </em>962 F.2d 1517, 1526 (10th Cir.1992) (finding that, although adoption of new policy mooted claims for injunctive relief, \u201cthe district court erred in dismissing the nominal damages claim which relates to <em>past </em>(not future) conduct\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In <em>Covenant Media of South Carolina, LLC v. City of North Charleston, </em>we recently addressed a mootness issue related to nominal damages in a \u00a7 1983 case. <em>See </em>493 F.3d 421 (4th Cir.2007). Covenant Media had filed a civil action against the City of North Charleston, alleging a violation of its First Amendment rights by enforcement of the City\u2019s sign regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 424. Covenant Media had submitted an application to construct a billboard as required by the City\u2019s sign regulation, and when the City failed to act on its application for several months, Covenant Media filed suit. <em>Id. </em>at 425. Covenant Media contended that the sign regulation was unconstitutional because it \u201cfailed to require a decision on a sign permit within a specific time period, in contravention of procedural safeguards mandated by <em>Freedman v. Maryland, </em>380 U.S. 51, 58-59, 85 S.Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428. In addition to injunctive relief, Covenant Media sought nominal damages. <em>Id. </em>at 427. During the litigation, North Charleston adopted a revised regulation, which placed a forty-five day time limitation on the disposition of sign permit applications \u2014 a procedural provision not included in its predecessor regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 426. We decided that, if the City\u2019s original sign regulation lacked the procedural safeguards mandated by <em>Freedman, </em>Covenant had \u201csuffered an injury by the City\u2019s application of an unconstitutional ordinance that is redressable at least by nominal damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428. Accordingly, we determined that \u201cCovenant\u2019s suit is not moot because if Covenant is correct on the merits, it is entitled to at least nominal damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429 n. 4. We nevertheless cautioned that \u201ca plaintiff must establish that he has standing to challenge each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>provision of an ordinance by showing that he <em>was injured </em>by application of those provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The <em>Covenant Media </em>situation is readily distinguishable from this appeal. Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Covenant Media, </em>Chapin\u2019s permit application received prompt attention. In fact, Chapin was not required to submit a permit application before making changes to its sign. Despite assurances that it did not need a permit, Chapin nevertheless submitted an application. In response, the Town immediately waived the permit fee and approved the application. It was only after Chapin installed and began using its EMC, on August 20, 2004, that the Town realized the nature of Chapin\u2019s changes to its sign and requested that it remove the EMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Notwithstanding Chapin\u2019s violation of the Ordinance, the Town did not f\u00edne or cite Chapin, and no court proceedings were initiated against it. In fact, in its summary judgment papers, Chapin informed the district court that \u201c[f]rom the time the sign was put up through the course of this litigation, the Chapin Furniture Outlet sign has been in use advertising for the businesses located on the property the sign is on.\u201d J.A. 360. Chapin noted that \u201c[t]he sign has been displaying these messages at the same intervals allowed for time and temperature signs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360-61. Such flashing messages violated the Ordinance, but Chapin concedes that it has used its EMC throughout the pendency of its dispute with the Town. Any contention that Chapin\u2019s speech was chilled by the Ordinance or the Town\u2019s letters requesting compliance therewith is thus entirely undermined. And, Chapin has failed to allege any other constitutional deprivation sufficient to support a claim for nominal damages. Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Covenant Media, </em>Chapin is unable to show any constitutional injury caused by the Ordinance. As we observed there, \u201ca plaintiff must establish that he has standing to challenge each provision of an ordinance by showing that he was injured by application of those provisions.\u201d <em>Covenant Media, </em>493 F.3d at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Absent a constitutional deprivation, Chapin\u2019s claim for nominal damages fails to present a case or controversy sufficient to avoid mootness. Because we cannot grant \u201cany effectual relief whatever,\u201d including nominal damages, in favor of Chapin, this proceeding must be dismissed as moot. <em>Calderon v. Moore, </em>518 U.S. 149, 150, 116 S.Ct. 2066, 135 L.Ed.2d 453 (1996) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for dismissal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-15\">.

Chapin\u2019s permit may have been obtained by misrepresentations made by the EMC's manufacturer about the nature of changes to the sign. The Zoning Administrator contends that she was informed by telephone that Chapin was simply going to add illumination to the sign it already displayed. Because the Ordinance does not require a permit for changes to an existing lawful sign that do not render the sign in violation of the Ordinance, the Administrator determined that Chapin did not need a permit for the changes proposed. When the manufacturer indicated that he would like a permit anyway, the permit fee was waived and Chapin secured the permit that very day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b592-6\">. The Opinion indicates that \u2018\u2018[t]he Town approved the revised ordinance on July 18, 2006,\u201d and the district court treated the Revised Ordinance as final. Opinion 2. The Revised Ordinance, however, was not actually enacted until November 7, 2006, after the Town had conducted a public hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b593-9\">. The Revised Ordinance does not permit scrolling messages and Chapin mentions this point (briefly) only in its reply brief. Chapin\u2019s summary briefing on this issue provides an insufficient basis for our review. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A) (providing that appellant\u2019s brief must contain \"contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies\u201d). Assuming that Chapin preserved this issue, its discontent with such a de minimus aspect of the Revised Ordinance is not sufficient to preserve a live case or controversy. <em>See Lovem v. Edwards, </em>190 F.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir.1999) (concluding that \"federal jurisdiction requires that a party assert a <em>substantial </em>federal claim\u201d (emphasis in original, internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Davis v. Pak, </em>856 F.2d 648, 650 (4th Cir. 1988) (concluding that mere assertion of constitutional violation not sufficient to obtain jurisdiction because jurisdiction requires party to assert substantial federal claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b595-6\">. Chapin has not pursued its claim for consequential damages on appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>Carter v. Lee, </em>283 F.3d 240, 252 n. 11 (4th Cir.2002) (noting that contentions not raised in opening brief are deemed waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\">. When a claim becomes \"moot after the entry of a district court's final judgment and prior to the completion of appellate review, we generally vacate the judgment and remand for dismissal.\u201d <em>Mellen v. Bunting, </em>327 F.3d 355, 364 (4th Cir.2003). Although vacatur is not appropriate where mootness occurs due to the voluntary actions of the losing party, it is available where \"appellate review of the adverse ruling was prevented by the vagaries of circumstance or the unilateral action of the party who prevailed below.\u201d <em>Valero Terrestrial Corp. v.
