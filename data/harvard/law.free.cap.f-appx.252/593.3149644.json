The district court dismissed the suit as frivolous. \u201cA complaint is frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999) (quotation marks omitted). We review the dismissal of a prisoner\u2019s complaint as frivolous for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-18\">According to Mahogany, the district court erred in dismissing his complaint because his constitutional right to access the courts encompasses the right to file administrative grievances. Interference with the right of access to courts is actionable under \u00a7 1983 only where the inmate demonstrates \u201cactual injury stemming from defendants\u2019 unconstitutional conduct.\u201d <em>Chriceol v. Phillips, </em>169 F.3d 313, 317 (5th Cir.1999). Mahogany seems to assert that he was injured by the failure to process his grievances because he is required to exhaust the grievance procedure before he can bring any claims in the district court. This argument is meritless because the district court assumes that a prisoner\u2019s claims have been exhausted when his grievances were not processed within prescribed time limits. <em>Underwood v. Wilson, </em>151 F.3d 292, 295 (5th Cir.1998), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Jones v. Book, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 910, 919-21, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Mahogany also asserts that he has a protected liberty interest in filing grievances and that he was deprived of due process when his grievances were refused. He does not have a protected liberty interest in the processing of his prison grievances. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373-74 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cInsofar as he seeks relief regarding an alleged violation of his due process rights resulting from the prison grievance procedures, the district court did not err in dismissing his claim as frivolous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Because Mahogany\u2019s appeal is without ai\u2019guable merit, we dismiss it as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. It. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of his suit and our dismissal of his appeal each count as a strike against him for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). If he accumulates three strikes, he may no longer proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b618-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
