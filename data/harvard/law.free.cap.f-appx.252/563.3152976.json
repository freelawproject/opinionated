The district court sentenced Torres-Garcia to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment, an upward departure of four months from the high end of Torres-Garcia\u2019s sentencing guidelines range of imprisonment. On appeal, Torres-Garcia\u2019s attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising for the court\u2019s consideration whether the district court erred in imposing an upward departure. Torres-Garcia was informed of the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not do so. The Government did not file a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-16\">We will affirm the sentence imposed by the district court as long as it is within the statutorily prescribed range and reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005). In sentencing a defendant, the district court must: (1) properly calculate the guideline range; (2) determine whether a sentence within that range serves the factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007); (3) implement mandatory statutory limitations; and (4) explain its reasons for selecting the sentence, especially a sentence outside the advisory range. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Even if the sentence exceeds the advisory guideline range, it will generally be deemed reasonable \u201cif the reasons justifying the variance are tied to \u00a7 3553(a) and are plausible.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.), cert <em>denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-19\">If the court finds that a sentence within the guidelines does not serve \u00a7 3553(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>factors, it may impose a different sentence within statutory limits. If that is the case, the court should first look \u201cto whether a departure is appropriate based on the Guidelines Manual or relevant case law.\u201d <em>Moreland, 437 </em>F.3d at 432. The court must make factual findings, as appropriate or necessary to carry out its sentencing function, and in every case give the reasons for the sentence imposed, as well as reasons for particular deviations from the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 455. This court must ask \u201cwhether the sentence was selected pursuant to a reasoned process in accordance with the law, in which the court did not give excessive weight to any relevant factor, and which effected a fair and just result in light of the relevant facts and law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">A district court may depart upward from the guidelines range under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.3 (2005) when \u201cthe defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l). The guideline further directs that \u201c[i]n a case in which the court determines that the extent and nature of the defendant\u2019s criminal history, taken together, are sufficient to warrant an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI, the court should structure the departure by moving incrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense level in Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline range appropriate to the case.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3 (a)(4)(B). Commentary to the guideline states that, \u201c[i]n determining whether an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI is warranted, the court should consider that the nature of the prior offenses rather than simply their number is often more indicative of the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal record.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3, comment, (n.2 (B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Our review of the record shows the district court properly determined that Torres-Garcia\u2019s criminal history category under-represented his criminal history. It properly moved incrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense level and chose a sentence from within that range of imprisonment. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Torres-Garcia\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Torres-Garcia.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
