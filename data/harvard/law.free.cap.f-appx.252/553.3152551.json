The district court granted the government\u2019s motion for downward departure under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1, p.s. (2004), based upon Markle\u2019s substantial assistance, and sentenced Markle to a 132-month term of imprisonment, which was 103 months below the advisory sentencing guideline range. Markle\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the adequacy of the hearing conducted pursuant to Fed.R.CrimP. 11, and the reasonableness of Markle\u2019s sentence. Markle has filed a pro se supplemental brief raising several issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">Counsel raises as a potential issue the adequacy of the plea hearing but does not specify any deficiencies in the district court\u2019s Rule 11 inquiries. Because Markle did not move in the district court to withdraw her guilty plea, any error in the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Mariinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (discussing standard). Our careful review of the record convinces us that the magistrate judge substantially complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Markle\u2019s guilty plea. Moreover, the magistrate judge and the district court ensured that Markle entered her plea knowingly and voluntarily and that the plea was supported by an independent factual basis. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">Counsel also suggests that Markle\u2019s sentence is unreasonable. In imposing a sentence <em>post-Booker,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>courts still must calculate the applicable guideline range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). This court will affirm a post-<em>Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see Rita v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number><em>States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69,168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The district court properly calculated the guideline range and appropriately treated the sentencing guidelines as advisory. The district court explicitly considered Markle\u2019s assistance to the government in granting the government\u2019s motion for a substantial assistance departure. The court also considered the nature of the offense and Markle\u2019s history and characteristics before imposing a sentence well below the guideline range. Thus, we find that the sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any mei'itorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-11\">. We have thoroughly reviewed the issues raised in the pro se brief and find them to be without merit. To the extent Markle seeks to raise claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal, we decline to review them at this time. <em>See United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.) (providing standard), <em>cert, denied, </em>546 U.S. 1203, 126 S.Ct. 1407, 164 L.Ed.2d 107 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-19\">. <em>United States v.
