Florence\u2019s complaint alleged that the defendants conspired and retaliated against him and maliciously prosecuted him in disciplinary proceeding number 20050042060.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-20\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of Florence\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint de novo. <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998). Florence\u2019s only argument on appeal is that the district court erred in determining that his reduction in line classification status did not implicate a constitutionally protected liberty interest. The district court\u2019s determination was based on our holding in <em>Malchi v. Thaler, </em>211 F.3d 953 (5th Cir.2000). Florence argues that <em>Malehi </em>was incorrectly decided and that we should revisit that decision. Absent an intervening Supreme Court or en banc decision, we cannot overrule the decision of a prior panel of this court. <em>Foster v. Quarterman, </em>466 F.3d 359, 367-68 (5th Cir. 2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2099, 167 L.Ed.2d 817 (2007). The district court correctly dismissed Florence\u2019s complaint, and all of his outstanding motions before this court are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-23\">The appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Florence is warned that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) and that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996); \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-24\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b721-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
