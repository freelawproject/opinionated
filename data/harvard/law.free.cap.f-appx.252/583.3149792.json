The district court denied Dedrick\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because he had not shown that his claims satisfied the requirements of the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 savings clause. Dedrick argues that the indictment was invalid because it was not notarized or stamped with the \u201cGovernment Seal of Certification of Notarization\u201d and was not signed by the grand jury foreperson. He argues that he was never in possession of any drugs and that the Government lied in the indictment and forged the indictment. He argues that the district court erred in not addressing the merits of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">In order to satisfy the criteria of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, Dedrick must show that his claims are based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and that the claims were foreclosed by circuit law at the time when they should have been raised at trial, on appeal, or in an initial \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir. 2001). Dedrick- has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Dedrick\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED. Dedrick\u2019s \u201cMotion to Grant Amended State a Claim Upon Which Relief May Be Granted In Appellant\u2019s Brief\u2019 is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b608-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
