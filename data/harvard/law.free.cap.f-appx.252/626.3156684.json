The district court agreed with and accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations, concluding that plaintiff failed to produce summary judgment evidence to allow a fact finder to find a causal link between a custom or policy of Harris County Department of Education (HCDE) and any violation of federal law suffered by plaintiffs son.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Plaintiffs 21-year-old son Toddrick Lewis was a special education student attending school at HCDE\u2019s ABC West campus in Houston, Texas. This is a school for mentally retarded and emotionally disturbed students. Toddrick grabbed a meat patty off the plate of another student, placed it whole in his mouth and began to choke. Several staff members responded by performing the Heimlich maneuver and made other efforts to dislodge the food from Toddrick\u2019s throat but, unfortunately, were unsuccessful, and he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">1. We agree with the magistrate judge and district court that appellant has failed to demonstrate a policy, practice, or custom enacted or known to the HCDE board that was causally related to Toddrick\u2019s injury and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-16\">2. The district court did not err in declining to consider plaintiffs supplemental evidence that was not tendered to the magistrate judge before her decision. Appellant never sufficiently explained her delay in obtaining and submitting this evidence. <em>See Freeman v. County of Bexar, </em>142 F.3d 848 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-17\">Therefore, for these reasons and those set forth in the careful November 2, 2006 Memorandum and Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge, we affirm the district court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b651-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
