We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>See Cousin v. Small, </em>325 F.3d 627, 637 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-25\">Miller asserts that, for a period of five years, defendants Kalmanov and Wilson exercised deliberate indifference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>treatment of his hemorrhoid condition. The record reflects that Miller was treated for his hemorrhoids, including two separate visits with specialists. Miller\u2019s complaints regarding his treatment constitute disagreement with the method of treatment that was provided and are non-aetionable under the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Miller also asserts that the defendants lied about his medical condition to retaliate against Miller for filing grievances concerning the method of treatment that he was receiving. He contends that Wilson and Kalmanov engaged in retaliatory practices by consistently prescribing hydrocortisone cream although it caused Miller burning pain. Miller has not alleged \u201ca chronology of events from which retaliation may plausibly be inferred.\u201d <em>See Tighe v. Wall, </em>100 F.3d 41, 42 (5th Cir.1996). He has not shown that but for a retaliatory motive, the defendants would not have prescribed hydrocortisone cream to treat his hemorrhoid condition. <em>See id. </em>The district court did not err in granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <em>See Cousin, </em>325 F.3d at 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Miller has abandoned his conspiracy and deliberate indifference claims against defendant Potter. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b704-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
