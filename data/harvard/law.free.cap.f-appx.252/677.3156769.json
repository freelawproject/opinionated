The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s determinations: that Ca\u00edame was removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation, and under \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), as a nommmigrant overstay. The BIA agreed that Calame\u2019s conviction of attempted criminal sale of co-came was \u201cfor a drug trafficking offense that is both an aggravated felony and a particularly serious crime, so as to render the respondent ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal\u201d and that Ca\u00edame had failed to meet his burden of proof under the CAT. Ca\u00edame timely filed his petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision. Thereafter, Ca\u00edame filed several motions to reopen and/or for reconsideration, all of which were demed. Ca\u00edame did not petition for review of the decisions denying the motions to reopen and/or for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Ca\u00edame contends that he was denied due process and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because he was advised to plead true to the allegation that he had been convicted m New York of attempted erimmal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He contends that his plea was unknowing and involuntary and that he was not advised of the consequences of his plea, as it made him ineligible for adjustment of status. He complains that he was not permitted to testify and to explain the circumstances of the offense and that counsel failed to call other witnesses on his behalf. Ca\u00edame argues that counsel knew that the IJs at the Oakdale detention facility never grant relief under the CAT and that, accordmgly, it was unreasonable for counsel to adopt a strategy that left him ineligible for other relief. Ca\u00edame contends that his conviction was for attempted criminal <em>possession </em>of cocaine, not attempted erimmal <em>sale </em>of cocaine. Ca\u00edame contends that his New York conviction was not a drug-trafficking aggravated felony because there was no showing that the offense involved a \u201csale.\u201d He contends that the offense would not be considered a felony under the Controlled Substances Act. Ca\u00edame contends also that he is entitled to cancellation of removal under the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Although the foregoing issues were raised m Calame\u2019s motions to reopen and/or for reconsideration, they were not raised on direct appeal. The \u201cBIA\u2019s denial of an appeal and its denial of a motion to reconsider are two separate final orders, each of which require them own petitions for review.\u201d <em>Guevara v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 173, 176 (5th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted). Because Calame has not petitioned for review of the BIA\u2019s decisions denying the motions to reopen and/or for reconsideration, this court does not have jurisdiction over the issues raised only in those motions. <em>See id.; Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 676 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Calame contends in his reply brief that the BIA erred in determining that his state offense was a \u201cparticularly serious crime.\u201d Because this issue was not raised in Calame\u2019s opening brief, we have not considered it. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Calame raises no issue with respect to the BIA\u2019s denial of relief under the CAT. Issues that are not briefed are waived. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004). The petition is</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b701-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
