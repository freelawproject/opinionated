We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-18\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b675-19\">Continental Airlines, Inc. (\u201cContinental\u201d) hired Hall as an airport ticket agent in 1996. In October 2000, she began working in the Customer Care Department. As a Customer Care Representative, Hall\u2019s duties included receiving customer complaints, researching the complaints, appropriately responding to customers, and documenting her responses to customers in Continental\u2019s files.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-20\">In February 2002, Hall failed to address and document a customer complaint. Three months passed, and Hall\u2019s supervisor, Joycelyn Barrow (\u201cBarrow\u201d), intervened and responded to the customer\u2019s complaints about Continental\u2019s service and Hall\u2019s lack of response. Barrow discussed Hall\u2019s poor job performance after that incident with her in May 2002. By October 2002, Barrow rated Hall\u2019s job performance as \u201cOn-Target Minus\u201d and developed a performance improvement plan for her. Hall insisted upon tape-recording a mandatory job evaluation meeting with Barrow, but when the meeting was postponed, Hall refused to meet with Barrow. In December 2002, Hall objected again to meeting with Barrow and being required to participate in a performance improvement plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-21\">On December 16, 2002, Barrow and Judy Dyer (\u201cDyer\u201d), Director of Customer Care, met with Hall to discuss Continental\u2019s expectations regarding her productivity and job performance. Continental had received another customer complaint regarding Hall\u2019s lack of timely customer service. They reminded Hall of her obligation to provide polite, timely responses to customer complaints and to document her interactions in resolving complaints. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>At the meeting, Hall accused Barrow of harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Hall\u2019s allegation was investigated by Continental\u2019s Managing Director of Human Resources, Gigi Jensen (\u201cJensen\u201d). Jensen met with Hall on December 18, 2002 to discuss the complaint. Hall complained of Barrow\u2019s numerous written communications and e-mails which she felt were micromanaging. Afterward, Hall took an extended vacation and, upon her return to work in late January 2003, Dyer changed Hall\u2019s performance rating to \u201cOn-Target.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">By March 2003, Continental continued to receive customer complaints regarding Hall\u2019s job performance. Hall, now supervised by Suzanne Venn (\u201cVenn\u201d), was advised that her work files were under review and that the result of the review could mean discipline or discharge. On April 25, 2003, Venn and Service Manager, Renee Mobley, held an investigatory meeting with Hall to discuss the serious problems discovered by the quality assurance review. The review revealed that Hall had closed customer complaint files when the complaint had not been resolved, documented customer responses that were never sent, and reopened closed files only to close them again, so that she could get credit for successfully resolving customer complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">On April 29, 2003, Hall submitted a formal written complaint of \u201cworkplace\u201d harassment. She made no allegation of harassment based upon a protected category, but expressed her \u201cfear of retaliation\u201d and alleged that her supervisors had \u201cviolated [her] due process rights.\u201d Jensen reviewed Hall\u2019s complaint but concluded that none of the allegations were related to Hall\u2019s race or sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Based on the results from the review of Hall\u2019s work files, Continental terminated her employment on May 2, 2003. Hall filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) on May 21, 2004, after initially filing a charge with the Civil Rights Division of the Texas Workforce Commission. She alleged that she was subjected to unlawful discrimination on the basis of her sex and that she had been terminated in retaliation for complaining about that conduct. She received a right-to-sue notice from the EEOC dated September 29, 2004, but did not file a lawsuit in federal court until January 18, 2005. In her complaint, she alleged that Continental had discriminated against her on the basis of race and sex, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2000h-6, and the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1871, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983. She also claimed that she had been terminated out of retaliation. Finally, Hall alleged state law claims of assault, defamation, and \u201cnegligent hiring and retention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendations, finding that Hall\u2019s lawsuit was not timely filed, that her claims of discrimination and retaliation under Title VII failed on the merits, and that her state law causes of action were abandoned due to her failure to comply with applicable statutes of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Strong v. Univ. Healthcare Sys., L.L.C., </em>482 F.3d 802, 805 (5th Cir. 2007). Summary judgment is proper when there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as matter of law. Fed.R.CivP. 56(c). \u201cThe evidence and inferences from the summary judgment record are viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>ant.\u201d <em>Minter v. Great Am. Ins. Co. of N.Y., </em>423 F.3d 460, 465 (5th Cir.2005). To survive a summary judgment motion, the nonmovant \u201cneed only present evidence from which a jury might return a verdict in his favor.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 257, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">A. Hall\u2019s Title VII Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Title VII disallows discrimination in hiring or termination of an individual based on his race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). Before an individual can pursue a Title VII claim in federal court, she must first exhaust her available administrative remedies. <em>See Taylor v. Books A Million, Inc., </em>296 F.3d 376, 378-79 (5th Cir.2002). Exhaustion occurs when an individual files a timely complaint with the EEOC, her claim is dismissed by that agency, and the agency informs her of her right to sue in federal court. <em>Id. </em>at 379. Once the EEOC has issued a right-to-sue letter, an individual has ninety days in which to file a civil action in federal court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l). Indeed, \u201c[t]his requirement to file a lawsuit within the ninety-day limitation period is strictly construed.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>296 F.3d at 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The EEOC dismissed Hall\u2019s complaint and provided notice of her right to sue on September 29, 2004. She filed this lawsuit in federal court on January 18, 2005, more than 100 days after the EEOC notified her of her right to sue. Hall does not address this issue and does not provide proof of the date she received the notice. When the actual date of receipt is unknown, \u201ccourts have presumed various receipt dates ranging from three to seven days after the letter was mailed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380. Even if we add several days to the ninety-day limit to allow for Hall\u2019s actual receipt of the notice, her complaint was filed untimely. Therefore, we hold that the district court properly dismissed Hall\u2019s Title VII claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">B. Hall\u2019s \u00a7 1981 Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">Hall claims that Continental discriminated against her on the basis of her race, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 1981 protects the right to enforce contracts without respect to race. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. This Circuit permits the prosecution of \u00a7 1981 claims that involve alleged discrimination of at-will employees. <em>See Byers v. Dallas Morning News, Inc., </em>209 F.3d 419, 425 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-14\">The analysis for claims under \u00a7 1981 and Title VII are identical and employ a burden-shifting framework for evaluating discrimination claims. <em>See Jones v. Robinson Prop. Group, L.P., </em>427 F.3d 987, 992 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Raggs v. Miss. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>278 F.3d 463, 468 (5th Cir.2002). In cases involving termination for workplace rule violations, an individual must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for discrimination. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). A <em>prima facie </em>case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>can generally be established if the plaintiff can show that he is a member of a protected class, he was qualified for the position that he held before being fired, he was fired or suffered other adverse employment action, and that similarly situated individuals outside of his protected class were treated more favorably. <em>Okoye v. Univ. of Tex. Houston Health Sci Ctr., </em>245 F.3d 507, 512-13 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Mayberry v. Vought Aircraft Co., </em>55 F.3d 1086, 1090 (5th Cir.1995). If a <em>prima facie </em>case for discrimination can be established, then the burden shifts to the defendant to rebut the plaintiffs case by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for any alleged unequal treatment. <em>Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253-56, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981); <em>Bodenheimer v. PPG Indus., Inc., </em>5 F.3d 955, 957 (5th Cir.1993). If the defendant presents such a reason, then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the defendant\u2019s reason for termination is not true, but is a mere pretext for discrimination, or that the reason is true, but the plaintiffs race was a motivating factor. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 804-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817; <em>Keelan v. Majesco Software, Inc., </em>407 F.3d 332, 341 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Here, Hall fails to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for race discrimination. Although the record indicates that at one time Hall was qualified for the job she held with Continental, and that she was later fired from that job, she presented no evidence that similarly situated individuals outside of her protected class were treated more favorably. Therefore, our analysis ends here and we hold that the district court properly dismissed Hall\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">C. Hall\u2019s State Law Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Hall claims that, under Texas law, Continental is liable to her for assault, defamation, and \u201cnegligent hiring and retention.\u201d However, she neglected to provide any argument or support for these claims in her brief. Because \u201c[i]nadequately briefed issues are deemed abandoned,\u201d this Court will not consider this issue. <em>United States v. Charles, </em>469 F.3d 402, 408 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b675-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-9\">. Even if her Title VII claims had been filed timely, her claim for race discrimination is barred because she did not raise that issue in her EEOC complaint. Courts may not consider claims brought under Title VII that were not included in a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. <em>See Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Employees v. City Pub. Serv. Bd., </em>40 F.3d 698, 711-12 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b677-15\">. Hall also made a discrimination claim under \u00a7 1983, but this statute prohibits only discriminatory behavior suffered at the hands of state actors. <em>See Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 U.S. 922, 929, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982). Because Hall has not alleged discriminatory behavior by a state actor, \u00a7 1983 is inapplicable. Thus, we find that the district court properly dismissed her \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
