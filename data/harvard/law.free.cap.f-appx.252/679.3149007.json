Rodriguez petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) denial of her request for a continuance. Rodriguez sought a continuance of her removal proceedings because a visa would soon be available and she would be eligible for an adjustment of status based on her approved 1-130 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-25\">We review the IJ\u2019s decision because the BIA affirmed without opinion. <em>Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 791 (5th Cir.2004). The grant of a motion to continue lies within the sound discretion of the IJ, who may grant the motion for good cause shown. <em>Witter v. INS, </em>113 F.3d 549, 555 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29. The Attorney General may adjust an alien\u2019s status \u201cif \u2014 (A) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence; and (B) an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>time the application is filed.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Although Rodriguez concedes that a visa is not immediately available, she asserts that the IJ should have granted the continuance because her visa would be available soon. Rodriguez, however, could not specify a time in which the visa would become available. In light of Rodriguez\u2019s inability to advise the IJ of an availability date, she cannot establish good cause warranting a continuance. <em>See Witter, </em>113 F.3d at 555-56 (finding no abuse of discretion in denial of request for continuance while state criminal charges were pending, as alien could not say when the proceedings might be completed and counsel indicated the continuance might be lengthy); <em>see also Bright v. INS, </em>837 F.2d 1330, 1332 (5th Cir.1988) (holding that the IJ did not abuse his discretion in refusing to grant an indefinite continuance). Accordingly, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying Rodriguez\u2019s motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Rodriguez requests that we take judicial notice of the visa bulletins for April 2007 and December 1995. We are required to consider the issues raised in a petition for review \u201conly on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b703-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
