On March 13, 2007, Raz sought permission to file a complaint against Bossier Deputy Reigan Malmay, Three Unknown Bossier Deputies, and the United States of America for alleged constitutional violations arising out of a traffic stop and arrest in Benton, Louisiana. Finding that Raz\u2019s complaint was frivolous, the district court denied Raz leave to file his complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Raz now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-18\">Having reviewed the pleadings and Raz\u2019s previous filings in the Western District of Louisiana, we conclude that Raz\u2019s current complaint contains the same type of incredible claims and allegations that led to the dismissal of Raz\u2019s previous actions. <em>See, e.g., Raz v. United States, No. 99-0202 </em>(W.D.La. Aug. 16, 1999) (order granting defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss). These incredible assertions also no doubt \u2014 in addition to Raz\u2019s \u201ccontumacious\u201d behavior \u2014 led to the imposition of the pre-filing sanction in the first instance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Raz v. Storey, </em>No. 99-1850 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>(W.D.La. Mar. 13, 2001) (order dismissing Raz\u2019s case and imposing sanctions on Raz). We, therefore, find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Raz leave to file his complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See In re: Yoram Raz, </em>48 Fed.Appx. 104 (5th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Accordingly, the order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b634-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-12\">. Raz contends that the district court's order did not state the reasons for its denial of his Motion for Leave to File Complaint and, therefore, remand is required. The district court, however, stated that the reason it denied Raz\u2019s motion was because it found his complaint \u201cfrivolous.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b634-19\">. Although the allegations regarding the discrete events at issue \u2014 an allegedly unlawful traffic stop, search, and arrest \u2014 are not in and of themselves incredible or delusional, this event is \u2014 according to Raz \u2014 simply another event in the same \u201cmassive, unrelenting, and life-destroying\u201d conspiracy involving the FBI, state and local law enforcement, and Israel's counterintelligence organization, Shin-Bet. Consequently, Raz's ongoing and incredible tale about this conspiracy casts doubt on his specific allegations regarding the events at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b635-18\">. Raz also alleges that the district judge was biased against Raz. However, his argument is based on previous adverse rulings of the district judge, which, without more, is insufficient to cast doubt on the judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 550-51, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
