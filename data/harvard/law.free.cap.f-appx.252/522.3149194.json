Mock appeals <em>pro se </em>the order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania denying her motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d). For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-31\">In March 2006, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granted the Chapter 13 Trustee\u2019s motion to dismiss Mock\u2019s bankruptcy petition because she unreasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>delayed prosecution, <em>see </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1807(c)(1), and failed to make timely plan payments, <em>see </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1307(c)(4). At the same time, the Bankruptcy Court dismissed as moot a related adversary proceeding. Mock appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The District Court dismissed the case for failure to comply with Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8006, which requires an appellant to designate both the items to be included in the record and the issues to be presented on appeal. Mock filed a motion for reconsideration, which the District Court denied. Next, in conjunction with the filing of another IFP application, Mock asked the District Court to grant a petition for a writ of mandamus compelling the Bankruptcy Court to reopen the adversary proceedings. The District Court denied the IFP application without explanation. Mock appealed, arguing that she financially qualifies for IFP status.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, <em>see Abdul-Akbar v. McKelvie, </em>239 F.3d 307, 311 (3d Cir.2001), and we review the District Court\u2019s denial of IFP status for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Jones v. Zimmerman, </em>752 F.2d 76, 78 (3d Cir.1985). In this Circuit, IFP determinations are made solely on the basis of indigence, without regard to the potential merit of a complaint. <em>See Deutsch, v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 1080, 1084 n. 5 (3d Cir. 1995). We have, however, left open the possibility that \u201c \u2018extreme circumstances\u2019 might justify denying an otherwise [financially] qualified affiant leave to proceed [IFP],\u201d although \u201cwe have not delineated the circumstances that might be sufficiently \u2018extreme\u2019 to justify denial[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1084 n. 1. The decision to grant IFP status turns on whether an applicant is \u201ceconomically eligible\u201d for such status. <em>Sinwell v. Shapp, </em>536 F.2d 15, 19 (3d Cir.1976) (citation omitted). When exercising its discretion to approve or deny a motion to proceed IFP, a District Court \u201cmust be rigorous ... to ensure that the treasury is not unduly imposed upon.\u201d <em>Walker v. People Express Airlines, Inc., </em>886 F.2d 598, 601 (3d Cir.1989). At the same time, however, the court must remember that the purpose of the IFP statute \u201cis to provide an entr\u00e9, not a barrier, to the indigent seeking relief in federal court.\u201d <em>Souder v. McGuire, </em>516 F.2d 820, 823 (3d Cir.1975). Indeed, the Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff need not \u201cbe absolutely destitute\u201d or \u201ccontribute to payment of costs, the last dollar they have or can get\u201d to enjoy the benefit of IFP status. <em>Adkins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>335 U.S. 331, 337, 69 S.Ct. 85, 93 L.Ed. 43 (1948). To require complete destitution would prevent meritorious suits from being brought, frustrating the IFP statute. <em>Id. </em>at 340, 69 S.Ct. 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Unfortunately, the District Court\u2019s failure to provide any explanation of its rationale for denying IFP status prevents us from determining the basis on which it exercised its discretion. The District Court may, for example, have determined that Mock is financially ineligible for IFP status.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Alternatively, the District Court may have believed that some other factor constituted an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d warranting the denial of IFP status for non-financial reasons. We also cannot exclude the possibility that the District Court denied IFP status for some other reason. Under these circumstances, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Court\u2019s ruling may represent an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Notwithstanding, we cannot perceive how Mock has been prejudiced. She has not been prevented from asserting her claims; rather, her claims were considered by the District Court but rejected because she failed to comply with Bankruptcy Rule 8006. Moreover, despite the denial of the IFP application, the case has seemingly proceeded in the District Court without impediment. For instance, the District Court accepted and adjudicated Mock\u2019s \u201cEmergency Motion to Appeal by Permission.\u201d In addition, the District Court recently consolidated with the instant case three separate bankruptcy appeals filed by Mock.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">At most, the denial of IFP status precluded the District Court from adjudicating Mock\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus. It is clear, however, that Mock is not entitled to such a drastic remedy. In the mandamus petition, Mock essentially sought to circumvent the District Court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint and the denial of her motion for reconsideration. There is, however, an adequate means of challenging those determinations, namely, an appeal to this Court. <em>See In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378-79 (3d Cir.2005) (holding that a mandamus petitioner must establish, <em>inter alia, </em>that she has \u201cno other adequate means\u201d to obtain relief). Indeed, mandamus cannot be used as a substitute for appeal. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that his appeal presents us with no substantial question. <em>See </em>L.A.R. 27.4. Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See Fairview Township v. EPA, </em>773 F.2d 517, 525 n. 15 (3d Cir.1985) (holding that this Court may affirm on any basis supported by the record).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\">. We note that such a determination in itself would be an abuse of discretion. Mock has filed for bankruptcy. In her IFP application', Mock swore under penalty of perjury that her estimated income for 2007 is $15,360, that she has $100 in a checking account, and no savings. The District Court\u2019s filing fee is $250. Under these facts, Mock is clearly financially qualified for IFP status.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
