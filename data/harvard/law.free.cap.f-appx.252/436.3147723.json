For the reasons that follow, we will dismiss his appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-22\">On March 20, 2007, Pruden filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The District Court determined that the complaint failed to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8, 10, and 20 and dismissed the complaint without prejudice. The District Court\u2019s order provided Pruden with an opportunity to file an amended complaint within twenty days and warned Pruden that failure to do so would result in dismissal of the action with prejudice. After Pruden failed to file an amended complaint within the specified time period, the District Court entered an order dismissing Pirnden\u2019s action with prejudice. Pruden appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-23\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). Because Pruden has been granted <em>in forma pauperis </em>status pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, we review this appeal for possible dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). An appeal may be dismissed if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The District Court concluded that Pruden\u2019s complaint failed to comply with Fed R. Civ. P. 8, 10, and 20. We agree. Pruden\u2019s complaint avers multiple constitutional violations that occurred over a span of seven years. His claims arise out of different transactions and occurrences, and. in many instances he fails to specify the defendant or defendants that committed the alleged constitutional violation. The District Court dismissed the complaint without prejudice and allowed Pruden twenty days in which to file an amended complaint. Pruden failed to do so. Because Pruden decided not to amend his complaint in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed Pruden\u2019s complaint with prejudice. <em>See In re Westinghouse Securities Litigation, </em>90 F.3d 696, 704 (3d Cir.1996). The District Court expressly warned Pruden that the failure to amend his complaint would result in dismissal of the action with prejudice. \u201c[I]t is difficult to conceive of what other course the court could have followed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Spain v. Gallegos, </em>26 F.3d 439, 455 (3d Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Pruden\u2019s motion for counsel is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
