He argues that the district court plainly erred in sentencing him to eight years of supervised release because, at the Rule 11 hearing, the district court advised him that the maximum sentence to which he would be sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>jeet was a fine (of more than $1,000) and 80 years\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release. This contention was not raised below. He requests modification of the district court\u2019s judgment so that his term of supervised release is only three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Pursuant to section 860(a), Carlton was subject to a minimum term of eight years of supervised release; twice the four-year term mandated by section 841(b)(1)(B). 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860(a). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s statement at the Rule 11 hearing that Carlton faced a three year maximum term of supervised release was erroneous, but the district court\u2019s sentence of Carlton to an eight year term of supervised release was correct and within the statutory authorized limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Carlton does not challenge the validity of his guilty plea, but nevertheless argues that the district court\u2019s misinformation at rearraignment regarding his possible supervised release term is a basis for modifying his term of supervised release. Any error committed by the district court at rearraignment was not such as to meet the plain error standard of review because the aggregate of the Carlton\u2019s 188 month term of imprisonment combined with the eight years of supervised release and the three-year period of incarceration that could be imposed after revocation of his supervised release would not exceed the eighty-year maximum prison sentence of which Carlton was advised.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Reyes, </em>300 F.3d 555, 560-61 (5th Cir.2002) (holding that a district court\u2019s failure to explain the effect and operation of supervised release was not plain error when the aggregate of the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment, his term of supervised release, and any penalty for the revocation of his supervised release was less than his advised maximum term of incarceration); <em>United States v.
