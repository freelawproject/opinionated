Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1158 (internal quotation omitted). \u201cEven if the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner\u2019s findings, we must affirm if the decision reached is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1158-59 (internal quotation omitted). In addition, we may not make credibility determinations, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">A person who applies for Social Security disability benefits must prove her disability. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512. Disability is the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">We first address Lanier\u2019s argument that the ALJ improperly discounted the opinion of her treating physician, Dr. Robert Simmons, that because of Lanier\u2019s impairments, Lanier was \u201cunable to pursue a regular 8-hour per day job of any type\u201d and was \u201cimpaired/disabled from working.\u201d \u201cThe opinion of a treating physician ... must be given substantial or considerable weight unless good cause is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation omitted). Good cause exists under these circumstances: \u201c(1) [the] treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3)[the] treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1241. If an ALJ disregards the opinion of a treating physician, the ALJ must clearly articulate the reasons for doing so. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>In this case, the record shows good cause not to give Dr. Simmons\u2019s opinion substantial weight. The ALJ correctly noted that the opinion that Lanier was unable to work was reserved to the Commissioner. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e) (explaining that a physician\u2019s opinion that a claimant is \u201cdisabled\u201d or \u201cunable to work\u201d is not a medical opinion and that this opinion is reserved exclusively to the Commissioner). In addition, Dr. Simmons\u2019s opinion was eonclusory; he neither specifically explained how Lanier\u2019s impairments impacted on her ability to work nor provided objective medical evidence to support his findings. <em>See Edwards v. Sullivan, </em>937 F.2d 580, 583 (11th Cir.1991) (\u201cThe treating physician\u2019s report may be discounted when it is not accompanied by objective medical evidence or is wholly eonclusory.\u201d). Therefore, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s evaluation of Dr. Simmons\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">We next address Lanier\u2019s contention that the ALJ erred in making an adverse credibility determination about her claims of being affected by pain. Credibility determinations about subjective testimony are generally reserved to the ALJ. <em>See Johns v. Bowen, </em>821 F.2d 551, 557 (11th Cir.1987). But if the ALJ \u201cdecides not to credit such testimony, he must articulate explicit and adequate reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Holt v. Sullivan, </em>921 F.2d 1221, 1223 (11th Cir.1991). In addition, we have \u201cestablished a three part \u2018pain standard\u2019 that applies when a claimant attempts to establish disability through his or her own testimony of pain or other subjective symptoms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This standard requires these things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">(1) evidence of an underlying medical condition and either (2) objective medical evidence that confirms the severity of the alleged pain arising from the condition or (3) that the objectively determined medical condition is of such a severity that it can be reasonably expected to give rise to the alleged pain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\"><em>Id. </em>\u201c[A] claimant\u2019s subjective testimony supported by medical evidence that satisfies the standard is itself sufficient to support a finding of disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The ALJ may consider a claimant\u2019s daily activities when evaluating her complaints of pain. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination in this case. The ALJ provided specific reasons for discrediting Lanier\u2019s testimony about the severity of her pain. For instance, as the ALJ noted, the record shows that Lanier\u2019s pain treatment was intermittent and that she had no significant physical abnormalities. The ALJ also explained that Lanier\u2019s testimony about the amount of pain that she experienced was inconsistent with her description of her activities. Lanier explained that she performed household chores (such as doing laundry and vacuuming weekly), went fishing if someone else helped her to reel in the caught fish, drove short distances, did some cooking, engaged in online shopping, cut some parts of the flowers in her yard, and worked on redecorating her bedroom.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We see no reversible error in the ALJ\u2019s assessment of Lanier\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">We turn to Lanier\u2019s claim that the ALJ did not present an accurate hypothetical question to the vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d) who testified at Lanier\u2019s hearing. Lanier contends that the hypothetical question did not include all of Lanier\u2019s claimed impairments. For the ALJ to rely on a VE\u2019s testimony, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical that adequately describes all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>the claimant\u2019s impairments and accurately reflects the claimant\u2019s educational level, age, work skills, and experience. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1229 (11th Cir.1999). But the hypothetical need only include limitations supported by the record. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Here, the ALJ asked the VE to assume a hypothetical person with impairments that included a restriction to light and sedentary unskilled work in a low-stress environment where the person would not be required to sit for more than two hours at a time or to stand for more than one hour at a time. The hypothetical also asked the VE to consider tasks that required occasional to frequent use of a person\u2019s hands. The hypothetical question included all of Lanier\u2019s credible limitations; and Lanier\u2019s additional claimed impairments that were not supported by objective medical evidence did not need to be included in the hypothetical.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">AFFIRM\u00cdED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-10\">. Lanier claims that she is affected by many impairments, including fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, back and shoulder pain, and depression.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-11\">. In addition, our review is limited to issues raised before the district court. <em>See Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1161 (11th Cir.2004). Therefore, to the extent that Lanier raises claims on appeal that she did not raise before the district court, we decline to address these issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b338-6\">. Lanier also testified that no tasks existed that she was completely unable to perform.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
