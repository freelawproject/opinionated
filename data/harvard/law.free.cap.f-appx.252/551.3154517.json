On appeal, counsel has filed an <em>Anders</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>brief, stating there are no meritorious issues for appeal but suggesting that Dipasalegne\u2019s sentence is unreasonable. Dipasalegne was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal based upon the waiver-of-appellate-rights provision in the plea agreement. We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-20\">A defendant may waive the right to appeal if that waiver is knowing and intelligent. <em>United States v. Amaya-PoHillo, </em>423 F.3d 427, 430 (4th Cir.2005). Generally, if the district court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver of his right to appeal during the Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 colloquy, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991). The question of whether a defendant validly waived his right to appeal is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-21\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Dipasalegne knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his sentence. Moreover, the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>issue raised on appeal falls within the scope of the waiver. We therefore grant, in part, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Although the waiver provision in the plea agreement precludes our review of the sentence, we note that Dipasalegne was not asked whether he understood that he also was waiving the right to appeal his conviction. Thus, the waiver does not preclude our review of any error in Dipasalegne\u2019s conviction that may be revealed by our review pursuant to <em>Anders. </em>Our review of the transcript of the plea colloquy leads us to conclude that the magistrate judge and the district court fully complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Dipasalegne\u2019s guilty plea and ensured that Dipasalegne knowingly and voluntarily entered his plea, which was supported by an independent factual basis. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 119\u2014 20 (4th Cir.1991). Thus, we deny, in part, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues not covered by the waiver. We therefore affirm Dipasalegne\u2019s conviction and dismiss the appeal of his sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b576-15\"> <em>Anders v.
