We previously affirmed Norwood\u2019s conviction, affirmed the sentence in part, and remanded the case for resentencing. <em>United, States v. Nor-wood (Norwood I), </em>155 FedAppx. 784 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Norwood contends that the Government failed to prove his prior convictions to the extent required by federal law because the state-court records do not indicate that he was admonished about the consequences of his true pleas to enhancement paragraphs to the extent that those pleas could be deemed knowing and voluntary. Thus, he argues, his true pleas did not constitute admissions \u201centered pursuant to proceedings with substantial procedural safeguards of their own,\u201d <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 488, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that can be used for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Norwood did not raise this particular contention in the district court; the contention thus is reviewed under the plain error standard. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Chavez, </em>432 F.3d 334, 336 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-15\">Although Norwood challenges the validity of his <em>true </em>pleas, he does not contend that his <em>guilty </em>pleas were entered without adequate procedural safeguards. The indictments and judgments introduced in the district court \u2014 apart from the allegations in enhancement paragraphs \u2014 indicated that Norwood committed burglaries on October 14, 1980, January 19, 1983, July 30, 1988, February 16, 1986, and March 14, 1991. Those documents satisfy the requirements of <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-16\">In light of <em>Apprendi, </em>Norwood challenges the constitutionality of the treatment of prior convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. In the context of challenges to the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), this court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Aug. 28, 2007) (No. 07-6202).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-17\">Norwood contends that the district court should not have been permitted to consider the documentary evidence of his prior convictions at resentencing. He asserts, based on Supreme Court precedent in death penalty cases, that consideration of new evidence on remand violates the Double Jeopardy Clause. Norwood raises his contention for the first time on appeal; our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>review is for plain error. <em>See Gonzalez-Chavez, </em>432 F.3d at 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">When the record is insufficient to determine whether a defendant\u2019s previous convictions qualify him for sentencing under the ACCA, the case is remanded to the district court for supplementation of the record and resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 338. The Double Jeopardy Clause is inapplicable to non-capital sentencing proceedings. <em>See Monge v. California, </em>524 U.S. 721, 728,118 S.Ct. 2246, 141 L.Ed.2d 615 (1998). Nor-wood has failed to show error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Norwood contends that the district court erred by imposing his federal sentence to run consecutively to his Young County sentence because his post-revocation re-sentencing had not yet occurred before his initial federal sentencing. We need not consider Norwood\u2019s contention, as the issue of consecutive versus concurrent sentences was beyond the scope of our previous remand. <em>See United States v. McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d 454, 459 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>547 U.S. 1120, 126 S.Ct. 1931, 164 L.Ed.2d 679 (2006); <em>United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 321 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Norwood contends that the district court erred by denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea without an evidentiary hearing. He concedes that the issue is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Nor-wood I, </em>but he raises it to preserve it for further review. Norwood offers no argument on the issue other than to \u201cincorporate by reference his briefing on the issue undertaken in the prior appeal.\u201d Norwood may not incorporate his previous briefs. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). He thus has failed to brief his issue for appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Norwood\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See United States v. Salazar-Olivares, </em>179 F.3d 228, 230 (5th Cir.1999); 5th Cm. R. 42.2. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Noiwood\u2019s appeal is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. MOTION TO DISMISS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b648-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
