We review the district court\u2019s dismissal de novo. <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-19\">If his brief is liberally construed, Gricco renews his argument that his lawsuit is brought exclusively under the FTCA, as well as his claims that his criminal judgment is void, that he should be immediately released from prison, and that he is entitled to monetary damages. As the district court determined, Gricco\u2019s FTCA complaint fails as he did not seek to hold liable the United States, the proper defendant for such an action. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b); <em>Ato\u00f1e Air, Inc. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., </em>942 F.2d 954, 957 (5th Cir. 1991). Gricco has abandoned by failing to brief any challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that he has not sued the proper party. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, dismissal was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-22\">The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Gricco is cautioned that the dismissal by the district court of his suit and the dismissal of his appeal as frivolous count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Gricco is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Gricco\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-23\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b615-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
