Liu and his wife, Yuan Sun, who had been married in a traditional ceremony, were not legally married when Sun was subjected to a forcible abortion and sterilization. Sun was sterilized after Liu escaped sterilization by fighting and fleeing family planning authorities at the hospital. For the reasons that follow, we deny his petition for review and affirm the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-15\">On appeal, Liu argues that the BIA exceeded its scope of review by characterizing as \u201calleged,\u201d contrary to the IJ\u2019s findings: (1) Sun\u2019s coerced abortion; and (2) the \u201cbeating\u201d that Liu received at the hands of the family planning officials. Liu contends that the BIA\u2019s treatment of these events seriously undermined his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-16\">Liu\u2019s contention that the BIA exceeded its scope of review is meritless. The BIA\u2019s reasons for denying asylum as to the abortion claim were based on Liu\u2019s failure to be part of a legal marriage and did not depend on whether there had been an abortion, alleged or otherwise. Also, the IJ did not make specific findings regarding a beating, and Liu never testified that he was beaten.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-18\">Liu next argues that the fact that he was not legally married when the abortion and sterilization of his now legal wife occurred should not bar his asylum application because the BIA\u2019s determination that a legally recognized marriage during the relevant time period is required finds no support in precedent or the regulations. Liu asserts that, because the BIA\u2019s decision in the instant case is unpublished and, thus, not precedential rule-making, it is not entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number><em>Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Liu argues that his association and later legal marriage to his wife constituted a significant association, which could establish a well founded fear of future persecution, and the BIA\u2019s requirement of a legal marriage was contrary to this doctrine of imputed political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">\u201c[Rjeview of the BIA\u2019s interpretation [of a statute] is informed by the principle of deference articulated in <em>Chevron.\u201d Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1195 (11th Cir.2006) (citations omitted), <em>cert, denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 977, 166 L.Ed.2d 709 (2007). Under <em>Chevron, </em>there is a two-step process, looking to see, first, if congressional purpose is clear. <em>Id. </em>If Congressional intent on an issue is ambiguous or silent, \u201ca court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">In 1996, the definition of \u201crefugee\u201d was amended to include that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-8\">[A] person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion, and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). The statute itself is silent on the issue of a spouse\u2019s derivative asylum. <em>See id. </em>The BIA has determined that the ability of one spouse to claim refugee status, under \u00a7 1101(a)(42), based on the forcible abortion or sterilization of the other spouse is limited to those legally married. <em>In re SL-L-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1, 7 (BIA 2006) <em>(en banc). </em>We recently affirmed as reasonable the BIA\u2019s determination that legal marriage is required in order to extend derivative refugee status to a husband for his wife\u2019s forcible abortion. <em>See Yi Qiang Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>494 F.3d 1311, 1317-18 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">Because we conclude that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the asylum statute, denying derivative asylum to a partner not legally married at the time when his partner was subjected to a forcible abortion or sterilization, was reasonable, we defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-13\">Liu next argues that, since his marriage was legally registered in 2005, and he and Sun had been living as husband and wife since 1999, he was entitled to asylum protection due to his wife\u2019s past persecution, pursuant to the BIA\u2019s former decisions, which allow an applicant to establish asylum eligibility due to his/her spouse\u2019s forced sterilization. Liu recognizes that the BIA has limited this protection to married couples, but as he and his wife are now legally married, he claims that he has established the requisite nexus and level of harm for persecution, making him eligible for asylum. Liu also argues that he demonstrated \u201cother resistance\u201d to China\u2019s family planning policy by: (1) impregnating his wife; (2) having two children in secrecy and in violation of Chinese law; (3) escaping Chinese family planning officials who were planning on sterilizing him; and (4) going into hiding and refusing to pay fines imposed upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-14\">We \u201creview only the [BIA]\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>\u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To the extent that the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions are based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.8d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). Factual determinations, however, are reviewed under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d which requires us to \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the [IJ]\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">We have stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-6\">[A]sylum relief requires proof of two criteria. To establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that she was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground. To establish eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant must prove (1) a \u2018subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable\u2019 fear of persecution, that is (2) on account of a protected ground.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-7\"><em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). In Yang, we also held that, even assuming that the petitioner established, under the \u201cother resistance\u201d clause of \u00a7 1101(a)(42), that he (1) \u201chad an extremely close and committed relationship\u201d with his partner, and (2) physically resisted family planning officials at the hospital in an attempt to prevent his partner\u2019s forced abortion, he could not establish that he was persecuted, where he only had a physical altercation with family planning officials at the hospital, was subpoenaed by the local security office, and was sought by family planning officials and \u201cVillage Cadres,\u201d who tried and were still seeking to arrest him. <em>Yang, </em>494 F.3d at 1319. We held that, where the petitioner suffered no prolonged detention or physical violence, we were not compelled to conclude that the petitioner suffered past persecution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">The record does not compel reversal of the BIA\u2019s determination that Liu had not suffered independent past persecution based on his resistance to family planning policies, because we conclude that a brief altercation with family planning officials and going into hiding to avoid arrest are not sufficient to establish persecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">Liu next argues that he established a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his resistance to family-planning laws. He contends that his wife\u2019s sterilization does not negate the possibility of future persecution, and the presumption of future persecution established by his wife\u2019s sterilization has not been rebutted. Additionally, he asserts that an outstanding fine creates a fear of future persecution because, as long as the fine remains unpaid, he and his wife will live in fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">Asylum status can be established based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, by proving that there is \u201c(1) a \u2018subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable\u2019 fear of persecution, that is (2) on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1236 (citation omitted). We have held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>It is \u201cwell-established\u201d that the well-founded fear inquiry contains both an objective and subjective component, i.e., the petitioner must be genuinely afraid and that fear must be objectively reasonable. As we have noted, \u201cpersecution\u201d is an \u201cextreme concept,\u201d requiring more than \u201ca few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u201d or \u201cmere harassment.\u201d Furthermore, it is the petitioner\u2019s burden to present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-4\"><em>Huang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>429 F.3d 1002, 1009 (11th Cir.2005) (citations and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Because Liu was not able to demonstrate that the Chinese government still would be interested in arresting him three years after he left China, we conclude that he has not established a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Finally, Liu argues that, because the BIA has never required that marriages have to exist during all relevant time periods of the resistance to family planning, it should have granted his motion to remand to prove the current validity of his marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">Because the motion to remand requested additional proceedings to present new evidence regarding Liu\u2019s eligibility for relief, it was in the nature of a motion to reopen. <em>See Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1301. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion, and \u201cthe BIA\u2019s discretion is quite broad.\u201d <em>Gbaya v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>342 F.3d 1219, 1220 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">The marriage certificate' did not add any new material information, as it only proved that he was currently legally married, not that he was married at the relevant time. Thus, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">For the above-stated reasons, we conclude that the BIA properly dismissed the appeal and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-8\">. Liu also argues for the first time on appeal that: (1) his wife\u2019s forced abortion and sterilization resulted in his emotional trauma and psychological persecution; (2) he was persecuted by the government\u2019s imposition of fines, which he was unable to pay; and (3) the government effectively deprived him of his livelihood, as he was forced into hiding. However, we lack jurisdiction to review these claims, as they were not exhausted below. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
