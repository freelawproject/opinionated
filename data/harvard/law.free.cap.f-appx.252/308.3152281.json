Henry asserts the district court erred in holding that: (1) the Board could not be liable for the alleged discriminatory actions that took place while a court-appointed receiver was in place to oversee the Board\u2019s operations; (2) the Board had \u201cvicarious immunity\u201d for the receiver\u2019s actions because the receiver was entitled to judicial immunity; and (3) she had not presented sufficient evidence of age discrimination to survive summary judgment. After review, we affirm for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned Memorandum Opinion of February 23, 2007, 519 F.Supp.2d 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
