Sutterley alleges that, while cutting frozen hamburger meat, some meat shavings became lodged under the meat he was cutting, causing the meat to spin. The meat apparently hit the saw blade, causing it to kick back. The blade severed two of Sutterley\u2019s fingers at the joint.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-23\">The district court dismissed Sutterley\u2019s complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity and qualified immunity grounds. Sutterley argues that the defendants are not immune from suit because they were negligent in their duties and because they subjected him to unnecessary, wanton infliction of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-24\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, \u201ctaking the allegations of the complaint to be true.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A Rule 12(b)(6) motion may only be granted \u201cif it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-25\">This court engages in a two pronged analysis to determine whether a government official is entitled to qualified immunity. The first prong asks \u201cwhether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of a constitutional right and, if so, [second] whether the defendant\u2019s behavior was objectively reasonable under clearly established law at the time the conduct occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-26\">\u201cIn order to show that his medical care violated the Eighth Amendment, [an inmate] must allege that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> With regard to Dr. Murray, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Sutterley has, at most, asserted allegations of unsuccessful treatment, negligence, medical malpractice, or a difference of opinion as to treatment, none of which gives rise to a constitutional violation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because Sutterley failed to allege a violation of a constitutional right, Dr. Murray is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Sutterley\u2019s brief does not argue that the district court erred by ruling that the Eleventh Amendment barred his \u00a7 1983 claims against the defendants in them official capacity. Nor does Sutterley address the district court\u2019s ruling that Hobart was not liable under \u00a7 1983 as a private party. Although this court construes a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s brief liberally, we \u201calso require that arguments must be briefed to be preserved.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly these issues are abandoned.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Similarly, Sutterley abandoned his claims against Captain Morris, although it is a closer question. Sutterley\u2019s brief fails to mention Captain Morris or to discuss directly the district court\u2019s ruling. Rather, Sutterley merely recites the allegations that Captain Moms violated his constitutional rights by providing \u201cinadequate\u201d training on the use of the saw that cut him. He does not, however, explain how the district court\u2019s analysis erred. He does not foot his objection on the district court\u2019s legal construction of his claim, and the bald allegation that there are sufficient facts to survive a 12(b)(6) motion without, at a minimum, identifying what alleged facts contradict the district court\u2019s conclusion is insufficient to satisfy Rule 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">Finally, to the extent that Sutterley\u2019s allegations concerning other unnamed prison employees\u2019 mishandling of his severed digit are an attempt to raise claims against additional defendants, we do not consider them because they were not raised below.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b696-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
