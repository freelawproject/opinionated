For the first time on appeal, Frias argues that the district court committed error by enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his prior Texas conviction for aggravated robbery. Our review is limited to plain error. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Chavez, </em>432 F.3d 334, 336 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-22\">Under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), a defendant\u2019s base offense level is increased by 16 levels if he was previously deported after a conviction of a crime of violence. Robbery is an enumerated crime of violence in the application notes to \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). Frias has not shown plain error in the increase of his offense level based on his prior aggravated robbery conviction. <em>See United States v. Santiestebartr-Hemandez, </em>469 F.3d 376, 378, 381 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b606-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
