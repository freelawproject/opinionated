Basically the facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s testimony was as follows: Plaintiff-landlord sued to recover increases of rent covering each month for a period commencing September 1, 1956 to July 1, 1957 at the rate of $11.44 per month, including the original rent for July 1957 in the sum of $57.20; the latter sum was sent to the landlord by the tenant but the landlord refused to deposit the check therefor and still retains the same. Although this suit is to recover $183.04, the actual amount in dispute is $125.84 \u2014 the difference between the full amount of $183.04 and the retained check amount of $57.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Plaintiff-corporation rented the apartment to defendant in or about December 1954 on a monthly basis for the maximum rental sum of $57.20 recurring on the first of each month. On July 31, 1956 plaintiff\u2019s agent served defendant with a copy of a notice of termination of tenancy .effective September 1, 1956 by sliding it under the defendant\u2019s apartment door. On August 27, 1956 the agent similarly served defendant with a letter stating in part that plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of amounts less than the new rental amount would not be a waiver. Thereafter, defendant continued to pay her rent by checks to the plaintiff\u2019s superintendent at the rate of $57.20 for 11 months until June, 1957. On June 25, 1957 plaintiff mailed to defendant a demand for payment of the total amount due and in July 1957 defendant sent to plaintiff the above-mentioned check which the landlord refused to accept as payment and still retains the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Defendant testified that she found the first letter notice under her apartment door on July 31, 1956; she also found under her door the second letter notice on August 27, 1956; she continued to pay her usual rent to plaintiff\u2019s superintendent each month thereafter; in July 1957 she offered her check for the July rent to the superintendent which was refused, and she thereupon mailed her check to plaintiff with a letter stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>\u201cI have contacted the Bent Bureau at City Hall, Jersey City, N. J.; and have been so informed, according to the New Jersey State Bent Law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\">(1) A tenant must be given thirty (30) days notice for a rent increase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">(2) No retroactive monies allowed according to this law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">Please be advised I am in accordance with this law, and therefore my new rental will take effect as of August 1, 1957.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The trial court found for defendant, holding the first notice, referred to by plaintiff as a notice of termination of tenancy, did not constitute a proper notice to quit; and further, that by accepting the rental payments in the original amount from defendant, plaintiff had waived its right to recover retroactively the increases in rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The letter by which the plaintiff-landlord sought to terminate defendant\u2019s month to month tenancy is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">\u201cDear Tenant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">This is to advise you that your Monthly Tenancy is hereby terminated as of September 1st, 1956.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">You may renew your monthly tenancy by paying the new rental of $68.64 per month on the 1st day of September, 1956 and each month thereafter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">The primary question raised by this appeal is whether this notice was sufficient (a) to terminate defendant\u2019s then existing month to month tenancy, and (b) to establish the prerequisite to the creation of a new month to month tenancy at a higher rental. The corollary question is whether the form of the notice is fatally defective for purpose (b) above because it lacks a demand that defendant quit and deliver up possession of the premises to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">A \u201cnotice to quit\u201d is required in order to terminate a tenancy when the tenancy is at will, or from month to month or year to year. <em>N. J. S. 2A</em>:18-56; <em>Steffens v. Earl, </em>40 <em>N. J. L. </em>128 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1878); <em>Dector v. Phelps, </em>136 <em>N. J. L. </em>53, 56 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1947); <em>Hertzberg v. Siegel, </em>8 <em>N. J. Super. </em>226, 229 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950); <em>Skyline Gardens, Inc., v. McGarry, </em>22 <em>N. J. Super. </em>193, 195-196 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952); 18 <em>N. J. Practice, </em>\u00a7 1538, <em>p. </em>106. We emphasize the distinctions between the aforesaid \u201cnotice to quit\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>N. J. S. 2A</em>:18-56 and the procedural requirement of a \u201cdemand * * * for delivery of possession\u201d which is a statutory prerequisite for the institution of a summary action for possession under <em>N. J. S. 2A</em>:18-53.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">\u201cThe demand for possession must be distinguished from <em>the notice to quit </em>which <em>has for its purpose the termination of the tenancy. </em>The purpose of the demand for possession is to give the tenant the opportunity to remove voluntarily when his term has expired. <em>It is a condition precedent to the institution of the action. </em>It must be served where the tenancy expires by its own terms and no notice to quit is required. It must also be served in cases in which a notice to quit is required to terminate the tenancy. In the last mentioned type of case, the demand for possession may be included in the notice to quit, or it may be separately served.\u201d 18 <em>N. J. Practice, District and Municipal Courts, </em>\u00a7 1541, <em>p. </em>111. (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-7\"> This is not a dispossess action. We are therefore concerned only with the sufficiency of the \u201cnotice to quit.\u201d The \u201cnotice to quit\u201d ought to apprise the tenant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">(1) That the relationship of landlord and tenant exists between the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">(2) That the premises are to be vacated and possession thereof delivered to the landlord by a certain day;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">(3) That the tenant\u2019s right to possession will expire on that day;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">(4) And the reason for termination permitting eviction under the statutory provisions, where applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-12\"><em>Dector v. Phelps, </em>136 <em>N. J. L. </em>53, 55 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1947); 18 <em>N. J. Practice, supra, </em>\u00a7 1538, <em>p. </em>109. However, we hold that a notice to quit to be effective to terminate a tenancy need only state that the tenancy is terminated as of a certain date. A notice to quit and a demand for delivery of possession are severable and a demand for delivery of possession is not required in order to terminate a tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">The case of <em>Skyline Gardens, Inc., v. McGarry (supra, 22 N. J. Super. </em>193) turned upon this very question. Therein, the notice to quit neglected to recite a termination of the tenancy and in that regard was held to be fatally defective since the <em>Housing and Rent Act of </em>1947, 50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number><em>U. S. C. A. Appendix, </em>\u00a7 1881 <em>et seq. </em>was not capable, in itself, of creating a new contract between the parties. We said (22 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at <em>page </em>197) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">\u201c* \u00bb $ The notice in question was not a \u2018notice to quit,\u2019 and it is well established that a month-to-month tenant has the right to continue in possession indefinitely in the absence of a notice to quit which is a prerequisite to the termination of the tenancy <em>so as to create a new tenancy at an increased rental.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">But here the termination of the prior tenancy agreement was expressly stated and a new monthly tenancy at increased rental was proffered to defendant as in the <em>Hertzberg </em>case, <em>supra. </em>There, this court said (8 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at <em>page </em>230):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">\u201c* * * The relationship of landlord and tenant is contractual and may be express or implied. Here there is no express contract but an <em>implied contract arose out of the voluntary holding over </em>in the face of the notices to quit and of increased rent.\u201d (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">We can find no distinction in the facts of the present case and the <em>Hertzberg </em>case. In the case at bar a judgment should also have been rendered in favor of the plaintiff-landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Defendant also contends that plaintiff waived its right to the increased rent by reason of the fact that plaintiff accepted the lower amount for a period of 11 months. The trial court cited as authority <em>Adler v. Logio, </em>208 <em>N. Y. S. </em>462 <em>(Sup. Ct. App. Term </em>1925). The entire opinion is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">\u201cPer Curiam. Although the landlord gave notice of an increase of the monthly rent beginning January 1, 1925, the action, based oh that notice was to recover rent for the month of April. As it appears that rent for. the prior months had been paid, and receipt of the rent at the old rate for such prior months rendered the notice inoperative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-12\">\u201cJudgment reversed, with $30 costs, and complaint dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">However, a vital factual difference is present in the case before us. Unlike the <em>Adler </em>case plaintiff here expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>went on record by letter dated August <em>21, </em>1956 that plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of the rent would not operate as a waiver of plaintiff\u2019s right to collect the differences. This letter notice to defendant clearly expressed the fact that plaintiff was not relinquishing its rights to the increased rentals. Since this prerequisite ingredient of a waiver is lacking, we find no basis for the trial court\u2019s finding. <em>R. R. </em>1:5-4(b); <em>2 Walsh, Commentaries on the Law of Real Properly </em>(1947), \u00a7 192, <em>p. </em>350; 56 <em>Am. Jur., Waiver, </em>\u00a7 150, <em>p. </em>115.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">Eeversed. Judgment is directed to be entered in favor of plaintiff. No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
