J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AKo\">Defendants Vojaeek and Eischer, owners and operators of a used car business known as Ladd\u2019s Auto Sales, were indicted, together with certain of their salesmen, for conspiring to obtain money and other things of value by false pretenses, in violation of N. <em>J. S. 2A</em>:98-l and 2. The charge was that they knowingly, fraudulently and falsely represented to customers that certain motor vehicles offered for sale were leftover new cars which had not been sold after the latest models had become available, when, in fact, the motor vehicles were used cars. The overt acts set out in the indictment described an advertising program in newspapers, on television and on radio wherein Ladd\u2019s Auto Sales announced that it had \u201cleftover\u201d cars for sale. Three of the overt acts referred to specific transactions in which Walters and Monaco, two salesmen, and Eischer, respectively falsely represented to purchasers that certain used cars were new cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Vojaeek and Eischer were convicted, as were Walters and Monaco, but only the former appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Evidence supporting the conviction came through the testimony of a number of purchasers who stated that many cars were represented to them as new by Vojaeek and Eischer and by their salesmen, when in fact they were used automobiles. The conviction was additionally amply supported by evidence of newspaper, television and radio advertisements of \u201cleftover\u201d automobiles, so worded as to lead the public to believe that all of the cars mentioned were leftovers, whereas many if not most of them were actually used cars. The State established through purchasers that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>they relied upon, the language of these advertisements as meaning new cars left over from a previous year, and not used cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Defendants denied misrepresentation, and Yojaeek testified that in the trade \u201cleftovers\u201d could refer to new or used cars of prior years\u2019 models \u2014 they were simply surplus merchandise. However, Yojaeek was confronted with contradictory testimony he had given before the grand jury to the effect that a car with a mileage reading of more than about 1,000 miles would be considered a used car and not a \u201cleftover.\u201d There was also defense testimony that each time \u201cleftover\u201d cars of prior years were advertised, there was a new car or cars on Ladd\u2019s Auto Sales premises matching the description in the advertisements.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Among the stipulations entered into before trial were: (1) in the conditional sales contracts signed by customers the space provided for the word \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cused\u201d was always left blank, and (2) each car referred to by the State\u2019s witnesses was actually a used car, and known to be such by each of the defendants at the time the car was sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">On this appeal defendants Yojaeek and Eischer do not argue that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence. This is understandable in light of the fact that the record supports the conviction in fullest measure. Rather, their major ground of appeal is that the trial court erred in refusing to permit testimony which, defendants claim, would have enabled them to demonstrate that their profit on each of the sales said to have been fraudulently induced was not greater than a normal or fair profit, and that the price they received for the cars not in excess of their market value as used cars. Defendants argue that evidence of the cost of the cars to them and the prices at which they sold them to their customers, as well as the actual fair value of the cars in the condition they were at the time of the sale, and the fair value of the cars had they in fact been new leftover models, shorrld have been admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>to show lack of motive for a conspiracy to obtain money by false pretenses. The rationale of this argument is that if the jury knew that defendants did not obtain an unfair price for the ears in their actual condition, it would have been less likely to convict them of the misrepresentation charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The State argues in its brief, and the record tends to support its contention, that the trial judge did permit defendants to show their cost on each car sold, as well as the sales price, thus revealing the amount of their profit. What the court refused to permit was evidence of the fair market value of each car, first, in its actual condition as of the date of the sale and, second, the hypothetical value had the car been (as represented) a new leftover as of that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\"> The general rule in criminal prosecutions is that whenever the motive or intent of the accused is important and material, \u201c[a]ll evidentiary circumstances which are relevant to or tend to shed light on the motive or intent of the defendant or which tend fairly to explain Ms actions are admissible in evidence against Mm <em>* </em>* Defendant can then, in turn, offer rebutting proof tending to negative motive. <em>State v. Rogers, </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>218, 228-229 (1955); 22 <em>C. J. S. Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 614, <em>p. </em>934 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">It should first be noted that neither defendants\u2019 cost nor selling price, nor book value, was part of the indictment or, indeed, part of the State\u2019s case. It was defense counsel who introduced selling price on his cross-examination of the State\u2019s first witness, and then brought in dealer\u2019s cost and market or book value during Ms direct examination of defendant Vojacek. Evidence of cost was admitted whenever ac\u00fcially offered by defendants, but then defense counsel sought to bring in the third element of value, namely, book value of the cars involved, by reference to the \u201cBlue Book\u201d published for dealers. Dpon objection by the State this testimony was excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">The jury was then excused so that defense counsel could make his offer of proof as to book value. In the ensuing very extended colloquy defense counsel argued in support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the admission of testimony as to value based on a \u201crecognized standard of price\u201d \u2014 the trade periodical \u2014 to show that the price paid for each car by the purchaser was lower than that to which defendants were entitled under the standard used in the trade. The trial judge ruled that such testimony would be excluded, and stated the question to be: \u201cDid these defendants conspire to sell these cars by representing that they were new or unregistered cars ?\u201d \u2014 adding \u201cI do not concede that it is any part of the proof under this indictment that the cars were sold at a small margin of profit or at cost or at a large margin of profit.\u201d He observed that the mere fact that testimony was permitted as to the selling price of the cars \u2014 defendants having every right to meet that testimony \u2014 \u201cdoes not open the collateral angle to obliquely meet that in the fashion suggested by offering testimony that these people got a good buy or that they didn\u2019t pay any more for the car than if they had been told it was a used car, or that they didn\u2019t pay any more for the car than for any other used car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">When defense counsel urged that he had a right to offer the value of the ears to rebut any inference of motive, the court noted that margin of profit was not the only consideration; that it was entirely consistent with the indictment for the State to take the position that the motive was increased volume of sales, at whatever profit \u2014 in other words, that even if defendants sold their cars at a normal profit for the condition and kind of car sold, their purpose was to sell more cars at that profit than they normally would have, by representing them to be new leftovers. The court indicated that it would charge on this point, and it eventually did when it instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">\u201cNow let me clear up one point that has arisen. Perhaps this will be as good a time as any to clear it up. It has been pointed out, and it is true, that the State offered no evidence before you that the purchasers paid more for the cars than they were actually worth. The State\u2019s contention is not that the defendants conspired to get the purchasers to pay more for the car than they otherwise would. The State\u2019s contention under this indictment is that the defendants conspired t;o induce purchasers to buy cars, at whatever price they paid, by falsely representing the ears to be new cars. The testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>of prices paid for the cars was not received in this case to show that the purchasers had been overcharged, but simply to show that the purchase in each individual case had been completed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Technically, it perhaps would not have been improper for the trial court to admit the evidence of the \u201cBlue Book\u201d value of the ears, because defendants\u2019 realization of only such profit on each sale as they might normally be expected to make on the sale of a used car would tend to refute in some degree the charge that they represented the cars to be new. However, theoretically relevant testimony may always be curtailed or even disallowed where the combination of its degree of remoteness, together with the extent of the collateral issues which would bo introduced, would delay the trial and tend to confuse the issues. Such was the basic reason given by the trial judge for excluding the proffered testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Relevance, as Justice Jacobs remarked in his article on <em>\u201cThe Uniform Rules of Evidence,\u2019\u2019 </em>10 <em>Rutgers L. Rev., </em>485, 492, is expressed in terms of logic rather than legal precedent. And Judge Clapp observed in <em>Miller v. Trans Oil Co., </em>33 <em>N. J. Super. </em>53, 59-60 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954), affirmed 18 <em>N. J. </em>407 (1955), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">\u201cA trial judge in his discretion may exclude evidence if he finds its probative usefulness is substantially outweighed by the risk that it will lead to either * * * undue consumption of time [or] confusion of issues * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">* * * [A] trial judge\u2019s decision on the exercise of this discretion is not reversible, unless it appears manifest that he has made a mistake * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">* * Our inquiry under the principle stated must be whether in admitting the testimony, there was a risk of unjust prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s case which substantially outweighed the probative usefulness of the testimony; and, further, whether the trial judge, who is entrusted with a discretion in the making of such a determination, committed manifest error. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">In the present case it is easy to see liow complex and ramified the collateral issues might become if defendants were permitted to introduce their proofs on market value. In the case of each sale to a complaining customer (there were some 40 witnesses who testified to about 25 individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>sales of used automobiles, represented by one or more of the defendants to be new cars), there would have arisen two valuation issues: (1) the market value of the car \u201cas is\u201d as of the time of sale, and (2) the market value of a car of the same description but assumed to be a new leftover. On objection to this bind of testimony the trial judge actually essayed a trial series of questions and answers with defendant Vojacek, in the absence of the jury, to see just where it all would lead. It quickly became apparent to him, as it is to us, that the widest variety of estimates might come into the ease on the question of market value under either of the two stated heads. The State might then have been justified in adducing rebutting proof through its own expert witnesses, to refute the valuation estimates given by defendants and their witnesses. The whole trial would probably have degenerated into a confusing series of #5 valuation cases, with two aspects of each. The basic issue of fraudulent representation would have been completely lost in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The trial judge was correct in his exercise of discretion as to this matter. The basic issue was whether defendants had conspired to obtain money from the general public by false pretenses, in fraudulently representing used cars to be leftover new cars. Defendants are in error when they argue that if the State showed no motive to charge an exorbitant price, there would be no motive established for the conspiracy charged. They ignore the existence of a motive, obvious and basic to every business \u2014 to develop a volume of transactions with a possible net profit on each.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Defendant\u2019s next argument is projected under the general heading that the trial court incorrectly charged the jury with respect to the meaning of the word \u201cleftovers.\u201d We see no merit in this contention. In essence the court charged that if defendants had reason to believe that the public, as a result of the use of the word \u201cleftovers\u201d in their advertisements, would be led to purchase a particular automobile under the impression that it was a new car which had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>remained unsold when the latest models appeared, defendants could be found guilty of the charge even though, in the trade, the term \u201cleftovers\u201d might be understood to signify either new cars or used cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Breaking defendants\u2019 portmanteau claim of error in the charge down into its several parts, we find nothing to sustain the contentions and suggestions made. The argument that the court in effect told the jury that the interpretation placed by the public on the word \u201cleftovers\u201d was binding on defendants \u201cregardless of what construction the defendants intended the public to place on it,\u201d is contradicted by the charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">\u201c* * * What did the word \u2018leftovers,' placed and used as it was in Ladds\u2019 advertisements, mean to the readers or the listeners or the viewers who were not \u2018in the trade\u2019? Did it mean to them new cars which had not been sold by new car dealers? If you find it did, then you should ask yourselves: Did the defendants know it would mean that to those not in the trade? If they did, if the defendants did know that, then the <em>meaning </em>of the words in the trade, even if there was one, would be immaterial. The defendants would have to be judged by the meaning placed on the word by the purchasers if the defendants expected and intended that the purchasers should get that interpretation of the word.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The further suggestion that the court\u2019s charge might be understood by the jury as an instruction \u201cto consider something \u2018said\u2019 by the State as evidence\u201d finds no support in the record, for the court distinctly told the jury that it was its obligation \u201cto decide the case in accordance with the facts as yon find them, not as the Court or the prosecutor or counsel for the defendants interpret or recollect them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Defendants\u2019 brief lays some stress on the fact that at least one of the advertisements in evidence referred to \u201cleftovers\u201d as being both new and used cars. That advertisement stands alone among a large number of newspaper advertisements and television and radio commercials. In all probability it was accidental; certainly it was never repeated. The typical advertisement refers to \u201cleftovers\u201d o\u00a3 one year, and then mentions a \u201clarge selection\u201d of cars from the previous year.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Defendants\u2019 statement that there was no evidence to support the State\u2019s contention as to the meaning of the word \u201cleftovers\u201d intended by defendants, completely ignores all the advertising and all the testimony relating to each of the 25 sales. The record exhibits an abundance of evidence, direct as well as circumstantial, demonstrating that defendants, particularly in the course of actually selling cars to the several complaining witnesses, consistently used the word \u201cleftovers\u201d to mean new cars available after the latest models had appeared and never previously sold to an ultimate consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Finally, defendants claim that whenever an advertisement appeared there were new cars for sale on their lot. Not only is this no defense to the charge leveled against them, but the inferences which arise from that statement would seem to point to guilt. If there were new cars on the lot to satisfy the representation made in the \u201cleftovers\u201d advertisements, and this is offered as proof that the advertisements were true, it seems reasonably clear that defendants were aware that customers would understand the word \u201cleftovers\u201d to mean \u201cnew.\u201d The alleged presence of a new car or ears on defendants\u2019 lot whenever an advertisement appeared would seem to amount to little more than a protective coloration, a cover, for their fraudulent activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">As a third point, plaintiffs complain of the court\u2019s refusal to charge two of their requests. Both refer to the word \u201cleftovers.\u201d We find that the court adequately and correctly dealt with that subject in its charge. Parties are not entitled to have the jury instructed in the precise-language of their requests, as long as the subject matter is correctly and fully covered in the charge, as it was here. <em>State v. </em>Rogers, above, 19 <em>N. </em>J., at <em>page </em>238; <em>State v. </em>Tansimore, 3 <em>N. J. </em>516, 526 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">We have read the charge as a whole and find no error or prejudice to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
