BURRELL, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">R.J.W. (\u201cMother\u201d) and A.W. (\u201cFather\u201d) (collectively, \u201cParents\u201d) are attempting to appeal disposition judgments entered in May 2015 by the Juvenile Division of the Circuit Court (\u201cthe trial court\u201d) that rested on the trial court\u2019s .assumption of jurisdiction over Parents\u2019 children (\u201cChildren\u201d) under section 211.031.1(1) (\u201cjurisdiction orders\u201d) and placed Children into the legal and physical custody of the Children\u2019s Division (\u201cthe Division\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jurisdiction orders' were entered after combined adjudication hearings, and we have consolidated the resulting appeals for all purposes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Parents\u2019 two points on appeal contend: (1) the trial court\u2019s finding that Parents \u201cabused or neglected Z.M.W_ was against the weight of the evidence\u201d; and (2) the trial court failed to make the findings required to assume jurisdiction over Children and remove them from their home. Because the trial court subsequently dismissed the cases in which the jurisdiction orders were entered and terminated its jurisdiction over Children, we dismiss Parents\u2019 appeals as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">Evidentiary and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">The evidence presented at the consolidated adjudication hearing, as viewed in the light most favorable to the jurisdiction orders, <em>see In re N.J.B., </em>327 S.W.3d 533, 537 (Mo.App.S.D.2010), was as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">On February 24, 2015, Z.M.W. was about nine weeks old. R.J.W. took the infant to the doctor because she \u201chad fussed\u201d earlier in the day when her arm was moved. A pediatric orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Jeremy David Onnen, examined Z.M.W. that day and saw from \u201ca radio-graphic skeletal survey\u201d that her \u201cright forearm had a mid-shaft radius fracture[.]\u201d The skeletal survey also showed multiple rib fractures that had healed. The doctor \u201cdid not see on the skeletal survey any thin diaphyseal bones indicating any brittle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>bone type diseases.\u201d Another pediatrie orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Elizabeth Engel, examined Z.M.W. in March 2015 and opined that Z.M.W.\u2019s injuries \u201cwere secondary to nonaccidental trauma.\u201d A pediatric radiologist, Dr. Shannon Farmakis, had reviewed materials in the case, and she' observed that Z.MW.\u2019s \u201cbone mineralization was completely normal.\u201d She opined that \u201cthe most likely cause- of these fractures would be nonaccidental trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">A.W. testified that \u201cduring the weeks leading up to [Z.M.W.\u2019s] injuries[,]\u201d no one other than himself, R.J.W., and the other Children had access to Z.M.W. When an investigator for the Division, Tina Clancey, first spoke'with Parents, they indicated \u201cthat they just didn\u2019t know what happened.\u201d R.J.W. had seen a video<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of an interview of Z.E.L.C. in which Z.E.L.C. \u201csaid that [A.W.] hurt the baby\u2019s arm on purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Three days after the discovery of Z.M.W.\u2019s injuries, Respondent filed petitions asking the trial court to assume jurisdiction over Children based on Z.MW.\u2019s injuries and the danger the actions that led to those injuries posed to Z.MW.\u2019s siblings. The petitions alleged that Z.M.W. had been \u201creleased from the hospital with a diagnosis of injury as the result of child abuse.\u201d Paragraph 5 of each petition further alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-6\">Investigation by law enforcement is ongoing but there is evidence tending to indicate that some or' all of the injuries may have been caused by [A.W.] and that [R.J.W.] was aware of the actions of [A.W.] and that [Z.M.W.] was in pain but failed to protect the infant or seek prompt medical treatment. There is no evidence to indicate the injuries occurred other than when [Z.M.W.] was in the physical custody of [Parents],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">At the conclusion of the April 2015 adjudication hearing, which involved the testimony of 13 witnesses, including a medical expert witness who testified on behalf of Parents, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-10\">The clear and convincing evidence in this case leads me to believe that [Z.M.W.] did suffer from abuse and ... it happened while [Z.M.W.] was in [Parents\u2019] care. I have to consider the credibility of the evidence, and the credibility takes me there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-11\">Therefore, I\u2019m finding that the allegations in the petition[s] are true by clear and convincing evidence and that [Children] come within the provisions of the juvenile code and under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">The trial court thereafter entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law \u201cthat the allegations contained in paragraph 5 of the pleadings are true[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">The trial court granted Parents\u2019 counsel\u2019s request for \u201ctime to prepare for\u201d the disposition hearing and continued that portion of the hearing to May 2015. At the disposition hearing, the trial court overruled Parents\u2019 motion to reopen the adjudication portion of the cases, and when asked whether it would \u201cbe willing to reconsider that after the visit to [another medical expert]?\u201d the trial court stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know. It all depends on what the report is.\u201d The jurisdiction orders were entered two days after this hearing, and Parents timely filed them notices of appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>section 211.261.1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Before we address the merits of Parents\u2019 appeals, we must first consider whether they are now moot. <em>In Interest of J.T.S., </em>462 S.W.3d 475, 477 (Mo.App.W.D.2015). \u201cAn appellate court is not permitted to review moot claims of error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although we may look outside the record in order to consider mootness, <em>id. </em>at 478, Parents and Respondent agree in .their briefs that the trial court has terminated its jurisdiction over Children. Based on that agreement, we consider that status as if it appears in the record. <em>See Rogers v. Hester ex rel. Mills, </em>334 S.W.3d 528, 541 (Mo.App.S.D.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">After Parents filed their brief in April 2016, Respondent filed a \u201cMOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL\u201d (\u201cthe dismissal motion\u201d) that included the five appellate case numbers but was styled \u201cIN THE INTEREST OF Z.E.L.C.\u201d and did not otherwise reference any other children. The dismissal motion stated that the trial court had terminated its jurisdiction in November 2015 and had \u201cplacefd] <em>the juvenile </em>back in the custody of [Parents] after a trial home placement which began in August of 2015.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The dismissal motion incorporated exhibits, each entitled \u201cMotion and Order for Termination of Jurisdiction[,]\u201d over Children.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Parents filed suggestions in opposition to .the dismissal motion \u201cdenying] that the appeal is mooted by the termination of jurisdiction\u201d and the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">In response to Parents\u2019 second point on appeal, Respondent contends, among other things, that Parents\u2019 challenge to the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s findings \u201cshould be denied as being moot.\u201d Respondent states that \u201c[t]o remand these .cases at this time will accomplish nothing as' a practical manner as ultimately the final disposition in these cases has been in [Parents\u2019] favor as [Children] have been returned to [Parents] and the cases closed.\u201d Respondent\u2019s appendix'includes five motions with orders terminating the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over Children;</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">In their reply brief, Parents state: \u201cWhile it is true that [Children] have been returned to their -home and the trial court terminated jurisdiction oyer them, this Court should review this matter as an exception to the mootness doctrine, should it find this appeal moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Parents claim a mootness doctrine exception is appropriate because the trial \u201c[c]ourt\u2019s utmost compliance with the statutes in assuming jurisdiction over and removing children from their parents is a matter of utmost public policy, is likely to evade appellate review if the Court does not exercise its review, and will recur.\u201d \u201cHowever, a desire for personal vindication does not rise to the level of a general public interest[,]\u201d <em>J.T.S., </em>462 S.W.3d at 480, and Parents do not demonstrate that the points they present frame significant recurring public policy concerns'likely to evade review.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">Point 1 claims the trial court\u2019s -findings are against the weight of the evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>Such a claim is not sufficient to establish a public interest exception to the general prohibition against reviewing moot claims. <em>C.f. In re J.L.R., </em>257 S.W.3d 163, 166 (Mo.App.W.D.2008) (a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate an issue of general public interest and importance that would otherwise evade appellate review). Regarding Point 2,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Parents argue in their reply brief that this point could permit this court to \u201clogically find that [Parents] were deprived of due process\u201d due to alleged procedural deficiencies in an affidavit by Ms. Clancy that Parents claim as the \u201conly \u2018findings\u2019 \u201d by the trial court. Parents then assert that \u201cthey were not granted due process because there was no family preservation screening conducted by [the] Division pursuant to \u00a7 211.180[.]\u201d Because neither of these claims are contained in Point 2, they are not preserved for appeal. <em>Chipperfield v. Mo. Air Conservation Comm\u2019n, </em>229 S.W.3d 226, 237 (Mo.App.S.D.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Parents also argue that \u201cthere are collateral consequences and ongoing injury to [Parents]\u201d that merit an exception to a dismissal for mootness. Parents describe these harms as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-5\">including the right to participate in the educational and extracurricular activities of their six [sic] children because of being marked as \u2018child abusers\u2019 and lost career opportunities with the U.S. Army for [A.W.; moreover,] those lost career opportunities, including being denied promotions and possibly being discharged, will affect the entire family in incalculable ways, including but not limited to them income and housing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">Parents provide us with no support for their alleged harms, and other such \u201cbare assertions about speculative future consequences\u201d have been rejected.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>J.T.S., </em>462 S.W.3d at 480-81 (citing <em>J.L.R., </em>257 S.W.3d at 166).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">Parents have failed to convince us that an exception to the mootness doctrine is applicable. The consolidated appeals are dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b850-11\">JEFFREY W. BATES, P.J.\u2014 CONCURS</judges>\n<judges id=\"b850-12\">MARY W.

Although Parents' jurisdictional statement fails to identify what authority permits juvenile jurisdiction orders to be appealed, this Court has appellate jurisdiction based on section 211.261. <em>In Interest of L.W., </em>830 S.W.2d 885, 886 (Mo.App.S.D.1992).
