William Case died leaving a daughter, Jennie B. Rice, and the said Hiram S. Case as his sole heirs. The daughter conveyed her interest in the land to her brother, who went into possession, and conveyed the land to Norman C. Green, who succeeded to such possession. After the death of his father, Adelbert Case conveyed his life-estate under the lease from his grandfather to the plaintiffs, who had secured a quitclaim deed from Rebecca Case, and who, during the lifetime of Adelbert Case, brought ejectment to obtain possession of said land from said Norman C. Green and another, who defended on the ground that the lease to Adelbert Case was invalid because the absolute power of alienation was suspended for a longer period than during the continuance of two lives in being at the creation of the estate; and in passing upon said claim the Court hold:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b574-7\">a \u2014 The estate of Adelbert Case was an expectant estate, and was created when the grant was delivered to Hiram S. and Rebecca Case, at which time the instrument became operative.

By giving a life-estate to Adelbert the title to the land was complicated by reason of a <em>third </em>life-estate in Adelbert, and this was clearly in violation of the statute; citing <em>Coster v.

Case, a son, and Jennie B. Rice, a daughter. On March 7, 1862, Jennie B. Rice executed a deed of said premises, without covenants of warranty, to Hiram S. Case. Hiram S. Case and Rebecca Case, his wife, went into the possession of said premises, and after the death of William Case, and on December 15, 1862, conveyed said premises by warranty deed to Norman C. Green, who immediately went into the possession of the same. Hiram S. Case died April 24, 1882, and Rebecca, his wife, died May 1, 1887. On May 4, 1883, Adelbert E. Case and Sarah J., his wife, granted to Marion Case and Esther Case the remainder, which, by said instrument, was given to him after the death of Hiram and Rebecca Case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These grantees have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>brought this action in ejectment to obtain possession of the premises under their conveyance from Adelbert, who is still living.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The record presents but a single question, and that is whether the remainder over to Adelbert E. Case is valid. The defendants insist that the instrument is invalid because, as they claim, the absolute power of alienation is suspended for a longer period than during the continuance of .two lives in being at the creation of the estate. How. Stat. \u00a7 5531. The estate of Adelbert Case was, under our statutes, an expectant estate, and was created when the grant was delivered to Hiram S. and Rebecca Case. The instrument became operative at that time. Id. \u00a7 5557. Adelbert\u2019s estate was a future estate, being dependent upon the precedent estate of Hiram S. and Rebecca. It was what is termed a <em>\u201c </em>remainder,\u201d and might be transferred by that name. Id. \u00a7 5527. Adelbert being alive, and having the immediate right to the possession of the lands upon the ceasing of the intermediate or precedent estate, it was a vested estate in him at the time of its creation. Id. \u00a7 5529., Being a vested expectant estate in Adelbert, it was descendible, devisable, and alienable in the same manner as estates in possession. Id. \u00a7 5551.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">It follows that William Case, the owner of the fee or legal title, Hiram S. and Rebecca, the owners of the life-estate in possession, and Adelbert, the owner of the remainder, could by\u2019 uniting in a deed, or by separate deeds, convey an absolute fee in possession. Hpon William\u2019s death, the same persons, with Jennie Rice, could have done so. After Jennie conveyed to Hiram S., he and Adelbert could have done so. Hence there has been no time but what there were persons in being by whom an absolute fee in possession could be conveyed, and consequently the instrument is not a restraint upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>absolute power of alienation, or prohibited by How. Stat, \u00a7\u00a7 5530, 5531. As no expectant estate can be defeated or barred by any alienation or other act of the owner of the intermediate or precedent estate, nor by any destruction of such precedent estate by disseisin, forfeiture, surrender, merger, or otherwise, there is no reason why the present suit may not be maintained. Id. \u00a7 5548.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">The jury found that Green had notice of this lease, and the right of entry did not accrue until the death of Rebecca; so that there is no statute of limitation to bar a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b579-6\">Sherwood, C.
