In a machine for manufacturing steel wool, a table, cutting tools arranged adjacent thereto, means to guide a plurality of parallel strands formed from a single wire adjacent said tools over said table, said means consisting of sheaves over which the strands are looped at either end of said table, and means for driving said sheaves to move said wires independently of the pull of the wire thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-25\">\u201c2. In a machine for manufacturing steel wool, a table, cutting tools arranged adjacent thereto, means to guide a plurality of parallel strands formed from a single wire in engagement with said tools over said table, and means to drive said guiding means so that each loop of wire will be independently driven by said guiding means whereby the driving strands will he applied to each loop'independently against the resistance of the tools engaging the strand of wire of that loop.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-26\">The counts were claims 17 and 57 of the Robbins patent, No. 1,584,145, issued May 11,1926 (application filed October 14,1924). Steinbart\u2019s application was filed on November 27, 1923. After the issuance of Robbins\u2019 patent, Steinbart copied the two claims at issue for the purpose of interference. Robbins\u2019 preliminary statement alleged conception in January, 1921, the embodiment of the invention in a full-sized machine on the I2th day of May, 1924, and successful operation of said machine in June&gt; 1924. Stein-hart\u2019s preliminary statement alleged conception and drawings January, 1922, and \u201cthat he first embodied his present invention in a full sized machine which was completed on or about the first day of October, 1924,\u201d which was successfully operated on about said last named date. It will be noticed that Stein-bart claimed a date for actual reduction to practice later than his constructive date which was the date of filing the application on November 27, 1923. After seeing the filing date of Robbins, Steinbart moved to amend bis preliminary statement and sought to change his date for the first actual reduction to practice from October 1, 1924, to April 30, 1924, which motion was deified by the Examiner of Interferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-27\">Robbins moved to. dissolve the interference for the reason that the counts could not be read upon the machine shown and described in Steinbart\u2019s application and for the further reason that Stednbart\u2019s application showed and described an inoperative device and one lacking utility. -The Law Examiner sustained the motion to dissolve upon the ground that Steinbart\u2019s machine was inoperative. Steinbart appealed to the Board of Appeals, which reversed the Law Examiner\u2019s decision. The board held that the machine as disclosed was prima facie operative and stated that, \u201cIt is believed the interference should be continued in order to give the parties oppor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>tunity, if they so desire, to present testimony on the question of operativeness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In deciding the interference issue, the Examiner of Interferences accepted the mling of the Board of Appeals as to Steinbart\u2019s right to make the counts as conclusive, since the now testimony taken did not warrant a different conclusion. Ho held as follows: \u201cNo ruling is made as to whether a knife resiliency pressed against the wires would be \u2018operable in the patent sense but even if such .knife would be inoperable the skill of the art would have supplied an operable knife moulding and the resulting mechanism would have satisfied the counts of this interference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">He reviewed the evidence of both parties affecting their early conceptions and rejected all evidence of both parties as proving an earlier date of conception than the date of. the filing of the Steinbart application, holding that Steinbart\u2019s application was a conception and reduction to practice of the counts in interference, and priority of invention of the counts was awarded to Steinbart.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Upon appeal to the Board of Appeals, it held, as did the Examiner of: Interferences and the Law Examiner, that the counts read upon Steinbart\u2019s disclosure, and said: \u201cAppellant contends as one of the allegations of error that the counts do not properly read upon Steinbart\u2019s disclosure. It is bis view that the inclusion of the term \u2018independently\u2019 in the counts limits the counts to a machine in which <em>some </em>other <em>means </em>for advancing the wire is present other than the power sheaves. The counts were copied from Robbins\u2019 patent and were doubtless drawn in view <em>of </em>the disclosure where the' additional winding reels are present. It is our view, however, that sines the counts do not specifically include an additional means they should not be construed as limited to an apparatus in which such means is necessarily present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Upon the question of imperativeness of the Steinbart machine, the board said: \u201cTaking up first the question of imperativeness it is our opinion that the machine as disclosed in the Steinbart application is not a practical construction. The most serious difficulty as shown by the evidence relates to the mounting of the knives. The counts, however, are not specific as to this feature and since it was old in steel wool machines to employ knives in a similar way we do not consider that it would require the exercise of invention to substitute other knife mountings old in the art or modify those disclosed in the Steinbart application in such a way that a practical knife action would result. As previously stated the particular subject matter of the issue relates to the feeding of the wire and we ane satisfied there is no patentable relationship here between the feed and the knife mounting. We have also considered the improper showing of the gears and the other matters dealing with the alleged improper feeding of the wire but we consider that those matter's also can bo readily corrected and adjusted by those skilled in the art without requiting the exercise of invention. It is our view, therefore, that the Steinbart application contains an operative disclosure of the subject matter of the counts of the issue and the fact that many of the details shown were discarded, particularly with relation to the support for the knives, we do not regard as material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">It also concluded that the testimony relating to Robbins\u2019 conception earlier than the filing date of Steinbart was not satisfactory and gave him no conception date earlier than Steinbart\u2019s application. It also rejected the Steinbart proof as establishing an earlier dato of conception than his filing date. Having held that Steinbart could make the counts and that his device was operable as far as the issue of the involved counts was concerned, and having held that Steinbart was the first to conceive and reduce to practice the issues of the counts, it affirmed the action of the Examiner of Interferences in awarding priority to Steinbart. From this decision Robbins appeals here.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">If our consideration of the sufficiency of Robbins\u2019 evidence to establish a conception by him earlier than Steinbart\u2019s filing date were an initial question with us, it is possible that we might have arrived at a conclusion differing from those of the two concurring tribunals below; but we are not convinced that they are manifestly wrong, and under the well-known rule, we are constrained to concur in, the holding of the board in this particular. Leonard v. Everett, 52 App. D. <em>C. </em>90, 281 F. 594; Oldroyd v. Morgan, 58 App. D. C. 78, 24 F.(2d) 1004. We also concur in the holding of the board as to the effect of the evidence produced for the purpose of showing a conception date of Steinbart earlier than his filing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">In view of our above conclusions, the issues narrow down to the following propositions :</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">First. Do the counts in issue read upon the disclosure of Steinbart in his application of November 27, 1923?</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">Second. Should the Steinbart application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>be regarded as a concexotion and reduction to practice <em>of </em>the subject-matter of the counts?</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The record and briefs are long and voluminous and contain more charges and evidence of false swearing and bitter .controversy, than is involved in any appeal that has come to our attention. We do not regard it as necessary, in our decision of the issues presented, to indulge in extended comment on the many different phases of the ease which have occupied the attention, in some instances at length, of tire tribunals below.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">On the first proposition as to whether the counts read uxoon Steinbart\u2019s disclosure, we agree with all the tribunals below, that have passed on the question, that the claims, as drawn, read directly upon Steinbart\u2019s application. When the counts are read in connection with Robbins\u2019 structure, a meaning can be given to them which probably was not in the mind of Steinbart, but the claims are \u2022couched in such language as to read directly ux&gt;on Steinbart\u2019s disclosure and there are no limitations which restrict them to. the disclosure of Robbins. On this phase of the case the Law Examiner aptly said: \u201cThe reason given by the party Robbins in support of his motion to dissolve on the ground that the party Steinbart can not make count 1 is that the count specifies means for pulling on the wire indejiendently of the movement given to the wire by the power driven sheaves, but recitation of said means is not found in the count. The last element of the count \u2018means for driving said sheaves\u2019 is followed by the statement \u2018to move said wires independently of the pull of the wire thereon.\u2019 This statement does not directly or inferentially import an element into the count corresponding to \u2018means to pull the wire,\u2019 but clearly states that the pull of a wire does not drive the sheaves. The cutting effect of the knives as opposed to the movement of the wire by the sheaves would result in. a pull on the wire, but the means for driving the sheaves is not dependent on the last mentioned \u2018pull.\u2019 It is clear that the Steinbart sheaves are driven by the motor 49 and are not moved by the pull of the wire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Substantially the same reasons for arriving at the same conclusion as that arrived at by the Law Examiner are found in the decision of the Examiner of Interferences and the Board of Appeals, and we \"agree with such conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">It may be suggested that the counts at bar must be given the construction contended for by axapellant in order to sustain the validity of the two involved claims of appellant\u2019s \u2022patent, and that to give them the construction contended for by appellee would render them invalid by reason of the prior art. As far as we know this question was not considered by the tribunals below, and it certainly has not been sufficiently briefed nor discussed here to justify our consideration of -it.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">In Deibel v. Heise <em>&amp; </em>Schumacher, 46 F.(2d) 579, 571, 18 C. C, P. A. 907, this court used the following language, which we regard as apt in the present controversy: \u201c * * * The counts of the interference should be given the broadest interpretation which they will reasonably support, and this court is not justified in reading limitations into them for the purpose of changing the plain import of their terms. Had appellant desired to limit his claims to a particular kind or type of kraft paper, he might have done so. However, having deliberately elected to claim the invention broadly, he is not in a position to insist that limitations be read into his claims (the counts in issue) for the purpose of avoiding the issue of priority. \u2022\u00bb * * <em>V</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">The second proposition involves matters more controverted and more troublesome than those involved in the first proposition. Robbins points out a number of reasons why he regards the Steinbart machine as inoperative. In Steinbart\u2019s structure both drums turn in opposite directions, which would either prevent any operation or movement of the machine or would bring about a total destruction of the wire worked upon. Appellant contends that the cutting knives are wholly inoperative inasmuch as they sire spring pressed, which permits chattering and the consequential destruction of the wire. It is unnecessary for us to enumerate or to discuss here other serious defects affecting the machine\u2019s operation which defects are pointed out in axopellant\u2019s brief. Appellant contends that everything disclosed in Steinbart\u2019s application was abandoned except the legs; that new devices were supplied in most instances; that the whole machine was at one time abandoned; and that no successful operating machine was' ever produced until 1925&gt; and when so produced was in no sense in accordance with the disclosure of the Steinbart application.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">With much of this contention we agree. It seems obvious that the knives would not function as intended; that the drums would not rotate properly; and that the machine had other serious defects which rendered it, as the board held, an impracticable construction. The gist of the decision .of the board, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>on this phase of the ease, however, rests in its conclusion that the parte of the Steinbart machine which rendered its operation im-praetieahio were such features as could bo supplied from the prior art by a mechanic, or be supplied by a mechanic, without the necessity of inventivo skill. At this point appellant vigorously and with much persuasiveness urges, in substance, that an applicant cannot claim a constructive reduction to practice from an application disclosure of an inoperative machine which, with the exception of the legs, must be discarded before a successful machine can be constructed; that the structure speaks for itself in this respect; and that appellee\u2019s preliminary statement and his attempt to amend the same, together with his apparent abandonment of tho original structure and final construction of an almost wholly differently operating machine, show conclusively that Steihbart\u2019s application was not a reduction to practice of the subject-matter of tho counts at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">We are fully cognizant of the unusual situation which the facts in this case present, hut nevertheless we must agree with tho holdings of the tribunals below to the effect 1hat if it did not require invention to substitute elements of the prior art for the elements responsible for the inoperativeness, the machine could not be held to bo inoperative as far as the Issue in the counts involved is concerned. For instance, let us suppose that <em>the </em>only feature claimed to he inoperative in the Stciribni't device was the fact that the two drums run in opposite directions. No one has contended, and it cannot be contended logically, that it requires inventive genius to make them both, run in the same direction and thus operate in accordance with the issues presented by tho counts at bar. Under such circumstances it would be Improper to hold that the structure by reason of such defect was not a reduction to practice of the issues. Cariying tliis thought further, if all the other elements contributing to tho inop-erativeness could be supplied without inventive genius, it seems obvious that the same result would he arrived at. True enough, it is possible to visualizo a situation where, owing to many defects, such an impracticable and unworkable contraption might be proposed as to amount to no disclosure at all, and where those skilled in tho art, seeking to follow the teachings of the applicant, would find nothing to work upon in trying' to evolve from tho applicant\u2019s teachings a successful commercial machine. Appellant in one phase of its argument seeks to present this supposed state of facte as a true picture of conditions at bar. When all the facts and their relation to the particular issues at bar are considered, such a viewpoint is not justifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">On the question of curing defects by resorting to the prior art or mechanical skill, the Patent Office and the appellee have cited us no authority. The appellant, however, contends that the law does \u201cnot permit reconstruction of a machine to make it operative,\u201d and cites Weisbrod v. Sisson, 46 App. D. C. 311, and Bliss v. Brooklyn, 10 Blatchf. 521, Fed. Cas. No. 1546, aiul suggests that tho doctrine in those cases applies, since appellee would have to abandon his \u201cold flexible knife mounting and movement, which was the essence of his invention.\u201d Regardless of what value wo might give such a doctrine in, a proper ease, it has not been made plain to us that the knife mounting is tho essence of tho invention. It is, as heretofore stated, no part of tho invention of tho involved claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Tho rule applicable to the question at bar is well laid down in Computing Scale Co. v. Standard Computing Scale Co. (C. C. A.) 195 F. 508, 511, in which the following language was used: \u201cThe primary question is: To what extent must a device, built as shown in the drawings and specifications, he operative in order to- support a conclusion that the conceived invention has been completely made? This question was quite fully considered by this court in an opinion by Judge (now Mr. Justice) Lurton in Standard Cartridge Company v. Peters Cartridge Company, 77 F. 630, 23 C. C. A. 367. He quotes from [Webster] Loom Co. v. Higgins, 106 U. S. 586, 26 L. Ed. 1177, tbo illustration of an invention in some appurtenance of the steam engine which may be completely sho&gt;wn without describing <em>other parts of </em>the engine. Ho lays down the rules, also, as fully as contended for by the patentee here, that a completed invention is not negatived because tho drawings are rude or imperfect, or because they are incomprehensible to one unacquainted with that class of machinery, or because they do not in all respects show the relation of tho novel features to the old device nor describe precisely the <em>mode of </em>attachment <em>nor </em>with scientific exactness show other details of the combination. He concludes that the controlling question is whether- \u2018the absent features are such as would be readily supplied by a mechanic familiar with the subject and without requiring further invention\u2019 (77 F. 647, 23 C. C. A. 383); and whether the mechanical questions left unsolved by the drawings were of such dignity as to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>quire invention to carry into effect the idea indicated by the drawings (77 F. 652, 23 C. C. A. 388); and whether \u2018that which remained imperfect in the sketches was remediable by the exercise of the technical knowledge of mechanics familiar with the construction and operation of the old machines\u2019 (77 F. 655, 23 C. C. A. 391). It is true Judge Lurton was considering a question really of conception, but he was adopting and applying the rule appropriate to questions of completion or reduction to practice.\u201d See, also, Howell v. Hess, 122 O. G. 2393, 1906 C. D. 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">We think that the features of the Stein-hart device responsible for its alleged inop-erativeness could have been corrected without the exercise of inventive skill.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The decision of the Board of Appeals, awarding priority of invention to the party Steinbart in the subject-matter of the counts at issue, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
