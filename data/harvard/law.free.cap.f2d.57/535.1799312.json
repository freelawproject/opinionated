The plaintiffs testimony disclosed that she desired to alight at Quincy Street; she pushed the buzzer in ample time for the driver to stop; she started down the aisle to the door; the driver failed to stop; he asked her if she wanted off; she said yes; he opened the door, brought the bus to such a quick stop it jerked her and threw her out of the door. The driver\u2019s version was entirely different, <em>but </em>such differences are for the jury. The petition alleged negligence in failing to stop on signal; in opening the door while the bus was in motion; and in the sudden and violent stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-25\">Two errors are assigned:</p>\n<p id=\"b559-26\"> First, that a verdict should have been directed for the defendants. The contention is that it is physically impossible for one s1 finding in the aisle of a bus to be thrown out of a door in the side of the bus; that a sudden stop, or a jerk, propels forward or backward, but never sideways; that the verdict therefore rests upon evidence that cannot possibly bo true. The contention assumes that the force of the jerk was exerted in a perfectly straight line coincident with the aisle of the bus; that there was no sway in the bus; that the plaintiff was.perfectly balanced, and made no move to avert the fall. There is no ground for such assumptions. The accident might have happened in a number of ways; the plaintiff testified she was holding to one of the upright rods in the bus; if she was holding by her right hand, a sudden stop would cause her to pivot on that hand and she would be ejected through the open door; or the bus may have swerved, or struck a bump, and a side-thrust have been thus imparted to the jerk. It is entirely impossible to say as a matter of law that the sudden stop of a moving vehicle must project the victim in a straight line. It is said she was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. This contention is predicated upon the assumption that the jury believed the witnesses of defendants, which assumption is clearly wrong. Counsel must he aware that a jury\u2019s finding on conflicting evidence will not bo disturbed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-27\">Second, it is contended that the court should have charged the jury that the defendants were not liable for injuries resulting from jerks and jars usually incident ta the operation of a bus. There was no occasion for such a charge. If plaintiff\u2019s testimony was believed, the injuries resulted from an unusual and violent jerk incident to a sudden stop. If defendants\u2019 evidence was true, the plaintiff stepped off the bus before it had come to a complete stoy). The trial court charged the jury that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>could not recover unless she had established the negligence alleged in her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The case presents a sharp conflict in the evidence, but that is all; the jury\u2019s verdict has settled the matter for all time; there is no error in the record, and no occasion for this appeal. The judgment is affirmed and the Clerk directed to issue the mandate forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
