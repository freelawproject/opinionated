The defendant then introduced evidence in its own behalf, and did not repeat its motion for a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence. Defendant then requested and was granted an instruction to the jury on the question of contributory negligence. \u201cWhereupon,\u201d the record discloses, \u201cthe court charged the jury generally as to the law of the case, to which charge no objections or exceptions were taken or noted by either the plaintiff or the defendant ; nor were any objections made or exceptions noted to the admission or rejection of any testimony whatsoever during the trial. <em>* \u25a0\u00bb tf</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-25\">It now is contended (1) that the court should have directed a verdict for the defendant, and (2) that the court erred in refusing to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-26\">By introducing evidence in its own behalf and failing to move for a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence, defendant acquiesced in the submission of the ease to the jury and cannot now be heard to complain.

Ed. 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-27\"> The ruling of the court on the motion for a new trial is not subject to review on appeal unless it clearly appears that there has been an abuse of discretion, which the record in this ease fails to disclose.
