The policy provided the premiums should he paid \u201con or before each and every Monday during the continuance of this contract,\u201d and should he void \u201cwhen in arrears more than four Mondays.\u201d The single question presented is as to the construction of the provision last quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-23\">Insured died Tuesday, August 5. All premiums due had been paid up to Monday July 14. A payment was due on that day, but was not made. At the time of his death, fhero were due payments on July .14, 21, 28, and August 4, all of these days being Mondays.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-24\">Appellant insists that the policy had not lapsed because the provision of the policy \u201cin arrears more than four Mondays\u201d should be read \u201cmore Mondays than four Mondays,\u201d but no authority is cited to support this contention, and we are not impressed with it. Substantially the contrary was held in Baus-erman v. Blunt, 147 U. S. 647, 660, 13 S. Ct. 466, 472, 37 L. Ed. 316, where the expression \u201cfor more than five years\u201d was held to mean live years and one day.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-25\">We think, however, the lapse of the policy may be avoided on another ground. To have lapsed, it must have been four Mondays in arrears. To be in arrears, it must be \u201cpast due.\u201d The due date of the premium, as we have seen, was July 14. Insured had all of that day in which to pay the premium, and he was not in arrears until that day had passed, so that it was not until Tuesday July 15 that he was in arrears. In this view, the previous Monday cannot ho counted as a Monday in arrears, and, since the death of insured occurred prior to the fourth Monday following, it would seem to us to follow that the policy was in effect at the time of his death. To hold otherwise would require us to say that the term \u201cwhen In arrears more than four Mondays\u201d meant in arrears more than four payments, and this would require that we construe the policy more favorably to the insurer than to the insured, and this would violate a primary rule of construction in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-26\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
