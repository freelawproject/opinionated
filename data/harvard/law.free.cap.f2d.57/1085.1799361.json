Proceedings are now pending to have the alleged bankrupt declared to be a bankrupt. Pending that proceeding, and in view of the omission of the appellants to inform the court as to the nature of their claim, so as to enable it to now determine whether the alleged claim should be passed on by the court itself or whether the trustee, in ease the alleged bankrupt is so adjudged, should proceed by plenary action, this restraining orden was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-35\">Wo find no error in the court making such cautionary order to enable it to keep control over the property meanwhile. We accordingly dismiss the present appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
