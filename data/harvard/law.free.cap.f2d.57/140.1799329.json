Upon arraignment he waived the reading of the indictment, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced by the court. Later he moved to set aside the judgment and sentence upon the ground that the indictment did not charge an offense. The motion was overruled, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">The indietment charges that appellant unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly attempted to bring into and land in the United States an alien \u2018\"not being then and there lawfully entitled to enter and reside within the United States \u201d The statute makes it an offense for any person to attempt \u201cto bring into or land in the United States * <em>* </em>any alien not duly admitted by an immigrant inspector or not lawfully entitled to enter or to reside within the United States.\u201d Appellant contends that the only purpose of the statute is to prevent the bringing into or landing in this country of an alien so as to avoid inspection and examination, and hence it was necessary that the indictment allege that appellant attempted to bring into or land in the United States an alien \u201cnot duly admitted by an immigrant inspector.\u201d Wo do not think the statute is to be so narrowly construed. Its purpose, it seems to us, is to make effective the inhibitions of the immigration. laws against the admission off aliens. <em>It is </em>thus <em>made an offense to bring into or </em>land in this country an alien \u201cnot lawfully entitled to enter.\u201d See, in this connection, Middleton v. United States (C. C. A.) 32 F.(2d) 239. To commit this offense, the landing or bringing in must be completed\u2014 there must be an entry. It is also an offense to attempt toi bring into- or land in the country an alien \u201cnot lawfully entitled to enter.\u201d The gravamen of this offense is an attempt without success, the alien not being landed or brought in. In the first offense there must be a bringing in or landing of the alien. Whether, in charging the offense in an indietment, it is necessary to allege that the alien was \u201cnot duly admitted by an immigrant inspector,\u201d we need not decide. Certainly it is not required whore the allegation charging the offense \u2014 an attempt without success \u2014 neg-atives the possibility of inspection. Ill such ease the indictment is sufficient if it alleges the act forbidden by the statute, that is, an unlawful attempt to bring\u201d into or land in the United States an alien \u201cnot lawfully entitled to enter.\u201d McFarland v. United States, 19 F.(2d) 805, 806 (6 C. C. A.), does not hold otherwise. What does or does not amount to such an attempt depends, of course, on the character of the act. We are not here concerned with that question, but only with the averments of the indictment, which are sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
