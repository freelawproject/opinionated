Moreover, there is a split of authority among the courts of appeals regarding how such jurisdiction over \u00a7 10 and \u00a7 11 motions is to be determined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We conclude that the better reasoned approach for determining subject-matter jurisdiction over \u00a7 10 and \u00a7 11 motions is to look to the nature of the underlying claim in dispute, just as is done with respect to \u00a7 4 petitions to compel arbitration.

After AOL complied with the Police Department's request, Alvin Moore, the subscriber for that address, complained to AOL that it had violated its privacy policy, as well as Title II of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (known as the Stored Communications Act),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , by providing information about him without a warrant, a subpoena, or his consent.

In his motion, Moore alleged that the arbitrator was \"completely biased\" against him, improperly excluded evidence, prejudged his claim, and committed various other errors.

The Court reasoned that \"when the parties' underlying dispute arises under federal law, the 'look through' approach permits a \u00a7 4 petitioner to ask a federal court to compel arbitration without first taking the formal step of initiating ... a federal-question suit - that is, without seeking federal adjudication of the very questions it wants to arbitrate rather than litigate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 65,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653799\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/49/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Other courts, however, have reasoned that the difference in language is not dispositive and have held that the \"look through\" approach should apply to \u00a7\u00a7 9-11 motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ortiz-Espinosa v.

This conclusion takes the FAA as establishing a comprehensive procedural alternative to litigation such that if a district court would have jurisdiction to litigate the dispute, it would likewise have jurisdiction to compel and supervise arbitration of the dispute. Not only does our holding take the FAA as an integrated whole, rather than a collection of independent mechanisms, it also gives effect to the FAA's purpose of favoring arbitration over litigation when arbitration has been agreed to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The FAA makes \u00a7 4 a procedural gate to arbitration, directing courts to compel arbitration if agreed to in writing, and it prescribes the basis of jurisdiction over a \u00a7 4 petition, instructing that jurisdiction over such a petition follow the jurisdictional basis for litigating the underlying dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vaden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653799\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/49/\">\n    556 U.S. at 62-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653799\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/49/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, when the underlying dispute can be litigated in federal court, the federal court has jurisdiction over the \u00a7 4 petition to compel arbitration. It follows that if the federal court has jurisdiction to compel the arbitration, it also has jurisdiction to compel the attendance of witnesses at the arbitration under \u00a7 7, despite the lack of any \"save for\" language in that section. And the same conclusion can be reached for jurisdiction over motions to review arbitration awards under \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11. There is no indication that Congress intended to allow a\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   court to compel arbitration under \u00a7 4 on the basis that the underlying claim arose under federal law and then to require the parties to go to\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   court to review the arbitration's procedures or to enforce its awards. Indeed, subscribing to such a reading would suggest that \u00a7 4 expands federal jurisdiction, a proposition that has been rejected by the Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vaden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653799\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/49/\">\n    556 U.S. at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653799\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/49/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 79,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653799\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/49/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Roberts, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The FAA as a whole creates a procedural mechanism that provides an alternative to litigation, and \u00a7 4, as\n   <em>\n    Vaden\n   </em>\n   held, indicates that petitions to compel arbitration may be resolved in the same court that could adjudicate the case in the absence of an arbitration agreement. In our view, it would be surplusage to include in each section of the FAA language specifying jurisdiction over each motion filed subsequent to a \u00a7 4 petition. And indeed, the Supreme Court has suggested as such, noting that \"where the court has authority under the [FAA] ... to make an order for arbitration, the court also has authority to confirm the award or to set it aside for irregularity, fraud, ultra vires, or other defect.\"\n   <em>\n    Marine Transit Corp. v. Dreyfus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5719092\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/284/263/#p275\">\n    284 U.S. 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 275-76,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5719092\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/284/263/#p275\">\n    52 S.Ct. 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5719092\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/284/263/#p275\">\n    76 L.Ed. 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1932). In other words, the court that has jurisdiction to compel arbitration under \u00a7 4 also has jurisdiction to supervise the arbitration's procedures and to confirm, vacate, modify, and enforce the resulting arbitration award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This \"look through\" approach should apply to \u00a7 10 and \u00a7 11 motions regardless of whether a \u00a7 4 petition has first been filed. To require the parties to take the formal step of going to court to compel arbitration on penalty of losing the benefit of \u00a7 4 's otherwise applicable provision of jurisdiction would make no sense and would undermine the benefit of arbitration as a more efficient process for the resolution of disputes. The language of \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11 does not require the unnecessary procedural step of first obtaining a \u00a7 4 order, and the absence of such an order does not change the nature of a \u00a7 10 or \u00a7 11 motion or otherwise affect the parties' claims in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Thus, while\n   <em>\n    Vaden\n   </em>\n   held only that jurisdiction over \u00a7 4 petitions to compel arbitration is governed by the jurisdictional rules applicable to the underlying dispute and did not address the precise issue before us, we conclude that jurisdiction over motions under \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11 should likewise be governed by the jurisdictional rules applicable to the underlying dispute. While it is true that \u00a7 4 petitions and other FAA motions are part of a process that is contract-based, they function as a comprehensive procedural mechanism, working together to provide an alternative reticulated process to litigation. And as an alternative process, the FAA is appropriately applied by the same courts that otherwise would have jurisdiction over litigation of the underlying dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Indeed, we can think of nothing to suggest that the questions raised in a typical \u00a7 4 petition are more appropriate for a federal forum than those raised in a typical \u00a7 10 or \u00a7 11 motion. When considering \u00a7 4 petitions to compel arbitration, courts primarily resolve issues of state contract law such as whether the arbitration provision covers the relevant dispute or whether the contract itself is valid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vaden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653799\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/49/\">\n    556 U.S. at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653799\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/49/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, motions under \u00a7 10 or \u00a7 11 raise issues of state contract law, such as the scope of the arbitrator's authority. While some courts have reasoned that the FAA's policy of enforcing valid agreements to arbitrate suggests that the federal interest in compelling arbitration under \u00a7 4 is greater than the federal interest in confirming, vacating, or modifying awards under \u00a7\u00a7 9-11,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goldman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351131\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/242/#p252\">\n    834 F.3d at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we do not agree. The issues addressed by \u00a7 4 and \u00a7\u00a7 9 - 11 are completely intertwined in carrying out Congress's decision to provide a set of federal rules governing the arbitration process. Privileging \u00a7 4 petitions over \u00a7 10 and \u00a7 11 motions for jurisdictional purposes thus reflects too narrow a\n   view of the FAA's comprehensive role with respect to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, our holding has the added virtue of applying a uniform jurisdictional approach to the FAA as an integrated whole. In this vein, the Supreme Court has rejected interpretations of the FAA that result in \"needless tension\" between the Act's pre-award and post-award provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cortez Byrd Chips, Inc. v.

Applying the \"look through\" approach to \u00a7 4 but not to \u00a7 10 or \u00a7 11 would create just such a tension by subjecting the Act's pre-award and post-award remedies to different jurisdictional inquiries, potentially by different courts, during different stages of the same arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Indeed, were the \"look through\" approach not applied uniformly, \"curious practical consequences\" would result, similar to those identified in\n   <em>\n    Vaden\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vaden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653799\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/49/\">\n    556 U.S. at 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653799\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/49/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Particularly, if we were not to \"look through\" \u00a7 10 or \u00a7 11 motions when the underlying dispute arises under federal law, we would in effect be requiring parties to go through the superfluous step of first filing a \u00a7 4 petition in the district court simply to secure jurisdiction over later motions filed under \u00a7 10 or \u00a7 11.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marine Transit Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5719092\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/284/263/#p275\">\n    284 U.S. at 275-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5719092\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/284/263/#p275\">\n    52 S.Ct. 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under this artificial construct, parties would file \u00a7 4 petitions even if they agreed to the propriety of arbitration. Moreover, if we refused to \"look through\" a \u00a7 10 or \u00a7 11 motion, we would similarly be encouraging plaintiffs to file first a federal question lawsuit and a \u00a7 3 motion to stay that lawsuit pending arbitration, which again are unnecessary procedural steps when the parties agreed to the propriety of arbitration. The formal step of initiating a federal-question lawsuit in order to secure the benefit of a \"look through\" approach for \u00a7 10 or \u00a7 11 motions would undermine the efficiency sought to be achieved by the FAA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vaden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653799\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/49/\">\n    556 U.S. at 64-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653799\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/49/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Doscher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055359\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/372/#p381\">\n    832 F.3d at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing how a refusal to look through \u00a7 10 motions would \"encourage[ ] the protective filing of federal suits\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In this case, Moore's underlying claim arises out of alleged violations of the Stored Communications Act, a federal statute.
