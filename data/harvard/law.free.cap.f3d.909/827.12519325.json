This court previously affirmed the denial of Miller's federal habeas petition.\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

On the same date, Miller moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from carrying out his execution, currently scheduled for December 6, 2018. The district court subsequently denied the request for a preliminary injunction to the extent that it sought to prevent use of the lethal-injection protocol,\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

The defendants have filed a partial response opposing Miller's motion for a stay, and Miller has filed a reply to this response. Further, while this motion has been pending, the court was notified that Miller has elected to be executed by electrocution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In considering whether to grant a stay, we balance the following factors: (1) whether the movant has demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether he will suffer irreparable injury in the absence of equitable relief; (3) whether the stay will cause substantial harm to others; and (4) whether the public interest is best served by granting the stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    In re Garner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700480\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/612/533/#p536\">\n    612 F.3d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 536 (6th Cir. 2010).

Miller maintains that electrocution is more humane than the new drug protocol, and his basis for this argument appears largely to rest on the length of time each method of execution requires. However, this contention is debatable, and Miller has not shown that the new protocol is \"sure or very likely\" to be less humane than electrocution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Miller also argues that Tennessee is improperly compelling him to choose between two unconstitutional methods of execution, electrocution and the three-drug protocol. However, this court has concluded that neither of these methods violates the Constitution.

Because, according to Miller, electrocution is cruel and unusual punishment, and execution using the three-drug protocol would cause even more suffering than electrocution, forcing him to choose between the two methods, as Tennessee has here, leaves him only a choice between two unconstitutional alternatives: be executed by electrocution in violation of the Eighth Amendment, or be executed by lethal injection in violation of the Ex Post Facto clause and the Eighth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Assuming that electrocution violates the Eighth Amendment, and that lethal injection violates either the Ex Post Facto clause or the Eighth Amendment, Miller has a strong likelihood of success on his claim that Tennessee violated the Constitution by forcing him to choose between two unconstitutional alternatives.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Arizona v.

But in each of those cases, we simply cite back to a prior case without any analysis, and the line of summary rejections of challenges to the constitutionality of electrocution ultimately leads back to the Supreme Court's 1890 decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Kemmler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217862\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/136/436/#p449\">\n    136 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 449,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217862\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/136/436/#p449\">\n    10 S.Ct. 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217862\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/136/436/#p449\">\n    34 L.Ed. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1890).

But the Supreme Court itself has made clear that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments demands that we revisit from time to time past judgments of what methods are acceptable to accomplish the ultimate punishment of death. Indeed, the meaning of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments is derived from \"the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society. This is because the standard of extreme cruelty is not merely descriptive, but necessarily embodies a moral judgment. The standard itself remains the same, but its applicability must change as the basic mores of society change.\"\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v.

Miller has presented plausible and yet-unrebutted assertions that the three-drug protocol causes 18-20 minutes of pain and suffering, substantially longer than the six minutes of pain and suffering caused by electrocution. The state has not addressed the merits of this new evidence, other than to point to recent decisions finding that similar lethal-injection protocols did not inflict cruel and unusual punishment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Ohio Execution Protocol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276333\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/881/#p886\">\n    860 F.3d 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 884 (6th Cir. 2017) (en banc),\n   <em>\n    cert. denied sub nom.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Otte v.

Those holdings, of course, were based on the evidence presented in those cases, and in any event do not address whether the three-drug protocol constitutes an ex post facto violation. Further, the district court in this case cited another district court's recent finding that there were \"serious questions ... concerning whether the lethal injection protocol with which the state intends to execute the plaintiff is more or less humane than electrocution.\" R. 4, PID 1699 (citing\n   <em>\n    Zagorski v. Haslam\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:18-1035,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204931939\">\n    2018 WL 4931939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Tenn. Oct. 11, 2018) ). The district court did not contest this finding from\n   <em>\n    Zagorski\n   </em>\n   but instead reasoned that it did not matter in this case because the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Zagorski\n   </em>\n   , unlike in this case, was insisting on electrocution and the state was refusing his request. Nonetheless, based on Miller's unrebutted evidence, the state's failure to respond to that evidence, and the district court's recognition of serious questions concerning whether the three-drug protocol is less\n   humane than execution, Miller has presented a substantial likelihood of success on his ex post facto claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Miller's allegations also establish a substantial likelihood of success on his claim that the three-drug protocol constitutes a cruel and unusual punishment, which requires him to show \"that the method presents a risk that is\n   <em>\n    sure or very likely\n   </em>\n   to cause serious pain and needless suffering\" and to identify \"a known and available alternative method of execution that entails a lesser risk of pain.\"\n   <em>\n    Glossip v.

Miller contends that evidentiary findings made by a trial court in a case in which Defendants were parties establish that Midazolam (the first drug in the three-drug protocol) will not prevent the pain sure to result from the second and third drugs in the protocol, and that the findings relied on by the Supreme Court when it upheld the constitutionality of a similar three-drug protocol in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2731\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , have been undermined by subsequent developments. The state did not address the merits of these arguments, either. Nor did the state dispute that Miller has identified several feasible and readily available alternative methods of execution that would substantially reduce the risk of pain. Thus, Miller's allegations and supporting documentation establish a likelihood of success on the merits of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For these reasons, I would grant Miller's motion for stay of execution until the merits of his challenges can be decided, reverse the denial of preliminary injunctive relief, and remand to the district court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    The Eighth Amendment provides: \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed,\n    <em>\n     nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\n    </em>\n    \" (Emphasis added.)
