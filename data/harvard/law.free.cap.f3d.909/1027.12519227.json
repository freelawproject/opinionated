In light of\n   <em>\n    Lair III\n   </em>\n   , we reject this argument. Alaska proffered substantial evidence of attempts to secure votes for contributions. For example, Senator Coghill testified that he was approached by a lobbyist demanding his vote, saying: \"This is why we gave to you. Now we need your help.\" Similarly, Anchorage Assembly member Bob Bell testified that an executive offered to hold a fundraiser for him if he would support a private prison project. When he refused, the executive held a fundraiser for his opponent instead. These examples demonstrate attempts by individuals to affect public officials' voting behavior through the prospect of financial gain, thereby giving rise to a risk of quid pro quo corruption. Finally, there is Alaska's VECO public corruption scandal, which came to light shortly after the 2006 Initiative was passed. That scandal snared roughly 10% of Alaska's legislature in a scheme of accepting money from VECO, an oil services firm, in return for votes and other political favors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Lair III\n   </em>\n   , we are compelled to conclude that the State's evidence suffices to show that the individual-to-candidate limit \"further[s] the important state interest of preventing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266990\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/1170/\">\n    873 F.3d at 1179-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Thompson next argues that Alaska fails to show that the legislative purpose for cutting the individual contribution limit in half was to prevent quid pro quo corruption or its appearance. According to Thompson, Alaska needed to but failed to explain why $500 is better suited to combating corruption than the prior $1,000 limit. Absent such a showing, Thompson asserts, the $500 limit targets at most the \"influence\" and \"pressure\" that contributors can have on elected officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We are unpersuaded.

While different races will require varying levels of fundraising, witness testimony established that amassing $100,000 allows a candidate to mount an effective campaign.

Thus, even if a candidate spent the maximum estimated expenditure in each of these categories, she would still spend less than $100,000.

Alaska fails to show why an out-of-state individual's early contribution is not corrupting, whereas a later individual's contribution-i.e., a contribution made after the candidate has already amassed $3,000 in out-of-state funds-is corrupting. Nor does Alaska show that an out-of-state contribution of $500 is inherently more corrupting than a like in-state contribution-only the former of which is curbed under Alaska's nonresident limit. Alaska fails to demonstrate that the risk of quid pro quo corruption turns on a particular\n   donor's geography. Accordingly, while we do not foreclose the possibility that a state could limit out-of-state contributions in furtherance of an anti-corruption interest, Alaska's aggregate limit on what a candidate may receive is a poor fit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As an alternative defense of the law, Alaska argues that the nonresident limit targets the important state interest of protecting its system of self-governance. We reject Alaska's proffered state interest for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   First, what Alaska calls \"self-governance\" is really a re-branding of the interest of combating influence and access that the Supreme Court has squarely rejected. To understand Alaska's proffered state interest, it is important to be clear on what the State does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   mean by \"self-governance.\" In the distinct context of a law restricting \"who may exercise official, legislative powers,\" we recognized \"self-governance\" as a legitimate state interest.\n   <em>\n    Chula Vista Citizens for Jobs &amp; Fair Competition v.

In\n   <em>\n    Norris\n   </em>\n   , we used the term \"self-governance\" to mean a state's interest in controlling who governs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Alaska's (and the dissent's) proffered state interest is materially different from what we called self-governance in\n   <em>\n    Norris\n   </em>\n   . Alaska's version of \"self-governance\" is concerned with limiting not who governs (as in\n   <em>\n    Norris\n   </em>\n   ) but who is allowed to contribute to the campaigns of those who would govern. Indeed, the dissent correctly characterizes Alaska's proffered interest as seeking \"to ensure that its legislators are responsive to the individuals that they represent, not to out-of-state interests.\" Dissent at 37. The premise of Alaska's concern with \"outside control\" is that Alaska state officials will feel pressure to kowtow to out-of-state entities because of nonresident contributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The dissent makes a cogent case for the view that states should be able to limit who may \"directly influence the outcome of an election\" by making financial contributions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dissent at 37.

Indeed, Alaska fails to prove that nonresident participation in a state's election infringes state sovereignty.

A vital method of doing so is by curbing large monetary contributions, which can corrode the public's faith in its government's responsiveness to the popular will. Thus, while campaign contributions implicate a contributor's First Amendment right to express a particular political viewpoint, the State has an important interest in combating quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Under existing precedent, the district court correctly held that three of the four challenged provisions of Alaska's 2006 campaign finance law are closely drawn to serve this interest. But the court erred in upholding the nonresident aggregate contribution limit because it, at most, targets contributors' influence over Alaska politics. Since\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McCutcheon\n   </em>\n   , preventing \"undue influence\" is no longer a legitimate basis for restricting contributions under the First Amendment. Accordingly, we reverse the district court on that provision and remand for entry of judgment consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The parties shall bear their own costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   I agree with the majority that Alaska's limitations on individual contributions to candidates and election-related groups and on political party contributions to individual candidates do not violate the First Amendment. However, I would hold that the nonresident aggregate contribution limit, which furthers Alaska's important state interests in preventing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance and in preserving self-governance, also does not violate the First Amendment. Thus, I respectfully dissent from Section III(B)(iv) of the majority opinion. I would affirm the district court's well-reasoned decision in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   To survive First Amendment scrutiny in this case, Alaska must establish that the limits are justified by the risk of quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.
