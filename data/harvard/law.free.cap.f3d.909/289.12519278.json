BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In May 2015, Dropbox, Inc.-an internet company providing data storage for electronic files-submitted a tip to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that child-pornography images had been uploaded to an account registered to \"Pablo Garrido.\" Dropbox identified the account email address as karmus28@gmail.com. The FBI linked the Dropbox and email accounts to IP addresses and to a cellphone number in Pablo Garrido's name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Executing a search warrant for Chilaca's home, FBI agents seized a Compaq desktop computer tower, a loose Western Digital hard drive disconnected from a computer, and a Simple Tech Pro Drive hard drive. Each device contained videos or images of child pornography. Each device was linked to the Dropbox account, allowing files added to a folder on that device to upload to the Dropbox account; the images were therefore accessible from the Dropbox folder on the other devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A grand jury indicted Chilaca for two counts of child-pornography possession, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B). A superseding indictment charged Chilaca with four counts, again under \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B). Count 1 charged possession of 24 images and 1 video of child pornography in the Dropbox account; Count 2 charged possession of 22 images and 6 videos on a \"Seagate brand hard drive\"; Count 3 charged possession of 7 images and 5 videos on a \"Western brand hard drive\"; and Count 4 charged possession of 6 images and 2 videos on a \"Simple Tech Pro Drive brand hard drive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Chilaca moved to dismiss the superseding indictment as multiplicitous, arguing that he could be charged with only one count of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B). The district court denied the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The jury found Chilaca guilty on all four counts, and the district court sentenced him to four concurrent 66-month terms, a lifetime of supervised release, a $400 special assessment, and $6,000 in restitution. The issue is whether the court erred by finding that the indictment was not multiplicitous and did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Four Counts Were Multiplicitous\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Section 2252(a)(4)(B) makes it a crime for \"[a]ny person who either knowingly possesses, or knowingly accesses with intent to view, 1 or more books, magazines, periodicals, films, video tapes, or other matter which contain any visual depiction\" of child pornography.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B). The indictment charged four \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) violations. The question is whether, under this statute, simultaneous possession of child-pornography images, stored in different media and found in the same location, creates separate \"allowable units of prosecution.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Chilaca argues that simultaneously possessing \"1 or more\" media or electronic storage devices that contain child-pornography images is only one violation of \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B), regardless of the number of images or separate media used to store the images. The government argues that storing child pornography on the Dropbox account and three hard drives constitutes four separate and distinct acts. If not, the government argues, possessing \"a single item that contains child pornography\" would be analogous to someone possessing \"a warehouse of such items,\" both punishable by only one count of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The circuits that have squarely addressed the issue before us have concluded that multiple counts under \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) are multiplicitous when the defendant simultaneously possessed the child pornography on different devices found at the same time and in the same place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Second Circuit considered whether several convictions under \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) were multiplicitous in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

On appeal, the court concluded that the \"1 or more\" language in \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) means that a person who simultaneously possessed multiple \"matters\" found at the same place committed only one \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) violation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4238499\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/564/142/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4238499\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/564/142/\">\n    at 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
