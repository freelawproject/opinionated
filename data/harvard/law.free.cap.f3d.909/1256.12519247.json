Here, the City filed a petition for an Order for Relief alleging that it was eligible for bankruptcy and, in fact, was insolvent. After a three-day bench trial, the bankruptcy court issued an extensive order making factual findings and determining that the City was eligible for Chapter 9 relief. As to insolvency, the court\n   examined the City's ability to: (1) pay its debts as they matured (commonly referred to as \"cash insolvency\"); (2) pay for the costs of providing services required for the health, safety, and welfare of the community (commonly called \"service delivery insolvency\"); and (3) create a balanced budget (termed \"budget insolvency\"). After considering the evidence, the court found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The sum of the evidence establishes that the City was insolvent by all available measures when it filed its chapter 9 case. It was cash insolvent, unable to pay its debts as they came due as required by \u00a7 101(32)(C) and \u00a7 109(c)(3). That it was service delivery insolvent confirms that the cash insolvency was not a mere technical insolvency. That it was budget insolvent for the long term confirms that the insolvency would persist without realignment of revenues and expenses. Hence, the City satisfied the insolvency requirement of \u00a7 109(c)(3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    In re City of Stockton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178852\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/493/772/#p780\">\n    493 B.R. at 790-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The ensuing Chapter 9 proceedings were complex, costly, and contentious.\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362220\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/542/261/#p265\">\n    542 B.R. at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Pursuant to the plan, the City made wire transfers totaling $13.1 million, including a settlement of health care benefits to retirees and payments to institutional creditors. The City implemented the provisions of the plan, restructuring its obligations to two other major institutional creditors by conveying title to 17 parking lots and garages, assigning leasehold interests, and assigning an option for the purchase of a city office building. The City has continued to make its payments pursuant to the plan, with secured creditors receiving lower payments on the secured debt and unsecured creditors receiving lesser amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   So, what was Objector-Appellant Michael Cobb's part in all of this? The background is somewhat procedurally complex. Cobb's father, Andrew Cobb, owned a parcel of land in Stockton. In 1998, the Stockton City Council resolved that the public necessity required the condemnation of a strip of land across the parcel for the purpose of building a road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In California, the power of eminent domain can be exercised through traditional\n   condemnation proceedings, where possession is taken at the time of judgment, or through \"quick-take\" condemnation where a locality can take possession upon depositing a probable compensation amount determined by a qualified expert appraiser. Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 19 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201255.010\">\n    Cal. Civ. Proc.

Following the deposit of funds under the \"quick-take\" procedure, the government may move the court for an immediate possession order.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201255.410\">\n    Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 1255.410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the defendant elects to withdraw the proposed compensation amount, he waives all claims and defenses to the condemnation, except a claim for greater compensation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201255.260\">\n    Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 1255.260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Stockton elected to use the \"quick-take\" process. Thus, pursuant to California Civil Procedure Code \u00a7 1255.010, the City had an expert appraise the parcel to determine the amount of just compensation owed to Andrew Cobb. The appraiser valued the parcel at $90,200.00. As required by the \"quick-take\" provisions, the City deposited that sum with the California State Treasurer Condemnation Deposits Fund. That same day, the City initiated eminent domain proceedings in the Superior Court of California, County of San Joaquin, to acquire a permanent easement over the parcel (the \"eminent domain action\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Later that year, the Superior Court determined the City had met the requirements of \u00a7 1255.010, concluded it had met the requirements of probable compensation, and issued an Order for Prejudgment Possession in favor of the City. A road was then built on the parcel, and the Stockton City Council passed a resolution in 2000 accepting the improvements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the meantime, Andrew Cobb passed away and his son, Michael Cobb, inherited the parcel. After Andrew Cobb's death, Cobb was substituted in the condemnation action. He entered into a stipulation with the City allowing him to withdraw the deposited amount and, in 2000, he withdrew the entire amount of the deposit. At that point, by operation of law, he waived all of his defenses and claims to the property, except a claim for greater compensation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201255.260\">\n    Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 1255.260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, Cobb gave up all rights to the property. He did not assert a counterclaim for greater compensation in the condemnation proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Seven years later, Cobb attempted to return the $90,200.00 to the City-apparently in an attempt to revoke his earlier waiver-but the City would not accept the funds, explaining that the withdrawal of probable compensation was final under California law. Cobb deposited the funds into an interest-bearing trust account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 2007, the Superior Court dismissed the City's eminent domain action because it had not been brought to trial within five years of its commencement, as is required by California Civil Procedure Code \u00a7 583.310. A year later, Cobb filed a complaint in San Joaquin County Superior Court, seeking relief for inverse condemnation (the \"inverse condemnation action\"). The complaint alleged that because the City failed to prosecute the eminent domain action, the true market value of the parcel remained undetermined and thus Cobb had not received the just compensation due him under the California Constitution. Over the next several months, Cobb amended his complaint three times, adding claims for quiet title, ejectment, trespass, and declaratory relief. The City demurred to all the amended complaints. The Superior Court sustained the City's demurrer as to the inverse condemnation claim on the\n   grounds that it was barred by the statute of limitations because the taking occurred more than five years before the complaint was filed, and it sustained the City's demurrer as to the other claims on the grounds that they were barred by the doctrine of intervening public use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Cobb appealed the Superior Court's dismissal of his inverse condemnation claim solely on statute of limitations grounds. He did not appeal the dismissal of the quiet title, ejectment, trespass, or declaratory relief claims. In 2011, the Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of Cobb's inverse condemnation claim, finding that his claim was timely because it \"did not accrue until the City's occupation of the property became wrongful, which did not occur until the eminent domain proceeding was dismissed.\" Thus, what remained of his state court action was simply an unliquidated and unsecured monetary damage claim. The merits of his inverse condemnation claim remain unadjudicated and unproven. As the bankruptcy court pointed out, given the various defenses available to the City, \"Mr. Cobb has a very steep hill to climb in his action for greater compensation in the California courts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Thereafter, in 2012, the City petitioned for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 9. In a Chapter 9 bankruptcy, the debtor is not required to file schedules and a statement of financial affairs. Rather, the debtor is required to file a list of creditors.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Any claim on the debtor's list is deemed filed as a proof of claim pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , unless the debt is listed as contingent, disputed or unliquidated.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20925\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   When it filed its list of creditors in this case, the City identified Cobb's claim as an unsecured, disputed liability claim of an unknown amount. Subsequently, Cobb filed a proof of claim for $4,200,997.26. Cobb's claim consisted of a principal of $1,540,000.00 for the parcel, $2,282,997.26 in interest on the principal, $350,000.00 in attorney's fees and expenses, $13,000.00 in costs of suit, and $15,000.00 in real estate taxes and maintenance and insurance costs. Cobb did not assert on his proof of claim that his claim was secured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In 2013, the City filed its first amended plan for adjustment of its debts (the \"plan\"), which listed 19 classes of claims. The plan included Cobb's claim in Class 12 as a general unsecured claim. On February 11, 2014, Cobb filed an objection to confirmation of the plan, alleging that his \"claims in inverse condemnation are protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and cannot be impaired by the Plan.\" He did not contest the listing of his claim as unsecured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In 2014, the bankruptcy judge overruled Cobb's objection to confirmation of the pending plan of adjustment. The bankruptcy judge explained that Cobb is left with only a claim for more money because the road had long since been built on the parcel and because by withdrawing the probable just compensation, Cobb had waived by operation of law all claims except a claim for greater compensation. In an oral ruling, the bankruptcy judge concluded that \"[t]he bankruptcy clause does permit the adjustment of a debt for greater compensation,\" and \"if [the debt] were reduced to judgment, it would be a general unsecured debt at the moment the judgment was issued.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Cobb did not seek a stay of plan confirmation from the bankruptcy court. Cobb timely appealed the bankruptcy court's order overruling his objection to the plan to the district court for the Eastern District of California. He did not seek a stay of plan confirmation before the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Cobb and the City both stipulated, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(A), that the appeal warranted proceeding directly to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On August 7, 2014, the district court certified this appeal to this Court, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(B)(ii). A motions panel of our Court granted Cobb's motion to appeal directly to this Court. Cobb did not seek a stay of plan confirmation. The bankruptcy court confirmed the City's plan of adjustment and issued a final judgment. Cobb did not seek a stay following plan confirmation, and the plan became effective on February 25, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finality is essential to the success of bankruptcy reorganization plans. A reorganization plan almost always involves tradeoffs, debt adjustment, partial asset liquidation, and the infusion of new revenue sources. Both creditors and the debtor require certainty so that the debtor can return to economic health, and the creditors can maximize their recovery within the debtor's ability to pay. In the case of a municipal reorganization, the public has an enormous stake in the outcome so that critical government programs, such as law enforcement, fire protection, and public works, can be restored. Thus, if a creditor wishes to challenge a reorganization plan on appeal, we require the creditor to seek a stay of proceedings before the bankruptcy court. When a stay is requested, all affected parties are on notice that the plan may be subject to appellate review and have an opportunity to present evidence before the bankruptcy court of the consequences of a stay. \"A confirmed reorganization plan operates as a final judgment with\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Unsecured Creditors Comm. v.

As the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel concluded in\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]o reverse the Confirmation Order at this point would have a potentially devastating impact on creditor constituencies whose settlements with the City were incorporated in the Plan and who are not appearing before us in this appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362220\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/542/261/#p265\">\n    542 B.R. at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In addition to the creditors, reversal of the Confirmation Order would have a substantial effect on the citizens of Stockton, who depend upon the City for the provision of vital services.

Leaving aside the fact that the remedy he seeks is to reverse plan confirmation, Cobb is making a multi-million dollar claim which, on its face,\n   would have a considerable impact on the City. He suggests, without proof, that the City has the resources to pay the claim. However, as the City pointed out in\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   , allowing such a claim would likely result in revisiting the City's Long Range Financial Plan, which provided the basis for the plan's feasibility, and \"consequently calling into question the economic underpinnings of the Plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362220\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/542/261/#p265\">\n    542 B.R. at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In addition, and most importantly, the only adjudication of the City's solvency in the record is the bankruptcy court's findings of facts and conclusions of law holding that the City was insolvent-a finding that was adopted and reiterated at the time of plan confirmation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cobb did not challenge the City's claim of insolvency in the bankruptcy court, nor dispute the bankruptcy court's findings. He simply suggests for the first time on appeal, without support in the record, that the City is not insolvent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In sum, the third factor favors application of equitable mootness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   4\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The final factor is whether the bankruptcy court could fashion equitable relief without completely undoing the plan. Of course, undoing the plan is precisely the remedy that Cobb seeks. Cobb argues that he seeks only monetary relief, but his appeal is of the bankruptcy court's order overruling Cobb's objection to confirmation of the plan of adjustment. His challenge-and his only challenge-is to the confirmation of the plan itself. In his objection to the plan before the bankruptcy court, Cobb argued that the plan could not be confirmed, and \"[w]here a Chapter 9 Plan may not be confirmed, the remedy appears to be dismissal of the bankruptcy case.\" The Notice of Appeal was taken as to the bankruptcy court's order denying his objection to plan confirmation. On appeal, he reiterated his objection to the plan and repeated his claim that where a bankruptcy plan cannot be confirmed, the remedy is dismissal of the bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Sustaining Cobb's objection would mean dismantling the confirmed reorganization plan, which is the only relief he seeks. Considering this remedy in\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   , the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel concluded that \"[r]eversing the Confirmation Order would 'knock the props out from under' the plan and would leave the bankruptcy court with an unmanageable situation on remand.\"\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362220\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/542/261/#p265\">\n    542 B.R. at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plan provides for 20 different classes of creditors, almost all of which have been deemed impaired-meaning that the legal, equitable, or contractual rights of the creditors are affected by the plan. Plan confirmation adjusted all of these rights. To reverse the Confirmation Order at this stage would create chaos and undo years of carefully negotiated settlements. The fourth factor favors application of equitable mootness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   5\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Thus, as it was for the Sixth Circuit in considering a similar appeal arising out of Detroit's bankruptcy, \"[t]his is not a close\n   call.\"\n   <em>\n    Ochadleus v. City of Detroit\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re City of Detroit\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173787,12141679\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/792/\">\n    838 F.3d 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 799 (6th Cir. 2016). As with the situation posed by the Detroit municipal reorganization, the complex plan has been confirmed, affecting the rights of thousands of creditors and the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The reorganization train has left the station. Cobb did not pursue any bankruptcy stay remedies, much less pursue them with the requisite diligence. The plan has long been substantially consummated. He offers too little, too late. None of the factors that we consider in deciding whether to apply the doctrine of equitable mootness favor Cobb. Thus, his appeal must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Cobb's underlying theory-that the Takings Clause exempts his unsecured claim from reorganization-is not viable on this record, and the bankruptcy court properly concluded that this claim fails on the merits. The Takings Clause is only implicated in bankruptcy if the creditor has actual property rights. In other words, the creditor must have an \"\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   right under nonbankruptcy law to look to specific items of property\" in order for the debt to be paid ahead of unsecured creditors. 4\n   <em>\n    Collier on Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 506.03 (Alan N. Resnick &amp; Henry J. Sommer eds., 16th ed. 2017). If the purported property interest is, in reality, just a contractual or statutory right for monetary relief, then the debt can be adjusted in bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Distilled to its essence, Cobb's argument on appeal is that he has a property interest that cannot be adjusted in bankruptcy. But that is not what his bankruptcy claim is, or even what he asserted that his was. As we have noted, both the City and Cobb classified his claim as an unsecured monetary claim. Cobb has never challenged the categorization of the claim as unsecured; nor has he sought, through\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   or otherwise, to have his interest adjudicated otherwise. Indeed, prior state court judgments against him would have precluded that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Even assuming that Cobb had asserted a property-based proof of claim, it failed on the merits to be categorized as such, as the bankruptcy court found. First, he had relinquished his property interest in the land more than 15 years before bankruptcy was filed. As we have noted, under California's \"quick-take\" condemnation proceedings, Stockton properly hired a qualified expert appraiser, who valued the property. Following the statutory procedure, Stockton then deposited the funds and moved the superior court for immediate possession of the property, and the superior court granted the City immediate possession of the parcel. Andrew Cobb did not object to the probable just compensation finding or judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As we have noted, under California law, if the property owner elects to withdraw the proposed compensation amount, he waives all claims and defenses to the condemnation, except a claim for greater compensation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201255.260\">\n    Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 1255.260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Michael Cobb withdrew the deposit, thereby waiving all claims, except as to a claim for greater compensation. In other words, Cobb gave up all rights to the property. He did not assert a counterclaim for greater compensation in the condemnation proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Seven years later, he tried to return the money, which the City declined. His subsequent suit against the City, in which he sought quiet title and declaratory relief, among other remedies, was dismissed. In sum, the relief he sought to enforce property rights or restoration of his property\n   interest was rejected. That judgment is final and binding. He did not take an appeal from that decision, except as to the statute of limitations on his inverse condemnation claim. The California Court of Appeal granted him relief on that question. So, what remains of his state court action is simply an unliquidated and unsecured monetary damage claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Thus, the bankruptcy court properly concluded that once Cobb withdrew the tendered compensation, he waived by operation of law all claims and defenses in his favor as to the property, except for a claim for greater compensation, which is an unsecured monetary debt claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Second, Cobb independently relinquished any property interest he had by allowing the City to construct the road and open the road to public use. Under California law, if a property owner allows the government to complete the taking of the property for public use, he is \"denied the right to enjoin the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Frustuck v.

It had been extinguished. What remained was bare legal title-without any other property rights and subject to defeasance by the prior litigation-and an unsecured statutory monetary claim for greater compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Cobb's theory seems to be that an unliquidated, statutory claim for greater compensation cannot be adjusted in bankruptcy. But it is purely a monetary claim. As the bankruptcy court pointed out, if the inverse condemnation claim had been reduced to a judgment, it would be subject to adjustment in bankruptcy; therefore, it is not logical to say that an unliquidated claim for greater compensation cannot be adjusted in bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Nor does the character of any claim asserting an unconstitutional taking make it immune from evaluation on the merits in bankruptcy.

He did not seek exemption from discharge. It would be improper not only to excuse all of these\n   failures, but to invent for him an entirely new remedy on appeal.

His unsecured claim for greater compensation was not tethered to the actual property interest he had when the bankruptcy was filed. Rather, his claim is for the purported rights that were extinguished long before\n   the bankruptcy was filed. What he is left with after bankruptcy is bare property title and an unliquidated unsecured claim. Given the circumstances of the case, the bankruptcy court correctly determined that Cobb's claim was properly categorized in the reorganization plan and properly overruled his objection to plan confirmation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Stockton's reorganization plan was confirmed and has been substantially consummated. Undoing the confirmed plan would seriously affect the rights of third parties. Cobb did not take the minimal step of seeking a stay at any level-not before the bankruptcy court, not before the district court, and not before us. On the merits, the bankruptcy court properly rejected his claim. The claim was correctly categorized as unsecured and adjusted as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   This appeal is not the first time that the question of equitable mootness has arisen in the context of this bankruptcy. In\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   , the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel carefully reviewed the challenge of a large capital market creditor to Stockton's plan of reorganization. It concluded that the creditor's challenge was equitably moot in consideration of the substantial consummation of the plan, the effect on third parties, and whether relief could be fashioned without destroying the plan.\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362220\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/542/261/#p265\">\n    542 B.R. at 264-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same considerations apply here, with the same effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Bill of Rights constrains the powers given to Congress by Article I of the Constitution. And, in particular, the Fifth Amendment's requirement that the government provide just compensation for any taking of private property constrains the powers granted to Congress by the Bankruptcy Clause of Article I. Takings claims should therefore be excepted from discharge in bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The majority contends that the judge-made bankruptcy doctrine of equitable mootness is the dominant principle at issue in this appeal, and that it prevents us from even adjudicating the constitutional claim to just compensation asserted by Appellant Michael Cobb (\"Cobb\") against the City of Stockton (\"City\"). But equitable mootness has no role to play here. Cobb seeks only to have his claim to just compensation excepted from discharge-that is, to effectively be treated as falling outside the City's bankruptcy adjustment plan (\"Plan\"). A claim that falls outside of bankruptcy cannot be subject to the bankruptcy doctrine of equitable mootness. I would therefore reach the merits of Cobb's appeal rather than dismissing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As to the merits, there is no dispute that the City condemned Cobb's property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, after that happened, Cobb took all actions necessary under state law to preserve his right to just compensation for the taking of that property. Indeed, his state court action for just compensation would\n   have proceeded if it had not been stayed in response to the City's bankruptcy filing. Because Cobb maintains a constitutional claim for just compensation, and because that claim should have been excepted from discharge, I would hold that Cobb's state-court inverse condemnation action should be allowed to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The majority concludes that any appeal seeking to unravel the Plan would be equitably moot. Even assuming so, undoing the confirmed Plan is not on the table in this appeal. Cobb has been abundantly clear before our court that he seeks only to except his claim from discharge, and thus to remove his claim from the Plan altogether. Although Cobb originally lodged his complaint as an objection to the Plan, which may have seemed to him the only option given the novelty of the legal issue his situation presented, he has since plainly disclaimed any intent to \"unwind\" the Plan. Equitable mootness considerations are therefore irrelevant here and should not prevent us from adjudicating Cobb's argument that his takings claim was entitled to \"pass through [the] bankruptcy unaffected.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Towers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11814514,11807890\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/162/952/\">\n    162 F.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 953 (7th Cir. 1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Equitable mootness \"reflects an\n   <em>\n    unwillingness\n   </em>\n   to provide relief\" in cases involving bankruptcy \"transactions that are so complex or difficult to unwind that debtors, creditors, and third parties are entitled to rely on the final bankruptcy court order.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Transwest\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345707,6055043\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/1161/\">\n    801 F.3d 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1167 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Mortgs.

I am unaware of any case in which we have applied an equitable mootness analysis to an individual's claim that an asset should have been excepted from discharge and excluded from bankruptcy proceedings altogether. Indeed, it makes no sense to extend this judicially created doctrine to cases like this one. The sole point of this appeal is that Cobb should have been permitted to pursue his claim outside of the Plan because his claim should have been excepted from discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Towers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11814514,11807890\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/162/952/\">\n    162 F.3d at 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such an appeal could never undo a plan. If an appellant like Cobb prevails, his or her claim will survive totally apart from the plan, and recognition of such survival will in no way change the terms of the plan. If the appellant does not prevail, then it will have been appropriate to have discharged his or her claim as part of the plan, and there will thus be no reason to change the terms of the plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The majority relies on\n   <em>\n    Franklin High Yield Tax-Free Income Fund v.

Starting with the latter point, as a matter of constitutional first principles, I believe municipalities are obligated to provide just compensation for any taking of private property, regardless of the bankruptcy laws.

The Fifth Amendment requires that states provide a mechanism for compensating land owners for their condemned property, so such takings claims will generally be brought in accordance with procedures laid out in state statutes. Takings claims arising in California do not somehow lose their constitutional status merely because California's procedures for seeking just compensation were codified by statute rather than solely through caselaw.

As a result, the classification of Cobb's claim within the Plan is irrelevant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Moreover, while Cobb may not have challenged his claim's specific classification, he unequivocally maintained throughout the bankruptcy proceeding that his claim for just compensation was \"protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and c[ould not] be impaired by the Plan\" or treated as a mere \" 'general unsecured' claim.\" This line of reasoning plainly encompasses the argument that his claim should have been excepted from discharge. Cobb has now also clearly expressed to our court that the remedy he requests is to preserve his takings claim. Given that the parties had an opportunity to address all of the relevant issues, I see no reason to\n   fault Cobb for failing to challenge the categorization of his claim as unsecured. After all, \"the bankruptcy law is not supposed to function merely as a procedural gauntlet that only the most adroit or best represented creditors can overcome.\"\n   <em>\n    Kolstad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1138292,6506021\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/928/171/\">\n    928 F.2d at 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Contrary to the majority's suggestions, the sky will not fall if Cobb is allowed to pursue his claim for just compensation. I am not blind to the City's herculean task of pulling itself out of bankruptcy, but a ruling for Cobb would not topple the Plan, or somehow throw the City back into bankruptcy. The City has presented no evidence that Cobb cannot be compensated for his condemned property while the City carries out its Plan. The City has not, for example, argued that it would have to claw back distributions under the Plan to pay Cobb. Indeed, the City has not even claimed that it is currently insolvent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, because Cobb seeks to proceed entirely outside of the Plan, the City would be under no obligation to compensate him within the same timeframe in which it compensates creditors under the Plan.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In addition, as the majority itself notes, just compensation does not necessarily mean full compensation.\n   <em>\n    United Statesv.

But the analysis of what just compensation entails must take place under the Fifth Amendment, rather than through the lens of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Moreover, recognizing the protected nature of Cobb's claim would have implications only for other takings claims, and thus would not leave the City vulnerable to a slew of new liabilities arising from other sorts of constitutional claims.

Contrary to the majority's characterization, there was therefore no colorable takings claim for the bankruptcy court to have any impact on one way or the other. Here, by contrast, there is no question that a taking occurred that entitled Cobb to compensation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    To the extent the majority faults Cobb for not asserting a counterclaim for greater compensation in the eminent domain proceeding, the majority is mistaken. Because an eminent domain action will necessarily determine the compensation due to the property owner-indeed, that is the purpose of the action-a property owner is not required to separately counterclaim for more than the probable just compensation funds. In fact, the value of the probable just compensation funds \"may not be given in evidence or referred to in the trial of the issue of compensation\" during an eminent domain proceeding in California court.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201255.060\">\n     Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 1255.060\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a). This state procedural rule would make no sense if a property owner had to bring a counterclaim to request compensation in excess of the deposited funds. Moreover, the City has never asserted that Cobb was required to bring a counterclaim for his requested compensation. Even assuming such a requirement existed, then, the City has forfeited any argument that Cobb failed to meet it. Finally, as the California Court of Appeal explained in concluding that Cobb's inverse condemnation action was still timely, a property owner is not required to bring an inverse condemnation action until the dismissal of the eminent domain proceeding. If Cobb had been required to assert a counterclaim for greater compensation, he would not have had a viable inverse condemnation claim that could even potentially have been time barred. The fact that the Court of Appeal held that Cobb's inverse condemnation action could proceed shows that the court implicitly concluded that Cobb was not required to bring a counterclaim in the eminent domain action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    <em>\n     People ex rel.

The issue in\n    <em>\n     Peninsula Title\n    </em>\n    was thus whether a property owner should continue to bear the\n    <em>\n     burdens\n    </em>\n    of ownership throughout the lengthy eminent domain process despite having effectively lost the property, not whether a property owner is deprived of the only\n    <em>\n     benefit\n    </em>\n    remaining to him at that point-the constitutional right to seek just compensation. The City has not cited any cases that support the latter proposition, nor has the majority.
