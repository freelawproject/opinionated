This so-called \"Reporting Rule\" was scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2018. On March 21, 2017, however, DOT issued an \"Extension Rule\" that delayed the effective date of the Reporting Rule by one year. On July 31, 2017, over four months after the issuance of the Extension Rule, Paralyzed Veterans of America and Larry J. Dodson, a paralyzed Air Force veteran, (\"the Petitioners\") filed a lawsuit in the District Court challenging the Extension Rule. They contended that the rule was procedurally infirm because it was issued without notice-and-comment procedures and it was substantively invalid because it was arbitrary and capricious. In response to this suit, DOT elected not to address the merits of the Petitioners' claims and instead argued only that the District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the suit. The District Court agreed with DOT, held that it lacked jurisdiction over this action, and then transferred the case \"in the interests of justice\" to this court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201631\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans of Am. v.

We therefore reject the Petitioners' request that this case be transferred back to the District Court. We further dismiss the case because the Petitioners' claim was filed after the 60-day statutory deadline and there are no \"reasonable grounds\" justifying their untimely filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

And when DOT promulgated the Extension Rule, it cited Part A provisions as authority to support the rule; however, as indicated above, the Department mistakenly cited \u00a7\u00a7 41101 and 41701, instead of \u00a7\u00a7 41708 and 41709.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Furthermore, the Petitioners are correct in pointing out that the two Part A statutory provisions cited by DOT -\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2041101\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 41101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 41701 - plainly do not support the Extension Rule.

However, the District Court correctly rejected this claim because this provision merely delegates authority to the General Counsel to issue the Extension Rule on behalf of the Secretary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522992\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/286/111/#p120\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, we find no merit in the Petitioners' claim that the direct-review provision of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2046110\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) has no application in this case. The problem with the Petitioners' argument is that it rests on\n   the implicit assumption that they were misled by DOT's failure to cite \u00a7\u00a7 41708 and 41709 in support of the Extension Rule. The record does not support this assumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   First, although DOT cited the wrong provisions in Part A when it promulgated the disputed rule, the Petitioners were on notice that the Department meant to rely on Part A. As explained above, Part A authorizes DOT's regulation of air commerce, including the agency's imposition of recordkeeping and reporting requirements. In addition, the Extension Rule - which amends\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20234.6\">\n    14 C.F.R. \u00a7 234.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - expressly invokes Part A authority.

As the District Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   At oral argument, the Department suggested that the notice of proposed rulemaking had actually meant to expand part 234's authority citation-that is, to cite chapters 411 and 417 of title 49. This mistake was then compounded by the drafters of the final Reporting Rule, who \"corrected\" the citation not by changing the phrase \"41101 and 41701\" to \"411 and 417,\" but rather by changing the word \"chapters\" to \"sections.\" In light of the foregoing review of the Reporting Rule's drafting history, this explanation for the change-the only one offered by either party-\"makes perfect sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

Why else would the Department have changed the citation from clearly applicable statutory authority ( \u00a7\u00a7 41708 and 41709 ) to clearly inapposite authority ( \u00a7\u00a7 41101 and 41701 )?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522992\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/286/111/#p120\">\n    286 F.Supp.3d at 118-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Extension Rule's citation to \u00a7\u00a7 41101 and 41701 was simply a mistake, but not one that misled the Petitioners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522992\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/286/111/#p120\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522992\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/286/111/#p120\">\n    at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
