We disagree and affirm the district court's\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   denial of the permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Calzone is the incorporator, president (the sole officer), director, registered agent, and one of three members of the Board of Directors (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Board\n   </strong>\n   \") of Missouri First, Inc. (\"\n   <strong>\n    Missouri First\n   </strong>\n   \"). Missouri First is a non-profit organization, and its charter states that it uses legislative lobbying to influence public policy, mobilize the public, and meet Missouri First's objectives. R. Doc. 34, at 4. On its website, it also states that \"there is strength in numbers\" when lobbying and solicits new members to help further advance Missouri First's legislative agenda. R. Doc. 34, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Calzone regularly meets with legislators, legislative staff, and other legislative groups to discuss Missouri legislation. These meetings cover both specific legislation or proposed legislation and include Calzone and Missouri First's opinion as to whether legislation should be passed or blocked. Calzone admits that when he met with legislators in Jefferson City, Missouri, he usually disclosed his affiliation with Missouri First, commonly by identifying himself as \"Ron Calzone, Director of Missouri First\" or \"Ron Calzone, a director of Missouri First.\" R. Doc. 34, at 5. As the Director, sole officer, registered agent, and board member of Missouri First, Calzone is responsible for determining who will appear before the legislature and present Missouri First's agenda. No evidence in the record suggests that anyone other than Calzone has represented Missouri First before the Missouri legislature. Calzone does not receive any compensation or make any expenditures when lobbying on behalf of Missouri First.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2014 and 2016, the Commission received two complaints against Calzone claiming that he violated the Missouri Statutes, which define who qualifies as a lobbyist and require those individuals to register as lobbyists and file regular lobbying reports. The Missouri Society of Governmental Consultants filed the first complaint, and the Commission found probable cause to believe that Calzone violated the lobbying statutes. Calzone appealed the decision, and the Administrative Hearing Commission ordered discovery. Calzone then sought a writ of prohibition from the Cole County, Missouri Circuit Court. The circuit court granted the petition, finding that the Missouri Society of Governmental Consultants is a corporation, and Missouri law does not allow corporations to file complaints with the Commission. The Commission appealed and the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed and remanded with directions to quash the writ. The Administrative Hearing Commission then stayed the proceedings pending this court's decision. The second complaint was filed by Michael Reid, a natural person, and was substantively identical to the first. The Commission has dismissed the second complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 21, 2016, Calzone filed suit in federal court stating the Commission violated his First Amendment rights and requesting a temporary restraining order to prevent the Commission from enforcing the Missouri Statutes against him or any\n   other unpaid lobbyists. Initially, the district court abstained from hearing the case because the 2016 complaint was pending before the Commission, but, after the Commission dismissed the complaint, the district court resumed the temporary restraining order proceedings. The court denied Calzone's request for a temporary restraining order, finding he was not likely to succeed on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Calzone also moved for a permanent injunction, challenging the constitutionality of the Missouri Statutes both facially and as applied to him. After a hearing, the court, applying exacting scrutiny, found that Missouri had a sufficiently important interest in governmental transparency and that requiring unpaid lobbyists to register with the government and file lobbying reports was substantially related to furthering that transparency interest. Thus, the court held Calzone's as-applied challenge failed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court then turned to Calzone's facial challenge and found it lacking as well. The court determined that the word \"designated\" in the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because an ordinary person would have a reasonable opportunity to understand what the statute required. Because Calzone was the registered agent of Missouri First, the court reasoned, he had the authority to appoint himself as a lobbyist for Missouri First. The court held this action is within the plain meaning of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Thus, because the district court found both claims failed on the merits, it denied Calzone's request for a permanent injunction. Calzone now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

First, he argues that the district court erred by applying the wrong level of scrutiny to his constitutional claims. Second, he argues that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20150.473\">\n    Mo. Rev.

Level of Scrutiny\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As a preliminary argument, Calzone asserts that the district court did not apply the correct level of scrutiny, claiming that strict scrutiny rather than intermediate or exacting scrutiny applies. It does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Citizens United v.

Calzone makes an inappropriate distinction.\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   did involve campaign finance, but the Supreme Court referred to disclosure and disclaimer requirements generally, and it made no distinction between disclosure statutes in campaign finance versus lobbying cases.\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p318\">\n    558 U.S. at 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p318\">\n    130 S.Ct. 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swanson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514810\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/864/#p874\">\n    692 F.3d at 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 105.470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Calzone asserts that Missouri only has a sufficient interest in having paid lobbyists register; thus, as applied to him, the statute is unconstitutional because he is unpaid. Again, \"exacting scrutiny ... requires a substantial relation between the disclosure requirement and a sufficiently important governmental interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Swanson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514810\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/864/#p874\">\n    692 F.3d at 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). We turn first to whether Missouri has a sufficiently important governmental interest in having unpaid lobbyists register.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We do not, as both Calzone and the dissent urge, consider the application of this statute to unpaid lobbyists who make no expenditures related to lobbying efforts because this argument was not fairly raised before the district court. Calzone did not even raise it on appeal until oral argument, where he attempted to recast his claim as including an as-applied challenge to registration requirements for unpaid lobbyists who make no expenditures. Whether this narrower claim might have been successful is an interesting academic question, but Calzone forfeited any such claim in the district court and waived it on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Calzone's complaint alleged a cause of action under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, stating \"specifically\" that the state of Missouri violated his rights by seeking to apply the lobbying statutes to his \"uncompensated policy conversations.\" R. Doc. 1, at 11. His motion for a preliminary injunction sought an order preventing Missouri from enforcing the lobbying statutes \"against any individual that acts without being compensated\" and \"against those\n   who act without being compensated.\" R. Doc. 2, at 2. The district court properly addressed the issue that Calzone raised.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. Doc. 34, at 1 (\"Calzone contends that Missouri cannot require him to register as a lobbyist ...\n   <em>\n    because he is not paid to be a lobbyist\n   </em>\n   and Missouri's definition of lobbyist is unconstitutionally vague.\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (\"Calzone requests a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants ... from enforcing or threatening to enforce the disclosure requirements ...\n   <em>\n    against those who act without being compensated\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). Calzone's stipulation and factual assertions that he does not make expenditures are not the same as a legal argument premised on that fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Further, in his brief on appeal, Calzone's \"Statement of the Issues\" raised only the same legal issue that he presented in the district court: \"May the government, consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, require\n   <em>\n    unpaid individuals\n   </em>\n   to comply with Missouri's registration and reporting regime for legislative lobbyists?\" Appellant's Br. 1 (emphasis added). His \"Summary of the Case\" likewise described the question presented as whether an individual may be regulated as a lobbyist \"even if he acts solely\n   <em>\n    as an unpaid volunteer\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The summary objected to the district court's ruling that \"Missouri could require\n   <em>\n    unpaid volunteers\n   </em>\n   to carry the same burdens as professional,\n   <em>\n    compensated\n   </em>\n   lobbyists.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphases added). Calzone's heading in the \"Argument\" section of his brief reads: \"The district court erred in failing to apply strict scrutiny to Missouri's efforts to regulate\n   <em>\n    uncompensated volunteers\n   </em>\n   as lobbyists.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (emphasis added). Calzone's failure to include a narrower as-applied challenge in his statement of the issues waived the argument.\n   <em>\n    United States v. O'Neal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1830241\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/17/239/\">\n    17 F.3d 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 243 n.8 (8th Cir. 1994) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And even if the issue had been stated, a passing reference to the absence of lobbying expenditures in the argument section of his opening brief is insufficient to present a legal issue for review.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Durham D &amp; M, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3678184\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/606/513/\">\n    606 F.3d 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 515 n.2 (8th Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Even where the record factually supports what might be a better legal argument for reversal, it is not our place to raise it for a litigant who forfeits and waives the contention.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v.

Deciding the case based on an argument that was not properly raised either in the district court or on appeal would be unfair to the district court, which had no occasion to decide it, and to the state of Missouri, which had no reason to address it. And with no adversarial briefing on the question, this court is not in a good position to ensure that it is resolved correctly. Of course, the \"entire case is before us,\"\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   at 953, but what constitutes the \"entire case\" depends on what arguments were properly preserved in the district court and properly raised on appeal. Accordingly, we analyze only the as-applied challenge as to unpaid lobbyists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Before\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   and its progeny established the exacting review standard for disclosure statutes, this Court held that requiring lobbyists to register their activities was a compelling state interest that satisfied the strict scrutiny standard.\n   <em>\n    Minn.

As we established earlier, the appropriate level of scrutiny is now exacting scrutiny, which is a lesser standard than strict scrutiny. Thus, rather than having a compelling interest, the government need only have a sufficiently important interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swanson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514810\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/864/#p874\">\n    692 F.3d at 874-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the interest in lobbyists registering their activities is a compelling interest, then it is certainly also a sufficiently important interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   However, Calzone argues that the interest in having lobbyists register should apply only to paid lobbyists. He asserts that we should distinguish\n   <em>\n    Harriss\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Minnesota State Ethical Practices Board v. NRA\n   </em>\n   from this case because those cases dealt with paid lobbyists and the government does not have a sufficient interest in having unpaid lobbyists like him register. This is a novel argument that presents an issue of first impression in the federal courts. But, upon reviewing existing case law, we find that the government retains a sufficiently important governmental interest in registering lobbyists whether the lobbyist is paid or unpaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    NRA\n   </em>\n   , we held that the activity that warranted requiring the NRA's executive director to register and report as a lobbyist was his mailing of letters to Minnesota residents urging them to vote a specific way.\n   <em>\n    NRA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"29535\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/761/509/#p512\">\n    761 F.2d at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Though the lobbyists may not be receiving money, unpaid lobbyists could still offer things of value to legislators, creating a sufficiently important governmental interest in avoiding the fact or appearance of public corruption.

We further find that the burden of these requirements does not outweigh Missouri's interest in transparency. In fact, these requirements are minimal, imposing a very slight burden on those required to register and report. The registration process takes little time, effort, and money to complete, and those requirements, respectively, need only be completed in the months or years in which Calzone actually engages in lobbying activities. Moreover, this legislative scheme is precisely that which we have previously held would satisfy the substantial relationship test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swanson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514810\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/864/#p874\">\n    692 F.3d at 876-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, Calzone would have an even easier time producing the lobbying reports than most because the reports simply require Calzone to make statements regarding expenditures related to his lobbying activities, Mo. Rev. Stat. 105.473(3), which he claims he does not engage in. Because the statute directly furthers Missouri's interest in transparency and the burden placed on Calzone is not disproportionate to that interest, we find that the statute is substantially related to Missouri's sufficiently important governmental interest.

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 105.470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(c). But let us be clear about what, exactly, Missouri means by \"lobbying.\" Calzone is a Missouri citizen who speaks to legislators. No one pays him to do so, and he does not pay anyone in connection with his activities. To be sure, Calzone created a nonprofit \"alter ego,\" as Missouri characterizes it, to amplify his voice. But even so, Calzone is not who we typically think of as a lobbyist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The court insists on ignoring the fact that Calzone does not spend money on his advocacy efforts based on a crabbed reading of his complaint and motion for injunctive relief. In my view, we cannot overlook Calzone's lack of expenditures because it has been a piece of his as-applied challenge to Missouri's lobbying-disclosure law all along.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The meat of Calzone's as-applied challenge has always been, as one might expect,\n   that Missouri cannot constitutionally apply its registration and reporting requirements to\n   <em>\n    him\n   </em>\n   . It simply is not true, as the court claims, that Calzone raised the issue of expenditures for the first time at oral argument. Beginning with his appearance before the Missouri Ethics Commission and continuing with his complaint in the district court, memorandum in support of his motion for a permanent injunction, stipulation of facts, briefing to this court, and oral argument, the record is stuffed full of references to Calzone's lack of expenditures, leaving no doubt that a key piece of his argument is that he does not give money or gifts to legislators.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court and Missouri were on notice that Calzone's constitutional argument folds in\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   his lack of compensation and his lack of expenditures, and so are we. Just because Calzone's lack of compensation is the lede does not mean that we get to bury the rest of the story.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The procedural posture provides us with yet another clue about the scope of our review. The district court's denial of a permanent injunction is just one ingredient\n   of Calzone's appeal. The other is the court's decision to enter final judgment against him. By dismissing Calzone's complaint, the court rejected his request for a declaration that Missouri's lobbying-disclosure law is unconstitutional as applied to him, an individual who, as his complaint makes clear, neither is paid nor pays anyone else in connection with his advocacy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verified Complaint 1, 12 (stating that \"[Calzone] does not give legislators any gifts\" and requesting declaratory relief).

Although Calzone presents an as-applied challenge, which prevents us from considering other potential challengers to Missouri's law, the scope of the law is far-reaching. It does not appear to treat a member of a religious or civic organization who has been \"designated\" to attend a \"Lobby Day\" any differently from Calzone, who advocates on behalf of Missouri First.

Indeed, a political adversary, an unscrupulous government official, or even a legislator tired of being held accountable could simply submit a complaint to the Commission\n   accusing a politically active citizen of lobbying-that is, speaking out-without first registering as a lobbyist.

For example, if a so-called unpaid lobbyist filled a position of trust as a representative fiduciary of another party, the state could assert an interest in regulating the relationship to prevent exploitation or self-dealing, much like with attorneys. But Missouri has neither asserted nor tailored its law to serve such an interest here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
