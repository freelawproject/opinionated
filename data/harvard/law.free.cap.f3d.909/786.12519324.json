The eleven plaintiffs here all filed for these benefits, and they all eventually received them. The trouble, however, is that they were represented in their efforts by Eric Conn, a Kentucky attorney who secured benefits for his clients by submitting fraudulent reports to the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\"). An Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"), David Daugherty, also participated in the scheme by taking\n   bribes from Conn to assign Conn's cases to himself and issue favorable rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nearly ten years after the SSA first learned of Conn's and Daugherty's possible wrongdoings, it initiated efforts to \"redetermine\" plaintiffs' eligibility for benefits. The SSA held new hearings before new ALJs to determine plaintiffs' entitlement to benefits as of the date of their original applications-i.e., seven to ten years earlier. During the redetermination process, the SSA disregarded all medical evidence submitted by the four doctors participating in Conn's scheme on the ground that such evidence was tainted by fraud. Plaintiffs had no opportunity to rebut the agency's assertion of fraud as to this medical evidence. Ultimately, all plaintiffs were deemed ineligible for SSDI and SSI benefits as of the date of their original applications, and their benefits were terminated. After exhausting all administrative remedies, plaintiffs brought suit in federal district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The eleven cases presented in this consolidated appeal appeared before three different district judges. Though the precise nature of their claims somewhat varied, all plaintiffs alleged that the SSA's procedures and actions violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), and the Social Security Act. We now hold that the plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on their due-process claim, the SSA is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs' claims under the Social Security Act, and the SSA is not entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs' claims under the APA. We therefore\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the district court's judgment in cases numbered 17-5206, 17-5211, 17-5212, 17-5213, 17-5214, 17-5215, 17-5216, and\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   in part,\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   in part, and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings consistent with this opinion in cases numbered 17-5598 and 17-5614.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The SSDI and SSI programs provide disability benefits to individuals with physical or mental impairments that preclude them from working.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20423\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(A), 1382c(a)(3)(B). The eleven plaintiffs in this consolidated appeal had each applied for SSDI and/or SSI benefits between June 2006 and October 2008, and their applications were initially denied. Either before or after these initial denials, each plaintiff retained Eric Conn, a Kentucky attorney, to assist with the application process. With Conn's counsel, each plaintiff then submitted a timely request for a hearing before an ALJ. In each of these cases, the plaintiff's application included medical records from one of four examining doctors-Bradley Adkins, Ph.D., Srinivas Ammisetty, M.D., Frederic Huffnagle, M.D., or David P. Herr, D.O. And in each of these cases, ALJ David Daugherty relied exclusively on the doctors' medical opinions to conclude on the record (i.e., without holding a hearing) that plaintiffs were disabled and thereby entitled to either SSI or SSDI benefits. In particular, in each case Daugherty's discussion of his determination to award benefits read, more-or-less verbatim, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Having considered all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the information provided by Dr. [Adkins, Ammisetty, Huffnagle, or Herr] most accurately reflects the claimant's impairments and limitations. Therefore, the claimant is limited to less than sedentary work at best.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   After considering the evidence of record, the undersigned finds that the claimant's medically determinable impairment could reasonably be expected to produce the alleged symptoms, and that the\n   claimant's statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are generally credible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , 16-cv-53 (Blackburn), R. 26-1 (Ex. 6A, Daugherty Decision at 3) (Page ID #281).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to the SSA, plaintiffs' change of fortune was not coincidental. Instead, SSA alleges that Conn, Daugherty, and the four doctors identified above were engaged in a widespread scheme to secure SSI and SSDI benefits for Conn's clients based on fraudulent disability applications. SSA Br. at 12-15. The scheme, according to the SSA, worked like this: Conn created a limited number of template Residual Functional Capacity (\"RFC\") forms, which he or attorneys in his office filled out ahead of time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20423\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to the Senate Report, a shredding company sent Conn an invoice on June 23, 2011 for the destruction of more than 26.5 thousand pounds of documents for the Conn Law Firm, which is, according to the Report, the equivalent of 2.65 million sheets of paper.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122.

The OIG referral stated only that the OIG had reason to believe that a small portion of the four physicians' reports-the RFC forms-had been fraudulently prepared, 16-cv-154 (Hicks), R. 10-1 (OIG Letter) (Page ID #146), yet the SSA disregarded\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   evidence signed by Adkins, Ammisetty, Huffnagle, or Herr and submitted by the Conn Law Firm between January 2007 and May 2011,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 16-cv-154 (Hicks), R. 20-4 (Notice of Appeals Council Action at 2) (Page ID #340). The SSA's rule therefore excludes a wide range of materials that the OIG never claimed to have \"a reason to believe\" were tainted by fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The divergence between the material identified by the OIG and the material excluded by the SSA highlights the danger of the SSA's approach. Not only are the OIG's assertions of fraud unreviewable, but the SSA's application of those assertions is unreviewable. Currently, the SSA asserts that it has \"reason to believe\" that all reports signed by Adkins, Ammisetty, Huffnagle, and Herr and submitted by Conn between January 2007 and May 2011 contained fraud. But what if the SSA instead declared that all reports signed by the four doctors-regardless of whether they were submitted by Conn-were tainted by fraud? What would preclude the SSA from interpreting the OIG's referral this broadly? In effect, the SSA insists that it may unilaterally select the criteria for fraud (based on vague statutory guidance) and then unilaterally select which evidence satisfies those criteria. With no adversarial input and no judicial oversight, the risk that nonfraudulent material will be erroneously excluded is impermissibly high.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The dissent essentially argues that the \"reason to believe\" standard is \"nearly irrebuttable,\" and therefore due process affords plaintiffs no entitlement to attempt to rebut it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dissent at 821-22. We see things differently. The considerable liberties that the SSA has taken in interpreting and administering the \"reason to believe\" standard advocate in favor of a procedural check, not against it. In extolling the virtues of the non-adversarial \"reason to believe\" determination, the dissent draws an analogy to the Supreme Court's approval of a non-adversarial probable cause determination in criminal cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dissent at 820-21 (discussing\n   <em>\n    Kaley v.

Yet in criminal cases the same question underlies the initial probable cause determination and the ultimate issue at trial: whether the defendant committed the crime. Here, however, the question of whether there is \"reason to\n   believe\" that materials were tainted by fraud is distinct from the later question of eligibility for benefits. Once the SSA has determined that there is \"reason to believe\" a possible fraud occurred, access to a class of evidence is forever foreclosed to a beneficiary in his subsequent redetermination hearing. No such negative consequence follows from a non-adversarial finding of probable cause in criminal cases because it \"determines only whether adequate grounds exist to proceed to trial and reach that [same] question.\"\n   <em>\n    Kaley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701995\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/320/#p338\">\n    571 U.S. at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701995,12578270\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1090/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The SSA nevertheless argues that it does not matter much whether nonfraudulent material is wrongly disregarded because the likelihood of a wrongful benefit determination remains low. SSA Br. 38-41. In support, the SSA notes that plaintiffs may submit new evidence showing the same facts as the excluded reports.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39. But plaintiffs persuasively argue that this procedural protection may be of little practical value for most claimants affected by Conn's scheme. Conn failed to turn in claimants' medical files once their cases were assigned to Daugherty and then seemingly destroyed a great deal of the files when news of his misconduct began to break, Senate Report at 122; 16-cv-154 (Hicks), R. 22-1 (Slone Aff. \u00b6 3) (Page ID #1082), and it is understandably difficult to obtain new evidence of past disability. The SSA notes that plaintiffs did, for the most part, supplement their files with new evidence during the redetermination process. SSA Br. at 39. But simply because they fought on with whatever means remained available does not imply that they were not disadvantaged by their inability to contest the SSA's denial of their use of the reports. For similar reasons, the SSA's claim, which the dissent wholeheartedly embraces,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dissent at 819-20, 821-22, that the excluded medical reports are relatively insignificant because they were never supposed to receive controlling weight in the benefits determination also fails,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SSA Br. at 39-41. Even if the excluded reports would generally not override contrary evidence from treating physicians,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2), they could nevertheless corroborate other evidence in the file and potentially tip the scales toward a favorable determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The remaining two\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factors also favor plaintiffs. The Supreme Court has long recognized that social security disability beneficiaries have a substantial interest in receiving their benefits, as \"the hardship imposed upon the erroneously terminated disability recipient may be significant.\"\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    424 U.S. at 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, plaintiffs provide some evidence as to precisely how significant the hardship is: upon losing her benefits, Hicks moved into a camper without a bathroom and signed up for food stamps, and her depression worsened. 16-cv-154 (Hicks), R. 49-1 (Hicks Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4, 6) (Page ID #1629-30). In addition, upon termination of their benefits, plaintiffs became liable for significant overpayment liabilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7 (Page ID #1630) (noting Hicks received a letter from the SSA saying that she owes $62,000 in overpayment). SSA contends that plaintiffs could mitigate the hardship associated with losing their benefits by (1) applying for new benefits, and (2) applying for a waiver of overpayment. SSA Br. at 30-31. But, as the district court in\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   noted, \"filing an entirely new application or defending past payments is itself a burden,\" 16-cv-154 (Hicks), R. 36 (Mem. Op. &amp; Order at 24) (Page ID #1351), and three of the plaintiffs' applications for new benefits have already been denied, SSA Reply Br. at 13 n.6. With respect to waivers, the SSA has declined to provide blanket overpayment amnesty to plaintiffs or other Conn clients, which renders the threat of overpayment\n   penalties a distinct and troubling possibility for most plaintiffs. Pls. Br. at 41. (The SSA has approved waiver requests for four plaintiffs, and one plaintiff's overpayment penalty was discharged in bankruptcy. SSA Reply Br. at 13 n.6.) Further, there is a distinct dignitary harm to beneficiaries who are not allowed to effectively dispute the allegation that they have been receiving undeserved benefits for close to ten years, leeching government resources to which they had no right. This harm remains even if overpayment is waived. The dissent trivializes all of the above hardships,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dissent at 816-17, contributing to its skewed\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   balancing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As to the government's interest in avoiding additional procedures, the SSA's position boils down to arguments about cost and administrative burden. The SSA believes plaintiffs' requested procedure would require an ALJ to hold a hearing in which an OIG agent would \"testif[y] about how he came to believe that here was fraud in part of [the plaintiffs'] file[s],\" and the plaintiffs would \"cross-examine[ ] the agent and present[ ] evidence to show why [their medical reports] were all true.\" SSA Br. at 33 (quoting 16-cv-154 (Hicks), R. 36 (Mem.

The SSA contends that such a process would be \"extraordinarily burdensome\" and would \"infringe on law enforcement efforts concerning the fraud scheme\" because it would require ALJs to review the sufficiency and merits of the OIG's investigatory efforts. SSA Br. at 33-34. The SSA further argues that additional procedures would frustrate Congress's efforts to ensure that redeterminations occur quickly, as evidenced by the requirement that SSA \"immediately redetermine\" benefits upon developing a \"reason to believe\" that fraud was involved in the initial application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (u) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   These arguments are not compelling. We are particularly unpersuaded by the SSA's timing claims, given that the SSA waited nearly ten years after first learning about possible misconduct involving Conn and Daugherty to initiate redetermination proceedings. It seems disingenuous now to claim that plaintiffs should receive fewer procedural protections because the SSA is statutorily obligated to move quickly. Nor do we believe that \"forcing OIG investigators to testify in over 1,500 redetermination hearings\" would be particularly onerous given that SSA investigators would have to do the same thing if they developed a \"reason to believe\" fraud existed in 1,500 applications for benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SSA Reply Br. at 18;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (u). If anything, the burden might be greater on the SSA investigators, as it is more likely that whatever fraud they uncover involves a single beneficiary,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SSA Reply Br. at 40, and therefore they would not benefit from the economies of scale that might exist in redeterminations spawned from OIG investigations. The dissent attacks a straw man of \"complex evidentiary hearings into wide-ranging fraud schemes\" in which \"officials [ ] spend inordinate time testifying over and over again about that Inspector General's investigation into the Conn fraud.\" Dissent at 817. Yet if the application of the \"reason to believe\" standard is as formulaic as the dissent elsewhere claims, there is no reason such extensive testimony would be required. And although we do hold that the current state of affairs fails to afford beneficiaries due process, we have not mandated the particular ameliorative procedures that the SSA and dissent assume and bemoan. This district court, for example, proposed a considerably less painful adversarial procedure than the travails described by the dissent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   16-cv-154, R. 36 (Mem.

Finally, if the SSA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   is concerned about interfering with ongoing law enforcement efforts, the SSA may secure a certification, in writing, from a state or federal prosecutor with jurisdiction over the investigations saying that the redeterminations would \"jeopardize the criminal prosecution of a person involved in a suspected fraud,\" and the redetermination proceedings would halt.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (u)(1)(A).

First, plaintiffs contend that the redetermination hearings, which were required to comply with the APA's requirements for formal adjudications, did not in fact do so. The SSA, in turn, argues that the redetermination hearings necessarily complied with the APA's formal-adjudication requirements because they conformed to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), and the requirements of \u00a7 405(b)(1) and the APA's formal-adjudication provisions are coterminous. SSA Reply Br. at 36-37. Second, the SSA insists that plaintiffs' actual challenge is that \"they did not receive a hearing on OIG's reason to believe that fraud was involved in the applications for benefits,\" and plaintiffs' claim therefore must fail because the OIG's fraud determination is not governed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and therefore need not conform to the APA requirements for formal adjudications.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    at 37-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The SSA's first argument is somewhat hard to follow.

To shunt it aside, or to relegate it to an afterthought, or to focus on so-called \"long-standing principles of procedural due process that predate the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   test,\" baldly defies longstanding foundational Supreme Court precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The plaintiffs' attempt to shift the focus from the application of rock-solid precedent suggests that plaintiffs anticipate losing under that precedent. Indeed, plaintiffs do inexorably lose under the\n   <em>\n    Mathews v. Eldridge\n   </em>\n   test. First, while the plaintiffs' property interest in continued benefits is certainly substantial, the district court in\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   gave considerable reasons why that harm is categorically limited.\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   makes clear that this weight-of-the-property-interest factor is to be determined categorically, that is, by the nature of the benefits rather than by the individual harm that one plaintiff may suffer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    424 U.S. at 340-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the government has an obviously strong interest in not erroneously restoring Social Security benefits on the basis of evidence from fraudsters. Apart from the dollar loss, the value of the integrity of the administration of government benefits-and the popular perception of integrity-is\n   enormous. Finally, the factual accuracy of eligibility redeterminations is only minimally enhanced by the additional procedural protection sought by plaintiffs and awarded below in\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   . The procedure sought is to require the agency to consider evidence provided by a lawyer and doctor who together have concededly engaged in wholesale fraud against the same agency for the same type of benefits, unless the agency can show that they acted fraudulently\n   <em>\n    with respect to the particular claimant\n   </em>\n   . It is fanciful to think that this protection will significantly improve the accuracy of eligibility redeterminations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The court below in\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   , concededly \"avoid[ing]\" the\n   <em>\n    Mathews v. Eldridge\n   </em>\n   analysis for the major part of its opinion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hicks v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271827\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/214/627/#p630\">\n    214 F.Supp.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 630-41 (E.D. Ky. 2016), boils procedural due process down to an over-simplified principle (\"[w]hen the government asserts a fact about someone and that affects her rights, due process provides her a chance to challenge the assertion,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271827\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/214/627/#p630\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 634 ), and then uses the \"naked eye\" to apply that principle in a way that cannot be reconciled with the analysis mandated by\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   . Here is how this simplification leads to the wrong conclusion: The purported essence of procedural due process is the ability to challenge facts affecting a plaintiff's rights. Whether there is \"reason to believe\" the prior application was fraudulent is a fact affecting each plaintiff's rights because without it there would have been no redeterminations of eligibility in the first place. Ergo, each plaintiff is entitled to challenge whether there was fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Such reasoning elides the whole carefully wrought structure of procedural due process. Standard due process analysis requires a clear identification of a property interest and the application of the\n   <em>\n    Mathews v. Eldridge\n   </em>\n   analysis to the deprivation of\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   interest. In this case there are two determinations, by two different administrative bodies, that affect two distinct interests. First there is the decision that eligibility must be redetermined, and second is the question of eligibility itself. There is no property or liberty interest in the first. The statute provides for a redetermination in certain circumstances that are independent of whether a claimant is eligible for benefits (\"reason to believe\" fraud on the part of the lawyer and doctor). There is no more a protected property interest in avoiding a redetermination in these circumstances than had the statute provided for random redeterminations or for redeterminations scheduled on a three-year interval. Indeed, plaintiffs do not claim to have a property interest in avoiding a redetermination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, even though the decision to redetermine is obviously a precondition to losing benefits, and therefore \"affects her rights\" in a colloquial sense, it does not affect the actual determination of eligibility for benefits, which is the property interest properly identified in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Here, following ample notice, an administrative law judge terminated plaintiffs' disability benefits (the deprivation) because it determined there was not sufficient evidence of disability in the medical records initially submitted with the application, the new evidence submitted by plaintiffs, and any testimony given (the evidence) after hearing argument from plaintiffs and their counsel (the opportunity to challenge the evidence). That is textbook due process. The question is whether due process requires even more-specifically, an opportunity for plaintiffs to challenge the Inspector General's \"reason to believe\" that fraud was involved in their original applications, so that they might use the evidence excluded because of that belief. A straightforward balance of the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factors says no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Private Interest at Stake.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   As\n   <em>\n    Mathews v. Eldridge\n   </em>\n   itself makes clear, it is the general nature of the harm, and the types of relief that are generally available, that fix the weight of the property interest at stake.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    424 U.S. at 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Giving short shrift to\n   <em>\n    Mathews v. Eldridge\n   </em>\n   makes it easier for plaintiffs to focus on the particular harms to particular plaintiffs resulting from adverse disability determinations. Instead, viewing in generality the stakes to plaintiffs as a class, as the district court below in\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   thoughtfully examined, this interest is substantial, but not as substantial as, for instance, the loss of welfare benefits in\n   <em>\n    Goldberg v. Kelly\n   </em>\n   , and of course not nearly so portentous as the detention in\n   <em>\n    Hamdi\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Here the parties agree that the property interest being deprived is the continued receipt of Social Security by an eligible recipient. But any plaintiff suffering from a current disability can establish a new forward-looking entitlement by filing a new application for benefits. If successful, those monthly payments should make up for the lost benefits going forward. All plaintiffs were informed of this right to submit new applications when they received unfavorable redetermination decisions, and five of the seven plaintiffs who have taken advantage of this right have been approved for benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Plaintiffs may also apply for a waiver of overpayment, so long as they were not at fault for the fraudulent aspects of their prior application and collection of past payments would be inequitable. If granted, an overpayment waiver would relieve plaintiffs of having to pay back the years of benefits they had received before termination, otherwise one of the harshest consequences of an unfavorable redetermination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.501\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -.502a, 404.506-.512. On a request for a waiver, it is the Commissioner's burden to prove fault, so every plaintiff unaware of the prior fraud should qualify. To this point, waivers have been granted to 98% of Conn-related beneficiaries who have requested one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Together, an overpayment waiver coupled with a new, prospective benefits award drastically reduce the hardship of deprivation by allowing plaintiffs to retain earlier monthly payments and ensuring continuous benefits save only for the (likely short) period between the end of the old benefits and beginning of the new ones.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of course, these mitigators are not guaranteed-an applicant must qualify for disability benefits to receive a new award and be without fault to obtain a waiver. But the\n   likelihood in general that a genuinely eligible recipient\n   <em>\n    wrongfully\n   </em>\n   stripped of benefits will not be able to prove her current disability is small.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   These protections are readily available to nearly every plaintiff who would benefit from the additional process sought-and it is those plaintiffs that our inquiry must focus on. These mitigators are not enough to zero out plaintiffs' interest in the receipt of their benefits, but they do go a long way in reducing the degree of deprivation created by an erroneous eligibility determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Public Interests at Stake\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   On the other side of the scale rest the weighty public interests in a functioning disability benefits regime free from the taint of fraud and from overly burdensome and costly procedures. Most obviously, there is an enormous public interest in avoiding the taint of fraud on determinations by one of the largest and most significant government benefits programs in the United States. Confidence in the integrity of the system of awarding benefits is crucial to public acceptance of the statutorily imposed obligation of almost all working Americans to pay Social Security taxes on their income. Permitting the award of benefits based on evidence provided by a doctor through a lawyer to an ALJ when all three have concededly conspired, at least in other cases, to defraud the Social Security disability benefits system obviously undermines confidence in the system. Avoiding this is a substantial public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   There are also significant administrative costs. As was the case in\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   , the \"most visible burden would be the incremental cost resulting from the increased number of hearings.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    424 U.S. at 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Significantly, that cost would \"come out of the pockets of the deserving since resources available for any particular program of social welfare are not unlimited.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    at 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That burden would be even greater here, where the hearings sought are not run-of-the-mill benefits determinations (which are already provided), but complex evidentiary hearings into wide-ranging fraud schemes. Hearings of this sort would require officials to spend inordinate time testifying over and over again about that Inspector General's investigation into the Conn fraud-time not spent investigating other Social Security frauds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   What is more, grafting these sorts of evidentiary mini-trials onto the redetermination\n   process would thwart Congress's objective of redetermining benefits effectively and immediately. The redetermination process was created to protect the agency from the lasting effects of benefits frauds. But to undo Congress's evidentiary restriction would serve to introduce categorically unreliable evidence back into the redetermination process and risk re-exposing the agency to the continuing effects of fraud. Congress had large-scale frauds like this in mind when it crafted a \"streamlined procedure enabling the [Commissioner] ... to expeditiously terminate fraudulently obtained [disability] benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   140 Cong. Rec. H4750-03 (1994) (Stmt. of Rep. Pickle). As did the Commissioner in implementing Congress's statutory design. We should be loath to substitute our own policy considerations for those unquestionably better suited-and constitutionally empowered-to make them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    424 U.S. at 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the burden of additional evidentiary hearings cannot be prohibitively heavy considering that the Commissioner provides similar hearings when agency staff-and not the Inspector General-has reason to believe fraud was involved in an application. But the Commissioner's argument does not hinge on the proposition that it would be impossible to provide the hearings, merely that the cost of doing so in these circumstances outweighs the benefits gained. Moreover, the Commissioner has good reason for treating those two scenarios differently-where a law enforcement entity like the Inspector General investigates and forms a reason to believe that fraud occurred, the cost of challenging that determination is higher and the benefit much lower. That is, in part, because Inspector General investigations are often much larger and more complex than their non-law-enforcement counterparts, and also because determinations by a law enforcement entity with investigative expertise serve as a check against arbitrariness and are less likely to be rebutted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Risk of Erroneous Deprivation\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   Under a proper application of the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   balancing test, the additional procedure sought-the ability to present evidence from fraud-tainted sources-is hardly likely to reduce the risk of wrongful deprivation of the (properly identified) property interest at stake-continued receipt of eligible disability benefits. Once again, giving short shrift to the standard procedural due process analysis leads the analysis astray, here by permitting exaggeration of the risk of erroneous deprivation. Once the property interest at issue is properly identified as the loss of disability benefits, and not the avoidance of a redetermination or the use of certain evidence, it becomes clear that little increase in accuracy would result from considering evidence provided by Conn and one of the four conspiring doctors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In evaluating the risk of erroneous deprivation, we start by evaluating the current administrative process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    424 U.S. at 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The process in place is intuitive and robust. After the Inspector General notified the Commissioner that it had reason to believe that fraud was involved in the applications of some 1,787 applicants formerly represented by Conn, the Administration's Appeals Council internally reviewed each case to determine whether, disregarding the tainted evidence, the record supported the original award. Some two hundred and fifty applications contained sufficient evidence and were unaffected. For the remainder, including plaintiffs, the Appeals Council found insufficient evidence of disability and notified those individuals that further proceedings were required. Those individuals were notified that they could submit new evidence for a second review by the Appeals\n   Council. Following that second review, the cases were submitted to administrative law judges for further evidence gathering, which the Commissioner was statutorily obligated to assist with. Given the time lapse, plaintiffs were permitted to submit new, after-the-fact evidence in lieu of historical medical records so long as the new evidence was relevant to the existence of a disability at the time of the original application. After all of that additional evidence gathering, administrative law judges conducted individualized hearings-at which plaintiffs could testify and were represented by counsel-to determine whether there was sufficient evidence of disability. All told, about 55% of recipients whose Conn-related redeterminations are complete have received favorable decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   That is a lot of process. More importantly, it is process designed to minimize the risk that deserving applicants will be wrongly stripped of benefits. Two key features are worth emphasizing. First, the administrative law judge reviews anew all of the evidence from the original application, save only for the single report submitted by one of the crooked doctors. That review is significant because the Commissioner is statutorily charged during the initial stages of review (of the original application) to assist in \"develop[ing] a complete medical history\" of at least the twelve months preceding the application, including by scheduling consultative examinations where needed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20423\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5)(A), (B) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1512\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The existing case file, then, should paint a detailed picture of the applicant's disability at the time of the initial determination-the very thing at issue on redetermination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Second, the opportunity to submit new evidence enables plaintiffs to fill in any gaps left open in the existing case file and to provide substitute evidence for any truthful information contained in the excluded reports. Of course, given the lapse of time, it may sometimes prove difficult to find substitute evidence, but those difficulties are eased in two significant ways. First, the earlier development of the case file means that the most relevant medical records should already be available to the administrative law judge. Second, where older records are unavailable, recipients may develop and submit new evidence, along with authority (expert testimony or otherwise) that such evidence bears on the relevant period. For example, a recipient, like Hicks, suffering from a cognitive disability could take an IQ test today and submit the results as evidence of prior disability, since intellectual capabilities generally remain stable throughout life,\n   <em>\n    see Program Op. Manual Sys.\n   </em>\n   (POMS) DI 24515.055;\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276283\" index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/606/\">\n    792 F.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 620 n.4 (6th Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the risk of an erroneous deprivation (from excluding evidence from a tainted combination of sources) is too high because there is too great a risk that, in any one case, the Inspector General might have had no \"reason to believe\" fraud was involved-meaning evidence was excluded that should not have been. But again, this conflates the risk of wrongfully excluding evidence with the risk of wrongfully terminating benefits. Plaintiffs have a protected interest in only the latter, and the risk of wrongfully excluding evidence is relevant only as it raises a serious risk of wrongfully terminating benefits-and in most cases it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   That is because the one-off reports by non-treating physicians that were excluded are weak evidence as a matter of agency regulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under those regulations, controlling\n   weight can only be given to evidence from treating physicians.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). None of the excluded reports were from treating physicians; they were from one-time examining doctors and were probative only to the extent that they were consistent with the plaintiffs' overall medical records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4). Moreover, even if there were no showing that the physician engaged in fraud with respect to the particular plaintiff, the fact that-as plaintiffs appear to concede-the lawyer, ALJ, and doctors had otherwise conspired in at least some other cases to commit Social Security fraud would-permissibly, and doubtless drastically-reduce their credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Thus, it is simply wrong to say that the exclusion virtually decides the ultimate issue of eligibility. Plaintiffs observe that because they were successful in their initial applications, when they had the reports, and only failed on redetermination, without them, they must be dispositive. But that observation forgets another, rather important, distinction: plaintiffs' original applications were granted by an administrative law judge on the Conn payroll who rubberstamped every application sent his way regardless of the evidence. The point is that any neutral administrative law judge to consider the reports on redetermination would be bound by regulation to afford them little, if any-and in no case, controlling-probative value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Even assuming the reports might have some probative value, it would remain next to impossible for any plaintiff to rebut the Inspector General's \"reason to believe\" that fraud was involved-meaning any hearing on that question would be of little practical worth. The statute requires the Commissioner to \"disregard any evidence if there is reason to believe that fraud or similar fault was involved in the providing of such evidence.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (u)(1)(B). That is a very low bar. Alternatively, plaintiffs would face a very high bar in showing that no such reason exists. Even compelling evidence to the contrary might well fall short of showing that there was no\n   <em>\n    reason to believe\n   </em>\n   fraud was involved. Plaintiffs would require the Commissioner to provide evidence specifically tying the fraud to their individual applications, but the low bar does not require even that. Evidence of the conspiracy between Conn and the four corrupt doctors already provides \"reason to believe\" that each of the reports those doctors submitted at Conn's behest was tainted by fraud. It is difficult to imagine how any plaintiff could ever show otherwise, considering plaintiffs, as victims, likely do not know whether fraud was involved in their own cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In Congress's view, it is a feature-not a bug-that this standard is so low. Having a \"reason to believe\" is not the end, but rather the beginning of the redetermination process, and a more adversarial determination would defeat the gateway function that the standard serves. It is also the\n   type of determination that can be made reliably by a third party without an adversarial hearing. In\n   <em>\n    Kaley\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the Court held that the adversarial process \"is far less useful to the threshold finding of probable cause,\" which \"by its nature, is hard to undermine, and still harder to reverse.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701995\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/320/#p338\">\n    571 U.S. at 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701995,12578270\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1090/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That Congress set such a standard suggests it intended a non-adversarial determination from the start.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   For its part, the Supreme Court has upheld initial non-adversarial findings by independent third parties as a check\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   arbitrary deprivations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    F.D.I.C. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Gilbert v. Homar\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the Court upheld a state procedure that caused the State to suspend an employee upon learning that the employee was charged with a felony.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653435\" index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/924/#p926\">\n    520 U.S. 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 926-27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653435\" index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/924/#p926\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653435\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/924/#p926\">\n    138 L.Ed.2d 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). Rejecting the argument that due process required a pre-suspension hearing, the Court held that the finding of probable cause and bringing of charges \"by an independent body [the police] demonstrate that the suspension is not arbitrary.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653435\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/924/#p926\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653435\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/924/#p926\">\n    at 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653435\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/924/#p926\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, a third-party finding of fault was enough to trigger the deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest (continued employment), so long as the employee could eventually challenge the ultimate deprivation. The principle applies with even greater force here because the Inspector General's finding does not trigger the deprivation (the termination of benefits), only the redetermination, and like in\n   <em>\n    Gilbert\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs had the opportunity to challenge the ultimate deprivation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In sum, the redetermination inquiry asks whether plaintiffs would have been entitled to disability benefits at the time of their original applications had those applications not included evidence tainted by the possibility of fraud. To answer that question accurately and efficiently, an administrative law judge reviews the original claims file (which presents a snapshot of the claimant's medical condition at the time of her original application) and any newly submitted evidence by claimants or their experts and hears argument and testimony. There is little risk of error in that process-which is even further backstopped by judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Plaintiffs attempt to inject a specter of unpalatable error by citing the risk that outcome-determinative evidence might be wrongfully excluded in any given case. But that risk is practically nonexistent, and not at all improved by the evidentiary hearing sought. First, by regulation the excluded reports are of such little probative value that they could be outcome-determinative in only the rarest of cases. Second, the standard for excluding evidence-a mere \"reason to believe\" fraud was involved-is nearly irrebuttable. The rare cases do not dictate the amount of process constitutionally due. Considering the robust procedural safeguards in place, plaintiffs are not constitutionally entitled to additional, burdensome process with little real-world value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In general, due process does not guarantee a right to present evidence of whatever type and in whatever form a party chooses. Even in the context of a criminal trial, a \"defendant's right to present relevant evidence is not unlimited, but rather is subject to reasonable restrictions.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Scheffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503568\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/303/#p308\">\n    523 U.S. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 308,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503568\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/303/#p308\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503568\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/303/#p308\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). The right to present evidence must accommodate other legitimate interests, and in determining that balance, federal rulemakers enjoy broad latitude under the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503568\" index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/303/#p308\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Here, Congress and the Commissioner balanced plaintiffs' right to introduce evidence with other legitimate interests of ensuring accurate redeterminations based on reliable evidence and facilitating swift, efficient redeterminations in cases of large-scale frauds. In doing so, the federal rulemakers created a blanket prohibition of evidence that the Commissioner or Inspector General has reason to believe is fraudulent and thus unreliable, rather than allow for case-by-case reliability determinations that would be costly and time intensive. To square that prohibition with plaintiffs' right to introduce evidence, the process allows plaintiffs to submit new evidence to substitute for that which was excluded. That approach soundly balances the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Indeed, the evidentiary restriction here is very much like the prohibition of polygraph evidence upheld in\n   <em>\n    Scheffer\n   </em>\n   . There, the Court held that a blanket prohibition on the use of polygraph evidence in military trials was reasonable because there was no scientific consensus on the general reliability of that evidence and because case-by-case reliability determinations would be difficult, if not unworkable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scheffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503568\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/303/#p308\">\n    523 U.S. at 310-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503568\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/303/#p308\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather than allow individual defendants to litigate why\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   polygraph evidence was nonetheless reliable, it was reasonable to exclude that sort of evidence as a matter of course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <em>\n    Scheffer\n   </em>\n   is not distinguishable on the theory that the restriction here depends on a particularized determination that aspects of the plaintiffs' records are tainted by fraud, whereas\n   <em>\n    Scheffer\n   </em>\n   involved a blanket prohibition. Such a purported distinction mistakes the nature of the Inspector General's inquiry and the standard for exclusion. The Inspector General developed the necessary \"reason to believe\" not by engaging in a hyper-particularized analysis of each plaintiff's records but by investigating and uncovering that the four doctors conspired with Conn to submit fraudulent reports. The Commissioner then excluded any reports submitted by one of those doctors at the behest of Conn. The only remotely individualized inquiry was to compile the list of claimants who submitted one of those reports-hardly an exercise requiring adversarial input. In overall function, then, the exclusion here works just like\n   <em>\n    Scheffer's\n   </em>\n   blanket prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   It similarly misses the point to argue, in response, that the evidentiary restriction is unreasonable because it may exclude some evidence that was not fraudulent. Congress is free to (reasonably) exclude-\n   <em>\n    in all cases\n   </em>\n   -categories of evidence that it determines is inherently unreliable, even if that evidence might be trustworthy\n   <em>\n    in some cases.\n   </em>\n   The point is that it is too difficult or time consuming to determine when those cases arise. The Social Security benefits regime incorporates a good example of the principle: by statute, claimants can prove their disability only with evidence incorporating \"medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20423\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3). That limitation reflects a policy choice that it is preferable to demand a certain quality of evidence than to determine case by case whether a claimant's non-qualifying testimony is credible. The idea that some accurate, non-qualifying evidence will not be considered is baked into that evidentiary restriction. So too here. Even if some of the excluded reports contain bits of accurate information, Congress has decided that it is better to exclude all of the tainted evidence than to engage in the hard, if not impossible, work of confidently determining which portions are good evidence and which are bad. There is nothing unreasonable-or unconstitutional-about that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In short, a\n   <em>\n    Mathews v. Eldridge\n   </em>\n   balancing leads inexorably to the conclusion that there is no procedural due process violation in this case. Disregarding in this case the countless Supreme Court holdings that reaffirm\n   <em>\n    Mathews v. Eldridge\n   </em>\n   risks undermining public respect not only for the integrity of the Social Security system, but also for the commitment of the lower courts to follow foundational Supreme Court precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Commissioner's redetermination process also survives the two challenges plaintiffs advance under the Administrative Procedure Act. First, plaintiffs argue that the hearings afforded during redeterminations do not live up to the standards of formal adjudications under the APA. That is a non-starter because redeterminations are not formal adjudications under the APA and thus need not meet those requirements. Regardless of whether they must meet those standards, they do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Second, plaintiffs argue that it is arbitrary and capricious for the Commissioner to allow claimants an opportunity to challenge a \"reason to believe\" finding by the Commissioner, but not one by the Inspector General or another law-enforcement agency. This too fails out of the gate; plaintiffs have forfeited the argument by not developing it below. In any event, because the Commissioner has a non-arbitrary justification for tailoring the procedures according to the genesis of the \"reason to believe\" finding, those procedures are not arbitrary or capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Redeterminations are not formal agency adjudications under the APA and thus need not follow the detailed trial-like procedures the APA requires of formal adjudications.

When there is reason to believe that fraud was involved in a benefits claim, \u00a7 405(u) requires the Commissioner to \"immediately redetermine the entitlement of individuals\" and authorizes the Commissioner to \"terminate such entitlement\" if the \"Commissioner of Social Security determines that there is insufficient evidence to support such entitlement\" \"after redetermining pursuant to this subsection.\" \u00a7 405(u)(1)(A), (3). That statutory language is silent as to what procedural shape redeterminations shall take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   With no \"on the record\" requirement in \u00a7 405(u) -the only statutory language expressly governing redeterminations-plaintiffs are forced to look elsewhere in search of their textual hook. According to plaintiffs, the necessary \"on the record\" requirement appears in \u00a7 405(b)(1), which governs the Commissioner's \"decisions as to the rights of any individual applying for a payment under this subchapter.\" They argue that \u00a7 405(b)(1) compels an \"on the record\" hearing and applies to redeterminations under \u00a7 405(u). Both steps of that syllogism are shaky.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Contrary to plaintiffs' contention, we have not already held that hearings under \u00a7 405(b)(1) are formal adjudications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mullen v.

While we did say as much in a footnote in\n   <em>\n    Mullen\n   </em>\n   , we did so only in dicta. The issue of whether \u00a7 405(b)(1) required an \"on the record\" hearing was not before us then. The Commissioner does not appear to contest this point on appeal, however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Even assuming \u00a7 405(b)(1) determinations are formal adjudications, that subsection does not govern redeterminations under \u00a7 405(u).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 405(b)(1) governs \"decisions as to the rights of any individual applying for a payment under this subchapter.\" But plaintiffs were not \"individual[s] applying for a payment\" at the time of their redeterminations; they were recipients. Section 405(u), on the other hand, authorizes the Commissioner to redetermine disability \"pursuant to this subsection,\" meaning \u00a7 405(u), without any indication that redeterminations are also subject to \u00a7 405(b)(1). Plaintiffs' broader reading fails to account for these textual limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Reading formal-adjudication requirements into \u00a7 405(u) would subvert Congress's purpose in amending the statute to authorize streamlined redeterminations in cases of possible fraud. Even before the statute was amended to provide for redeterminations, the Commissioner was authorized to \"reconsider\" whether a recipient's disability had ceased, was no longer disabling, or ever existed to begin with-but \"only after opportunity for an evidentiary hearing\" that is \"reasonably accessible\" to the recipient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 405(b)(2)(B). It was this reconsideration process that Congress found \"cumbersome and unworkable\" in dealing with potential frauds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Staff of Subcomm. on Oversight of the H. Comm. on Ways &amp; Means, 103rd Cong., Rep. on Reforms to Address Supplemental Security Income Fraud and Abuse Involving Middlemen 7 (Comm. Print 1994). The very essence of \u00a7 405(u) was to provide the Commissioner a quicker, more effective method of redetermining eligibility in cases of possible fraud. It makes no sense that Congress would supplement the existing unworkable procedures with a redetermination process subject to the same procedural hurdles. That reading would render Congress's 1994 addition of the redetermination process meaningless. The better reading is that redeterminations are not subject to the APA's trial-like requirements for formal adjudications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   In any event, the redeterminations here met those requirements. Plaintiffs fault the Commissioner for (1) imposing a \"sanction\" based on evidence outside the record,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20556\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ; (2) not allowing \"such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20556\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; (3) relying on official notice of a material fact not appearing in the record without providing plaintiffs the opportunity to \"show the contrary\" of that material fact,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 556(e) ; and (4) permitting agency employees involved in \"investigative or prosecuting functions\" to \"participate or advise in the [administrative] decision,\" \u00a7 554(d). But each of those complaints fails for much the same analytical reason that plaintiffs' due process challenge fails: each assumes a right to challenge the Inspector General's \"reason to believe\" finding or conflates that finding with the administrative decision at issue-redetermination of entitlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   First, the very same rule that prohibits an agency from imposing a \"sanction\" based on evidence outside the record, requires that the \"agency as a matter of policy shall provide for the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20556\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). In\n   accordance with those rules and Congress's specific mandate in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (u)(1)(B), the tainted evidence was excluded from the record on which the agency terminated plaintiffs' benefits. Thus, even if the termination of benefits can be termed a \"sanction,\" the termination was imposed consistent with \u00a7 556(d), because it was based on \"consideration of the whole record\" before the administrative law judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Second, \u00a7 556(d) requires cross-examination only \"as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts,\" and expressly allows an agency, when \"determining claims for money or benefits,\" to accept only written evidence so long as no party is prejudiced. Plaintiffs do not claim that cross-examination was necessary for a full and true disclosure of the facts concerning the redetermination of their eligibility; they seek to cross-examine the Inspector General about its fraud finding. But plaintiffs are not entitled to any hearing on the Inspector General's finding, much less a formal adjudication, and cross-examination on that finding has nothing to do with a full and true disclosure of the facts considered by the agency in redetermining plaintiffs' eligibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Third, the agency did not rest its redetermination on official notice of any material fact not in the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   To say otherwise is yet again to conflate the Inspector General's finding of fraud with the Commissioner's redetermination of eligibility. The agency did not take notice of the Inspector General's finding of fraud in weighing the evidence properly before it. Upon the Inspector General's referral, the tainted evidence was excluded entirely and automatically by statute. The agency's redetermination of eligibility was based on the record before it, which was completely available to plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Fourth, no one from the Inspector General's office participated or advised in the \"[administrative] decision\" to which plaintiffs would apply the formal-adjudication rules, the redetermination of eligibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20554\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the administrative decision at issue is the redetermination of plaintiffs' eligibility for benefits, which was decided based on the record before the administrative law judge without any participation or advice from the Inspector General. The Inspector General's referral to the Commissioner for independent redeterminations in no way implicates the concerns underlying \u00a7 554(d) -the joining of prosecutor and judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Plaintiffs' remaining APA claim also fails. It is neither arbitrary nor capricious for the Commissioner to shape the agency's internal procedures governing redeterminations according to which entity investigates and finds that there is \"reason to believe\" fraud was involved in an application. Plaintiffs do not argue that the Commissioner lacks the statutory power to\n   establish procedures to carry out redeterminations. Nor could they, for the statute says nothing about the procedures for redeterminations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (u), and instead empowers the Commissioner to \"establish procedures, not inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter, which are necessary or appropriate to carry out such provisions,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 405(a). It is a \"very basic tenet of administrative law that agencies should be free to fashion their own rules of procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2961\" index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/519/#p543\">\n    435 U.S. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 543,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2961\" index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/519/#p543\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2961\" index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/519/#p543\">\n    55 L.Ed.2d 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978). Thus, as plaintiffs appear to concede, so long as the Commissioner has a non-arbitrary justification for tailoring the procedures according to the source of the \"reason to believe\" determination, those procedures survive challenge. Here, such a justification exists: investigations and referrals by the Inspector General-the law-enforcement component deputized to root out benefits frauds-are sufficiently different from ad-hoc findings by the Commissioner or her staff to warrant differing procedural review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   But that puts the cart before the horse. Plaintiffs forfeited their arbitrary-and-capricious challenge by failing to raise it meaningfully below. At most, plaintiffs made two passing references to the so-called arbitrary procedural distinction the Commissioner drew between Inspector General referrals and internal determinations of fraud. That these perfunctory references cite the statute setting out the arbitrary-and-capricious standard does not make up for plaintiffs' failure to develop these arguments as standalone claims. On the contrary, both references were made in support of\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   claims-once in the context of plaintiffs' due process challenge, and again in connection with their formal-adjudications argument. Issues cursorily mentioned without any sort of developed argument are routinely deemed forfeited.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Langley v. Daimler Chrysler Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5525255\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/475/#p483\">\n    502 F.3d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 483 (6th Cir. 2007). Plaintiffs give no reason to look past that forfeiture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Forfeited or not, the challenge fails. The statute makes perfectly clear that the Commissioner is authorized to establish procedures that it deems appropriate for carrying out the redeterminations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"320\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). That \"delegated power, of course, may not be exercised arbitrarily, but its exercise may not be impeached merely because reasonable minds differ on the wisdom\" of a given procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F.C.C. v. Schreiber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169135\" index=\"321\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/381/279/#p292\">\n    381 U.S. 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169135\" index=\"322\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/381/279/#p292\">\n    85 S.Ct. 1459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169135\" index=\"323\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/381/279/#p292\">\n    14 L.Ed.2d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1965). Thus, our task is to ask whether the Commissioner has some non-arbitrary reason for establishing the two sets of procedures, not to weigh for ourselves the competing considerations that went into that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The Commissioner does have a non-arbitrary justification for treating referrals from the Inspector General differently than fraud determinations made by non-investigatory, in-house personnel-namely, the distinct roles and competencies of those decisionmakers. For one, it would impose a significantly greater burden on investigators (than on agency staff or adjudicators) to subject them to countless evidentiary hearings. In part this is because the Inspector General and other law-enforcement officials play no ongoing role in redeterminations after their referral. Thus, to hold evidentiary hearings into their determinations would be to introduce a host of new actors into the redetermination process. And since the Inspector General and law-enforcement agencies are more likely to investigate large-scale frauds, the resulting hearings would often be more complicated and arduous. That is because an understanding of the broader investigation and findings is crucial to reviewing the\n   individual fraud determinations. It makes good sense that the Commissioner would choose not to impose these burdens on the Inspector General, where doing so would divert considerable resources away from the office's statutory mission to investigate and detect benefits fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   In contrast, it is also reasonable for the Commissioner to align redetermination procedures following its own findings of fraud with the procedures required for initial determinations under \u00a7 405(b)(1). By its terms, \u00a7 405(b)(1) governs initial determinations and not redeterminations. But that does not mean the Commissioner acts arbitrarily by fashioning redetermination procedures that borrow from those used in initial determinations. Because \u00a7 405(b)(1) provides for review of the Commissioner's decisions-but not the Inspector General's-it makes sense that redetermination procedures would allow for review of the Commissioner's finding of fraud, but not one by another entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   It is ironic that plaintiffs fault the agency for providing review of its own findings of fault, when that review is merely a substitute for the check that is inherent in Inspector General referrals-a finding of fault by an independent third party. As discussed earlier, the Supreme Court has held that a finding of probable fault by an independent body demonstrates that a resulting deprivation is not arbitrary, \"baseless[,] or unwarranted.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gilbert v.

Apples to apples, the evidentiary exclusion here is like allowing Hamdi a very real and meaningful opportunity to contest before a neutral arbiter his status as an enemy combatant and that he was captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan (and any other fact used to justify his detention)-only requiring that he do so without relying on, say, letters from persons the CIA has reason to believe are affiliated with al-Qaeda, because Congress determined that evidence of that kind is categorically unreliable in determining enemy combatant status.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    One plaintiff, Griffith, experienced no gap in her monthly payments because of the timing of her overpayment waiver and successful new application.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    Departing from the standard analysis for procedural due process also risks the incoherent anomaly of looking at the sought procedural protection as the property interest. The property interest in this case, for instance, is the eligible receipt of disability benefits, not the desired procedural protection of permitting evidence from identified fraudsters. Admitting the evidence is instead a proposed procedure asserted to be required under the\n    <em>\n     Mathews v.

Treating admission of the evidence itself as the protected property interest facilitates unsound reliance on cases like\n    <em>\n     Goldberg\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Hamdi\n    </em>\n    that involved property and liberty interests far weightier than those in\n    <em>\n     Eldridge\n    </em>\n    and this case.

The plaintiff-specific findings are reliably made, in part, because they are deduced from the broader investigation into and discovery of the pattern of submitting fraudulent forms of a particular kind.

But that is not quite right. In its referral, the Inspector General notified the Commissioner of its reason to believe that \"Mr. Conn or his firm submitted pre-completed 'template' Residual Functional Capacity forms purportedly from\" one of the four identified doctors. Along with each of those RFC forms, Conn submitted the evaluation notes of those doctors purporting to be the basis for the (fabricated) conclusions in the RFC forms. Thus, based on the referral, the Commissioner excluded these RFC forms and the accompanying examination notes, which together formed a medical report or opinion. It makes no sense to suggest that the Inspector General did not have reason to believe that the evaluation notes submitted along with and serving as the basis of the conclusions contained in the fabricated RFC forms were similarly tainted by fraud.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    The Commissioner does argue the point that redeterminations under \u00a7 405(u) are not required by \u00a7 405(b)(1),\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Comm'r.
