She timely seeks review of a decision issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), which affirmed an immigration judge's decision pretermitting her application for cancellation of removal and ordering her removed from the United States. She argues (A) that her federal bribery conviction does not constitute a crime involving moral turpitude and (B) that the statutory phrase \"crime involving moral turpitude,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i)(I), is unconstitutionally vague.

A few years later, she provided cash payments to an employee at the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles to influence and reward the employee for issuing identification documents\n   to non-citizens illegally present in the United States. As a result, in 2010, Petitioner pleaded guilty to one count of bribery, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), for which the maximum penalty is 10 years' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Petitioner received a Notice to Appear, charging her with inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i). Through counsel, Petitioner conceded inadmissibility but sought cancellation of removal. An immigration judge ruled that Petitioner's bribery conviction constituted a crime of moral turpitude, rendering her ineligible for cancellation of removal.

Accordingly, we are not persuaded that\n   <em>\n    Boutilier\n   </em>\n   forecloses consideration of whether a crime committed by a non-citizen constitutes a \"crime of moral turpitude\" so as to render her inadmissible. We also note that at least one other circuit has continued,\n   after\n   <em>\n    Boutilier\n   </em>\n   , to analyze on the merits a void-for-vagueness challenge to the phrase \"moral turpitude,\" brought by a non-citizen who was found to be inadmissible.\n   <em>\n    Lagunas-Salgado v.
