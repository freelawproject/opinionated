We thus affirmed the district court's dismissal of plaintiffs' claims that involved any art sales postdating the Copyright Act's effective date of January 1, 1978. We reversed, however, the district court's dismissal of plaintiffs' CRRA claims to the extent they involved sales occurring before January 1, 1978 (but after the CRRA's effective date of January 1, 1977), because those claims are not preempted by federal copyright law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants Sotheby's and eBay have filed applications for attorneys' fees pursuant to Ninth Circuit Rule 39-1.6. They seek fees under the CRRA fee-shifting provision, which mandates a fee award to the \"prevailing party in any action brought under\" the CRRA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20986\">\n    Cal.

We hold that Sotheby's and eBay are entitled to fees under the CRRA fee-shifting provision and refer the applications to the Appellate Commissioner to calculate the amount of fees to be awarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The background of this case is detailed in the panel's opinion. In brief, the California Resale Royalties Act of 1976 (\"CRRA\") required the seller of a work of fine art or the seller's agent to withhold 5% of the sale price and pay it to the artist.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20986\">\n    Cal.

Artists could bring an action to enforce this requirement under the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   If a seller or the seller's agent fails to pay an artist the amount equal to 5 percent of the sale of a work of fine art by the artist or fails to transfer such amount to the Arts Council, the artist may bring an action for damages within three years after the date of sale or one year after the discovery of the sale, whichever is longer. The prevailing party in any action brought under this paragraph shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees, in an amount as determined by the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20986\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 986(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this action against Sotheby's, Christie's, and eBay seeking royalties for resales of artwork dating back to the CRRA's January 1, 1977 effective date.

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The CRRA fee-shifting provision provides: \"The prevailing party in any action brought under this paragraph shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees, in an amount as determined by the court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20986\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). Three features of this provision are significant. First, by using the phrase \"prevailing party,\" this provision grants defendants as well as plaintiffs the opportunity for a fee award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jankey v.

Second, by using the phrase \"shall be entitled,\" fee-shifting under this provision is mandatory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=290%20P.3d%20187\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3931875\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/55/1038/\">\n    55 Cal.4th 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=150%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20191\">\n    150 Cal.Rptr.3d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=290%20P.3d%20187\">\n    290 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   192 ;\n   <em>\n    Hsu v.

And third, the fee-shifting provision was added to the CRRA in 1982,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1982%20Cal.%20Stat.%206434\">\n    1982 Cal.

Civ. Code \u00a7 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). Thus, the only claims that remain pending on remand-those involving sales in 1977-do not fall within the fee-shifting provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs oppose the fee applications on two grounds, arguing that the CRRA fee-shifting provision is unenforceable because it is preempted, and that Sotheby's is not a prevailing party. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Preemption\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the CRRA fee-shifting provision is preempted and unenforceable. They raise two arguments: first, that our opinion in this case rendered the CRRA \"null and void\" and thus there is no surviving attorneys' fees provision to apply; and second, that the 1976 Copyright Act itself preempts the attorneys' fees provision of the CRRA. We disagree with both arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   1. The CRRA fee-shifting provision is not \"null and void\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   According to plaintiffs, our decision in this case means that, as of January 1, 1978 (the effective date of the 1976 Copyright Act), \"the CRRA was null and void and could not thereafter be enforced\" and, accordingly, the 1982 amendments to the CRRA are ineffectual because \"a nonexistent statute cannot be amended.\" This argument misapprehends the effect of our decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides that the \"Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land.\" U.S. Const. art.

The CRRA fee-shifting provision thus applies, and the Copyright Act fee-shifting provision does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   That this action involves only state-law claims distinguishes it from actions brought under both federal law and state law.

A fee award in this circumstance would encompass fees for litigating the federal claim.

It is true that portions of the CRRA are, in effect, dormant-at least unless we reverse our judgment about the preemptive effect of the federal copyright laws, the Supreme Court reverses our judgment for us, or Congress removes the preemptive provision of the 1976 Copyright Act or otherwise recognizes the\n    <em>\n     droit de suite\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Close\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517441\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/894/1061/\">\n     894 F.3d at 1065-66\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (discussing similar proposals).
