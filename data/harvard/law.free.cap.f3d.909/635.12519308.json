For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Corps lacked statutory authority to substitute its own special condition \"in lieu of\" a different special condition imposed by West Virginia as part of its certification of NWP 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We further conclude that, absent completion of the notice-and-comment procedures required by the Clean Water Act, a state cannot waive a special condition previously imposed as part of its certification of a nationwide permit. Because West Virginia did not follow its federally mandated notice-and-comment procedures in waiving another special condition the state imposed as part of its certification of NWP 12, that condition remains a required-but, in this case, unsatisfied-condition of the nationwide permit. Accordingly, we vacate, in their entirety, the Corps' December 22, 2017, Verification and July 3, 2018, Reinstatement authorizing the Pipeline's compliance with NWP 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The 42-inch diameter natural gas Pipeline proposes to run 304 miles through parts of Virginia and West Virginia, crossing the Corps' Pittsburgh, Norfolk, and Huntington Districts. In the Corps' Huntington District, the Pipeline and related access roads propose to cross 591 federal water bodies, including four major rivers (the Elk, Gauley, Greenbrier, and Meadow), three of which are navigable-in-fact rivers regulated by Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (the Elk, Gauley, and Greenbrier).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20403\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Following extensive administrative proceedings, Intervenor Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (\"Mountain Valley\") obtained a certificate from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") to construct and operate the Pipeline.

NWP 12 includes several General Conditions designed to ensure that activities falling under NWP 12 minimally impact water quality, the aquatic environment and adjacent land, and water bodies managed by the Corps.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 45-46 (establishing conditions related to \"adverse effects from impoundments,\" \"soil erosion and sediment controls,\" and \"removal of temporary fills.\"). General Condition 7 provides that, \"No activity may occur in the proximity of a public water supply intake, except where the activity is for the repair or improvement of public water supply intake structures or adjacent bank stabilization.\" J.A. 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As with any other federal Clean Water Act permit, an applicant for a Section 1344(a) permit, like Mountain Valley, \"shall provide the [Corps] a certification from the State in which the discharge originates or will originate,\" unless the state waives, either explicitly or by inaction, its right to independently certify the project.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20325.2\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 325.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(ii).

When, as is the case with NWP 12, a state's certification of the general permit imposes additional \"special conditions,\" the Corps must \"make these special conditions regional conditions of the NWP for activities which may result in a discharge into waters of the United States in that state, unless [the Corps] determines that such conditions do not comply with the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20325.4\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 325.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20325.4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 330.4(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Pursuant to its authority under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), West Virginia imposed, after providing public notice and receiving public comment, several additional \"Special Conditions\" as part of its certification of NWP 12. Relevant to this case are Special Conditions A and C. Special Condition A, in relevant part, provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Individual State Water Quality Certification is required for\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   i. Pipelines equal to, or greater than 36 inches in diameter;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ii. Pipelines crossing a Section 10 river (unless the bore is greater than 100 feet below the stream bed on the Ohio River mainstem, or greater than 50 feet below the stream bed on the Ohio River mainstem, or greater than\n   50 feet below the stream bed on all other Section 10 waters);\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   J.A. 43. And Special Condition C provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Individual stream crossings must be completed in a continuous, progressive manner and within 72 hours during seasonal normal or below normal stream flow conditions. Crossings on the Ohio River, Kanawha River, New River, Monongahela River, and the Little Kanawha River, below the confluence with Hughes Rivers, are exempt from the 72-hour requirements. All stream activities shall be completed as rapidly as possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   J.A. 43-44. Accordingly, under Special Conditions A and C, NWP 12 in West Virginia requires certain pipelines to obtain an individual Section 401 certification (Special Condition A) and limit construction of stream crossings to a 72-hour window, except for certain rivers not at issue in the instant case (Special Condition C). NWP 12 also requires the submission of a pre-construction notification to the Corps if any of seven criteria are met. Given the nature and scope of the Pipeline project, it satisfies several of these conditions. On February 25, 2016, Mountain Valley submitted an NWP 12 pre-construction notification for the Pipeline's 591 water crossings in the Huntington District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To comply with Special Condition A, Mountain Valley applied to the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (the \"State Department\") for an individual water quality certification. On March 23, 2017, the State Department issued a conditional grant of the certification, subject to certain special conditions and the standard 401 conditions. Petitioner Sierra Club timely petitioned this Court for review of the Department's individual certification.\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v. W. Va.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Envtl. Prot.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-1714, ECF No. 3 (4th Cir. June 9, 2017). The State Department then sought voluntary remand with vacatur of its verification with this Court, contending that \"the information used to issue the Section 401 Certification needs to be further evaluated and possibly enhanced\" and that it \"needs to reconsider its antidegradation analysis in the Section 401 Certification.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., ECF No. 42 (4th Cir. Sept. 13, 2017). On October 17, 2017, we granted the motion, vacated the Pipeline's individual water quality certification, and remanded to the State Department pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(d)(3).\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., ECF No. 45 (4th Cir. Oct. 17, 2017). On remand, the State Department purported to waive its requirement that Mountain Valley obtain an Individual 401 Water Quality Certification. Accordingly, Mountain Valley does not have an individual state water quality certification under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On December 22, 2017, the Corps issued the Verification concluding that the Pipeline project meets the criteria of NWP 12, provided Mountain Valley \"compl[ies] with all terms and conditions of the enclosed material and the enclosed special conditions.\" J.A. 1-2. The Verification recognized that Mountain Valley's expected construction timeframe of these crossings would \"take a total of 4-6 weeks to complete, 1-3 weeks for each side of the crossings.\" J.A. 86. Based on consultation with FERC, Mountain Valley plans to use a \"dry open cut\" method to construct the Pipeline through four major, Corps-managed rivers (the Elk, Gauley, Greenbrier, and Meadow), which requires installing cofferdams directing water away from a riverbed construction area to minimize sedimentation and erosion. This \"dry\" open-cut method takes longer than \"wet\" open-cut construction, which involves const\n   ructing a pipeline while water continues to flow over the riverbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On May 22, 2018, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(d)(1), Petitioner Sierra Club moved this Court to stay the Verification on grounds that contrary to the 72-hour limit set forth in Special Condition C, Mountain Valley expected to take four-to-six weeks to construct river crossings for the Pipeline through the Elk, Gauley, Greenbrier, and Meadow Rivers. ECF No. 40. On that same date, the Corps suspended the verification-purportedly as to the four rivers only-in order to \"evaluat[e] the extent of [Mountain Valley's] compliance\" with Special Condition C. J.A. 254. On June 21, 2018, this Court stayed the entire Verification. ECF No. 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On May 30, 2018, the Corps sent a letter to the State Department requesting the State Department's \"views on whether the use of the dry-cut construction method is protective of water quality at the four crossings ...?\" J.A. 256. The Corps further asked if the State \"Department believe[s] that requiring the use of the method is more stringent for protecting water quality than the time requirement in Special Condition C?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The next day, the State Department sent a letter to the Corps stating that it \"believes the use of the 'dry' cut construction method ... is more protective of water quality at each of the crossings\" and \"provides more stringent water quality protections than the time requirement in Special Condition C.\" J.A. 258. The State Department did not notify or solicit feedback from the public in any manner before responding to the Corps' letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On July 3, 2018, the Corps sent the Reinstatement to Mountain Valley \"reinstat[ing] with modifications\" its prior Verification of the Pipeline project's compliance with NWP 12.

Citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20330.5\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) -which provides that the District Engineer has discretionary authority to modify a \"case specific activity's authorization under an NWP\"-the Corps imposed several additional \"special conditions\" in the Reinstatement. In particular, Special Condition 6 provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Construction of each river crossing (Greenbrier River, Gauley River, Elk River and Meadow River) will [be] conducted using the \"dry\" open-cut methodology (water-filled cofferdam approach) to minimize adverse effects to water quality, the aquatic environment, and overall environmental impacts. This Special Condition shall apply in lieu of Special Condition C of the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection's (WVDEP) Section 401 Water Quality Certification (WQC) issued for Nationwide Permit 12 in West Virginia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   J.A. 232. The Reinstatement further noted that, in its Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Pipeline project, FERC concluded that \"the proposed 'dry' method is preferred [to the 'wet' method] and thus found this method to be 'acceptable.' \" J.A. 229. And the Reinstatement emphasized that the State Department also determined that the use of the \"dry\" cut construction \"is more protective of water quality at each of the crossings of the Gauley, Greenbrier, Elk, and Meadow Rivers\" as such techniques \"generally provide better control of environmental sedimentation and more protection to the aquatic environment\" than \"wet\" cuts, though \"dry\" crossings take longer to complete. J.A. 228.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Petitioners again timely filed a petition with this Court challenging the Corps' Reinstatement, and on July 6, 2018, Petitioners and Respondents filed a joint motion to consolidate that petition with Petitioners' earlier challenge to the Verification. Petitioners raise four issues: (1) whether the Corps exceeded its authority in the Reinstatement to impose Special Condition 6\n   \"in lieu of\" NWP 12's Special Condition C; (2) whether the Huntington Verification is inconsistent with Special Condition A; (3) whether the Verification lacked sufficient analysis of General Condition 7, and therefore fails arbitrary and capricious review;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (4) whether complete vacatur or remand without vacatur is an appropriate remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Petitioners' challenges to the Verification and the Reinstatement are governed by the standards for reviewing administrative actions set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). Under the APA, we may \"hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be ... arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not otherwise in accordance with law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We first address Petitioners' claim that the Corps exceeded its statutory and regulatory authority by imposing Special Condition 6 \"in lieu of\" NWP 12's Special Condition C.

Because the Clean Water Act mandates that Special Condition C be followed under NWP 12, we conclude that the Corps' issuance of the Reinstatement authorizing Special Condition 6 \"in lieu of\" Special Condition C exceeded its statutory authority and therefore must be vacated under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Congress's express purpose in enacting the Clean Water Act-and Section 1341, in particular-as well as that provision's legislative history are in accord with Section 1341(d) 's plain and unambiguous language.

Were the Corps' construction of the Clean Water Act accepted, the Corps could, in future, replace\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   state condition with an alternative condition, so long as it deemed the alternative condition more environmentally protective. We decline to sanction this level of discretionary authority that would allow the Corps, with few guardrails, to replace state-imposed conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Indeed, such authority would materially alter the Clean Water Act's balance of authority between federal agencies and the states. For example, another special condition imposed by West Virginia as part of its certification of NWP 12-Special Condition L-provides that \"[n]o structure authorized by this permit shall impede or prevent fish movement upstream or downstream.\" J.A. 44. Under the Corps' theory, it would be permissible for the Corps to replace that structure prohibition with, for example, a \"dry\" open cut provision so long as the Corps determined the \"dry\" provision was, overall, more protective of water quality than the structure provision, even though those conditions appear to target substantively different environmental protection goals. Further, the state may have legitimate reasons for preferring the structure condition to the dry-cut condition, even if the dry-cut condition is more environmentally protective. For example, the state may be more concerned with preserving places for fish to spawn than preventing erosion and sedimentation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Put simply, the state may prefer protecting the environment in one way to protecting it in another way. But in enacting Section 1341(a)(1), Congress did not intend to allow federal agencies to \"override\" such state policy determinations. S. Rep. 92-414, at 69 (1971). That the Corps seeks to override state policy decisions without providing public notice or receiving public comment-procedures required by Congress in Sections 1341 and 1344 -renders the Corps' claim of unconstrained authority to set aside state certification conditions on a case-by-case basis all the more problematic.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Part III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Absent any further limiting principles, the Corps' interpretation would radically empower it to unilaterally set aside state certification conditions as well as undermine the system of cooperative federalism upon which the Clean Water Act is premised. Further, the plain language of the Clean Water Act does not authorize the Corps to replace a state condition with a meaningfully different alternative condition, even if the Corps reasonably determines that the alternative condition is more protective of water quality. Accordingly, we vacate the July 3, 2018, Reinstatement as exceeding the Corps' statutory authority.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Corps' own Clean Water Act implementing regulations reinforce our conclusion\n   that Section 1341(d) 's plain and unambiguous language bars the Corps from replacing Special Condition C with Special Condition 6.

For instance, Section 330.2(c) provides that \"[a]uthorization means that specific activities that qualify for an NWP may proceed,\n   <em>\n    provided that the terms and conditions of the NWP are met\n   </em>\n   . After determining that the activity complies with\n   <em>\n    all applicable terms and conditions\n   </em>\n   , the prospective permittee may assume an authorization under an NWP.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20330.2\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (emphases added). Put differently, \"[a]n activity is authorized under an NWP\n   <em>\n    only if\n   </em>\n   that activity and the permittee satisfy\n   <em>\n    all of the NWP's terms and conditions\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20330.1\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Thus, a precondition for \"authorization\" of the Pipeline project is satisfaction of \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the NWP's terms and conditions,\" necessarily including state-imposed conditions like Special Condition C under Section 1341(a).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20330.1\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (emphasis added). The Corps' regulations specifically refer to the Corps' ability to modify \"authorizations under an NWP\" ( Section 330.1(d) ) and \"NWP authorizations\" ( Section 330.4(e) ). So, only a successful authorization activates the discretionary authority in Sections 330.1(d) and 330.4(e)(1) upon which the Reinstatement purports to rely. In other words, full compliance with each and every condition in the underlying NWP, including Special Condition C, is a precondition for the Corps to exercise its discretionary authority to modify the conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Notably, the \"definitions\" section of the regulations defines the \"discretionary authority\" conferred on the Corps as the authority of the relevant Corps official \"to modify an NWP authorization by\n   <em>\n    adding conditions\n   </em>\n   , to suspend an NWP authorization, or to revoke an NWP authorization and thus require individual permit authorization.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20330.2\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) (emphasis added). That the regulations define the Corps' discretionary authority as the power to \"add[ ] conditions\" further establishes that the Corps can exercise its discretionary authority only after all \"terms and conditions\" of an NWP have been satisfied because it presupposes that the NWP's other conditions are already met. The plain language of the regulations does not permit the Corps to\n   <em>\n    replace\n   </em>\n   conditions in the NWP, as it did by substituting Special Condition 6 \"in lieu of\" Special Condition C. Instead, the Corps' discretionary authority allows it to supplement the conditions set forth in an NWP with additional conditions, but that discretionary authority is triggered only upon a successful NWP authorization-i.e., satisfaction of all terms and conditions of the NWP. Further, that authority is limited to providing\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   conditions, above and beyond those found in the NWP, not replacing them wholesale, as the Corps did here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Corps argues that such a reading of its regulations would render Section 330.4(e) 's language superfluous. In particular, the Corps focuses on Section 330.4(e) 's language that \"[m]odification means the imposition of additional\n   <em>\n    or revised\n   </em>\n   terms or conditions on the authorization.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20330.4\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (emphasis added). The Corps argues that under this reading, the phrase \"or revised\" would be meaningless, because then \"all modifications to the NWP authorization would be 'additional.' \" Gov't Br. at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   However, as above, we must consider this provision in conjunction with the Clean Water Act and the language of the Corps' other regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3751958\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/675/315/#p324\">\n    675 F.3d 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 324 (4th Cir. 2012) (emphasizing the \"cardinal rule that statutory [or regulatory] language must be read in context because a phrase gathers meaning from the words around it\") (citation omitted) (brackets in original). Given the regulations' repeated indication that an \"authorization\" requires full compliance with the terms and conditions of the underlying NWP, Section 330.4(e) is most naturally read to mean that only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   a project has received such an \"authorization\"-potentially an authorization including \"additional\" \"activity-specific\" conditions-can the Corps modify the existing \"authorization\" by adding further conditions or \"revis[ing]\" any activity-specific conditions previously imposed. Under this reading, the Corps could still \"revise\" existing conditions under an obtained authorization when any of the criteria mentioned in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20330.5\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   are met,\n   including when there are \"changes in circumstances relating to the authorized activity since the NWP itself was issued.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20330.5\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). Therefore, the Corps still retains substantial discretionary authority, but a project must first meet the underlying conditions of the NWP, and therefore be authorized, to trigger that authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Corps further argues that this reading fails to meaningfully distinguish a \"verification\" from an \"authorization\" because \"authorization\" exists \"even when no verification is required,\" and the Corps' \"authority to impose 'additional\n   <em>\n    or revised\n   </em>\n   terms or conditions' applies to the 'authorization,' not to the broader Nationwide Permit or the narrower verification.\" Gov't Br. at 23. We agree that verifications and authorizations meaningfully differ, and that a project can be \"authorized\" even if it is not \"verified\" because authorization inheres, even without verification, if a project complies with the terms and conditions of the NWP. However, that distinction does not advance the Corps' argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Here, the Pipeline project never satisfied all terms and conditions of NWP 12 because, without dispute, it cannot satisfy the time limit set forth in Special Condition C. The Pipeline project never obtained \"authorization\" under NWP 12, and therefore there is no \"authorization\" for the Corps to \"modify\" through \"revis[ion].\" To agree with the Corps would allow the Corps' discretionary authority to permit noncompliance with an NWP condition. Such a finding would reject the plain language of the Clean Water Act, which bars the Corps from rejecting, altering, or overriding a state-imposed condition.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We accord no deference to an agency's \"improper interpretation of a decidedly unambiguous regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

The Verification includes no explanation of the Corps' rationale for why it concluded that the state's waiver of its condition without notice-and-comment was valid, let alone any indication that it viewed that determination as binding in future cases.\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518071\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/260/#p286\">\n    899 F.3d at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And the more extensive reasoning offered in the Corps' briefing constitutes \"mere[ ] litigation positions that do not reflect an exercise of delegated legislative authority.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518071\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/260/#p286\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518071\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/260/#p286\">\n    at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, under\n   <em>\n    Mead\n   </em>\n   , the Verification's legal conclusion that it could rely on the State Department's purported waiver of its state-specific condition absent notice-and-comment is not entitled to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference. Similarly, as with the Reinstatement, the Verification is not entitled to\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   deference, as the Corps provided no reasoning at all as to its legal conclusion regarding the state's ability to waive Special Condition A without notice-and-comment under the text of the Clean Water Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   , 323 U.S. at 140,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1229682\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/134/\">\n    65 S.Ct. 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Corps argues that it lawfully relied on the State Department's waiver letter to conclude Special Condition A was satisfied. Its argument primarily rests on the claim that the \"certification\" in Special Condition A is reasonably understood as having the same meaning as \"certification\" in Section 1341(a)(1). Examining several certification requirements under the Act, the Corps and Mountain Valley maintain that Section 1341(a)(1) 's use of the term \"certification\" \"implicitly encompasses the possibility of waiver\" and contend that the use of \"certification\" in Special Condition A should be read similarly. Gov't Br. at 37. Under this reading, a \"state's waiver may substitute for an individual water quality certification\" under Special Condition A.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   However, the Corps' argument ignores one critical aspect of the statutory language. Although Section 1341(a)(1) expressly contemplates that the state may \"waive\" its right to separately certify a federal permit, it also uses\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the terms \"certification\" and \"waive[ ],\" thus undermining the Corps' argument that the Corps validly interpreted Special Condition A to be satisfied by the Department's waiver. Ultimately, under Section 1341(a)(1), \"certification\" does not encompass \"waiver,\" as the certification requirements do not even apply when a state has waived its certification authority. Further support for this reading comes from the Corps' regulations themselves. Section 330.4(c)(1) states that \"State 401 water quality certification pursuant to section 401 of the [CWA],\n   <em>\n    or waiver thereof\n   </em>\n   , is required prior to the issuance or reissuance\n   of NWPs.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20330.4\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (emphasis added). Accepting the Corps' reading of \"certification\" would therefore likely render its own regulation redundant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   At any rate, even assuming West Virginia could waive Special Condition A, the waiver was invalid because it did not result from the notice-and-comment process contemplated by Section 1341(a)(1). That section provides that each state \"shall establish procedures for public notice in the case of all applications for certification by it and, to the extent it deems appropriate, procedures for public hearings in connection with specific applications.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Put differently,\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   law requires that the states establish notice-and-comment procedures for reviewing applications for certification of nationwide or individual permits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Here, West Virginia followed its Section 1341(a)(1) -mandated notice-and-comment procedures in certifying NWP 12, and therefore in imposing Special Condition A. But the State Department did not provide a notice-and-comment opportunity in waiving Special Condition A for the Pipeline project. Allowing West Virginia to revoke, on a\n   <em>\n    case-specific\n   </em>\n   basis, conditions imposed in its certification of a\n   <em>\n    nationwide\n   </em>\n   permit would impermissibly allow the state to circumvent Section 1341(a)(1) 's explicit requirement that state permit certifications satisfy notice requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Our decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In that case, the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") brought an enforcement action under the Clean Water Act against Smithfield, a pork processing and packing company. Smithfield's two swine slaughtering and processing plants discharged pollutants into federal waters, for which it obtained authorization by a permit from both the EPA and the relevant state regulator.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 520. The state regulator subsequently modified Smithfield's permit, after allowing public review and comment, to apply a more restrictive provision further limiting the maximum discharge amount of a particular pollutant. Afterward, the state regulator issued several orders, without engaging in the notice-and-comment process, purportedly delaying Smithfield's obligation to comply with the new standard, and Smithfield failed to comply with the new standards.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11578038\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/191/516/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11578038\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/191/516/\">\n    at 522-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In defense, Smithfield sought to rely on the state regulator's subsequent orders as modifications of the terms of the permit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11578038\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/191/516/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11578038\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/191/516/\">\n    at 523-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Smithfield additionally argued that the district court erred in finding that the EPA's suit was not barred by Section 309(g)(6)(A)(ii) of the Clean Water Act, which provides in part that \"any violation of the CWA 'which a State has commenced and is diligently prosecuting an action under a State law comparable to this subsection' shall not be the subject of a federal civil enforcement action.\"\n   <em>\n    Smithfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11578038\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/191/516/\">\n    191 F.3d at 524-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Two aspects of the district court's reasoning and judgment-and this Court's adoption of that reasoning and judgment-are particularly relevant to the present case. First, the district court in\n   <em>\n    Smithfield\n   </em>\n   found that the state regulator's subsequent orders did not change the terms of the permit because they did not follow the \"specific, mandatory procedures for modification\" of the permit laid out in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20122.62\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    United States v. Smithfield Foods, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"479556\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/965/769/#p787\">\n    965 F.Supp. 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 787 (E.D.Va. 1997). That regulation implements Sections 318, 402, and 405 of the Clean Water Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20122.1\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (3). Like Section 401 of the Act, which is codified at Section 1341(a)(1), Section 402 of the Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201342\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3), explicitly provides for\n   the \"opportunity for public hearing\" before the administrator issues the relevant pollutant discharge permit. Further, also like Section 1341(a)(1), Section 1342(b)(3) provides that the public \"receive notice of each application for a permit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Admittedly,\n   <em>\n    Smithfield\n   </em>\n   involved a different form of permit issued by the EPA and a distinct portion of the Act. However, Section 1342(b), just like Section 1341(a), lays out mandatory procedures for notice-and-comment before the issuance of a proposed state permit. Therefore, under our reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Smithfield\n   </em>\n   , the Corps' Verification cannot recognize the state's waiver of Special Condition A absent the state following the \"specific, mandatory procedures for modification\" laid out in Section 1341(a).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"479556\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/965/769/#p787\">\n    965 F.Supp. at 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Smithfield\n   </em>\n   , we also agreed with the district court's ruling that Virginia's enforcement scheme was not sufficiently comparable to Section 309(g) of the Act to trigger the statutory provision barring the EPA's suit.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 530 n.4. Central to the district court's analysis was that for a state law to be comparable to Section 309(g)-and therefore for the EPA's suit to be barred-the state law must contain \"public notice and participation rights that are similar to Section 309(g).\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"479556\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/965/769/#p787\">\n    965 F.Supp. at 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We adopted the district court's reasoning and judgment that Virginia's law was not sufficiently comparable to Section 309(g).\n   <em>\n    Smithfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11578038\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/191/516/\">\n    191 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   530 n.4. As the district court concluded, the state's enforcement scheme lacked Section 309(g)'s \"public notice and participation safeguards ... to ensure that interested citizens have an opportunity to contest administrative actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Smithfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"479556\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/965/769/#p787\">\n    965 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   793 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201319\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(4)(A) (\"Before issuing an order assessing a civil penalty under this subsection the Administrator or Secretary, as the case may be, shall provide public notice of and reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed issuance of such order.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Again, this aspect of\n   <em>\n    Smithfield\n   </em>\n   addressed a different provision of the Act. But our reasoning nonetheless signals the critical importance of notice-and-comment requirements throughout the Clean Water Act. Smithfield could not argue that an EPA suit was barred precisely because the state enforcement scheme\n   <em>\n    lacked\n   </em>\n   the notice-and-comment requirements required by the Act. In the instant case, this reasoning carries even more weight, as any state modifications to its certification of NWP 12 are directly subject to Section 1341(a)(1) 's requirement that states establish notice-and-comment procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In sum, Section 1341(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act specifically contemplates and requires a notice-and-comment process for case-specific modifications of conditions imposed as part of a state's Section 401 certification of a nationwide permit. To hold otherwise would constitute a back-door mechanism for a state to circumvent Congress's intended notice-and-comment process: the state could issue certification conditions after engaging in the required notice-and-comment process but then refuse to apply those conditions in each case. Accordingly, if West Virginia desires to waive Special Condition A, it must do so through the proper notice-and-comment procedures laid out in Section 1341(a)(1). Because the Corps' Verification and Reinstatement ignored this requirement, and impermissibly found that Mountain Valley complied with all terms and conditions of NWP 12, we vacate them both in their entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Finally, the Corps and Mountain Valley argue that this Court need not vacate the Verification and Reinstatement in their entirety but should instead remand the case\n   to the Corps to further consider whether verification is appropriate. In support of this position, the Corps and Mountain Valley rely on the D.C. Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal, Inc.v. U.S. Nuclear Reg. Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3813033,10510774\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/988/146/\">\n    988 F.2d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 150-51 (D.C. 1993), concluding that a court may decline to vacate an insufficiently supported agency decision on equitable grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   This Court has never formally embraced the\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal\n   </em>\n   remand-without-vacatur approach. Nevertheless, even if we were to follow\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal\n   </em>\n   , that decision would not support the Corps' and Mountain Valley's argument.\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal\n   </em>\n   holds that in deciding whether to exercise its discretion to remand, rather than vacate, an unlawful agency action, a court should consider \"the seriousness of the order's deficiencies (and thus the extent of doubt whether the agency chose correctly),\" and whether \"there is at least a serious possibility that the [agency] will be able to substantiate its decision on remand.\"\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3813033,10510774\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/988/146/\">\n    988 F.2d at 150-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal\n   </em>\n   's use of the remedy of remand without vacatur principally is relevant in matters where agencies have \"inadequately supported rule[s].\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 150. That is not the case here. Instead, we find that the Verification and Reinstatement's conclusions as to Special Conditions A and C were legally deficient, as they exceeded the Corps' statutory authority. The Supreme Court has recognized that Section 706(2)(A)\"requires federal courts to set aside federal agency action\" that is \"not in accordance with law.\"\n   <em>\n    F.C.C. v. NextWave Pers.
