Because the Rehabilitation Act does not contain a limitations period, we borrow the time limit from the most analogous state law claim. In the past, courts have applied Maryland's three-year general limitation for civil cases to claims under the Rehabilitation Act. We, however, have not addressed this question since Maryland amended its Fair Employment Practices Act (\"MFEPA\") to align more closely with the Rehabilitation Act. We now find that the amended MFEPA qualifies as the most analogous Maryland\n   law to the Rehabilitation Act. The MFEPA's two-year statute of limitations applies and bars Ott's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   To avoid this result, Ott invokes the doctrine of equitable tolling. Unfortunately, she does not meet the doctrine's exacting standard, and cannot avoid the bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For these reasons, we affirm the district court's dismissal of Ott's Rehabilitation Act claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ott worked for DPSCS as a parole officer. In 2010, she learned that a pediatrician had molested her daughter, causing Ott to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\") and severe anxiety. Her difficulties forced her to take medical leave and to transfer to a different location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ott says that one of her co-workers learned of the molestation and began to harass Ott about her daughter and Ott's mental health. The harassment continued for a year and took various forms, all ignored by the Department. Ott's PTSD and anxiety worsened, her performance deteriorated, and DPSCS forced her to resign on March 6, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While still employed, Ott filed a discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). Ott's charge proceeded slowly through the EEOC, but eventually the agency found reasonable cause for Ott's claims and referred them to the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"). On July 26, 2016, the DOJ issued Ott a right to sue notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ott filed her complaint in this case on October 10, 2016, asserting claims arising under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and Rehabilitation Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court applied the MFEPA's two-year statute of limitations to Ott's Rehabilitation Act claims and refused to toll her time to sue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court dismissed her complaint, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We review de novo dismissals pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    Walters v.

(Md. 2006) (codified as amended at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20State%20Gov%27t%20%C2%A7%2020-1013\">\n    Md.

Then, in 2009, the legislature expanded rights for persons with disabilities by adding provisions to the MFEPA that mirror the ADA. The revised law expands the definition of \"disability,\" requires reasonable workplace accommodations for disabilities, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees for opposing discriminatory conduct.
