Baroni, Jr. and Bridget Anne Kelly engaged in a scheme to impose crippling gridlock on the Borough of Fort Lee, New Jersey, after Fort Lee's mayor refused to endorse the 2013 reelection bid of then-Governor Chris Christie. To this end, under the guise of conducting a \"traffic study,\" Baroni and Kelly, among others, conspired to limit Fort Lee motorists' access to the George Washington Bridge-the world's busiest bridge-over four days in early September 2013: the first week of Fort Lee's school year. This scheme caused vehicles to back up into the Borough, creating intense traffic jams. Extensive media coverage ensued, and the scandal became known as \"Bridgegate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2015, a grand jury indicted Baroni and Kelly for their role in the scheme. Each Defendant was charged with seven counts: conspiracy to obtain by fraud, knowingly convert, or intentionally misapply property of an organization receiving federal benefits,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the substantive offense,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A); conspiracy to commit wire fraud,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1349, and two counts of the substantive offense,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1343; and conspiracy against civil rights,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 241, and the substantive offense,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 242. A jury convicted Defendants on all counts. They appeal only their judgments of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For reasons that follow, we will affirm Defendants' judgments of convictions on the wire fraud and Section 666 counts but will reverse and vacate their civil rights convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2010, then-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie appointed Baroni to serve as Deputy Executive Director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. That same year, David Wildstein-a cooperating witness in this case\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -was hired to serve as the Port Authority's Director of Interstate Capital Projects, in which capacity he functioned as Baroni's chief of staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Among its many functions, the Port Authority operates the George Washington Bridge, a double-decked suspension bridge connecting the Borough of Fort Lee, New Jersey, and New York City across the Hudson River. On the bridge's upper deck, twelve toll lanes carry traffic from New Jersey into New York. During the morning rush hour, Port Authority police place traffic cones to reserve the three right-most lanes-the \"Special Access Lanes\"-for local traffic from Fort Lee. This leaves the other nine lanes for drivers on the \"Main Line,\" which includes traffic from I-80 and I-95. This practice of reserving Special Access Lanes was a decades-long custom dating back to a political deal between a former New Jersey governor and Fort Lee mayor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Wildstein testified he first became aware of the Special Access Lanes in March 2011. He learned the three lanes were given to Fort Lee by a former New Jersey governor to reduce local traffic and \"immediately thought that this would be ... a potential leverage point with [Fort Lee] Mayor [Mark] Sokolich down the road.\" Joint App'x (J.A.) 1596. Wildstein shared this observation with Baroni, Governor Christie's then-Chief of Staff Bill Stepien, and Kelly, then the Deputy Chief of Staff for New Jersey's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA). Wildstein did not, however, use the Special Access Lanes as leverage at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Around the same time that Wildstein realized the Special Access Lanes could be used as leverage, IGA officials-including Kelly-were discussing a plan to solicit endorsements from Democratic elected officials to generate bipartisan support for Governor Christie's 2013 re-election bid. IGA officials rewarded potential endorsers with, among other things, \"Mayor's Days\" (meetings with top departmental and agency\n   staff) and invitations to sporting events, breakfasts and parties at Drumthwacket (the Governor's Princeton residence), and the Governor's State of the State address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Governor's Office and IGA used the Port Authority similarly to bestow political favors on potential endorsers. As Wildstein explained at trial, the Port Authority \"was viewed as the economic engine of the region\" and \"had an ability to do things for Democratic officials that would potentially put the Governor in a more favorable position.\" J.A. 1522-23. Baroni and Wildstein were thus asked \"to assist the Governor's Office in identifying opportunities that would be helpful.\" J.A. 1523. The Port Authority gave benefits ranging from gifts (e.g., steel from the original World Trade Center towers, flags that had flown over Ground Zero, framed prints) and tours, to jobs, to large economic investments (e.g., the $250 million purchase of the Military Ocean Terminal at Bayonne).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   One Democratic endorsement sought by the Governor's Office was that of Mayor Sokolich. IGA invited Sokolich to a New York Giants game, several holiday parties, and one of Governor Christie's budget addresses. And, as early as 2010, the Governor's Office and IGA directed Wildstein to leverage the Port Authority's resources to obtain Sokolich's endorsement. Sokolich received benefits ranging from the sort of gifts described above to substantial Port Authority assistance for Fort Lee (e.g., Port Authority Police assistance directing traffic in Fort Lee, a $5,000 contribution to the Fort Lee fire department for an equipment purchase, and over $300,000 in funding for four shuttle buses providing Fort Lee residents with free transport between ferry and bus terminals). Despite that, Sokolich informed IGA in 2013 that local political considerations precluded him from endorsing the Governor's reelection bid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In June 2013, Kelly told Wildstein that she was disappointed Sokolich would not be endorsing Governor Christie, and Wildstein reminded her \"if she want[ed] the Port Authority to close down those Fort Lee lanes to put some pressure on Mayor Sokolich, that that c[ould] be done.\" J.A. 1605. On August 13, 2013, Kelly sent an email to Wildstein that read: \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\" Supplemental App'x (S.A.) 42. Wildstein \"understood that to mean it was time to change the lane configurations, the upper level of the George Washington Bridge in order to create traffic in the Borough of Fort Lee.\" J.A. 1612. Wildstein testified that, on a follow up telephone call, Kelly told him that \"Mayor Sokolich needed to fully understand that life would be more difficult for him in the second Christie term than it had been [i]n the first.\" J.A. 1620. Wildstein admitted at trial that he agreed to change the lane configuration \"[f]or the purpose of causing-of punishing Mark Sokolich, of creating a traffic jam that would punish him, send him a message,\" and that there was no other reason for the change. J.A. 1621.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Wildstein testified he told Baroni he \"received an email from Miss Kelly that [he] viewed as instructing [him] to begin to put leverage on Mayor Sokolich by doing a lane closure.\" J.A. 1618. He also testified he told Baroni \"that Miss Kelly wanted the Fort Lee lanes closed ... [f]or the purpose of punishing Mayor Sokolich ... [b]ecause he had not endorsed Governor Christie\" and that \"Mr. Baroni was fine with that.\" J.A. 1623.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to Wildstein, he decided \"to create the cover of a traffic study\" and shared his plan with both Baroni and Kelly. J.A. 1624. Wildstein believed \"calling it a traffic study would provide a cover story for the true purpose of changing and realigning that traffic pattern at the bridge\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   and \"to have a public policy reason for doing so as opposed to saying it was political and it was punitive and revealing the true purpose.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.A. 1632. In furtherance of Defendants' traffic study cover story, Wildstein contacted Peter Zipf, the Port Authority's chief traffic engineer, and told him he wanted to take away the cones that created the Special Access Lanes \"so that New Jersey could determine whether those three lanes given to Fort Lee would continue on a permanent basis.\" J.A. 1657-58. Zipf responded later that day with various proposals but recommended that at least one segregated lane be left in place to prevent sideswipe crashes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   According to Wildstein, he and Baroni discussed when to implement the lane closure at the end of August 2013, and they selected Monday, September 9, 2013-the first day of school in Fort Lee. But Wildstein waited to give the instruction until Friday, September 6. He testified \"[i]t was a deliberate effort on [his] part to wait until the last minute to give a final instruction so that nobody at the Port Authority would let Fort Lee know, would communicate that to Fort Lee or anyone else within the Port Authority,\" including Executive Director Patrick Foye. J.A. 1684. According to Wildstein, he discussed waiting to give the instruction with both Baroni and Kelly, who agreed. This directly contravened normal Port Authority protocol, with any lane closures announced to the public weeks, and even months, in advance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Wildstein gave the instruction to Zipf and two other Port Authority managers, Bob Durando (the general manager of the George Washington Bridge) and Cedric Fulton (the director of Tunnels, Bridges &amp; Terminals), again claiming that New Jersey wanted to see whether the Special Access Lanes would remain permanent. When Fulton asked if Foye knew, Wildstein lied and said he did. Wildstein later told the same lie to Durando.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Durando explained that because only one Special Access Lane would remain open, the Port Authority needed to pay an extra toll collector to be on relief duty for that sole toll collector. Wildstein discussed this with Baroni and Kelly, and none of the three saw a problem with this extra cost. Wildstein and Zipf also discussed collecting data on the ensuing traffic, and Wildstein testified he understood it would require \"some staff time.\" J.A. 1688.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On the morning of Monday, September 9, Port Authority police placed traffic\n   cones two toll booths to the right of where they were customarily placed on the upper deck, thereby reducing the number of Special Access Lanes from three to one, and increasing the number of Main Line lanes from nine to eleven. This realignment meant that Fort Lee's sole remaining Special Access Lane had to accept both cash and E-ZPass, further delaying traffic. As discussed, Fort Lee received no advance warning of the change-contrary to the Port Authority's standard procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As a result of this change, cars attempting to cross the George Washington Bridge during the morning commute backed up into Fort Lee and gridlocked the entire town. Mayor Sokolich repeatedly attempted to contact Baroni and IGA to have the two other Special Access Lanes reinstated, but Baroni deliberately did not respond. Wildstein testified \"that was the plan that [he] had come up with along with Mr. Baroni and Miss Kelly, which is that all calls would be directed to Mr. Baroni. And that Mr. Baroni would be radio silent. Meaning any-all the calls would come to him, and he wasn't planning on returning any of them.\" J.A. 1687-88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On the morning of September 9, Mayor Sokolich called Baroni's office about an \"urgent matter of public safety in Fort Lee,\" but received no response. S.A. 51. The Fort Lee borough administrator also called to say Fort Lee police and paramedics had difficulty responding to a missing child and a cardiac arrest. The next day, the mayor called again, saying the traffic was a \"life/safety\" issue and that paramedics had to leave their vehicle and respond to a call on foot. S.A. 54. Receiving no response to his calls, he then sent Baroni a letter on September 12 detailing the negative impact on public safety in Fort Lee. Kelly was similarly unmoved by the traffic and the anger it generated, reportedly smiling when a colleague at IGA informed her of the situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Executive Director Foye first learned of the realignment on the evening of Thursday, September 12. The following morning, he sent an email to Baroni and others, criticizing the \"hasty and ill-advised\" realignment and ordering the restoration of the prior alignment with three Special Access Lanes. J.A. 1100-02, 5809. Baroni went to Foye's office and asked that the realignment be put back into effect, with only one Special Access Lane for Fort Lee. Foye testified Baroni said the issue was \"important to Trenton,\" which Foye understood to reference the Governor's Office. J.A. 1107-08. Foye refused to do so. Baroni returned to Foye's office later that day, again asked that two of Special Access Lanes be taken away from Fort Lee, and said the issue was \"important to Trenton\" and \"Trenton may call.\" J.A. 1109. Foye held firm and continued to refuse. Wildstein testified Baroni reached out to David Samson, the New Jersey-appointed Chairman of the Port Authority, to \"overrule Mr. Foye and talk to others on the New York side,\" but Samson ultimately declined to do so, instead recommending Baroni \"let it go.\" J.A. 1832.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In response to significant public backlash, Baroni and Wildstein began preparing a report that would describe what happened as \"a traffic study to determine whether it was fairer to give three lanes to Fort Lee.\" J.A. 1870. The report would also have admitted that the Port Authority had failed to give Fort Lee appropriate notice due to an alleged \"communications breakdown.\" J.A. 1870. But the report was never released because Port Authority staff were asked to testify before the New Jersey State Assembly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 1879-80. Wildstein helped Baroni prepare his testimony, which was based on the draft report\n   and the traffic study and \"fairness\" rationale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Then-Governor Christie fired Wildstein on December 6 and Baroni on December 12. Kelly was fired on January 9, 2014. A federal criminal investigation followed and resulted in the underlying prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On April 23, 2015, a federal grand jury returned a nine-count indictment, charging Defendants with seven counts each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In Count 1, the grand jury charged Defendants with conspiracy to obtain by fraud, knowingly convert, or intentionally misapply property of an organization receiving federal benefits.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As charged, \"[t]he object of the conspiracy was to misuse Port Authority property to facilitate and conceal the causing of traffic problems in Fort Lee as punishment of Mayor Sokolich.\" J.A. 96. In Count 2, Defendants were charged with the substantive offense of that conspiracy. The grand jury alleged Defendants, through Port Authority agents Baroni and Wildstein, \"obtained by fraud, otherwise without authority knowingly converted to their use and the use of others, and intentionally misapplied property owned by and under the care, custody, and control of the Port Authority, with a value of at least $5,000.\" J.A. 119;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A), 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In Count 3, Defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201349\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The charged \"object of the conspiracy was to obtain money and property from the Port Authority and to deprive the Port Authority of its right to control its own assets by falsely representing and causing false representations to be made that the lane and toll booth reductions were for the purpose of a traffic study.\" J.A. 120. In Counts 4 through 7, the grand jury charged each Defendant with two substantive wire fraud violations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201343\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2. Count 4 pertained to Kelly's August 13, 2013 email informing Wildstein it was \"[t]ime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,\" and Count 6 to her September 9, 2013 email thanking Wildstein for confirming there would be \"[r]adio silence\" from Baroni in response to Mayor Sokolich's inquiries. J.A. 123 (second alteration in original). Counts 5 and 7 related to Baroni's September 9 and 12, 2013 emails to Wildstein concerning complaints from Mayor Sokolich.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In Count 8, the grand jury charged Defendants with conspiracy against civil rights.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20241\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The charged \"object of the conspiracy was to interfere with the localized travel rights of the residents of Fort Lee for the illegitimate purpose of causing significant traffic problems in Fort Lee to punish Mayor Sokolich.\" J.A. 124. In Count 9, Defendants were charged with the substantive violation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20242\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   At the outset, Defendants moved to dismiss all the charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(B). The District Judge held oral argument and denied the motions. After a six-week trial, the jury found Defendants guilty on all counts.

In summation, the Government explained this was the \"same money, the salaries, the same property, the lanes, the toll booths,\" that it alleged Defendants fraudulently obtained, knowingly converted, or intentionally misapplied in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . J.A. 5195. The Government explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   The physical property that was misused were the local access lanes, themselves, and the toll booths.... The defendants agreed to use these Port Authority assets, that property, to purposely create a traffic jam in Fort Lee. That agreement was not a legitimate use of the George Washington Bridge, the Port Authority's property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   J.A. 5193-94. The Government identified the \"money\" as \"the salaries of each of the employees who wasted their time in furtherance of the defendants' scheme,\" including \"the salary paid to the overtime toll booth collectors for the one remaining toll booth that was accessible to Fort Lee,\" \"the money paid to Baroni and Wildstein themselves while they ... [were] wasting their time in furtherance of this conspiracy,\" and \"money paid to the engineers who wasted time-and Port Authority professional staff, who wasted time collecting data that no one ever wanted.\" J.A. 5194. The Government also invoked the costs the Port Authority incurred in redoing a legitimate traffic study-at Center and Lemoine Avenues in Fort Lee-that was spoiled by the gridlock and \"would not have been ruined without these lane reductions.\" J.A. 5296.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   According to the Government, Defendants' untruthful claim they were conducting a traffic study was what allowed them to carry out the lane reductions and to obtain the Port Authority property and money necessary to do so. The Government also contended Defendants conspired with each other and Wildstein in furtherance of this fraudulent scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants argue the evidence was insufficient to prove a scheme to defraud\n   because (1) Baroni possessed unilateral authority over Port Authority traffic patterns and any resources necessary to implement his decisions, and (2) the Port Authority was not deprived of any property right.

Before trial, the District Judge declined to dismiss the wire fraud counts on this basis, holding the existence and scope of Baroni's authority was a question of fact for the jury. After trial, the judge denied Defendants' motions because that question was \"one that the jurors resolved in favor of the prosecution.\" J.A. 60. Carefully reviewing the relevant witness testimony, the judge held \"the Government presented evidence at trial from which the jury could reasonably have found that Baroni did not have the authority to change the lane configurations, and in fact, did defraud the Port Authority.\" J.A. 59.

Likening Baroni to the pension fund trustees in\n   <em>\n    Zauber\n   </em>\n   , Defendants argue \"the undisputed evidence showed that Baroni's position as co-head of the Port Authority gave him authority to make unilateral decisions about the alignment of traffic patterns at Port Authority facilities, and to command the resources needed to carry those decisions out.\" Baroni Br. at 42. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As a preliminary matter,\n   <em>\n    Zauber\n   </em>\n   is inapposite because here the grand jury alleged, and the Government proved at trial, that the Port Authority was actually deprived of its money and property. In any event, the evidence refutes the notion Baroni possessed \"unilateral\" authority to realign the bridge's lanes. To the contrary, it reveals Defendants would not have been able to realign the lanes had Baroni and Wildstein provided the actual reason or no reason at all. They had to create the traffic study cover story in order to get Port Authority employees to implement the realignment. And, as we described above, Wildstein lied to Port Authority officials Durando and Fulton about whether Executive Director Foye knew of the realignment. This lie was necessary to keep Foye in the dark and prevent him from putting an immediate end to the scheme. In fact, that is exactly what happened when he finally learned of the realignment. Foye ordered the three Special Access Lanes be\n   restored to the use of Fort Lee motorists and refused Baroni's repeated entreaties to reinstate the realignment. Baroni then appealed to Chairman Samson, who declined to intervene and overrule Foye's decision. This evidence belies Defendants' assertion Baroni had anything approaching \"authority to make unilateral decisions about the alignment of traffic patterns at Port Authority facilities.\" Baroni Br. at 42. If that were so, Baroni could have reinstated the realignment on his own without needing to appeal to Foye and then Samson. That Baroni was countermanded shows he lacked the unencumbered authority he claims he possessed, and that he needed to lie to realign the traffic patterns. The record contains overwhelming evidence from which a rational juror could have reached these conclusions. Indeed, it is difficult to see how any rational juror could have concluded otherwise. The jury's verdict necessarily reflects its rejection of Defendants' argument that Baroni possessed unilateral authority to control the bridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendants contend we cannot draw this inference because the trial judge declined to give a jury instruction based on\n   <em>\n    Zauber\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree. The judge instructed the jury that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [i]n order to establish a scheme to defraud, the Government must also prove that the alleged scheme contemplated depriving the Port Authority of money and property. An organization is deprived of money or property when the organization is deprived of the right to control that money or property. And one way the organization is deprived of the right to control that money and property is when the organization receives false or fraudulent statements that affect its ability to make discretionary economic decisions about what to do with that money or property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   J.A. 5121-22. This instruction forecloses the possibility the jury convicted Defendants of fraud without finding Baroni lacked authority to realign the lanes. For Baroni could not deprive the Port Authority of money and property he was authorized to use for any purpose. Nor could he deprive the Port Authority of its right to control its money or property if that right to control were committed to his unilateral discretion. In finding the existence of a scheme to defraud, the jury necessarily concluded Baroni lacked authority to order the realignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendants also argue the Port Authority was not deprived of any tangible property and challenge the Government's and\n   District Court's invocation of the \"right to control\" theory of property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Before trial, the trial judge rejected Defendants' related argument the charges should be dismissed because they did not \"obtain\" money or property. Relying on our decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Al Hedaithy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9189231\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/392/580/\">\n    392 F.3d 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2004), the judge ruled \"it [wa]s enough that they prevented the Port Authority from exercising 'its right to exclusive use of' its property, which here allegedly includes toll booths and roadways, in addition to money in the form of employee compensation and the costs of redoing a traffic study.\" J.A. 36-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In their post-trial motions, however, Defendants raised no sufficiency arguments respecting the property at issue.

Wildstein told Durando the New Jersey side of the Port Authority wanted to be able to \"make a determination down the road as to whether those [Fort Lee] lanes would stay on a permanent basis.\" J.A. 1685. Of course, as Wildstein admitted at trial, the traffic study rationale offered to Durando was not the real reason for the realignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Among other things, Durando told Wildstein he would need to have a relief toll worker on duty because all of Fort Lee's traffic would be going through one lane. Wildstein testified he \"understood that the Port Authority would have to pay for an extra toll collector to be on relief duty for that first toll collector,\" J.A. 1686, and discussed this cost with both Defendants. According to Wildstein, both Baroni and Kelly found it humorous that the Port Authority would have to \"pay a second toll collector to sit and wait in case the first toll collector had to go to the bathroom,\" and they had no problem with the extra cost. J.A. 1687. On Sunday, September 8, 2013, Wildstein emailed Durando to say he would \"be at [the] bridge early Monday [morning] to view [the] new lane test.\" S.A. 49. Durando replied that he would also be present, and that he had \"also brought a toll collector in on overtime to keep toll lane 24 (the extreme right hand toll lane Upper level) in the event the collector assigned to TL 24 needs a personal.\" S.A. 49. Wildstein forwarded the email to Baroni. On cross-examination, Baroni admitted he had received the email and did not object to bringing in overtime toll booth workers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Government also called Theresa Riva, a Port Authority employee who served as an Operations Planning Analyst for the George Washington Bridge during the relevant time period. In that capacity, Riva supervised time keeping for operations staff and managed scheduling and coverage for toll collectors. Riva testified she learned of the lane reductions the Friday before, and Bob Durando \"asked [her] to staff one additional toll collector\" on the upper level toll plaza twenty-four hours a day. J.A. 2897. Because toll collectors work eight-hour shifts, this meant \"three toll collectors a day to be an excess toll collector in the toll house.\" J.A. 2897. Riva testified all these additional toll collectors were paid an overtime rate \"[b]ecause they either worked on their regular day off or in excess of eight hours, a double [shift].\" J.A. 2898. Riva testified these employees\n   would not have been paid absent the lane realignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In addition to the overtime toll workers, Wildstein discussed with Zipf using Port Authority professional staff to track data, which would include \"numbers on how-how many cars were involved and how far back the traffic was delayed.\" J.A. 1688. Wildstein understood Zipf \"would have to use some staff time.\" J.A. 1688. At trial, the staff members testified to the significant amount of time they spent performing unnecessary work related to the realignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Amy Hwang, Senior Operations Planning Analyst for the Port Authority, testified she collected data on traffic at the bridge and compared it to traffic on the same date the year before.

Chung testified he spent a little over eight hours doing this analysis on the Friday before the reductions went into effect. During the week of the reductions, Chung was asked to compare travel times approaching the bridge's upper-level toll plaza during peak hours and to compare it to historical travel times. Chung testified he spent about six hours on this analysis, for a total of 14 hours spent on unnecessary work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   And Umang Patel, Staff Service Engineer in the Port Authority's Traffic Engineering department, downloaded and analyzed data relating to travel time on the Main Line during the lane reductions.

According to Defendants, \"[i]t cannot be the case that the Supreme Court has pointedly and repeatedly rebuffed the government's attempts to prosecute public officials for the deprivation of the public's intangible right to honest services or honest government if, all along, the inevitable use of at least a peppercorn of public money or property made every instance of such conduct prosecutable as money or property fraud.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Baroni Br. at 48-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   We are mindful of the Supreme Court's honest services case law but do not believe it counsels a different result in this case. Defendants were charged with simple money and property fraud under Section 1343-not honest services fraud-and the grand jury alleged an actual money and property loss to the Port Authority. In any event, their conduct in this case can hardly be characterized as \"official action\" that was merely influenced by political considerations. Defendants invented a cover story about a traffic study for the sole purpose\n   of reducing Fort Lee's access to the George Washington Bridge and creating gridlock in the Borough. Trial testimony established that everything about the way this \"study\" was executed contravened established Port Authority protocol and procedures. Indeed, witnesses testified that traffic studies are usually conducted by computer modeling, without the need to realign traffic patterns or disrupt actual traffic. When traffic disruptions are anticipated, the Port Authority gives advance public notice. And, as we have discussed, the evidence conclusively demonstrates Baroni lacked the authority to realign the bridge's traffic patterns unilaterally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   It is hard to see, under Defendants' theory, how a public official could ever be charged with simple mail or wire fraud. They appear to suggest that, as public officials, any fraud case against them necessarily entails intangible right to honest services. That is not so. As we have explained, Defendants were charged with defrauding the Port Authority of its money and property\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   -not the intangible right to their honest services.

Offering an analogy, Kelly contends Defendants' conduct is \"materially indistinguishable\" from that of a mayor who, after a heavy snowfall, directs city employees to plow the streets of a ward that supported her before getting to a ward that supported her opponent. Kelly Br. at 1. Baroni makes similar arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Baroni Br. at 31 (\"In any event, it is obvious that there is nothing illegal about allocating public resources to favor political supporters and allies. Budgets are enacted, projects are funded, pork is doled out, potholes are filled, and snow is plowed at every level of government with political considerations in mind.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   While such analogies have some superficial appeal, we find them unpersuasive. We agree with the District Court that this argument \"conflates motive ... with\n   <em>\n    mens reas\n   </em>\n   and conduct.\" J.A. 54. Defendants altered the bridge's decades-old lane alignment-without authorization and in direct contravention of Port Authority protocol-for the sole purpose of creating gridlock in Fort Lee. To execute their scheme, they conscripted fourteen Port Authority employees to do sham work in pursuit of no legitimate Port Authority aim. That Defendants were politically motivated does not remove their intentional conduct from the ambit of the federal criminal law. What Defendants did here is hardly analogous to a situation where a mayor allows political considerations to influence her discretionary allocation of limited government resources in the normal course of municipal operations. There is no facially legitimate justification for Defendants' conduct here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Nor are we persuaded by Defendants' arguments that the Government has sought to expand the reach of Section 666 beyond conduct involving bribery and theft.

Defendants were able to obtain these employees' labor only by lying about the purpose of the realignment, claiming they were conducting a traffic study.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Defendants argue they could not have misapplied Port Authority employee labor because they did not receive a \"personal pecuniary benefit.\" Baroni Br. at 27. We disagree. Defendants had Port Authority employees do work they would not have otherwise done to further their personal scheme. The fact Defendants sought to benefit politically, not monetarily, does not alter the fact they forced the Port Authority to pay toll workers overtime, and diverted the time of salaried professional staff, in furtherance of no legitimate purpose.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Genova\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9111721\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/750/#p758\">\n    333 F.3d at 758-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"the point of the \u00a7 666 prosecution is that political activities are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the performance of a garbage collector's official duties,\" and that while \"Public Works employees were entitled to unpaid leave for political endeavors[,] the \u00a7 666 problem was paying them for that time\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Defendants argue this interpretation raises constitutional vagueness concerns. We disagree. At trial, the Government introduced evidence that, after Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop declined to endorse Governor Christie, the Governor's office directed state agencies (including the Port Authority) to cancel meetings with Fulop and otherwise ignore him. In seeking to admit this evidence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), the Government argued there was no danger of unfair prejudice because \"[t]he mistreatment of Mayor Fulop, while hardly reflective of good government, was not criminal and thus, was\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   serious than the criminal conduct for which Defendants stand accused, conduct that needlessly imperiled public safety in Fort Lee and directly inconvenienced thousands of people.\" J.A. 259-60. Defendants contend it is not clear why their mistreatment of Mayor Sokolich is criminal, but their mistreatment of Mayor Fulop was not, and that \"[t]his inconsistency demonstrates the inherent arbitrariness of the government's interpretation of Section 666.\" Baroni Br. at 40. Defendants again conflate motive with conduct. While their decision to punish Mayor Fulop may have been animated by the same desire to exact political revenge, there were no allegations they defrauded their federally funded employer in order to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Defendants also raise federalism concerns, arguing the Government is improperly attempting \"to police state and local officials in the conduct of their official duties.\" Baroni Br. at 36. As we have observed, Congress has a uniquely significant interest in safeguarding the Port Authority, an interstate agency created by its consent. But we also believe federalism arguments are especially inapposite in the context of Section 666. We have described how Congress enacted Section 666 specifically to bring state and local officials within the scope of the federal criminal theft law.

These records indicate an hourly rate of $43.79 for Hwang, $52.11 for Chung, $47.24 for Patel, $79.59 for Wildstein, and $153.67 for Baroni. Based on these rates and the hours Hwang, Chung, and Patel testified they worked on the sham traffic study, the evidence shows their time was valued at $437.90 ($43.79 x 10 hours), $729.54 ($52.11 x 14 hours), and $661.36 ($47.24 x 14 hours), respectively. Cumulatively, the three Port Authority traffic engineers provided unnecessary labor valued at approximately $1,828.80. The value of the work done by Hwang, Chung, and Patel, taken with the $3,696.09 spent on overtime toll workers, satisfies the $5,000 threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Furthermore, based on Wildstein's testimony about the amount of time he and Baroni spent in furtherance of the scheme, the value of their time was, at a minimum, $4,294.80. This figure reflects approximately $1,989.75 for Wildstein's time ($79.59 x 25 hours) and $2,305.05 for Baroni's time ($153.67 x 15 hours).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The Government reminded the jury of this evidence in summation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   Based on Port Authority payroll records and testimony you've heard, about $5,000 in Port Authority salaries were paid for the time in connection for the lane reduction work performed by Tunnels, Bridges and Terminals, Miss Hwang, Mr. Chung, traffic engineering Mr. Patel, as well as for Mr. Baroni and Mr. Wildstein's time spent to facilitate and conceal causing traffic problems in Fort Lee.

Our analysis there focused on whether the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, provided a sufficient basis for a rational juror to convict. But our inquiry here is different. Defendants contend that, even if the record contained sufficient evidence that the value of public employee labor exceeded $5,000, we cannot be certain beyond a reasonable doubt the jury actually considered all of that time in light of its instructions. We disagree. No reasonable juror could have failed to credit the value of Port Authority employee labor Defendants used to effect their fraudulent scheme, which alone satisfies Section 666(a)(1)(A)(i) 's $5,000 threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Defendants do not assert any error in the jury instructions as to the value of the public employee labor, and we find none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The Government presented overwhelming and undisputed evidence-which we described in analyzing Defendants' sufficiency challenge-concerning the amount of time Port Authority employees spent in furtherance of Defendants' scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   As to the cost of compensating overtime tollbooth workers, the Government introduced, and Riva specifically testified to, detailed payroll records showing eleven overtime tollbooth workers were paid $3,696.09. The Government presented this number to the jury on a chart and referenced it in summation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The Government also elicited testimony from three members of the Port Authority's professional staff-Hwang, Chung, and Patel-about the time they spent collecting traffic data on the realignment, in furtherance of no legitimate Port Authority purpose, and testimony from Wildstein about the time he and Baroni spent in furtherance of the scheme. Detailed payroll records reveal the value of the traffic engineers' time was approximately $1,828.80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Defendants argue we cannot be confident the jury considered the traffic engineers' time because it was not presented a full calculation of the value of their hourly rate multiplied by the hours they claimed to have worked on the sham study. We disagree. The parties admitted the relevant payroll records by stipulation, the Government elicited testimony to establish the number of hours worked, and it reminded the jury of this evidence in summation, estimating that the value of the engineers' and Baroni and Wildstein's time exceeded $5,000-which is correct. The amount was over $6,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Accordingly, the value of the work performed by Hwang, Chung, and Patel, taken together with the $3,696.09 spent on overtime toll workers, satisfies the $5,000 threshold. The time Baroni and Wildstein spent plotting their fraud represents an additional $4,295.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Because the jury was instructed \"[c]ompensation for an employee's time and services obtained through deception is not legitimate or bona fide,\" and the Government presented overwhelming evidence Defendants fraudulently obtained Port Authority employee services, the jury necessarily found all the toll worker and professional staff time satisfied the $5,000 threshold and was not subject to Section 666(c) 's exclusion for bona fide compensation. As noted, even if the jury did not credit Baroni and Wildstein's compensation, the value of employee time Defendants obtained nonetheless exceeds $5,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Defendants' convictions on the wire fraud counts confirm this conclusion. The jury found Defendants defrauded the Port Authority and conspired to do so. The only fraudulent scheme before them was one to cause a traffic blockage in Fort Lee by conducting a sham traffic study. There is overwhelming evidence that the bridge lanes were altered, eleven toll collectors worked additional overtime hours as a result, and the traffic study was conducted with the help of several well-paid Port Authority engineers. Defendants do not argue the study was not conducted. At trial, they asserted they did not know it was a sham or barely participated in it-an argument the jury roundly rejected. Indeed, the jury was instructed that, if it found the Defendants believed the traffic study was legitimate, it was a complete defense. On appeal, they argue Baroni had the authority to conduct the study even if it was a sham. The jury could not have concluded that Defendants conspired to conduct a sham traffic study but then ignored the value of the employee labor necessary to effect that fraudulent scheme. As we have explained, the jury was presented with overwhelming and undisputed\n   evidence demonstrating the value of the toll workers' and professional staff's time exceeds $5,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Next, Defendants contend the District Court erred in instructing the jury it did not need to know of the specific property obtained. Defendants raise this argument to challenge the inclusion of the Center and Lemoine study in the jury instructions. Although we agree the instruction was erroneous, the error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The District Judge instructed the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   The Government does not have to prove that the Defendants knew of the specific property obtained by fraud, knowingly converted, or intentionally misapplied, or that the value of the property met or exceeded $5,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   J.A. 5110.

But Section 666(a)(1)(A)(i) 's requirement that the value of affected property be at least $5,000 can be described as jurisdictional in the sense that it is a \"jurisdictional floor\" below which Congress has determined there is insufficient federal interest in prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   In any event, the affected property is not part of Section 666(a)(1)(A)(i) 's $5,000 requirement.

The property is the direct object of the conduct\n   element, Section 666(a)(1)(A), which provides that one who \"embezzles, steals, obtains by fraud, or otherwise without authority knowingly converts to the use of any person other than the rightful owner or intentionally misapplies,\n   <em>\n    property\n   </em>\n   \" violates the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20666\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   While the jury need not have found that Defendants knew the\n   <em>\n    value\n   </em>\n   of the property, it was error for the trial judge to instruct the jury \"[t]he Government d[id] not have to prove that the Defendants knew of the specific property obtained by fraud, knowingly converted, or intentionally misapplied.\" J.A. 495. Such an instruction runs the risk of negating the statute's\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement and thus relieving the Government of its burden of proof on an essential element of the crime. We do not believe, for example, one could intend to misapply something one does not know exists; to instruct the jury otherwise would seemingly dispense with the intent requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   But because we need not reach nor credit the Center and Lemoine study to affirm Defendants' convictions, the error was harmless. There is overwhelming evidence Defendants knew of the property fraudulently obtained or intentionally misapplied, including the work of fourteen of Baroni's subordinates at the Port Authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Defendants next challenge the District Judge's definition of intentional misapplication as ambiguous. We disagree. Following the Third Circuit Model Jury Instruction, the judge instructed the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   To intentionally misapply money or property means to intentionally use money or property of the Port Authority knowing that the use is unauthorized or unjustifiable or wrongful. Misapplication includes the wrongful use of the money or property for an unauthorized purpose, even if the use actually benefitted the Port Authority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   J.A. 5109. Defendants argue that \"unjustifiable or wrongful\" is overbroad and ambiguous. Defendants raised this same argument in pretrial motions and at the charging conference. The Government responded these are common terms and have been used in numerous intentional misapplication cases going back decades. Kelly's lawyer suggested that the judge \"just define what unjustifiable and wrongful are,\" but when asked for proposed definitions, had nothing to offer. J.A. 4992. The judge overruled Defendants' objection because the terms are not \"inherently vague\" and were not \"strong legal term[s].\" J.A. 4992.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   On appeal, Defendants argue these terms are so broad that the jury could have convicted if it believed the lane realignment was \"a bad idea,\" unjustifiable \"as a policy matter,\" or that Baroni should have sought Executive Director Foye's approval. Kelly Br. at 35 (emphasis omitted). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Other instructions in the District Judge's thorough and comprehensive charge foreclose the possibility the jury convicted defendants for lawful but imprudent conduct, e.g., because the jury thought the lane reductions were \"a bad idea.\" These include the requirement that $5,000 worth of property be stolen or misapplied and that the misapplication be \"for an unauthorized purpose.\" The judge also told the jury that it had to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the purpose of the lane reductions was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a legitimate traffic study and that Defendants' good faith would be a complete defense to the charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 5141-42. Because the jury was instructed that Defendants could not be convicted if they believed in good faith that the reductions were part of a legitimate traffic study, a\n   jury following its instructions could not have convicted Defendants based on its personal judgments about the wisdom and execution of the traffic study.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Moreover, we observe that this definition, or even broader language, is contained in the model jury instructions in several of our sister circuits. It is included verbatim in the Section 666 pattern jury instructions from the Eighth Circuit. 8th Cir. Model. Crim. Jury Instr. \u00a7 6.18.666A.

Model. Crim. Jury Instr. \u00a7 4.18.656. The Ninth and Tenth Circuits both have pattern instructions for statutes containing \"willful misapplication\" that do not define those terms at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   9th Cir. Model.

They contend this error affects every count and constructively amended the indictment, \"permit[ing] the jury to convict based on conduct that was not unlawful.\" Baroni Br. at 63. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Defendants requested the object of the conspiracy be defined throughout the jury charge as one \"to misuse Port Authority property to facilitate and conceal the causing of traffic problems in Fort Lee as punishment of Mayor Sokolich.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 501-04, 506. The trial court disagreed, ruling \"the purpose or the object of the conspiracy being to punish Mayor Sokolich goes to motive,\" which is \"not an element of the crime\" and so \"not an element that has to be proven.\" J.A. 5009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   During deliberations, the jury sent a note asking: \"Can you be guilty of conspiracy without the act being intentionally punative [sic] toward Mayor Socholich [sic].\" J.A. 648. The judge responded: \"Yes. Please consider this along with all other instructions that have been given to you.\" J.A. 648.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   In their post-trial motions, Defendants argued the punishment of Mayor Sokolich was \"an essential element of each of the charged offenses,\" and that the failure to instruct the jury on this point relieved the Government of its burden of proof. J.A. 50. The trial judge again disagreed, explaining that \"any punitive goal Defendants may have had goes to their motive for violating the charged statutes, [but] is not an essential element of any of the crimes charged.\" J.A. 50. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Defendants argue the \"intent to punish Sokolich [is] an essential element of the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   of the charged offenses.\" Baroni Br. at 58. Once again, Defendants conflate motive with\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   intent and conduct. As we recently explained in\n   <em>\n    Hassan v.

Motive is what prompts a person to act. Intent refers only to the state of mind with which the particular act is done. Personal advancement and financial gain, for example, are motives for much of human conduct. However, these motives may prompt one person to intentionally do something perfectly acceptable, while prompting another person to intentionally do an act that is a crime. Motive is not an element of the offense with which a defendant is charged. Proof of bad motive is not required to convict. Further, proof of bad motive alone does not establish that the defendant is guilty. And proof of good motive alone does not establish that the defendant is not guilty. Evidence of the defendant's motive may, however, help you to determine his or her intent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   J.A. 5139; 3d Cir. Model. Crim. Jury Instr. \u00a7 5.04. The judge specifically instructed the jury that evidence of motive may be relevant to establishing\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   , thus allowing a juror who found evidence of motive lacking to vote for acquittal. Defendants were free to argue-and did argue-that they were not motivated by any desire to punish Mayor Sokolich. The jury's guilty verdict necessarily demonstrates no juror found motive so lacking as to raise a reasonable doubt concerning Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   guilt.

Rep. No. 98-225, at 370, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3511). And while Section 665 makes it a crime for an agency officer or employee to steal federal job training funds, there was no statute of general applicability pertaining to theft or embezzlement by such individuals.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523907\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/938/441/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Thus Congress enacted Section 666, in part, to correct the deficiencies in these provisions. \"The goal was to protect federal funds by authorizing federal prosecutions of thefts and embezzlement from programs receiving substantial federal support even if the property involved no longer belonged to the federal government.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-234\">\n    We note the jury was also instructed it could consider \"the value of the affected real property, including the lanes and toll booths as measured by the amount of tolls generated during the lane and toll booth reductions.\" J.A. 5110-11. In summation, the Government directed the jury to evidence demonstrating that the sole remaining Special Access Lane collected \"well in excess of $5,000\" during the week of the realignment. J.A. 5297. Defendants did not challenge the sufficiency of this evidence in their post-trial motions and do not raise the issue on appeal. And they concede \"the lanes and tollbooths can qualify as 'property' for\" Section 666. Kelly Br. at 40. This alone seemingly forecloses any argument the $5,000 threshold was not satisfied. But because our affirmance of Defendants' Section 666 convictions rests on their theft of employee labor, and the Government presented sufficient evidence the value of that labor exceeds $5,000, we decline to decide the issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-235\">\n    In its brief, the Government asserts it \"established that the lane diversion required $5,524.93 in pro-rated salaries of [Port Authority] employees to implement, and that is before the value of time Baroni and Wildstein spent on their mission to gridlock Fort Lee and cover up the reasons for that gridlock.\" Gov't Br. at 47 (citing J.A. 650-51). In support of this figure, the Government cited its post-trial sentencing memorandum. That memorandum contains a chart quantifying,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , the cost of labor provided by Hwang, Chung, Patel, the additional toll collectors, and Baroni and Wildstein. The source of these calculations was unclear, however, because the chart contains no citations to the trial record.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-236\">\n    At oral argument, the Government explained the calculations were established at trial through Port Authority payroll records, which had been admitted into evidence by stipulation, and testimony from Hwang, Chung, Patel, and Wildstein about how many hours each had worked on the fraudulent traffic study.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    Following oral argument, we requested the Government to file a supplemental letter brief addressing, with citations to the trial record, the evidence it presented to the jury to establish the property subject to the Section 666 counts is valued at $5,000 or more. We further ordered the Government to attach any relevant trial exhibits or stipulations it had not previously submitted. We also allowed Defendants to file a joint response. The Government timely filed its brief, and Defendants filed a joint response.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-238\">\n    The Government made this distinction at trial. In its summation, the Government argued:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-239\">\n    The defendants also agreed to misuse the time and the services of Port Authority employees. Those services have value. They're worth money. And that's Port Authority money. The Port Authority money that was paid to those employees. And because the Port Authority paid the salaries of each of the employees who wasted their time in furtherance of the defendants' scheme to punish the Mayor. And that includes the salary paid to the overtime toll booth collectors for the one remaining toll booth that was accessible to Fort Lee. That also includes the money paid to Baroni and Wildstein themselves while they spent time wasting, wasting their time in furtherance of this conspiracy. When they were suppose[d] to be working to advance the Port Authority's interests. And it includes money paid to the engineers who wasted time-and Port Authority professional staff, who wasted time collecting data that no one ever wanted.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-240\">\n    J.A. 5194.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-241\">\n    We earlier recognized the right in\n    <em>\n     Wellford v.
