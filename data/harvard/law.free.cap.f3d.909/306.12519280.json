SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The filing date of a bankruptcy petition determines the law governing exemptions and freezes the value of the exemptions that the debtor may claim. Because Debra Wilson's amended bankruptcy schedules sought to claim more than Washington law permitted her to claim as of the petition date, we affirm the district court's decision, limiting her claimed exemption to the amount she was entitled to under Washington law as of the petition date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Wilson filed her voluntary Chapter 7 petition for bankruptcy on December 18, 2013. In her initial Schedule C, Wilson elected to take the federal exemptions and listed the \"wildcard\" exemption. At the time the petition was filed, Wilson's one-bedroom condominium was valued at $250,000 and was subject to a $246,440 mortgage. Accordingly, Wilson listed the value of her exemption as $3,560, equal to the equity in her home as of the petition date. During the pendency of the bankruptcy, the value of the property increased. On July 18, 2016, Wilson amended her Schedule C, claiming \"100% of fair market value, up to any applicable statutory limit,\" listing the value of the property at $412,500. The amended schedule listed Washington's homestead exemption as the basis for the amended exemption. The Trustee, James Rigby, and the Bank, First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., opposed the amendments. After oral argument, the bankruptcy court held that an amendment to update the value of an exemption in light of post-petition changes in value was not permitted. Accordingly, the court held that Wilson could not claim more than $3,560 in the property. Wilson appealed to the district court, and the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court.

Here, there is no dispute that the \"net value\" of Wilson's home at the time she filed bankruptcy was the $3,560. That amount was all that Washington's exemption statute permitted her to exempt. The fact, that some debtors in our California cases were permitted to exempt more than the equity in their homes on the date of their bankruptcy petitions, does not establish Wilson's entitlement to do the same in Washington.

In\n   <em>\n    Alsberg\n   </em>\n   , the debtor's homestead property was appraised at $259,000 when he filed for bankruptcy, which amount was less than the deed of trust lien ($225,125) and tax liens ($86,000) encumbering the property. At the time, California's maximum homestead exemption was $45,000. Apparently because Alsberg believed that there was no equity in the homestead, he did not claim a homestead exemption in his schedules. However, postpetition, the homestead appreciated\n   in value and the trustee sold it, netting $121,000. After the sale, Alsberg amended his B-4 schedule to claim the $45,000 maximum California exemption. Alsberg then argued that the trustee was required to abandon the full $121,000 because at filing there was no equity in his homestead property for creditors, and therefore, the estate never had any interest in the property. Alsberg thus \"asserted that he was entitled to any appreciation in the value of the Property during the pendency of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Alsberg,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6524510\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/161/680/\">\n    161 B.R. at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, the trustee asserted that Alsberg could not receive any exemption because there was no equity in the property when Alsberg filed or, alternatively, that Alsberg's exemption was capped at $33,875-less than the full $45,000 California homestead exemption-because at filing that was the amount of equity in excess of the deed of trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The bankruptcy court disagreed with both parties and found that Alsberg was entitled to a full homestead exemption of $45,000, which amount included a portion of the property's postpetition appreciation, \"\n   <strong>\n    because the amount allowable as a homestead is determined when property is sold.\n   </strong>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6524510\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/161/680/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The bankruptcy appellate panel (\"BAP\") affirmed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6524510\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/161/680/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The BAP specifically framed the issue as \"[w]hether the trial court correctly held that the appreciation in the value of the Property during the pendency of the bankruptcy case belonged to the estate, not to Alsberg.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6524510\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/161/680/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finding that postpetition appreciation initially vested in the estate, the BAP made the logical subsequent finding: to the extent an applicable exemption exists, postpetition appreciation, an estate asset, will be exempted back out of the estate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6524510\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/161/680/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6524510\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/161/680/\">\n    at 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Applying this principle, the\n   <em>\n    Alsberg\n   </em>\n   court explained: \"Alsberg's California homestead exemption can be realized only from the net proceeds of sale received by the estate.... When Alsberg subsequently filed a claim for a $45,000 homestead exemption after the sale of the property,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     he became entitled to $45,000 of the proceeds\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and no more.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The facts in\n   <em>\n    Alsberg\n   </em>\n   are materially and legally indistinguishable from the facts here. However, the majority challenges\n   <em>\n    Alsberg\n   </em>\n   's authority, asserting that California's homestead exemption scheme is materially different from Washington's. The majority posits that California's exemption entitles every debtor to \"claim an exemption with a fixed dollar value, based on demographic criteria-not home equity\" and \"is always the statutory figure.\" The majority asserts this is in contrast to Washington's homestead exemption, which is materially different because it is \"tied to the equity in the debtor's home.\" This argument fails for at least three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, the distinction which the majority draws between the Washington and California statutes is illusory because even though the wording used in each is somewhat different, that is a difference without legal significance. In fact, the majority's attempt to distinguish California's exemption because it is \"based on demographic criteria-not home equity\" seems to be fashioned from whole cloth. The majority cites no case, nor have I found any, that has even mentioned, much less relied on, such a distinction or any other meaningful distinction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   To the contrary, there is, in my view, no meaningful basis for treating California's capped homestead exemption scheme differently from the federal and other state capped schemes. More importantly, this court has consistently concurred in that view. Ninth Circuit caselaw is clear that the legal principles applicable to the treatment of the homestead's postpetition appreciation, which were first established in cases arising out of California's exemption statute, are equally applicable to all other capped exemption statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re Gebhart\n   </em>\n   , a consolidated appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   this court made clear that its precedential\n   principles regarding how exempt property is defined and treated, including treatment of postpetition appreciation as an estate asset subject to the full homestead exemption, are not specific to or limited by any unique feature of the California exemption statute, as the majority contends.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gebhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784782,3777519\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/621/1206/\">\n    621 F.3d 1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1211 (9th Cir. 2010). Rather, these principles apply to \"all statutes that limit the value of an exemption to an 'interest' in property capped at a dollar value,\" such as Arizona's, California's, Washington's, and the Code's.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784782,3777519\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/621/1206/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, all capped homestead exemption statutes do not exempt the homestead property itself, but rather a capped portion of its equity value, and are subject to the same homestead exemption principles and analysis.

While it is true that the California statute does not specifically mention an equity limitation, that is of neither legal nor economical consequence. That is because in actual practice, and as a matter of basic economics, bankruptcy courts in California must, as do all states with a capped exemption, always cap the exemption at the lesser of the homestead's net equity or the designated maximum because the actual exempted amount will always be limited to, and can only be paid from, the net proceeds from the sale of the homestead.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bruton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118144\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/167/923/#p926\">\n    167 B.R. 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 926 (Bankr. S.D. Cal. 1994). Thus, California's exemption statute actually means, as does Washington's, that the debtor's exemption amount is the lesser of either the homestead's net proceeds at sale or the capped maximum amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In its attempt to distinguish Washington's exemption from California's, the majority also relies on dicta from\n   <em>\n    Hyman\n   </em>\n   stating that California\n   <em>\n    guarantees\n   </em>\n   debtors a specific homestead exemption amount.\n   <em>\n    In re Hyman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519867\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/1316/#p1321\">\n    967 F.2d at 1321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike taxes and death, however, nothing in California's homestead exemption scheme, nor in any other capped exemption scheme for that matter, guarantees any amount to the debtor. The only exemption guarantee in California, and again, as with all capped exemptions, is that debtors may only exempt and receive their homestead's equity, if any, up to the maximum statutory exemption amount. This is obviously the case because regardless of the maximum exemption the law permits, a debtor may only receive the exemption amount from the net proceeds generated by the sale of the homestead.\n   <em>\n    In re Alsberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413193,6473773\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/68/312/\">\n    68 F.3d at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Alsberg's California homestead exemption can be realized only from the net proceeds of sale received by the estate.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bruton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118144\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/167/923/#p926\">\n    167 B.R. at 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The amount that the debtor may claim as exempt for his homestead is $50,000.... However, since Bruton has only $16,981 equity in the property absent HOA's lien,\n   the available exemption for purposes of Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 522(f) is limited to $16,981.\"). Basic economic reality dictates that if the sale produces net proceeds in an amount less than the maximum homestead exemption, the debtor is limited to that lesser amount. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Hyman\n   </em>\n   's statement, and the majority's reliance on it, that California debtors are\n   <em>\n    guaranteed\n   </em>\n   a $45,000 homestead exemption, aside from being pure dicta, cannot be accurate in the bankruptcy context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Second, the majority's effort to distinguish Washington's homestead exemption statute from California's is also flawed because it ignores binding precedent involving exemption statutes other than California's. This precedent, arising in the consolidated\n   <em>\n    Gebhart\n   </em>\n   appeals involving federal and Arizona homestead exemption statutes, permits a debtor to increase the homestead exemption amount based on postpetition appreciation-as does California's statute. Like Washington's homestead exemption statute, the federal and Arizona statutes cap the homestead exemption at a specified maximum amount. As discussed in detail in the following section, the courts in both cases which\n   <em>\n    Gebhart\n   </em>\n   affirmed permitted debtors to claim increased homestead exemptions postpetition in order to take advantage of their properties' appreciation under federal and Arizona statutes respectively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gebhart,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784782,3777519\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/621/1206/\">\n    621 F.3d 1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court noted that the consolidated debtors' respective schedules at filing represented that there was no equity in the homestead properties and that the trustees were entitled to rely on debtors' representations. Therefore, this court rejected the debtors' contention that because trustees failed to timely object to their exemptions debtors' entire homestead properties, which had\n   subsequently appreciated in value, were excluded from the estates, as opposed to only the capped homestead exemption amounts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784782,3777519\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/621/1206/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784782,3777519\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/621/1206/\">\n    at 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And particularly relevant here, it is noteworthy that this court affirmed the lower courts, each of which held that even though the debtor was not entitled to exempt the homestead property itself, the debtor was entitled to the full homestead exemption amount, a portion of which was based on postpetition appreciation of the property, in line with\n   <em>\n    Alsberg\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A closer analysis of the underlying cases in\n   <em>\n    Gebhart\n   </em>\n   is instructive to the issues presented here. In\n   <em>\n    Klein v. Chappell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   when the husband and wife debtors filed they claimed that their homestead's fair market value was $350,000 subject to liens of $328,488, leaving $21,512 of equity, which they claimed as their federal homestead exemption. Thus, debtors' claimed homestead exemption was lower than $36,900, the maximum permitted under the Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 522(d)(1). Two years after debtors received their discharge, but while their case remained open, the debtors' mortgagee moved to foreclose on the homestead property because the debtors had defaulted. In response, the trustee moved the bankruptcy court for permission to sell the homestead property because he felt that its value had substantially appreciated. The debtors argued that the homestead could not be sold because they, upon filing their petition, had exempted the entire equity interest in the property, leaving nothing for creditors. The debtors contended that by doing so they \"withdr[e]w the entire fee from bankruptcy administration.\"\n   <em>\n    Klein v. Chappell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1091065\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/373/73/\">\n    373 B.R. at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The bankruptcy court found for the debtors, but the BAP reversed. The BAP held that the debtors were limited to, but also now entitled to, the maximum homestead exemption amount ($36,900) from the sale proceeds, even though at filing they had claimed only their homestead's then equity of $21,512 and that the estate retained the remaining sale proceeds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1091065\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/373/73/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1091065\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/373/73/\">\n    at 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, the BAP held, in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Alsberg\n   </em>\n   : \"Under well-settled Ninth Circuit law, any postpetition appreciation in value in the residence\n   <strong>\n    in excess of the maximum amount permitted by the exemption statute\n   </strong>\n   invoked inures to the benefit of the estate.

Moreover, a footnote emphasizes that very point. As the BAP explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Alsberg, Hyman, Reed\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Vu\n   </em>\n   the debtors claimed the maximum amount allowable by the California exemption scheme. In our case, the debtors limited their exemption to the difference between the value stated and the consensual liens, which was an amount substantially less than the maximum exemption available. While postpetition appreciation in value of property inures\n   to the benefit of the estate,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     the estate's interest in the appreciation must be limited by the ability of the debtors to obtain the maximum value of their federal exemptions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .

Thus,\n   <em>\n    Klein v. Chappell\n   </em>\n   , an opinion affirmed by this court, again confirms Wilson's position. There should be no doubt that\n   <em>\n    Klein v. Chappell\n   </em>\n   reaffirmed that in the Ninth Circuit, while the homestead and any appreciation in the homestead initially becomes estate property, that property is subject to the debtor's full homestead exemption, regardless of the amount of the debtor's claimed exemption or the homestead's equity when the petition is filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The majority contends that\n   <em>\n    Klein v. Chappell\n   </em>\n   is not precedential in that it does not involve a debtor's entitlement to postpetition appreciation up to the statutory maximum because the trustee had \"waived\" that issue. To the contrary, the trustee, in accordance with what the BAP accurately termed \"well-settled Ninth Circuit law,\" \"\n   <em>\n    conceded\n   </em>\n   \" that the debtor was entitled to the maximum exemption permitted by law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klein v.

There is an obvious and meaningful difference between an informed concession and a waiver. A concession involves accepting something as true or acknowledging defeat. A waiver, by contrast, is a voluntary relinquishment of a right, claim, or privilege. That the trustee, in the face of \"well-settled Ninth Circuit law,\" conceded that the debtors were entitled to the maximum federal homestead exemption is significant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1091065\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/373/73/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Gebhart v.

Thus, as did Wilson here, Gebhart initially claimed less than the maximum exemption permitted by Arizona law because at filing there was insufficient equity to provide revesting of the full allowable amount from the estate's sale of the homestead. As in\n   <em>\n    Hyman\n   </em>\n   , because the schedule facially reflected no equity in the homestead property in excess of the exemption claim, the trustee did not object to Gebhart's claimed exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Three years after filing, the trustee determined that Gebhart's homestead had substantially appreciated in value and sought to appoint a real estate broker to sell it. Gebhart objected, contending that he was entitled to the entire property because at filing he claimed as his exemption the full equity then existing in the property, thereby leaving nothing for the estate, and the trustee had failed to object. The bankruptcy court granted the trustee's request over Gebhart's objections, holding\n   that \"a chapter 7 trustee is entitled to the proceeds from the sale of the debtors' exempt homestead\n   <strong>\n    in excess of the exempt amount\n   </strong>\n   \" and that \"the excess belongs to the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of creditors.\"\n   <em>\n    Gebhart v.

In\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , the debtor listed her homestead value at $125,000 and claimed a $5,601 exemption, the amount of equity remaining after subtracting a mortgage lien of $106,898 and estimated sales costs.

But the majority's posited interpretation cannot be correct for a number of reasons. First and most obvious, that interpretation stands in sharp contrast to, and is irreconcilable with, what the\n   <em>\n    Gebhart\n   </em>\n   court actually did. Rather than freeze the debtors' exemption amount to the properties' equity claimed upon filing, the court permitted the debtors to postpetition increase their exemption claims up to the statutory capped amounts and to use a portion of the properties' postpetition appreciation to fund those amounts. The majority's interpretation is also irreconcilable with\n   <em>\n    Alsberg\n   </em>\n   , precedent upon which the\n   <em>\n    Gebhart\n   </em>\n   court relied in determining how postpetition appreciation is treated.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Tellingly, the majority's interpretation of that partial statement ignores the court's full discussion indicating, in conformance\n   with precedent, that when a homestead appreciates postpetition, the appreciation inures to the estate, but \"a portion is otherwise exempt.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . For example, the discussion preceding that partial statement informs as to its true meaning. There, the court observes that a dollar value exemption is limited to the exemption that debtor claimed at filing, but only \"when the total fair market value of the property is in fact greater than the exemption limit at the time of filing ... any additional value in the property remains the property of the estate regardless of whether the extra value was present at the time of filing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519867\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/1316/#p1321\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, when a debtor claims the maximum allowed exemption and at filing there is sufficient value to cover that amount, the debtor's exemption is frozen and he is not entitled to any of the property's appreciation. Conversely, it follows that if at filing there is insufficient value to meet the maximum exemption, the debtor is entitled to a portion of any appreciation up to the maximum exemption. This interpretation not only takes into account the\n   <em>\n    Gebhart\n   </em>\n   court's full discussion and what it actually did, but is also the only interpretation consistent with\n   <em>\n    Alsberg\n   </em>\n   and the other precedent which the\n   <em>\n    Gebhart\n   </em>\n   court cited with approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Moreover, the statement that exemptions are frozen on the filing date must be analyzed in the factual context in which it was made. Thus, it is important to note that the determinative issues in Wilson's case are different than those in\n   <em>\n    Gebhart\n   </em>\n   , keeping in mind that the court was discussing and ultimately rejecting the debtors' contention that section 522(a)(2)\"freezes the value of\n   <strong>\n    property\n   </strong>\n   claimed as exempt as of the date of the bankruptcy filing\" so that the\n   <strong>\n    estate\n   </strong>\n   was not entitled to any postpetition appreciation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519867\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/1316/#p1321\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). In both of\n   <em>\n    Gebhart's\n   </em>\n   two consolidated cases, the debtors contended that the trustees had effectively abandoned the homestead properties because the trustees did not object to debtors' homestead exemption claims which claimed all of the properties' purported equities at filing, which amounts were less than the maximum allowed homestead exemptions. Thereafter, the debtors claimed the appreciated properties themselves, the values of which had substantially increased to amounts greater than the statutory exemption cap. The ultimate issue in\n   <em>\n    Gebhart\n   </em>\n   was whether the trustees were entitled to the postpetition appreciation which exceeded the statutory cap such that they could sell the homestead properties or whether, instead, the debtors were entitled to all of the appreciation such that the trustees would have no interest in the homestead properties. In that different context,\n   <em>\n    Gebhart\n   </em>\n   held in both cases that the trustee did not have to object to the debtor's schedules which represented no value in the homestead property above the exemption claim, that the property was still estate property, and \"the estate [was] entitled to postpetition appreciation in the value of property a portion of which [was] otherwise exempt.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519867\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/1316/#p1321\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1211 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Alsberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413193,6473773\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/68/312/\">\n    68 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   314-15 ).

However, the majority draws a faulty conclusion from this limited principle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The majority is correct that section 541(a)(1) defines one category of estate property to include, \"all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\" However,\n   the majority treats the estate's postpetition category of property defined in section 541(a)(6) differently by classifying it as property that may never be exempted from the bankruptcy estate, notwithstanding that section 541(a)(6) is part of the list of all properties which section 541(a) includes as \"property of the estate.\" Section 541(a) states: \"The commencement of a case under ... this title creates an estate. Such estate is comprised of all of the following property, wherever located and by whomever held.\" Section 541(a)(6), the sixth category of that estate property, includes: \"proceeds, product, offspring, rents, or profits of or from property of the estate ...\" The majority acknowledges that \"proceeds, product, offspring, rents, or profits,\" which without question includes appreciation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   are part of the bankruptcy estate, but curiously concludes that only the debtor's property that transfers to the estate at filing, rather than the debtor's property which transfers postpetition, is subject to exemptions under section 522.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The majority's position is not supported by statute or caselaw. To the contrary, as discussed above, prohibiting a debtor from exempting postpetition appreciation from the estate contravenes binding precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   To say that debtor's property, including its appreciation, vests in the estate, says nothing about the debtor's right to revestment of a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of that property pursuant to debtor's homestead exemption. This is because all of debtor's property, including appreciation, must initially inure to the estate before the proceeds from the sale of such property may ultimately be distributed to those claiming an interest in the estate property, e.g., creditors, and, of course, debtors, by virtue of exemption or abandonment. It is axiomatic that the only property subject to exemptions is that which becomes part of the estate, but no statute or caselaw limits a debtor's right to exempt only that property which entered the estate at the commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

Thus, permitting Wilson to amend her schedules to assert Washington's full homestead exemption is required by the Code's text and this court's binding precedent.

The majority contends that the \"snapshot rule\" directly supports its position that the claimed\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of the exemption, as opposed to only the right to assert a specific exemption claim, is indelibly fixed at filing. The majority's interpretation of the snapshot rule is an unjustified extension of that rule as applied by the caselaw on which the majority relies.

More to the point, the extension of the snapshot rule as posited by the majority-that the amount of debtor's exemption claim at filing may not be amended to reflect postpetition appreciation-ignores this court's precedent to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   This court has explained that in applying a state homestead exemption statute, courts should look to \"clearly defined rights with respect to\" the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141327\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/266/310/#p313\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With respect to Washington's exemption statute, it does not, nor does the Code for that matter, provide that a homestead exemption is limited to the amount claimed at filing or set a deadline for asserting the full exemption. To the contrary, as discussed above, Washington's homestead exemption is determined by and is applied to the \"surplus proceeds from a ... sale ... such that a judgment creditor's claim is limited to funds in excess of the homestead, if any.\"\n   <em>\n    Sweet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1592356\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/88/199/#p200\">\n    88 Wash.

The snapshot rule, as properly construed, is not relevant here because at the time Wilson filed her petition, the exemption for which she qualified read the same as it does today: \"the homestead is exempt from attachment and from execution or forced sale for the debts of the owner up to the amount specified in RCW 6.13.030.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%206.13.070\">\n    Wash.

Guiding Bankruptcy Principles\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   As indicated above, there are three undisputed fundamental principles which must guide the court's analysis here, none of which have been discussed, much less taken into account, by the majority or the courts below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   First, the overarching and well-established purpose of the bankruptcy scheme is to \"grant a fresh start to the honest but unfortunate debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    Marrama v. Citizens Bank of Mass\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/#p367\">\n    549 U.S. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 367,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/#p367\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/#p367\">\n    166 L.Ed.2d 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (internal quotations omitted).

How better to assist\n   an honest but unfortunate debtor's fresh start than to permit her to claim the maximum applicable statutory homestead exemption amount? It is noteworthy that Wilson, unlike the debtors in\n   <em>\n    Hyman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Alsberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Klein v.

Importantly, in\n   <em>\n    Michael\n   </em>\n   , this court expressly held that, pursuant to a debtor's right to freely amend under Bankruptcy Rule 1009(a), a debtor may amend her bankruptcy schedules to claim a homestead exemption for the first time postpetition.\n   <em>\n    In re Michael,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11781153,11774777\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/163/526/\">\n    163 F.3d at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (permitting debtors to amend bankruptcy schedules to claim homestead exemption more than one year after the date of filing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The denial of Wilson's right to amend her exemption claim in order to obtain Washington's maximum homestead exemption to which she is entitled is an impermissible denial of a substantial portion of Wilson's homestead exemption. Nothing in the Code limits the amount of a debtor's state law homestead exemption to the amount of equity claimed in the property on the filing date. Moreover, denying Wilson's right to amend is inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Michael\n   </em>\n   and Bankruptcy Rule 1009(a). In contrast to the majority's position that a debtor's exemption amount is always limited to the amount claimed at filing, this court in\n   <em>\n    Michael\n   </em>\n   was intent on \"implement[ing] the policy of liberally allowing the debtors to amend their exemption claims in order to enhance their fresh start.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Michael\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11781153,11774777\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/163/526/\">\n    163 F.3d at 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is counterintuitive and an illiberal interpretation of the exemption laws to hold that a debtor may amend her bankruptcy schedules to claim a homestead exemption for the first time postpetition, as permitted in\n   <em>\n    Michael\n   </em>\n   , but to deny a debtor the right to amend her bankruptcy schedules to postpetition increase her homestead exemption\n   claim. Both scenarios allow a postpetition amendment and a greater exemption for the debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In an attempt to justify denying Wilson's full exemption, the majority relies on section 522(a)(2)'s term-of-art definition of \"value\" to support fixing the exemption amount to the equity amount claimed on the filing date. Such reliance is ill advised for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the section's clear language. While section 522(a)(2) provides that \"\n   <strong>\n    in this section\n   </strong>\n   , 'value' means fair market value as of the date of the filing of the petition,\" the word \"value\" is noticeably absent from, and thus inapplicable to, section 522(b)(3)(A), which authorizes debtors to utilize state law exemptions rather than federal exemptions. \u00a7 522(a)(2) (emphasis added). In contrast, section 522 includes the word \"value\" in several other irrelevant federal exemption sections, such as within section 522(d)(2), which federally exempts a \"debtor's interest, not to exceed $3,775 in\n   <em>\n    value\n   </em>\n   , in one motor vehicle.\" \u00a7 522(d)(2). That the defined term \"value\" is present in some sections but not section 522(b)(3)(A), the only section relevant here, clearly indicates that the defined term \"value\" plays no role in Wilson's homestead exemption analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conn.

In fact, the only limitation in the Code on a debtor's right to exempt property under\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   law is that the exemption statute must be \"applicable on the date of the filing of the petition to the place in which the debtor's domicile has been located\" for a period of time prior to filing. \u00a7 522(b)(3)(A). Moreover, nothing in section 522 limits exemptions to property that entered the estate on the filing date, as opposed to property that entered the estate postpetition.\n   <em>\n    See gen.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 522.
