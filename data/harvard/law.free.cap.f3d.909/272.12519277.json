SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case comes before us once again after a decade-long journey within the federal court system. In these final stages of the litigation, Petitioners-Appellants (Independent Living), a group of health care advocacy organizations and medical care providers, and Intervenors-Appellants (Intervenors, and together with Independent Living, Appellants), another group of\n   health care providers and organizations, seek an award of attorneys' fees from the Director of the California Department of Health Care Services (the Director), and possibly others. We hold that the district court erroneously concluded that Appellants were not entitled to seek fees pursuant to California Civil Procedure Code \u00a7 1021.5. In addition, we hold that the district court abused its discretion in denying Independent Living's motion to set aside fees from the retroactive monetary relief obtained in 2010. Accordingly, we remand to the district court to determine whether, in light of our ruling, Appellants meet the requirements to obtain attorneys' fees pursuant to \u00a7 1021.5 and Section III (C)(1)(a) and (b) of the Settlement Agreement (\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ), and whether it is possible and appropriate at this stage of the litigation for Independent Living to recoup attorneys' fees \"from Medicaid providers that purportedly obtained a benefit from counsel's work,\" pursuant to Section III (C)(1)(c) of the Settlement Agreement, and that received payments from the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) as a result of this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Medicaid Act authorizes the federal government to distribute funds to states for the purpose of providing medical assistance to low-income persons. Participating states are subject to certain conditions.\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587457\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1378/#p1382\">\n    135 S.Ct. 1378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1382,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587457\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1378/#p1382\">\n    191 L.Ed.2d 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). One such condition is the \"equal access\" provision (Section 30(A) ), which requires that states set provider reimbursement rates that are \"sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(30)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 16, 2008, the California legislature enacted Assembly Bill X3 5 (AB 5). AB 5 reduced the Medi-Cal-California's Medicaid program-rate of reimbursement for healthcare providers by ten percent. These cuts took effect on July 1, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 22, 2008, Independent Living filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court a petition for a writ of mandamus against the DHCS and the Director, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 1085 (the \u00a7 1085 Writ). The petition alleged that the ten percent rate reduction enacted pursuant to AB 5 violated Section 30(A), thereby conflicting with federal law, and violating the Supremacy Clause. In addition to the \u00a7 1085 Writ, Independent Living sought an injunction preventing the implementation of AB 5, as well as attorneys' fees pursuant to California's Private Attorney General Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201021.5\">\n    Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 1021.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On May 19, 2008, the Director removed this action to federal court based on federal question jurisdiction, and Independent Living filed the \u00a7 1085 Writ in federal court. On June 1, 2008, Independent Living dismissed the DHCS from its action, leaving only the Director as a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 25, 2008, the district court denied Independent Living's motion for a preliminary injunction preventing the enforcement of AB 5. We vacated that decision on July 11, 2008, holding that a plaintiff \"may bring suit under the Supremacy Clause to enjoin implementation of a state law allegedly preempted by federal statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Indep.

On August 27, 2008, the court modified its injunction to apply only prospectively from the date of the injunction because sovereign immunity purportedly barred retroactive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal, we analyzed whether retroactive application of the injunction violated California's sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    Indep.

We first found this retroactive relief would violate California's sovereign immunity absent the Director's waiver of that immunity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187075\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/606/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187075\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/606/\">\n    at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We then noted that the Director would have waived sovereign immunity by removing the suit to federal court if California had previously consented to similar suits in state court.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Consequently, after reviewing numerous California state court decisions that permitted \u00a7 1085 mandamus actions seeking disbursement of unlawfully withheld funds, we held that the Director had waived sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187075\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/606/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187075\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/606/\">\n    at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, we concluded that the injunction should also have applied retroactively to Medi-Cal payments between the time of AB 5's implementation and the date of the district court's injunction (the retroactive period).\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 15, 2010, Independent Living moved to set aside a portion of the monies paid, or to be paid, to Medicaid providers for the retroactive period to set up a fund from which attorneys' fees could be paid. The district court dismissed this motion because it believed it was premature and that \"[n]either side has provided any reason why [the court] at the conclusion of the case could not fashion an order requiring ... California to pay attorneys' fees based on what is ultimately the value of any judgment or settlement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2011, the United States Supreme Court granted the Director's petition for a writ of certiorari with respect to the Supremacy Clause issue. Preceding oral argument before the Supreme Court, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency in charge of administering Medicaid, disapproved the Director's submitted plan amendments to implement AB 5 because they did not satisfy Section 30(A).\n   <em>\n    Douglas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187075\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/606/\">\n    132 S.Ct. at 1209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, after oral argument, and before the Supreme Court issued its opinion, CMS approved some of the pending amendments.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Supreme Court ultimately held that CMS's decisions regarding the plan amendments changed the procedural posture of the case, and remanded it to our court to consider whether the providers could maintain an action pursuant to the Supremacy Clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1209-11. The Supreme Court thus vacated, but did not reverse, our decision affirming the preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following\n   <em>\n    Douglas\n   </em>\n   , the parties resolved this case in mediation, and produced a Settlement Agreement specifying the terms of their concord. In Sections III (C)(1)(a) and (b) of the Settlement Agreement, Appellants reserved the right to move for attorneys' fees before the district court. The state retained the right to oppose any such request. In addition, Section III (C)(1)(c) of the Settlement Agreement permitted \"any plaintiffs' attorney\" who had appeared in one of the listed cases to seek attorneys' fees \"from Medicaid providers that purportedly obtained a benefit from counsel's work,\" but not from \"DHCS or any of the State Released Entities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Independent Living and Intervenors separately moved for attorneys' fees pursuant to \u00a7 1021.5. The district court denied the motions, reasoning that this case involved only federal law claims, so the district court could not award attorneys' fees pursuant to a state-law provision like \u00a7 1021.5. Independent Living and Intervenors timely appealed, and their consolidated appeals are before us now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Availability of Attorneys' Fees Under \u00a7 1021.5\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The central question in this appeal is whether Appellants brought a\n   <em>\n    state-law claim\n   </em>\n   or a\n   <em>\n    federal claim\n   </em>\n   , for the answer to that question will determine whether they are entitled to seek attorneys' fees pursuant to California's \u00a7 1021.5 in federal court. We hold that Appellants brought a state-law claim, and that they are therefore permitted to seek fees pursuant to \u00a7 1021.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Federal Question Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Director argues that despite Appellants' only cause of action being the \u00a7 1085 Writ, their action involved \"solely\" federal law, which permitted the federal courts to exercise federal question jurisdiction. However, the fact that the federal courts exercised federal question jurisdiction does not automatically determine whether Appellants' claim was based on federal or state-law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Director removed this case based on federal question jurisdiction. With good reason, we originally understood Appellants' cause of action to constitute a suit pursuant to the Supremacy Clause to enjoin state legislation allegedly preempted by a federal statute (here, the Medicaid Act).\n   <em>\n    Shewry\n   </em>\n   , 543 F.3d at 1062, 1065-66. In so concluding, we relied in part on\n   <em>\n    Shaw v.

Finally, the Court held that Section 30(A) of the Medicaid Act did not confer a private right of action under federal law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1387. Thus, in short order, the Supreme Court determined that neither the federal statute nor the Constitutional provision at issue here provides similar plaintiffs a cause of action.

This argument is meritless. In order to prevail on a contract theory, Appellants would have had to show that, at the least, they were third-party beneficiaries entitled to enforce a valid contract between the federal and state governments-a requirement that might have been impossible to show.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanchez v.

Regardless, Appellants never attempted or needed to make that showing, because this case was not litigated as an action on a contract. Therefore, in order for Appellants to recover fees under \u00a7 1021.5, the \u00a7 1085 Writ must stand on its own as a state-law cause of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Although Appellant's breach-of-contract theory is unavailing, we conclude that in this case the \u00a7 1085 Writ endured as a state-law claim. A brief survey of relevant cases clearly shows that California courts have deployed \u00a7 1085 much as it was used in this case. Section 1085 provides that \"any court may\" issue a writ \"to any inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, to compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station ....\" Cal.

However, a recent California appellate court decision called into question the future viability of using \u00a7 1085 Writs to enforce Section 30(A) violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santa Rosa Mem'l Hosp., Inc. v.

Relying heavily on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   , the California Court of Appeal held that a \u00a7 1085 Writ could not issue where the Medicaid Act did not provide for private enforcement of Section 30(A) and Section 30(A)'s broad standards for rate setting impeded a clear duty to perform.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 206-207. The California Supreme Court has not decided this issue and, arguably, the California Court of Appeal decisions are split. Still, the potential ability of Appellants to prosecute this precise case under \u00a7 1085 if they filed again\n   <em>\n    today\n   </em>\n   is largely immaterial to whether they could have properly initiated such a state-court action\n   <em>\n    in 2008\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Ultimately, it is clear that, under California law, \u00a7 1085 Writs may issue to compel state agencies to comply with federal requirements. That is the essence of Appellants' claim. Moreover, a significant portion of Appellants' success was due to our interpretation of state law. In\n   <em>\n    Maxwell-Jolly\n   </em>\n   , we analyzed California law to determine whether sovereign immunity precluded Appellants' claim for retroactive relief. We held that it did not, acknowledging, \"Under California law, an action seeking injunctive relief that requires a state official to disburse funds is not an action against the State.\"\n   <em>\n    Maxwell-Jolly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670916\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/572/644/#p660\">\n    572 F.3d at 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The overlapping concerns of federal law did not transform the \u00a7 1085 Writ into a federal claim, for as\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   elucidated, there was simply no federal right of action to be had.

Several Medicaid providers and recipients (the Appellants here) claimed that the discounted reimbursement rate was so low that it was inconsistent with the mandate in \u00a7 30(A) of the Medicaid Act, which requires states to keep the rate high enough to ensure that there are sufficient provider options.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants' argument was that the California Legislature's action ran afoul of the Supremacy Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Appellants petitioned for a Writ of Mandate in state court pursuant to \u00a7 1085 of California's Code of Civil Procedure. They sought to bar the California Department of Health Care Services (\"DHCS\") and its director from imposing the discounted reimbursement rate. The Director removed\n   the action to federal court, and after several years of litigation, the parties settled their dispute.

Here, nothing was ever remanded, and as they had done from the beginning, Appellants continued to seek a judgment establishing that California's imposition of a cut reimbursement rate was unlawful because it conflicted with \u00a7 30(A)'s mandate.

If we were ruling on the merits,\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   likely would require dismissal of Appellants' claims, but the parties settled their dispute before\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   was decided and we are tasked only with identifying the nature of the claims the parties resolved. Pre-\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   , California state courts had issued writs of mandate to force compliance with \u00a7 30(A),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 280-81, and Appellants' insistence that the State had violated \u00a7 30(A) presented significant litigation risk to the State.

Motion to Set Aside Attorneys' Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   I also agree that it was an abuse of discretion to deny Appellants' motion to set aside attorneys' fees from the $70 million reimbursement. Moreover, it is hard to see anything that would prevent the district court from recouping funds to which the Appellants' attorneys may be entitled, as long as the relief ultimately comes from providers who received a windfall as a result of the earlier reimbursement, and those providers have an opportunity to be heard on any proposed plan for recoupment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Although we lack jurisdiction over the individual beneficiaries of the original reimbursement fund (i.e., the various medical care providers), the court continues to have jurisdiction over the Director and presumably it will be the Director who will be responsible for reimbursing providers for services yet to be furnished. I see no absolute obstacle to gradually recouping an appropriate fee amount either as part of a fractionally reduced reimbursement payment to the overcompensated providers or through some comparable process. The Director pointed out in her briefing at the time the Appellants moved for a set aside\n   that there are inefficiencies and transaction costs associated with adjusting the department's automated payouts. However, those difficulties do not appear to be sufficiently onerous to warrant denying Appellants' counsel a fee award to which they may be entitled.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The parties dispute whether a writ under \u00a7 1085 is best described as a remedial mechanism or a cause of action under California law; in reality, California courts have employed both descriptors.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kreeft v.
