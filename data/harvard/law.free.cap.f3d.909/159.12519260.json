Petitioner was denied relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1) and 1229b(b)(1). For the reasons set forth below, we\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Petitioner is a native and citizen of Poland. Petitioner's wife is a lawful permanent resident of the United States, and she and Petitioner have a son who is a United States citizen. Petitioner last entered the United States, to remain, in April 1999. The Department of Homeland Security commenced removal proceedings against Petitioner on October 14, 2016, by filing with the immigration court a notice to appear, charging Petitioner with being removable pursuant to 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) as an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 4, 2017, Petitioner filed an application for cancellation of removal. Petitioner's hearing before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") took place on May 8, 2017, at which Petitioner, his wife, and his son testified. On May 15, 2017, the IJ issued an order denying Petitioner's application. The IJ's order found that Petitioner was a \"habitual drunkard\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1) and was therefore unable to prove that he was a person of \"good moral character\" during the ten-year period prior to his application, as is required under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1) to be eligible for cancellation of removal. The IJ relied on evidence that Petitioner had been convicted five times on drunk driving charges and once as a \"Disorderly Person\" related to being drunk in public. This latter conviction and two of the drunk driving convictions were within the ten-year period before Petitioner's application, while three of the drunk driving convictions fell outside this period. The IJ cited Petitioner's high blood alcohol content levels at the time of his arrests as evidence of Petitioner's high tolerance, as well as testimony by Petitioner and his family members that he was an alcoholic. The IJ also found that Petitioner was not of good moral character because he had been confined in a penal institution for longer than the statutory limit set forth by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioner appealed that decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\" or \"Board\"), and on November 3, 2017, the\n   BIA dismissed Petitioner's appeal. The Board disagreed with the IJ's finding as to \u00a7 1101(f)(7), but affirmed the IJ's determination that Petitioner was a \"habitual drunkard.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following the Board's decision, Petitioner petitioned this Court for review pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Attorney General may cancel the scheduled removal of a nonpermanent resident from the United States under various circumstances. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b). One such circumstance is where a nonpermanent resident meets the following four requirements: (1) he has been continuously physically present in the United States for at least ten years, (2) he has exhibited good moral character during that time, (3) he has never been convicted of any of a list of enumerated criminal offenses, and (4) he demonstrates that removal would result in \"exceptional and extremely unusual hardship\" to his family members who are lawfully present in the United States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1229b(b)(1).

Petitioner argues that \u00a7 1101(f)(1) should be struck down as void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause.

Recently, the Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, was divided on the question of whether alcoholism alone was enough to fit the definition of habitual drunkard, or whether there needed to be some harmful conduct associated with one's drinking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ledezma-Cosino v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276751\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/1042/\">\n    857 F.3d 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2017) (en banc).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The dictionary definitions of \"habitual drunkard\" from around the time the statute was passed are not very helpful. Two entries emphasize the loss of willpower; another requires \"a fixed habit of frequently getting drunk, though not oftener drunk than sober, and though sober for weeks at a time;\" another states that \"[i]t is not necessary that the person shall have lost his will power ... or that he be intoxicated so often as to incapacitate him from attending to his business for a considerable portion of time.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   839 (4th ed. 1951) (citations omitted). However, \"[w]hether a statutory term is unambiguous ... does not turn solely on dictionary definitions of its component words ...

First, the canon that different words in a statute have different meanings supports this conclusion, since Congress used both \"habitual drunkard\" and \"chronic alcoholic\" in the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, ch. 477,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20Stat.%20182\">\n    66 Stat. 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (codified as amended at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (generally rendering ineligible for visas and excluding from the United States \"[a]liens who are narcotic drug addicts or chronic alcoholics\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20Stat.%20172\">\n    66 Stat. 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (codified as amended at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1) ) (excluding from the category of \"person[s] of good moral character\" those who during the relevant period were \"habitual drunkard[s]\"). If Congress had intended \"habitual drunkard\" to mean \"chronic alcoholic,\" Congress would have simply used the latter term in \u00a7 1101(f). Because Congress instead used \"habitual drunkard,\" we can reasonably infer that the term means something different from \"alcoholic.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Further, the canon of\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   makes clear that Congress intended the term \"habitual drunkard\" to focus on an individual's conduct, as opposed to his or her status as an alcoholic alone. \"[T]he commonsense canon of\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   ... counsels that a word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674164\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/285/#p294\">\n    553 U.S. 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 294,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674164\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/285/#p294\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674164\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/285/#p294\">\n    170 L.Ed.2d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). Using this canon, we find that each term in \u00a7 1101(f) focuses on conduct rather than status. For example, \u00a7 1101(f)(4) and (5) refer to those \"whose income is derived principally from illegal gambling activities\" and \"who ha[ve] been convicted of two or more gambling offenses\" during the relevant period, respectively; they do not refer to being a gambling addict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress also incorporated by reference into \u00a7 1101(f) some items from the list in what is now \u00a7 1182, but notably Congress excluded other items on the list, such as \"[a]liens who are feeble-minded;\" \"[a]liens who are insane;\" \"[a]liens afflicted with psychopathic personality, epilepsy, or a mental defect;\" and, as discussed, \"[a]liens who are narcotic drug addicts or chronic alcoholics ....\" Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, ch. 477,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20Stat.%20172\">\n    66 Stat. 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These excluded items focus on a person's status, whereas the categories included in \u00a7 1101(f) focus on conduct. This suggests Congress intended \"habitual drunkard\" to do the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Together, this is sufficient evidence to conclude that Congress intended the term \"habitual drunkard\" to focus on the\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   associated with an applicant's drinking, rather than solely on whether the applicant has the\n   <em>\n    status\n   </em>\n   of an alcoholic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Because the term \"habitual drunkard\" focuses on an individual's conduct-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the harm to others or negative consequences to society that results from one's drinking-Petitioner's equal protection challenge falls flat. A tendency to drink to excess and engage in harmful conduct is, under the statute, rationally related to lacking good moral character, and the statute therefore survives rational basis review. As discussed above, this is so regardless of whether the categorization is somewhat over- or underinclusive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Because Congress could find that habitual drunkenness was rationally related to lacking good moral character, we hold that\n   \u00a7 1101(f)(1) does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Due Process Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Petitioner alleges that the Immigration Judge and the BIA violated his Due Process rights by considering evidence outside of the relevant ten-year period and by harboring bias against him. This Court lacks jurisdiction over these claims because Petitioner did not properly preserve them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This Court may review a final order for removal \"only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as a matter of right.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Accordingly, this Court may review only those claims \"properly presented to the BIA and considered on their merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Ramani v.
