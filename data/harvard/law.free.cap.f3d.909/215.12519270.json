He pleaded guilty to four counts of wire fraud in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is his second appeal of his sentence. On the first appeal, we affirmed the judgment of the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   with one exception: we remanded the case for an independent determination of whether another participant\n   in the scheme, M.U., should be considered a victim of Binkholder's scheme for purposes of sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Binkholder\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Binkholder I\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351178\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/923/#p931\">\n    832 F.3d 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 931 (8th Cir. 2016). On remand, the district court concluded that M.U. was a victim under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2B1.1. It then resentenced Binkholder. Binkholder appeals the district court's determination under \u00a7 2B1.1 and several other issues arising from the resentencing. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   M.U.'s status as a victim has been at issue in this case more than once. In 2015, the district court held an evidentiary hearing on whether M.U. was a victim of Binkholder's scheme-if M.U. was a victim, the total loss associated with Binkholder's scheme would result in a greater enhancement to Binkholder's Guidelines offense level. On February 9, 2015, it found that M.U. was not a victim \"for sentencing purposes\" because, although he may have lost some money due to fraud, he was complicit in Binkholder's scheme. M.U. then asked the district court to recognize him as a victim under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), which would allow him restitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203771\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court refused, based on its earlier finding that M.U. was not a victim. M.U. filed a petition for a writ of mandamus asking this court to order the district court to recognize him as a victim under the CVRA. We granted M.U.'s petition and directed the district court to vacate its February 9 order and enter an order recognizing M.U. as a victim under the CVRA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court did so. At Binkholder's May 15 sentencing, he renewed his argument that M.U. should not be recognized as a victim under Guidelines \u00a7 2B1.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court refused based on the writ of mandamus, calculated the Guidelines range using M.U. as a victim under \u00a7 2B1.1, and sentenced Binkholder accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Binkholder appealed. We affirmed all aspects of the district court's judgment except M.U.'s status as a victim. We explained that \"the determination of who is a victim under the CVRA is not necessarily dispositive of who is a victim under the Sentencing Guidelines.\"\n   <em>\n    Binkholder I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351178\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/923/#p931\">\n    832 F.3d at 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the district court improperly collapsed the two victim status determinations, we remanded the case \"so that the district court may determine in the first instance whether M.U. was a victim under the Guidelines and, if necessary, proceed to resentencing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351178\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/923/#p931\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351178\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/923/#p931\">\n    at 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On remand, the district court concluded, based on the evidence presented at the 2015 hearing, that M.U. was a victim under \u00a7 2B1.1 because (1) M.U.'s money was used to further Binkholder's scheme without M.U.'s knowledge; (2) M.U. sustained an actual loss of more than $1 million; and (3) this court had already determined that M.U. was a victim under \"the CVRA's narrower definition of victim.\" The district court then resentenced Binkholder, using the same version of the Guidelines, calculating the same Guidelines range, and imposing the same sentence as it did at the initial sentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We review the district court's findings regarding an individual's status as a victim under the Guidelines for clear error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Contrary to the district court's reading, we did not describe the CVRA definition of victim as \"narrower\" than the Guidelines definition. Nevertheless, we do not believe that the district court's ultimate determination-that M.U. is a victim under the Guidelines-was erroneous. Guidelines \u00a7 2B1.1 defines a victim as \"any person who sustained any part of\" the \"reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\" The district court found that M.U. sustained a monetary loss because of Binkholder's scheme. Those factual findings are not clearly erroneous, and they support the conclusion that M.U. was a victim under \u00a7 2B1.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Binkholder also challenges the constitutionality of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203742\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). This statute requires district courts, when resentencing after remand from a direct appeal, to use the version of the Guidelines that was \"in effect on the date of the previous sentencing of the defendant prior to the appeal.\" The district court, following \u00a7 3742(g)(1), applied the 2014 Guidelines on resentencing. Binkholder would have preferred the application of the more favorable 2016 Guidelines, which had gone into effect by that time. He points to the Guidelines' general instruction in \u00a7 1B1.11(a) to \"use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced.\" He contends that \u00a7 3742(g)(1) is an irrational exception to the general rule of \u00a7 1B1.11(a) and that its differential treatment of defendants who are resentenced violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We review the constitutionality of a statute de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But they do not receive the unwarranted benefit of a favorable change in the Guidelines-unless the change was made retroactive, in which case it would be available to all defendants regardless of the outcome of a direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
