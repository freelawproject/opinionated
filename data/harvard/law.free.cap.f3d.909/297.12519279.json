On appeal they argue, first, that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions. We disagree and, therefore, reach their additional arguments concerning trial error. We hold: (1) the instruction defining \"harbor\" was erroneous because it did not require the jury to find that Defendants intended to violate the law, and the error was not harmless; and (2) the instruction defining \"reckless disregard\" was plainly erroneous because it did not require the jury to find that Lili subjectively drew an inference that the alien was, in fact, an alien and was in the United States unlawfully; the instruction may have affected the outcome of the trial, and the error constitutes a miscarriage of justice, warranting a new trial, because the jury could have convicted Defendants on an invalid legal theory. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In September 2013, Defendants traveled from their home on Saipan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (\"CNMI\") to China, Lili's native country, with their two children. Lili is a legal permanent resident of the United States through her marriage to Frank. While in China, Defendants met X.N.'s father, who asked Defendants to take 10-year-old X.N., a Chinese national, home with them to attend school in the United States. Lili contacted a friend of hers who knew someone who had brought a child to the United States to study in the past, and the friend told Lili that it was possible to bring X.N. to the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants returned to the CNMI with X.N. on September 26, 2013. The CNMI has a \"parole\" program designed to support its tourism industry. Pursuant to this program, Chinese and Russian nationals may enter the CNMI without a visa and stay for up to 45 days. United States Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") requires proof of a ticket booked on a return\n   flight within the 45-day window before an alien may \"parole in\" to the CNMI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At immigration control in the Saipan airport, CBP sent Lili and X.N. to \"secondary processing\" for a more thorough investigation because X.N. was a minor traveling without her parents. Lili presented a notarized letter of authorization from X.N.'s parents stating that Lili and Frank would be X.N.'s guardians during her studies in the United States. She also told the CBP officer that they were going to \"see how it would work out having X.N. stay with [us] and go to school.\" The officer told Lili to get the authorization letter stamped at the local police station, but otherwise said nothing about X.N.'s attending school on Saipan. At some point during processing, Lili or X.N. showed proof that X.N. had a return flight to China booked for October 28, 2013. The parole program allows a seven-day buffer from the date of a return ticket to account for problems that might prevent a flight from departing as scheduled, so the officer stamped the I-94-a paper record of entry and departure dates-in X.N.'s passport with \"Nov 04 2013\" to indicate that X.N. had to leave the CNMI by November 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After passing through immigration control, Defendants and X.N. went through customs. Frank filled out a customs declaration form for his family and X.N. In the section that asked about the purpose of the trip, Frank filled in the bubble for \"Returning Resident.\" He filled in only the CNMI bubble in the section that asked for country of permanent residence, but he also wrote X.N.'s name under \"Travelers,\" provided her correct passport number, and listed China as her country of citizenship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   About two weeks after returning to Saipan, Defendants enrolled X.N. in public school. Lili stated that she did not apply for a student visa for X.N. because the school never asked for one; Lili simply gave the school a copy of X.N.'s passport and the authorization letter. Defendants also filled out other forms to enroll X.N. in school, including a consent to disclose X.N.'s directory information and a hand-drawn map accurately depicting the location of their house relative to the school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   X.N. lived with Defendants until February 2015. After X.N. left her home, Lili voluntarily spoke to an agent from Homeland Security and signed a written statement. The statement acknowledged that Lili understood \"that there are immigration laws\" and that she \"had to follow certain steps and pay certain fees\" to obtain her green card. Lili also said that she \"had [X.N.]'s passport and saw the I-94 showing she was paroled in until November 2013.\" An agent present for Lili's interview testified, on cross-examination, that the interviewing agent did not ask Lili if she knew what an I-94 was. He could not recall whether the interviewer asked Lili if she knew what a student visa was. The agent also testified that Lili said she knew what \"being paroled in\" meant. The government indicted Defendants after Lili's interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants moved for acquittal after the close of the government's case. The district court denied both motions. Following their convictions, Defendants timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Only Lili's mental state was truly in dispute at trial. Lili admitted seeing\n   X.N.'s I-94 and the mandatory departure date of November 4, 2013 (indeed, Lili personally brought X.N. through immigration control), yet Lili kept X.N. in her house long after that mandatory departure date passed. Lili also understood that the United States has immigration laws, and she understood that obtaining legal status (as she did) requires an alien to follow certain procedures. The evidence also showed that Lili expected to be paid for keeping X.N. in the family home. On this record, a rational juror could have found that Lili knew that X.N.'s continued presence in the United States was unlawful after November 4, 2013, and that Lili intended to violate the immigration laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   With respect to Frank, the fact that he was named as a guardian in the Chinese letter of authorization from X.N.'s parents is circumstantial evidence tending to show that he actively participated in the plan to bring X.N. to the CNMI for a period longer than is authorized by law. And as the district court observed, Frank knew that, when X.N. came to Saipan, she had a return ticket to China booked for October 28, 2013, within the parole period. A rational juror could conclude that Frank intended to give X.N. a place to live long after her parole period ended and that he had a financial motive for doing so: Defendants' family had modest income, and Frank was an active participant in what occurred. For example, he flew to China with Lili to bring X.N. back to Saipan, he filled out the customs form at the border, and he enrolled X.N. in school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In short, the evidence-viewed in the light most favorable to the government-is sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find that Lili harbored an illegal alien and that Frank had the specific intent to facilitate Lili's commission of that crime. Therefore, Defendants are not entitled to outright reversal of their convictions. We turn, then, to Defendants' claims of instructional error and their request for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Meaning of \"Harbor\" and the Necessary Mens Rea\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Title\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201324\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A)(iii) criminalizes the conduct of any person who:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law, conceals, harbors, or shields from detection, or attempts to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection, such alien in any place, including any building or any means of transportation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Here, the court instructed the jury simply that the term \"harbor\" \"means 'to afford shelter to.' \" The instructions did not include any requirement that the jury consider whether Defendants intended to violate the law. Defendants asked the court to instruct the jury that it had to find that they sheltered X.N. for the specific purpose of avoiding detection by immigration authorities. The court declined to give that proposed instruction.

In concluding that the evidence sufficed even though the defendant did not have the specific intent to prevent detection, we held that-as the court instructed here-\"harbor\" means \"afford shelter to.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1074587\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/531/428/#p429\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1074587\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/531/428/#p429\">\n    at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   addressed an earlier version of the statute but, like the present statute, it criminalized \"conceal[ing], harbor[ing], or shield[ing] from detection\" an unlawful alien.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1074587\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/531/428/#p429\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 429 n.1.

We are not persuaded. The opinion considered the question at some length, relying on two analogous decisions in which we held that a district court should have instructed the jury that it must find that the defendants intended to violate the law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6035347\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/382/958/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6035347\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/382/958/\">\n    at 965-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the discussion was the sole analytical underpinning for the conclusion that an additional instruction was not needed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barapind v.

One way to demonstrate such an intention is to prove that the defendant sought to prevent immigration authorities from detecting an illegal alien's presence. But that is not the only way. For example, a defendant who chooses to publicize her harboring of an illegal alien in order to call attention to what she considers an unjust immigration law intends to violate the law, even though she does not intend to prevent detection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The omitted instruction was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, because it went to the heart of Lili's primary defense-that she did not understand the immigration laws and did not act with the intent to violate the law. Indeed, the government expressly concedes that, if the harboring instruction was erroneous, the error was not harmless.

The government provided uncontested evidence of the other elements of harboring an illegal alien: that X.N. was an alien, that X.N. remained in the United States unlawfully, and that Lili afforded shelter to X.N. And the government offered strong evidence on the mental-state element: Lili brought X.N. through immigration control and saw the I-94 with a mandatory departure date of November 4, 2013, yet she kept X.N. in her home until 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   X.N. also had a return flight (that she never boarded) booked within the parole program's 45-day window. That reservation suggests that\n   <em>\n    someone\n   </em>\n   connected to X.N. knew the requirements of the parole program, but the evidence did not definitively show that Lili booked the flight or even knew about it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Lili's defense strategy focused on sowing doubt about whether she knew (or knew of the risk) that X.N.'s continued presence on Saipan was unlawful. Through cross-examination and some of the government's exhibits, substantial evidence emerged from which a reasonable jury could infer that Lili-despite knowing of facts from which a reasonable person would infer the risk of X.N.'s presence being unlawful-did not\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   draw that inference\n   <em>\n    herself\n   </em>\n   , as\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   requires.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266837\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/1151/\">\n    880 F.3d at 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lili said that she consulted with a knowledgeable friend before agreeing to bring X.N. to the United States, and the friend told her that it was possible to bring a child to the United States to study. Lili also explicitly told a CBP officer, while going through immigration control, that X.N. would attend school on Saipan; she received no response to that information other than an instruction to have the authorization letter from X.N.'s parents stamped at the local police station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Moreover, Lili gave the public school extensive documentation connecting herself to X.N.-something the jury could have inferred that she might not have done had she appreciated the facts of X.N.'s unlawful status. Among other things, Lili gave the school the authorization letter listing herself and Frank as X.N.'s guardians, a consent form to release X.N.'s directory information to the public, and a hand-drawn map showing precisely where Defendants lived. Lili also said that she never sought a student visa for X.N. because the school never asked for one and simply accepted X.N.'s passport and the notarized letter from her parents in China. One reasonable view of that evidence is that Lili did not realize that X.N. needed\n   other documents to make her long-term presence in the United States legal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In sum, Lili has shown more than a mere possibility that the jury would have reached a different verdict if properly instructed on reckless disregard.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez-Aguilar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4049717\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/1185/#p1189\">\n    718 F.3d at 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
