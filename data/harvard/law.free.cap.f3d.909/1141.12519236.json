Section 7703(b)(1)(A) includes two sentences. The first sentence states: \"[e]xcept as provided in [ \u00a7 7703(b)(1)(B) and \u00a7 7703(b)(2) ], a petition to review a final order or final decision of the [MSPB] shall be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207703\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A).

For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Kloeckner v.

The majority improperly erects a jurisdictional hurdle and dismisses Ms. Graviss's Petition for Review, which was filed only one day late, by refusing to recognize that \u00a7 7703(b)(1)(A) 's sixty-day filing deadline is a claim-processing rule. I believe this case raises a question of exceptional importance with the majority's holding directly contrary to binding Supreme Court precedent, and I respectfully dissent from denial of the petition for rehearing en banc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As I have previously noted in dissent, the parties have been waiting eight years to resolve this case. After its convoluted history in this court, the case is now resolved by the panel dismissing the appeal for want of appellate jurisdiction, and the full court's denial of the petition for\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In dismissing the appeal, the panel majority relied on an earlier case,\n   <em>\n    Fedora v.

But as I explained in my dissent in\n   <em>\n    Fedora\n   </em>\n   (we were the same three-judge panel in that case as in this one), the statutory time requirement to appeal a case from an agency to an Article III court is not per se mandatory and jurisdictional-the rule is and has been to the contrary.
