We conclude that the photographers are not bound because they are not intended beneficiaries of the agreements, nor are they closely related parties. Our conclusion means that one District Court got it right, and the other got it\n   wrong. But mandamus is an extraordinary remedy. Because the erring District Court's mistakes were not clear or indisputable, we decline to issue the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ed Kashi and Bob Krist are professional photographers. Kashi resides in Montclair, New Jersey, while Krist resides in New Hope, Pennsylvania. To market their photographs, Kashi and Krist entered into representation agreements with Corbis Corporation, a stock photography agency. The agreements provided Corbis authority to sub-license the photographers' works to third parties on a non-exclusive, fixed-duration basis. In exchange, Kashi and Krist received a percentage of the fees negotiated by Corbis. The fees were reported to the photographers in periodic royalty statements. The royalty statements listed each photograph licensed and the fees collected, but did not identify the product in which the photograph would be used or specify the scope of the license. In addition to the royalty statements, the photographers had the right to request an audit once a year of Corbis' records with respect to their images.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The legal terms of the representation agreements were robust. Exemplar agreements in the record\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   include assignment of rights to recover, as well as forum selection clauses. Paragraph 6, titled \"Protection of Accepted Images,\" reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Corbis, in its sole discretion and without obligation to do so, shall have full and complete authority to make and settle claims or to institute proceedings in Corbis' or your name but at Corbis' expense to recover damages for Accepted Images lost or damaged by customers or other parties and for the unauthorized use of Accepted Images.\n   </strong>\n   You shall provide reasonable assistance in Corbis' efforts in connection with such claims or proceedings. Any recovery, after payment of all costs and expenses including outside attorneys' fees, shall be treated as Revenue and you shall receive the appropriate royalty, or 100% in the case of lost/damaged images.\n   <strong>\n    Following your notification, if Corbis declines to bring such a claim within sixty (60) days, we shall notify you, and you may bring actions in your own name at your own expense and retain all recoveries.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Krist App'x 132 (emphasis added). A forum selection clause in paragraph 12.3, titled \"Law,\" reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, irrespective of its conflict of law rules. In any action arising out of this Agreement, you consent to personal jurisdiction and the exclusive venue of the state and federal courts sitting in New York City, New York.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   MHE App'x 308, 320, 332, 354; Krist App'x 133.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Acting upon its authority under the representation agreements, Corbis sub-licensed Kashi and Krist's photographs to McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings LLC and McGraw-Hill School Education Holdings LLC (collectively \"McGraw-Hill\" or \"MHE\"), publishers of educational materials for K-12, college, and post-graduate students. Corbis utilized a two-step process in sub-licensing photographs to McGraw-Hill. First, Corbis negotiated a series of master agreements known as \"Preferred Pricing Agreements\" (PPAs), which set forth volume-based pricing and other terms. Second, Corbis issued invoices for all of McGraw-Hill's licensure purchases. The invoices constituted McGraw-Hill's license to use each image. They detailed the scope of the license, including limitations \"by publication, number of copies, distribution area, image size, language, duration and/or media (print or electronic).\" MHE App'x 165. The invoices also listed the price to be paid by McGraw-Hill for each image, and included the name of the photographer responsible for the work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Each invoice incorporated by reference Corbis' standard \"Terms and Conditions,\" which governed the transaction alongside the terms set forth in the PPAs. Both the Terms and Conditions and the PPAs included mandatory, exclusive forum selection clauses, with nearly identical language. Titled \"Choice of Law / Jurisdiction / Attorneys' Fees,\" the clause reads in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Any dispute regarding this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, and by Titles 15, 17 and 35 of the U.S.C., as amended, and the parties agree to accept the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York, New York, regardless of conflicts of laws.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   MHE App'x 284 (2014 PPA);\n   <em>\n    cf. id.\n   </em>\n   at 237 (Terms and Conditions revised Nov. 19, 2001). The only material difference between the forum selection clauses in the PPAs and in the Terms and Conditions is that the PPAs specify \"New York, New York\" as the forum,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 284, while the Terms and Conditions specify \"New York, USA,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 237.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2016 and 2017, respectively, Krist and Kashi each brought a copyright action against McGraw-Hill in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Krist and Kashi both allege that McGraw-Hill used their photographs beyond the terms of the Corbis licensure agreements, in violation of federal copyright law. The photographers allege a range of ways in which their photographs were used without permission, including exceeding the allowed number of publications printed, the geographic distribution area, the type of medium, and the time period for publication. In each proceeding, McGraw-Hill moved to transfer venue under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). It argued that the disputes implicate the Corbis-McGraw-Hill agreements, and that per the terms of those agreements, the proper venue was the United States District\n   Court for the Southern District of New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Honorable Wendy Beetlestone, presiding over the\n   <em>\n    Kashi\n   </em>\n   action, denied the transfer motion. Judge Beetlestone reasoned that because Kashi's claims are based purely on copyright law, the action is not a \"dispute regarding th[e] Agreement[s],\" and thus not subject to the forum selection clauses contained in the Corbis-McGraw-Hill agreements. MHE App'x 5. Judge Beetlestone further concluded that, absent an applicable forum selection clause, McGraw-Hill had not met its burden under \u00a7 1404(a) to warrant a transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Honorable Legrome Davis, considering a parallel motion in the\n   <em>\n    Krist\n   </em>\n   action, reached the opposite conclusion. Judge Davis determined that the dispute\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a dispute regarding the agreements, because the copyright claims depend upon the interpretation of the Corbis-McGraw-Hill agreements. Judge Davis held that despite Krist's status as a non-signatory, he was subject to the forum selection clause as an intended third-party beneficiary. Judge Davis also concluded that it was foreseeable that Krist would be bound under the Corbis forum selection clause. In light of those findings, Judge Davis granted the \u00a7 1404(a) transfer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   McGraw-Hill proceeded to file a petition for a writ of mandamus, asking this Court to direct a transfer of the\n   <em>\n    Kashi\n   </em>\n   action. Krist also petitioned for a writ of mandamus, doing so after his motion for reconsideration was denied. Krist asks this Court to direct a vacatur of the transfer order. The petitions were consolidated and referred to this panel. They present a range of doctrinal issues bearing on the ultimate question: whether either District Court erred in such a manner that mandamus is warranted. Numerous other actions implicating the Corbis forum selection clause have been adjudicated in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which have similarly yielded divergent results. The petitioners argue that the divergence of views speaks to the need for a ruling on mandamus. We agree that clarity is needed, yet the reasoned divergence of views militates against granting the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

First and foremost, McGraw-Hill argues that the photographers benefit\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   from the agreements. Second, it argues that the listing of the photographers' names on the Corbis invoices demonstrates McGraw-Hill's and Corbis' intent to benefit the photographers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We reject McGraw-Hill's first argument out-of-hand. The photographers were not entitled to any compensation as a\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   result of the Corbis-McGraw-Hill agreements. The photographers receive compensation only by operation of the separate representation agreements they entered into with Corbis. McGraw-Hill points to no provision of the PPAs or invoices that directly entitles either photographer to anything.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Moreover, McGraw-Hill's \"direct\" beneficiary theory is contrary to the examples provided in the Restatement. As an illustration from the Restatement explains: \"B contracts with A to buy a new car manufactured by C. C is an incidental beneficiary, even though the promise can only be performed if money is paid to C.\" Restatement cmt. e. ills. 17. The manufacturer in that illustration is not a party to the sale, and it is not owed performance under the\n   terms of the sale. Rather, it is owed performance under the terms of its contract with the dealer. Likewise here, the photographers are\n   <em>\n    incidental\n   </em>\n   beneficiaries of the Corbis-McGraw-Hill agreements; they are owed compensation only by virtue of\n   <em>\n    their own\n   </em>\n   contracts with Corbis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Judge Davis reasoned that the\n   <em>\n    limitations\n   </em>\n   contained in agreements between McGraw-Hill and Corbis directly benefit the photographers. He explained that Krist benefits from the limitations on the use of the copyrighted material, including limitations on the size of the images, numbers of copies, and duration of use. Krist App'x 375. Judge Davis stated that \"[p]rovisions limiting the actions of a contracting party that are intended to benefit a third party make the third party an intended beneficiary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6504696,10523417\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/938/338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For this proposition, Judge Davis cited an illustration from the Restatement. In it, a downstream landowner is an intended beneficiary of a contract between an operator of a fertilizer plant and a municipal sewer authority because the contract includes a term intended to prevent harm to that landowner, namely, a term requiring the removal of specified types of waste from the fertilizer plant's wastewater.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6504696,10523417\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/938/338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Restatement cmt. d. ills. 10). We cannot agree. Krist is the exclusive owner of the rights to reproduce, distribute, and display the photographs by virtue of the Copyright Act. McGraw-Hill is an infringer to the extent it exceeds any license that Krist or a sub-licensor granted it. The limitations in the license are not a contractual benefit to Krist, because his right to those limitations arises from the Copyright Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Judge Davis also reasoned that the invoices' \"specific listing of the copyright holder for each licensed image evidences the intent of the parties to benefit the copyright holders.\" Krist App'x 376. Kashi and Krist do not offer a strong rebuttal to this reasoning. At oral argument, counsel for the photographers suggested that the identification of the photographers was for the sole purpose of enabling the publisher to list a photo credit, as was required for purposes of the publication. Oral Arg. 22:33-22:50. Overall, Judge Davis did not place strong emphasis on this point, and the invoices alone do not provide sufficient evidence of an intent to bestow contractual rights or benefits on the photographers. For example, in one of the illustrations from the Restatement quoted above, although the name of the car manufacturer will likely be listed on the contract between the buyer and seller, the manufacturer is still not an intended beneficiary of that contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, the photographers argue that McGraw-Hill should be estopped from asserting an intended third-party beneficiary argument because of a position it took in prior litigation over the Corbis agreements. McGraw-Hill argues vigorously against estoppel. In light of our conclusion that the photographers are not intended third-party beneficiaries, we need not consider the application of estoppel. We do, however, take note of McGraw-Hill's previous arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In an earlier case in the Southern District of New York, a photographer in privity with Corbis attempted to assert rights under the Corbis-McGraw-Hill agreements, including a provision that entitled Corbis to bill the publisher \"ten (10) times the normal license fee for any unauthorized use.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defending against the photographer's\n   right to bring an action under the contract to which it was a non-signatory, McGraw-Hill argued that the photographers were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   intended third-party beneficiaries. In its briefing on a motion to dismiss, McGraw-Hill cogently summarized the intended third-party beneficiary doctrine, then argued that the Corbis Terms and Conditions \"identify as the parties to their arrangements only MHE and Corbis, and they contain both anti-assignment and integration clauses and\n   <em>\n    do not identify any third party in their choice of forum provisions\n   </em>\n   .\" Krist App'x 439 (emphasis added). McGraw-Hill argued that this \"strongly suggest[s] that the two parties to the contract intended the contract to concern and to benefit only themselves.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6504696,10523417\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/938/338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6504696,10523417\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/938/338/\">\n    at 439-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Subaru Distribs.

We consider this reasoning compelling, much more so than the arguments in favor of contractual third-party beneficiary status that McGraw-Hill has raised in these cases. We also note that while McGraw-Hill made a full-throated explication of the intended third-party beneficiary doctrine in the\n   <em>\n    Lefkowitz\n   </em>\n   matter-in order to argue\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   the doctrine's application-McGraw-Hill only feebly invoked the doctrine before the District Court in the cases before us. Indeed, as McGraw-Hill concedes in a supplemental letter brief, the term \"intended beneficiary\" did not appear in their opening briefs filed in the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The photographers are not closely related parties.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   McGraw-Hill invokes another doctrine to argue that the photographers should be bound as non-signatories to the Corbis-McGraw-Hill agreements: the closely related parties doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The closely\n   related parties doctrine is a form of equitable estoppel. This Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    DuPont\n   </em>\n   that it had \"never applied an equitable estoppel theory to bind a non-signatory to an arbitration clause although there appears to be no reason why, in an appropriate case, we would refrain from doing so.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9467471\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/269/187/#p196\">\n    269 F.3d at 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \"In determining whether a non-signatory is closely related to a contract, courts consider the non-signatory's ownership of the signatory, its involvement in the negotiations, the relationship between the two parties and whether the non-signatory received a direct benefit from the agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Carlyle Inv.

The record establishes only that they were in privity with Corbis for the purpose of licensing artwork. Moreover, there is no evidence that the photographers were involved in contract negotiations between Corbis and McGraw-Hill. Finally, the photographers did not, in any natural reading of the word, receive a \"direct\" benefit from the Corbis-McGraw-Hill agreements. Accordingly, there is precious little basis for applying the closely related parties doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Despite error, mandamus is not warranted on this issue alone.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Having concluded that the District Court in\n   <em>\n    Krist\n   </em>\n   erred in its conclusion that Krist has intended third-party beneficiary status and in transferring his case on the basis that the forum selection clause applied to him, we must next consider whether this error was a \"clear and indisputable abuse of discretion or ... error of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Howmedica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275273\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/390/#p399\">\n    867 F.3d at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We do not find Judge Davis' error here so clear as to meet that standard. Judge Davis was correct that the photographers were identified in each invoice. And while we disagree with his conclusion that the invoices rendered Krist a direct beneficiary, the result, as it pertains to this conclusion, cannot be said to \"approach[ ] the magnitude of an unauthorized exercise of judicial power.\"\n   <em>\n    Commc'n Workers of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541744\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/932/199/#p208\">\n    932 F.2d at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While arguments raised in other cases do not bind us, we do consider the larger jurisprudential landscape in the context of mandamus. We acknowledge the existence of a sharp split in the decisions of judges\n   in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and within the District of New Jersey on the question of the applicability of the forum selection clause at issue here. Some of those decisions have concluded that photographers were intended beneficiaries of the Corbis-McGraw-Hill agreements, or that the photographers were so closely related to those agreements that enforcement of the forum selection clause was justified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having reviewed the analysis in the other cases and the arguments raised in those actions, we cannot conclude that the error committed by Judge Davis is clear and indisputable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Even so, we proceed to analyze other issues addressed by the two District Court judges, because a clear and indisputable error on any determination necessary for transfer might warrant mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Was enforcement foreseeable?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Foreseeability is a prerequisite to applying the closely related parties doctrine. That is, before binding a non-signatory as a closely related party, we require a finding that enforcement of the clause by or against the non-signatory would be foreseeable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howmedica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275273\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/390/#p399\">\n    867 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   407 n.13 ;\n   <em>\n    Magi XXI, Inc. v.

Likewise, we require a foreseeability finding when enforcing a forum selection clause against an intended beneficiary. In\n   <em>\n    Coastal Steel\n   </em>\n   , we held that the plaintiff could not avoid a forum selection clause on account of its third-party beneficiary status.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=709%20F.2d%20190\">\n    709 F.2d at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Coastal chose to do business with Farmer Norton, an English firm, knowing that Farmer Norton would be acquiring components from other English manufacturers.

He first concluded that it was foreseeable to Krist that Corbis would contract with licensees, and that Krist may be a third-party beneficiary to those agreements. Krist App'x 377. This much is obvious: Krist entered into an agreement with Corbis\n   <em>\n    for the very purpose\n   </em>\n   of having Corbis sub-license his photographs. And because Krist was owed monetary compensation under his agreement with Corbis, it was foreseeable that he may have been deemed an intended beneficiary of those agreements. It is also foreseeable that Corbis' contracts with licensees would contain forum selection clauses. After all, the photographers' own contracts with Corbis contained such clauses, and as the District Court reasoned, they are quite common.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=709%20F.2d%20190\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing secondary source material). But the District Court made no finding that Krist could have foreseen that those clauses would specify New York, New York as a forum. While the District Court noted that Corbis' standard Terms and Conditions were published on Corbis' webpage, the District Court made no finding that Krist had ever visited the webpage or had seen an explicit reference to those terms and conditions. The fact that it was\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   for Krist to access the Terms and Conditions on the website does not establish that it was foreseeable that he would be subject to those terms as a third-party beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James v.

As the photographers argue, there is \"no evidence these Terms &amp; Conditions or the FSC therein were ever 'reasonably communicated' or otherwise made known to Kashi. Although Kashi received royalty statements from Corbis that provided limited information, Kashi did not receive copies of the Invoices that Corbis issued to MHE.\" Kashi Resp. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   A foreseeability finding in the context of forum selection clauses must have some evidentiary basis, other than pure speculation, that the party sought to be bound had an awareness of the clause, its contents, and that it might be defensively invoked. Krist argues for a higher bar. He argues that foreseeability requires a finding that the clause and its contents had been \"reasonably communicated\" to the party against whom enforcement is sought. Krist Pet'r 19 (citing\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. Audio Active Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047242\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/378/#p384\">\n    494 F.3d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 383 (2d Cir. 2007) ). But our case law, notably\n   <em>\n    Coastal Steel\n   </em>\n   , did not set such a high bar, and we decline to raise that bar today. What\n   <em>\n    Coastal Steel\n   </em>\n   does require is that the\n   <em>\n    actual forum\n   </em>\n   be foreseeable, and that there be some evidentiary basis for such a finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In light of this standard, we conclude that Judge Davis' foreseeability finding was insufficient. The online Terms and Conditions cannot suffice, and Judge Davis made no finding as to the foreseeability of a\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   forum. Yet we cannot say, on the record before us, that this error was so clear as to warrant mandamus. Indeed, there was other evidence in the record on which Judge Davis could have relied to bolster his foreseeability finding: namely the exemplar representation agreements. Krist has not refuted-and Kashi has conceded-that the photographers' representation agreements with Corbis contained a forum selection clause that specified New\n   York, New York. Oral Arg. 30:38-31:15, 48:21-49:08; Kashi Resp. 39-40 (conceding that Kashi's representation agreement contained a New York forum selection clause). At the very least, these clauses provide evidentiary support for a finding that enforcement of a\n   <em>\n    New York, New York\n   </em>\n   forum selection clause was foreseeable-the photographers were aware that Corbis preferred that forum. Because he had this evidence before him, Judge Davis' finding was not clear and indisputable error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Do the copyright claims fall within the scope of the Corbis FSC?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Judge Davis held that the copyright claims depend upon the licenses because\n   <em>\n    unauthorized\n   </em>\n   use is part of the plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case in the copyright context. The Second Circuit employs this approach when only the\n   <em>\n    scope\n   </em>\n   of the license is at issue.\n   <em>\n    Bourne v. Walt Disney Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414330\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/68/621/#p631\">\n    68 F.3d 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631 (2d Cir. 1995). In other words, where the plaintiff concedes the existence of a license, the burden may fall on the plaintiff, in the first instance, to demonstrate that the scope was exceeded. We have yet to consider that doctrine and have no cause to consider it today. Indeed, the plaintiffs doggedly refuse to concede the existence of licenses, even when pressed at oral argument. Oral Arg. 27:36-29:30. But that refusal to concede is not the reason we decline to adopt the\n   <em>\n    Bourne\n   </em>\n   rule. Rather, we recognize that on the facts of the cases before us, we could not hold plaintiffs to such a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The licenses obtained by McGraw-Hill were not granted by the photographers directly but by Corbis as a sub-licensor. And the royalty statements received by the photographers lacked specific detail as to the scope of each license granted. Kashi Resp. 7, 37 (citing Kashi Supp. App'x 1). As such, it stands to reason that the photographers may not be aware of each license issued, or the scope of each license. Because they were not themselves directly privy to those licenses, we cannot expect them to plead unauthorized use as part of a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case. As the Seventh Circuit recognized when considering this very issue, \" 'proving a negative is a challenge in any context,' and if there is evidence of a license, it is most likely to be in the possession of the purported licensee.\"\n   <em>\n    Muhammad-Ali v.

Kashi Resp. 30; Krist Pet'r 12. Under their reading,\n   <em>\n    even if\n   </em>\n   they are bound by the forum selection clause, their private interests must be considered on a \u00a7 1404(a) motion. In other words, they ask us to hold that the\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   modification applies only when all parties\n   <em>\n    signed\n   </em>\n   the contract-it does not apply when nonsignatories, regardless of their status as third-party beneficiaries or as closely related parties, are present in the action.\n   <em>\n    Howmedica\n   </em>\n   did not go so far, and we reject their request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   This argument is most easily analyzed through use of a counterfactual. Suppose a non-signatory intended third-party beneficiary brings a breach of contract claim, as would be his right under traditional principles of contract law. Despite his non-signatory status, he is fully aware of the contract and its terms. Indeed, he expressly bases his claim on the terms of the contract. The contract also contains a forum selection clause, and his breach of contract claim falls within the scope of that clause. As such, there is no question that the non-signatory is bound by the forum selection clause. Despite being bound by that clause, the plaintiff files his breach of contract suit in a jurisdiction other than the one specified in the clause. The signatory defendant invokes the forum selection clause and moves to transfer venue under \u00a7 1404(a). In this case, must the district court consider the non-signatory plaintiff's choice of forum and private interests? Or does the court consider only the public interest factors, per\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The latter must be true. Such an eyes-wide-open plaintiff-one who gets the benefit of the parties' bargain and has the corresponding right to sue-would be bound by the terms of the forum selection clause just as the signatories would be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The facts before us are different, but the underlying principle is the same. The\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   modification applies to the \u00a7 1404(a) transfer inquiry if: (1) a non-signatory is bound by a forum selection clause under traditional contract law principles; (2) enforcement of the clause against him was foreseeable; and (3) his claim falls within the scope of the clause. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   recognized that foreseeability offsets \"[w]hatever 'inconvenience' [a party] would suffer by being forced to litigate in the contractual forum.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/49/\">\n    571 U.S. at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    The\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bremen v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   These petitions raise complicated issues concerning forum selection clauses. We conclude that the District Court in\n   <em>\n    Kashi\n   </em>\n   reached the correct result in declining to transfer the action. We conclude that the District Court in\n   <em>\n    Krist\n   </em>\n   erred in transferring the action, but the error was not clear\n   and indisputable. As such, we decline to issue a writ of mandamus in either case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Kashi and Krist came to court with exactly the same claim against McGraw-Hill; their license agreements with Corbis were identical; they both defended against identical McGraw-Hill motions to transfer; and they even had the same lawyer. Yet, the District Courts came to opposite conclusions-the\n   <em>\n    Kashi\n   </em>\n   court denied McGraw-Hill's transfer motion and the\n   <em>\n    Krist\n   </em>\n   court granted it. Now, on petitions for mandamus, the two cases have been consolidated. Even though the majority finds that the\n   <em>\n    Krist\n   </em>\n   court erred in transferring the case, it fails to correct the error and leaves opposing District Court decisions untouched. The majority prioritizes adherence to the strict standards of mandamus relief over judicial consistency and equal treatment of the parties. I do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The majority concludes that even though the District Court in\n   <em>\n    Krist\n   </em>\n   should not have granted McGraw-Hill's motion to transfer, mandamus is not warranted. Specifically, in Krist's case, it holds that the judge's error in transferring the action was not \"a clear and indisputable abuse of discretion or ... error of law,\" and even if it was, there is no basis for exercising our discretion to grant the writ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It emphasizes the incredibly high bar petitioners must meet in order to receive mandamus relief and tells us that even if petitioners do meet the bar, the court can still deny mandamus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the majority fails to grapple with the fact that its decision permits the incongruous and unfair treatment of essentially indistinguishable litigants. Krist is left in the dust of this decision, correct on the law but without his remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Leaving undisturbed contradictory decisions in these two identical and consolidated cases promotes judicial inconsistency. Litigants-and the public at large-expect courts to come to the same conclusion when presented with the same claims and facts. Allowing opposite results in two consolidated cases with the same legal issues and the same factual background-even when done in the name of adherence to the strict standards of mandamus relief-erodes the integrity of and the public trust in the courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, in other contexts, federal courts have corrected contradictory, yet factually analogous, lower court decisions in the name of judicial consistency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In addition to promoting inconsistency, the majority's decision violates basic principles of fairness. While Kashi pursues his case in the forum he originally chose, Krist is forced to litigate in a forum of the defendant's choosing. Litigants should come to our courts knowing that the merits of their claims and defenses will determine the outcome of their cases-not the judge randomly selected to be on the case. Instead, the majority tells Krist that his judge made the wrong decision but that he cannot have the same remedy as Kashi. This result is unfair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Therefore, I propose a modified mandamus standard when considering whether to grant a writ in consolidated petitions. First, we should consider whether denying mandamus would create an inconsistent result or unequal application of law. If so, the petitioner need not show \"a\n   <em>\n    clear\n   </em>\n   abuse of discretion or\n   <em>\n    clear\n   </em>\n   error of law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, it is sufficient for the petitioner to show simply reversible error. In other words, the first factor in the three-factor test for granting mandamus relief\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   would not be such a \"high bar\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   in a consolidated petition like this one. If we were to apply this modified standard here, because \"the District Court in\n   <em>\n    Krist\n   </em>\n   erred in its conclusion ... and in transferring his case,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the\n   <em>\n    Krist\n   </em>\n   court committed reversible error. Krist met the modified standard for factor one. We would then grant Krist's writ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   As the majority reminds us, relief via a writ of mandamus is extraordinary and judges should \"proceed both carefully and courageously in exercising their discretion\" to grant a writ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   There are good reasons why mandamus relief is rare and difficult to achieve. Such relief disrupts a case's \"flow through the judicial system\" and \"is contrary to the common law policy of avoiding piecemeal appellate review of cases.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   If every potentially erroneous decision could be resolved on a writ of mandamus, our appellate courts would be overwhelmed and litigants would await final resolution of their cases far longer than they already do.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   However, these concerns are minimized here due to the limited application of this proposed modification. The lower standard for factor one of the mandamus test would only apply to (1) consolidated petitions for mandamus; (2) where the district courts had come to opposite decisions on substantially similar facts; and (3) where denying mandamus would create incompatible results and/or an unequal application of law. Such cases are extremely rare. This narrow exception makes room in our mandamus jurisprudence for judicial consistency and equal administration of justice without risking significant disruptions in litigation\n   or increases in burdensome piecemeal litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority's decision to deny mandamus in\n   <em>\n    Krist\n   </em>\n   , and concur with the ruling that mandamus is not warranted in\n   <em>\n    Kashi\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    The actual representation agreements signed by Kashi and Krist are not in the record.
