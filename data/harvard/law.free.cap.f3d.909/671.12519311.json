On appeal, Allen contends that the district court committed two sentencing errors: 1) in increasing his base offense level due to his prior conviction of a \"controlled substance offense\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20843\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), for using a communication facility to facilitate the crime of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base; and 2) in assigning one criminal history point for a prior North Carolina consolidated judgment. Upon our review, we affirm the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2016, Allen pleaded guilty to the unlawful possession of firearms by a convicted felon, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) and 924(a)(2). The probation officer prepared a presentence report (PSR), which included two prior convictions relevant to this appeal. First, in 2009, Allen was convicted of using a communication facility to facilitate the crime of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20843\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (the Section 843(b) conviction). And second, in 2007, Allen was convicted of two North Carolina misdemeanors, namely, possession of marijuana in an amount less than or equal to one-half ounce, and second-degree trespass. The two misdemeanor convictions were consolidated into one judgment for sentencing under North Carolina law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.15(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The probation officer recommended in the PSR that Allen's base offense level be increased to 24 under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (Guidelines) \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), based on his two prior felony convictions of \"controlled substance offenses,\" including his Section 843(b) conviction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). The probation officer also recommended that one point be added under Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.1(c) to Allen's criminal history score based on the North Carolina consolidated judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Allen objected to both recommendations made by the probation officer. First, he argued that the Section 843(b) conviction did not qualify as a \"controlled substance offense\" for purposes of computing his base offense level. Second, Allen asserted that he should not have been assigned one criminal history point for the North Carolina consolidated judgment due to the allegedly disproportionate effect this point would have on his Guidelines range. Exclusion of this single point in his criminal history would have resulted in a lower Guidelines range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At sentencing, the district court overruled both objections to the PSR, and adopted the PSR in all respects. After determining that Allen's advisory Guidelines range was a term of imprisonment of between 84 and 105 months, the district court varied downward and imposed a sentence of 77 months' imprisonment. Allen now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Allen first argues that his Section 843(b) conviction does not qualify as a \"controlled substance offense\" for purposes of determining his base offense level under Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(a). Allen acknowledges that the relevant Guidelines commentary specifically states that a Section 843(b) conviction is a \"controlled substance offense\" when the underlying conviction also qualifies as a \"controlled substance offense.\" Nevertheless, he maintains that under a \"categorical approach\" analysis, his Section 843(b) conviction does not qualify because its elements sweep more broadly than the Guidelines' definition of a \"controlled substance offense.\" Accordingly, Allen contends that the district court erred in increasing his base offense level from 20\n   to 24 due to his Section 843(b) conviction. We disagree with Allen's argument, and do not apply a categorical analysis because the relevant commentary is authoritative and controlling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Our standard of review is well established. We consider de novo the issue whether a prior conviction qualifies under the Guidelines as a \"controlled substance offense\" for purposes of a sentencing enhancement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. McCollum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516310\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/300/#p304\">\n    885 F.3d 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304 (4th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Under Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), a defendant's base offense level for possession of a firearm by a felon increases to 24 if the defendant committed that offense with a criminal record containing at least two prior felony convictions for a \"controlled substance offense\" or a \"crime of violence.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). The term \"controlled substance offense\" is defined in Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.2(b) and is incorporated by reference in the application note to Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1. This term includes any state or federal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Allen's predicate conviction at issue here, under Section 843(b), states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [i]t shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to use any communication facility in committing or in causing or facilitating the commission of any act or acts constituting a felony under any provision of this subchapter [controlled substance offenses] or subchapter II [drug trafficking offenses].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20843\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The commentary to Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.2 states in Application Note One that a Section 843(b) conviction constitutes a \"controlled substance offense\" if the underlying felony \"committed, caused, or facilitated\" by use of a \"communication facility\" was a \"controlled substance offense\" (the Section 843(b) commentary). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, appl. n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Section 843(b) commentary, like all Guidelines commentary, is designed to aid the critical tasks of the sentencing court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.7. The Guidelines necessarily are structured at a level of generality that permits their application to the many varied facts and circumstances presented in the sentencing process.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stinson v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n    508 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 40-42,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n    123 L.Ed.2d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). In this context, the commentary puts \"flesh on the bones\" of the Guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The issue of the proper weight to be accorded the Guidelines commentary was decided by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Stinson\n   </em>\n   . The Court emphasized that when commentary interprets a guideline provision or explains how a guideline is to be applied, the commentary is controlling.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n    at 42-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although this Court has not addressed the particular Section 843(b) commentary at issue in this case, we previously have addressed another part of Application Note One that clarified Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.2.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Walton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11328134\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/551/#p555\">\n    56 F.3d 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 555-56 (4th Cir. 1995). In\n   <em>\n    Walton\n   </em>\n   , we considered the question whether a defendant's Section 843(b) conviction qualified as a \"controlled substance offense\" within the meaning of that Guidelines term as it was defined at that time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11328134\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/551/#p555\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Our discussion in\n   <em>\n    Walton\n   </em>\n   addressed an earlier version of Application Note One that did not include the Section 843(b) commentary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11328134\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/551/#p555\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, we focused on the Guidelines commentary to the definition of a \"controlled substance offense,\" which stated in Application Note One that \"offenses of aiding and abetting\" a \"controlled substance offense\" are considered \"controlled substance offenses\" for purposes of computing a defendant's Guidelines range (the aiding and abetting commentary). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, appl. n.1 (2003). We held that the aiding and abetting commentary clarified that a \"controlled substance offense\" included any prior conviction that aided or abetted a \"controlled substance offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Walton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11328134\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/551/#p555\">\n    56 F.3d at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Underlying our rationale was the long-standing rule that an aider and abettor to a crime generally is punishable under federal law as a principal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosemond v.

'aids, abets' ... 'is punishable as a principal' \" is based on a \"centuries-old view of culpability\" (citations omitted) ). Accordingly, we held in\n   <em>\n    Walton\n   </em>\n   that the defendant's Section 843(b) conviction was a valid predicate offense in the computation of a career offender enhancement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, because the defendant used a telephone to aid the commission of his underlying \"controlled substance offense,\" namely, distribution of cocaine.\n   <em>\n    Walton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11328134\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/551/#p555\">\n    56 F.3d at 555-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Section 843(b) commentary before us also is dispositive here. This commentary states that a Section 843(b) conviction is a \"controlled substance offense\" if the \"underlying offense\" is a \"controlled substance offense.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, appl. n.1. Thus, this particular provision serves an explanatory function by describing one way in which a \"controlled substance offense\" may be committed, namely, by using a communication facility.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n    508 U.S. at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This language is not inconsistent with the dictates of Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1, which provides that a defendant be assigned a base offense level of 24 if he has committed at least a part of the present offense after having been convicted of two felony offenses of a \"crime of violence\" or a \"controlled substance offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n    508 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1, 4B1.2, appl. n.1. And Allen does not argue that the Section 843(b) commentary violates the Constitution or a federal statute,\n   or that the Section 843(b) commentary is a plainly erroneous reading of the Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n    508 U.S. at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The history of the amendment codifying the Section 843(b) commentary further supports the conclusion that this commentary is controlling. Before the inclusion of this commentary, we were one of three federal courts of appeal holding that a Section 843(b) conviction is a \"controlled substance offense\" for purposes of the career offender enhancement in Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Walton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11328134\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/551/#p555\">\n    56 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   555-56 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Allen's 2009 judgment of conviction shows that he used a communication facility to facilitate the underlying offense of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, which plainly is a \"controlled substance offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20812\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (listing cocaine as a schedule II controlled substance);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). We therefore hold that Allen's Section 843(b) conviction is a \"controlled substance offense\" that served as a valid predicate offense for enhancing his base offense level under Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Allen next argues that the district court erred in adding one point to his criminal history score based on his North Carolina consolidated judgment. According to Allen, because one of the two offenses comprising his North Carolina consolidated judgment cannot be used in assigning a criminal history point, that judgment should not have been counted in computing\n   his criminal history score. We disagree with Allen's argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On a challenge to a district court's application of the Guidelines, we review questions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264582\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/412/#p414\">\n    874 F.3d 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414 (4th Cir. 2017). Subject to certain exceptions, misdemeanor offenses generally are assigned one or more criminal history points. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c). However, one of the misdemeanor offenses included in Allen's North Carolina consolidated judgment, the trespass offense, falls within the category of misdemeanor offenses that may not be assigned a criminal history point. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). The other misdemeanor offense included in his consolidated judgment, possession of marijuana, is not subject to exclusion under Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.2(c) and, thus, may be assigned one point in computing his criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Based on these distinctions in the counting of misdemeanor convictions under Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.2(c), we hold that the district court properly added one criminal history point for the North Carolina consolidated judgment. The misdemeanor marijuana possession offense independently would have been assessed a criminal history point, and the fact that the consolidated judgment also included a non-qualifying offense does not change that result. Accordingly, because the misdemeanor trespass offense had no effect on the computation of Allen's criminal history, the district court did not err in assigning a criminal history point for the misdemeanor possession of marijuana conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For these reasons, we affirm the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Since the ratification of the Section 843(b) commentary, the Third Circuit has held that a Section 843(b) conviction is a \"controlled substance offense\" for purposes of determining career offender status under Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1.\n    <em>\n     United States v.
