Lester received that sentence because he was designated a career offender under the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines. Later precedent, however, established that this designation was wrong and that, as a result, Lester's sentence should have been up to 11 years shorter. Lester sought relief through habeas corpus, but the district court denied his petition. Because our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Wheeler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516441\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/415/\">\n    886 F.3d 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2018), permits Lester's challenge, we vacate and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Lester pled guilty to a single count of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the Sentencing Guidelines, which at that time were mandatory, Lester was deemed a career offender and subject to a sentencing enhancement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 4B1.1 (2004). This enhancement depended on a past conviction for a \"crime of violence,\" namely Lester's 1990 Georgia conviction for walkaway escape. With the enhancement, the guidelines range was 262-327 months in prison. Without the enhancement, however, Lester's Guidelines range would have been 121-151 months. The statutory maximum sentence was 40 years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B). Lester received a sentence of 262 months (a bit under 22 years), right at the bottom of the required Guidelines range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Lester appealed, unsuccessfully, and filed a motion to vacate his sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which was denied. In those proceedings Lester couldn't successfully challenge his classification as a career offender because, under then-controlling precedent, walkaway escape under Georgia law was a crime of violence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

First, the Supreme Court stripped the Sentencing Guidelines of legal force and made them purely advisory.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Booker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p245\">\n    543 U.S. 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 245,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p245\">\n    125 S.Ct. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p245\">\n    160 L.Ed.2d 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). Second, it ruled that the generic crime of failing to report to a prison was not a crime of violence,\n   <em>\n    Chambers v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679441\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/122/#p127\">\n    555 U.S. 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127-28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679441\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/122/#p127\">\n    129 S.Ct. 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679441\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/122/#p127\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009), which led courts to hold that the escape offense Lester committed was not a crime of violence either.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In his petition, he contended that his escape offense was not a crime of violence, that he thus wasn't subject to the career offender enhancement, and that his 262-month sentence was therefore unlawful because it exceeded the then-mandatory Guidelines range of 121-151 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because Lester had already filed a petition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the ordinary recourse for federal prisoners seeking postconviction relief, he couldn't bring his challenge under that statute. Instead, he filed under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a catchall habeas statute, arguing that such petitions are allowed, pursuant to \u00a7 2255 's so-called \"savings clause,\" when the latter statute is \"inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [one's] detention.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2255(e). But the district court rejected this argument, reasoning that the savings clause didn't allow challenges based on Sentencing Guidelines errors, at least when the petitioner's sentence, like Lester's, still fell below the statutory maximum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lester appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   That was in 2013. Since then, Lester's appeal has been held in abeyance while our court decided three potentially relevant cases:\n   <em>\n    Whiteside v.

But now, with\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   shining light on the issues before us, we consider whether Lester may challenge his sentence via the savings clause of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is a question of law that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But once the prisoner has filed one unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion, as Lester has, he may not file another except under very limited circumstances. Specifically, before filing a \"second or successive\" petition, the prisoner must first receive permission from the court of appeals by showing either \"newly discovered evidence\" proving he was not\n   guilty of his offense or that a new, previously unavailable rule of constitutional law made retroactive on collateral review by the Supreme Court entitles him to relief.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2255(h)(1)-(2). These restrictions are referred to as the \"gatekeeping provisions\" of \u00a7 2255. Crucially, they don't allow a second petition for new statutory constructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The gatekeeping provisions bar most federal prisoners from taking a second bite at the habeas apple. But not completely. In limited circumstances, courts including ours have said that a prisoner otherwise unable to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition may instead seek relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11231473\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/226/328/#p333\">\n    226 F.3d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 333-34 (4th Cir. 2000) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Davenport\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358880\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/605/#p610\">\n    147 F.3d 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 610-12 (7th Cir. 1998). That's because \u00a7 2255, while generally blocking habeas petitions by federal prisoners outside that statute, permits such petitions when it appears that \u00a7 2255\"is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the prisoner's] detention.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).

Second, well after Lester's direct appeal and \u00a7 2255 motion, the substantive law changed. After the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   in 2009, both the Eleventh and Fourth Circuits ruled that Lester's prior offense is not a crime of violence.\n   <em>\n    Clay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053232\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/959/#p969\">\n    627 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   969 ;\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3488198\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/859/#p874\">\n    586 F.3d at 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Third, Lester can't satisfy the gatekeeping provisions of \u00a7 2255. No new evidence suggests he's actually innocent of the federal drug charges he was imprisoned for, and\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   is a decision of statutory interpretation, not constitutional law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The only dispute, then, is whether this case meets the fourth\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   requirement-whether Lester's misclassification as a career offender, which increased his mandatory Guidelines range from a maximum of 151 months to a minimum of 262, is an \"error sufficiently grave to be deemed a fundamental defect.\"\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516441\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/415/\">\n    886 F.3d at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Given this fundamental problem with an incorrect sentencing range, we rejected the notion that Wheeler's sentence was immune to challenge because he could have received the same ten-year sentence even with the correct mandatory minimum. \"[S]uch an arbitrary disregard of the petitioner's right to liberty,\" we said, quoting\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   , \"is a denial of due process of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184369\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/343/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184369\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/343/\">\n    at 431-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184369\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/343/\">\n    447 U.S. at 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184369\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/343/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We also rejected the argument that any sentence below Wheeler's 40-year statutory maximum cannot be fundamentally defective, relying on two out-of-circuit cases.

Under\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   , we must agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As the preceding discussion of\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   makes clear, in that case, we found that Wheeler's sentence suffered the same fundamental defect as the sentence in\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   . A defendant has a due process right to be \"deprived of his liberty only to the extent determined by the [trier of fact] in the exercise of its statutory discretion,\"\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184369\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/343/\">\n    447 U.S. at 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184369\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/343/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but, because of an interpretive error, Wheeler was denied that right. And we suggested that incorrectly applied sentencing benchmarks are fundamentally problematic because they wrongly cabin the district court's discretion to impose a lower sentence when the facts of the crime warrant it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Those problems are present in Lester's case, but more so. Wheeler's erroneous sentencing enhancement raised the floor of the district court's sentencing discretion from five to ten years. Yet even without the erroneous enhancement, the court could still have given Wheeler the same ten-year sentence. Lester's sentence, in contrast, fell well outside the district court's proper range of sentencing discretion. Because of Lester's erroneous designation as a career offender, the court was required by statute to impose a sentence between 262 and 327 months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (requiring courts to impose Guidelines sentences),\n   <em>\n    invalidated by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p245\">\n    543 U.S. at 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p245\">\n    125 S.Ct. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without the enhancement, though, the court would have been bound to issue a sentence within the 121-151 months range. Lester's 262-month sentence, then, is more than nine years longer than the maximum sentence that the court rightfully had discretion to order. By\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   's logic, this sentence is fundamentally defective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Our conclusion that Lester may collaterally attack his sentence also follows from\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   's discussion of two cases allowing challenges by petitioners in Lester's very predicament. In both\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth and Seventh Circuits allowed petitioners sentenced within erroneous Guidelines ranges pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   to challenge their sentences under \u00a7 2241 via the savings clause. We cited these cases to reject the government's contention that any sentence falling below the statutory maximum is per se lawful and thus immune from savings clause challenge. Our discussion of those cases, however, would have made little sense if we did not agree with their basic holding-that a sentence is fundamentally defective when it exceeds the mandatory Guidelines range that, according to later retroactive precedent, should have applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For these reasons, we conclude that the sentencing error in Lester's case is \"sufficiently grave to be deemed a fundamental defect.\"\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516441\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/415/\">\n    886 F.3d at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The government offers two main arguments why Lester's sentence is not fundamentally\n   defective such that he may not proceed via \u00a7 2255 's savings clause. We find neither persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, the government urges that\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   doesn't control here because, in that case, the petitioner was sentenced pursuant to an erroneous statutory enhancement whereas Lester's range was mandated by the Sentencing Guidelines. Unlike statutes, the government contends, the Guidelines don't establish the maximum and minimum lawful sentences for crimes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mistretta v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494660\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/361/#p396\">\n    488 U.S. 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 396,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494660\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/361/#p396\">\n    109 S.Ct. 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494660\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/361/#p396\">\n    102 L.Ed.2d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989). Thus, it argues, the separation-of-powers reasons for treating statutory mandatory minimum sentences as fundamental defects do not translate to mandatory Guideline errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The problem with the government's argument, however, is that\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   was not primarily a separation-of-powers case. To be sure, our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   stated general separation-of-powers principles applicable to sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516441\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/415/\">\n    886 F.3d at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In the federal system, 'defining crimes and fixing penalties are legislative, not judicial, functions.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But we didn't find\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   's sentence fundamentally defective because the court lacked authority from Congress to impose it. Nor could we, given that Wheeler's ten-year sentence fell well within the correct statutory range of 5-40 years. Rather,\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   turned on the notion that a defendant has a due process right to have the trier of fact \"exercise ... its statutory discretion\" when imposing a sentence.\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184369\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/343/\">\n    447 U.S. at 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184369\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/343/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government can't dispute that Lester's right to this appropriate exercise of discretion was denied here because his erroneous designation as a career offender produced a statutorily required sentencing range much higher than the correct range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The government's second argument is that\n   <em>\n    United States v. Foote\n   </em>\n   , and not\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   , applies here. In\n   <em>\n    Foote\n   </em>\n   , we said a prisoner couldn't challenge a trial court's misapplication of the advisory Guidelines under \u00a7 2255.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180966\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/931/#p935\">\n    784 F.3d at 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government is correct that in\n   <em>\n    Foote\n   </em>\n   , we distinguished a misapplied career offender enhancement from fundamental defects such as \"sentences issued 'in excess of the maximum authorized by law.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180966\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/931/#p935\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180966\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/931/#p935\">\n    at 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ). But crucial to our analysis in\n   <em>\n    Foote\n   </em>\n   was that the petitioner, unlike Lester, was sentenced after\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   had rendered the Guidelines purely advisory. Because the Guidelines lacked legal force, we explained, an erroneous advisory Guidelines classification was unlike a violation of a statute or constitutional provision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 942 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516441\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/415/\">\n    886 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   432 n.9 (distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Foote\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Foote\n   </em>\n   undoubtedly would bar Lester's petition had he been sentenced under the advisory Guidelines. But\n   <em>\n    Foote\n   </em>\n   simply doesn't apply to a petitioner sentenced in the pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   era. Indeed, we denied the petitioner's claim in\n   <em>\n    Foote\n   </em>\n   partly on the grounds that, because he was sentenced under the advisory Guidelines, the district court not only had discretion to decide whether the Guidelines sentence was justified, but in fact was required to do so.\n   <em>\n    Foote\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180966\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/931/#p935\">\n    784 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   941-42 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (requiring individualized analysis of sentencing factors). That discretion is precisely what the district court lacked at Lester's sentencing because, at that time, the Guidelines were mandatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We also reject the idea, floated here and there by the government, that because a district court theoretically could depart from the Guidelines even when they were mandatory, the due process concerns in\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   are misplaced. Departures were allowed only when the court found aggravating or mitigating circumstances \"not\n   adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission\" in writing the Guidelines.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). As the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]n most cases, as a matter of law, the Commission will have adequately taken all relevant factors into account, and no departure will be legally permissible.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p245\">\n    543 U.S. at 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p245\">\n    125 S.Ct. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, in most cases-and doubtless in a \"run-of-the-mill drug case\" like Lester's-the district court had no discretion to deviate from the Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p245\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p245\">\n    at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p245\">\n    125 S.Ct. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In short, we find the government's attempts to skirt\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   unpersuasive. And this is so even as we are mindful that the savings clause should provide only the tightest alleyway to relief. Section 2255 is not \"inadequate or ineffective\" just because the prisoner can't successfully challenge his sentence under that provision. As we have said before, interpreting the savings clause coextensively with \u00a7 2255 would \"effectively nullify the gatekeeping provisions\" that Congress carefully wrote into that statute.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11231473\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/226/328/#p333\">\n    226 F.3d at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   However, our analysis is governed by\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   , and we find no meaningful distinction to support a different result in this case.
