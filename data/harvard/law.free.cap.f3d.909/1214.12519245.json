Under CBAs governing various facilities, Quebecor was obligated to contribute to the Fund. In 2009, employees at the Memphis Quebecor facility voted to decertify their union representation, and Quebecor ceased participating on their behalf. Quad assumed the obligation to contribute to the Fund with respect to the remaining Quebecor facilities when it acquired Quebecor. But, by 2011, employees at all other former Quebecor facilities had decertified their union representation, and Quad completely ceased its participation in the Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In calculating Quad's liability for the 2011 complete withdrawal, the Fund gave Quad a credit for the partial withdrawal liability imposed after the 2009 Memphis facility withdrawal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201386\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The MPPAA also provides for a twenty-year limitation on annual payments made to discharge the employer's complete withdrawal liability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201386\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1399(c)(1)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fund applied that limitation\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   first applying the \u00a7 1386(b) credit against Quad's liability.

Section 1381 provides the clear answer to that question. The statute unambiguously provides that first after calculating the employer's complete withdrawal liability (and making any adjustment required under \u00a7 1381(b)(1)(A), a provision not at issue here), any adjustment for a partial withdrawal required by \u00a7 1386 comes \"next.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201381\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B).

The \u00a7 1386(b) prior partial withdrawal credit reduces the employer's complete withdrawal liability.
