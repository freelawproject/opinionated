Although the Court sought and received briefing on the straightforward constitutional question, i.e. without the implicit requirement of due process for persons in arbitrary prolonged detention, whether these detention statutes are constitutional, it declined to reach the constitutional question. The Court instead chose to answer only the question whether the statutory text itself included a limit on prolonged detention or a requirement of individual bond hearings. In an opinion authored by Justice Alito, the Court concluded that as a matter of statutory construction, the only exceptions to indefinite detention were those expressly set forth in the statutes or related regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5)(A) (humanitarian parole);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) (bond) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) (witness protection);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20236.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 236.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1), 1236.1(d)(1) (bond hearing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court then remanded the constitutional issues to our court, and we now, taking our cue from it, likewise remand this case to the district court, which\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   had no occasion to consider [petitioners'] constitutional arguments on their merits.
