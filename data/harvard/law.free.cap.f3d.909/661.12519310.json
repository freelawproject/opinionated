Upon our review, we conclude that there are genuine disputes of material fact with respect to both claims. We therefore vacate the district court's judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We present the facts in the light most favorable to Ray, the nonmoving party, and draw all reasonable inferences in her favor.\n   <em>\n    Rosetta Stone Ltd. v. Google, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757645\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/144/#p150\">\n    676 F.3d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 150 (4th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted). IPC, which manufactures and distributes packaging boxes, hired Ray in 2002 to work as a \"bundler\" in its converting department. In 2007, Ray was promoted to the position of \"operator.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Johnnie McDowell was Ray's supervisor in both positions. In 2013, Ray was transferred to the shipping department to work as a \"bander operator.\" In that department, Ray reported to a different supervisor,\n   Benjamin Owens, for the beginning of her shift, and to McDowell when Owens was not present.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Beginning in 2003, one year after Ray began working at IPC, McDowell started acting inappropriately toward Ray, including asking Ray to engage in sexual activity with him and offering to pay her for those acts. McDowell also made several overtly sexual comments to Ray, stating that he wished he could \"bend her over [his] desk,\" that he would father a child with her, and that he would engage in sexual activity with Ray's sister-in-law if Ray did not acquiesce to his demands. McDowell also asked Ray to show him her \"cootie,\" \"cha-cha,\" and \"monkey,\" comments that Ray construed as requests to see her genitals. On one occasion, McDowell grabbed Ray's thigh while the two were alone in his office. McDowell continued this conduct despite Ray's repeatedly refusing his advances and asking him to stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2013, several years after McDowell's conduct began, Ray reported McDowell's behavior to Owens, and to Derrick Smith, another IPC supervisor. Ray explained that McDowell would not leave her alone and was \"ragging her\" because she would not \"have sex\" with him. Although Owens and Smith offered to \"say something\" about Ray's allegations, she declined out of fear of retaliation. Nevertheless, Ray would \"frequently call Owens\" requesting to leave work and asking if another employee could cover her shift because of McDowell's continued offensive conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under IPC's anti-harassment policy, when a supervisor is notified of potential harassment or discrimination, the supervisor is required to report that allegation to his manager, to a human resources representative, or to IPC's legal department. Neither Owens nor Smith formally reported any of Ray's complaints. Although Ray asked Owens and Smith not to report her first complaint, there is no evidence in the record that she told Owens not to report her later complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In early 2014, McDowell learned that Ray had complained about his conduct. He confronted Ray and asked if she had reported him for sexual harassment. Ray denied making any complaints, and McDowell informed her that such a report could \"get him in a lot of trouble.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Around the same time in 2014, McDowell informed Ray that she could no longer perform \"voluntary\" overtime work before the beginning of her regular work shifts. Before McDowell imposed this restriction, Ray often had arrived four hours before her scheduled shift to perform overtime work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Because Ray was paid one and one half times her normal rate of pay for overtime work, the voluntary overtime that she performed represented a significant portion of her income. After McDowell suspended Ray from performing voluntary overtime work, other \"bander operators\" still were allowed to work voluntary overtime hours. Also, IPC employees, including Ray, were required to work additional hours on a mandatory basis at the end of their shift when an employee on the next shift failed to appear for work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 22, 2014, Ray reported McDowell's conduct of sexual harassment to officials in IPC's human resources department. She informed those officials that McDowell repeatedly had propositioned her to have sex, and she provided the names of three other IPC employees to corroborate her allegations. IPC personnel investigated Ray's complaint over the next\n   few days, and conducted interviews of McDowell and other employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Based on these interviews, the IPC investigators learned that McDowell had told two other employees that he wanted to have sex with Ray, and that McDowell had commented to another employee that Ray was \"looking good.\" One employee also told IPC investigators that McDowell often spent time near Ray's banding machine, and that Ray had complained about McDowell's repeated requests that she engage in sex acts with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although McDowell \"den[ied] ever saying anything sexual to or about [Ray,]\" the IPC investigators concluded that McDowell was lying. Nevertheless, IPC did not discipline McDowell. The investigators reasoned that Ray's allegations were not corroborated by the statements from other employees, because none of those employees had witnessed McDowell making comments of a sexual nature to Ray. Ultimately, IPC officials instructed McDowell not to communicate directly with Ray in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ray complained on two other occasions about McDowell to officials in IPC's human resources department, in November 2014 and again in June 2015. Ray claimed that McDowell continually \"stared\" at her, and that he sabotaged her work on the production line. According to Ray, McDowell's acts of interference prevented her from properly \"banding\" the units for shipping and caused production delays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   IPC conducted an investigation of Ray's new complaints. One employee confirmed that McDowell had been staring at Ray, and stated that this conduct made that employee feel \"uncomfortable.\" Other employees related that McDowell manually adjusted the production line to make Ray's job more difficult, and that McDowell was \"picking on\" Ray. Again, IPC did not discipline McDowell, but instructed him to stop \"manually adjust[ing] the line.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In November 2015, Ray filed a complaint in the district court alleging that she was subjected to a hostile work environment based on McDowell's acts of sexual harassment. Ray also asserted a separate claim of retaliation. Upon IPC's motion, a magistrate judge recommended that summary judgment be granted in favor of IPC on both claims. The district court adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation over Ray's objections. With respect to Ray's hostile work environment claim, the district court determined that McDowell's harassing conduct was not imputable to IPC. The district court also concluded that Ray failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. Ray now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We review the district court's award of summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Rosetta Stone Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757645\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/144/#p150\">\n    676 F.3d at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Title VII states that \"[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to discriminate against any individual with respect to [her] ... compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of ... sex.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). Because an employee's work environment is a term or condition of employment, harassment based on sex is actionable under Title VII.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.

Therefore, Ray argues that the district court erred in failing to hold IPC strictly liable for McDowell's actions and in permitting IPC to assert the\n   <em>\n    Ellerth\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   defense. We address Ray's arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   i.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Ray asserts that McDowell's decision to deny her voluntary overtime work qualified as a tangible employment action. IPC, however, argues that Ray did not suffer any pecuniary loss from the denial of voluntary overtime and that, therefore, the elimination of her voluntary overtime hours did not qualify as a tangible employment action. Relying on Ray's pay records, IPC contends that because Ray earned more money from overtime work in 2015 than in 2014, she cannot show that she lost any income as a result of McDowell's actions. We disagree with IPC's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A \"tangible employment action\" is a \"significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Ellerth\n   </em>\n   , 524 U.S. at 761,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183137\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/742/#p761\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ray testified that McDowell's decision preventing her from performing this higher-paying work negatively affected her income. Prior to McDowell's action, Ray regularly was permitted to work for four hours before her shift, earning around $24.00 per hour instead of her normal rate of $16.25 per hour. Ray explained that these almost daily voluntary overtime hours were a \"significant part of [her] earnings.\" A reasonable jury could determine that losing this amount of income constituted a \"significant change in [Ray's] benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Ellerth\n   </em>\n   , 524 U.S. at 761,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183137\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/742/#p761\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Our conclusion is not altered by IPC's contention that Ray received a greater amount of overtime hours in 2015 than she received in 2014. Ray did not claim that her ability to earn overtime pay was eliminated completely. Rather, she contended that McDowell and IPC eliminated her opportunity to perform voluntary overtime work, which had been her regular practice. There is no dispute that Ray continued to work overtime hours after her regular shift when needed to \"cover\" for an absent employee. Thus, Ray's total amount of overtime income in 2015 bears little relevance to her claim that her income was affected negatively, at least for a period, because she was denied the opportunity to do voluntary overtime work. Accordingly, we hold that the record shows disputed issues of material fact regarding the issue whether Ray's loss of voluntary overtime work constituted a tangible employment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   ii.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We turn to consider whether Ray demonstrated a sufficient nexus between McDowell's offensive conduct toward her and the claimed tangible employment action. IPC argues that there is no evidence that McDowell denied Ray the ability to perform voluntary overtime work because Ray refused to submit to McDowell's sexual demands. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Employers are held strictly liable for a supervisor's harassment when the supervisor has been \"aided by the agency relationship\" in causing the tangible employment action.\n   <em>\n    Ellerth\n   </em>\n   , 524 U.S. at 761-62,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183137\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/742/#p761\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When a supervisor makes a tangible employment decision, there is assurance the injury could not have been inflicted absent the agency relation.\").

Ray contends that a jury reasonably could determine that she was denied voluntary overtime work because she complained about McDowell's harassment. IPC argues in response that the district court correctly held that a denial of overtime work does not constitute an \"adverse employment action\" for purposes of a Title VII retaliation claim. Alternatively, IPC contends that Ray failed to establish a causal link between her complaints about McDowell's conduct and the elimination of her voluntary overtime hours. We disagree with IPC's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Under Title VII, it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee because she has opposed any unlawful employment practice, or has made a charge or has participated in an investigation. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a).

On its face, this decrease in income constituted an adverse employment action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boone v.

We examine whether Ray's retaliation claim is supported by evidence that her complaints about McDowell's conduct resulted in the elimination of her voluntary overtime work.

As noted above, the evidence shows that Ray complained about McDowell to Owens multiple times, and that McDowell learned about these complaints and confronted Ray in \"early 2014.\" Around the same time, McDowell prevented Ray from engaging in her usual practice of performing voluntary overtime work.
