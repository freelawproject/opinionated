Defendants Drape Creative, Inc. (\"DCI\"), and Papyrus-Recycled Greetings, Inc. (\"PRG\"), designed and produced greeting cards using both phrases with slight variations. Gordon brought this suit for trademark infringement, and the district court granted summary judgment for defendants, holding that Gordon's claims were barred by the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Rogers v. Grimaldi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535529\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/875/994/\">\n    875 F.2d 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1989).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We use the\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   test to balance the competing interests at stake when a\n   trademark owner claims that an expressive work infringes on its trademark rights. The test construes the Lanham Act to apply to expressive works \"only where the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion outweighs the public interest in free expression.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 999. \"[T]hat balance will normally not support application of the Act, unless the [use of the mark] has no artistic relevance to the underlying work whatsoever, or ... explicitly misleads [consumers] as to the source or the content of the work.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535529\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/875/994/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   test is not an automatic safe harbor for any minimally expressive work that copies someone else's mark. Although on every prior occasion in which we have applied the test, we have found that it barred an infringement claim as a matter of law, this case presents a triable issue of fact. Defendants have not used Gordon's mark in the creation of a song, photograph, video game, or television show, but have largely just pasted Gordon's mark into their greeting cards. A jury could determine that this use of Gordon's mark is explicitly misleading as to the source or content of the cards. We therefore reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings on Gordon's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff Christopher Gordon is a comedian, writer, and actor, who commonly uses the name \"Randall\" as an alias on social media.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant DCI is a greeting-card design studio. DCI works exclusively with American Greetings Corporation and its subsidiaries, which include the other defendant in this case, PRG. PRG is a greeting-card manufacturer and distributor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In January 2011, under the name Randall, Gordon posted a video on YouTube titled\n   <em>\n    The Crazy Nastyass Honey Badger\n   </em>\n   , featuring National Geographic footage of a honey badger overlaid with Gordon's narration. In the video, Gordon repeats variations of the phrases \"Honey Badger Don't Care\" and \"Honey Badger Don't Give a S- - -,\" as a honey badger hunts and eats its prey. The parties refer to these phrases as \"HBDC\" and \"HBDGS,\" and we adopt their convention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Gordon's video quickly generated millions of views on YouTube and became the subject of numerous pop-culture references in television shows, magazines, and social media. As early as February 2011, Gordon began producing and selling goods with the HBDC or HBDGS phrases, such as books, wall calendars, t-shirts, costumes, plush toys, mouse pads, mugs, and decals. Some of the items were sold online; others were sold through national retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target, Urban Outfitters, and Hot Topic. In June 2011, Gordon copyrighted his video's narration under the title\n   <em>\n    Honey Badger Don't Care\n   </em>\n   , and in October 2011, he began filing trademark applications for the HBDC phrase for various classes of goods. The Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") eventually registered \"Honey Badger Don't Care\" for International Classes 9 (audio books, etc.), 16 (greeting cards, etc.), 21 (mugs), 25 (clothing), and 28 (Christmas decorations, dolls, etc.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Gordon never registered\n   the HBDGS phrase for any class of goods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the peak of his popularity, Gordon promoted his brand on television and radio shows and in interviews with national publications such as\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    The Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    The Huffington Post\n   </em>\n   . His brand was further boosted by celebrities like Taylor Swift and Anderson Cooper quoting his video and by LSU football players tagging their teammate, Heisman Trophy finalist Tyrann Mathieu, with the moniker \"Honey Badger\" for his aggressive defensive play. In November 2011,\n   <em>\n    Advertising Age\n   </em>\n   referred to Gordon's brand as one of \"America's Hottest Brands\" in an article titled \"Hot Brand? Honey Badger Don't Care.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In January 2012, Gordon hired Paul Leonhardt to serve as his licensing agent. Soon thereafter, Leonhardt contacted Janice Ross at American Greetings-the parent company of defendant PRG-to discuss licensing honey-badger themed greeting cards. Leonhardt and Ross had multiple email exchanges and conversations over several weeks. Ross at one point expressed some interest in a licensing agreement, stating: \"I think it's a really fun and irreverent property and would love to see if there's an opportunity on one of our distribution platforms. But in order to do that, I need to get some key colleagues of mine on board the Crazy Honey Badger Bandwagon.\" Nevertheless, neither American Greetings nor defendants ever signed a licensing agreement with Gordon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Leonhardt did eventually secure several licensing deals for Gordon. Between May and October 2012, Gordon's company-Randall's Honey Badger, LLC (\"RHB\")-entered into licensing agreements with Zazzle, Inc., and The Duck Company for various honey-badger themed products, including greeting cards. RHB also entered into licensing agreements with other companies for honey-badger costumes, toys, t-shirts, sweatshirts, posters, and decals, among other things. HBDC and HBDGS were the two most common phrases used on these licensed products. For example, two of Zazzle's best-selling honey-badger greeting cards stated on their front covers \"Honey Badger Don't Care About Your Birthday.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the same time that Gordon was negotiating licensing agreements with Zazzle and Duck, defendants began developing their own line of unlicensed honey-badger greeting cards. Beginning in June 2012, defendants sold seven different greeting cards using the HBDC or HBDGS phrases with small variations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 The fronts of two \"Election Cards\" showed a picture of a honey badger wearing a patriotic hat and stated \"The Election's Coming.\" The inside of one card said \"Me and Honey Badger don't give a $#%@! Happy Birthday,\" and the inside of the other said \"Honey Badger and me just don't care. Happy Birthday.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 The fronts of two \"Birthday Cards\" featured different pictures of a honey badger and stated either \"It's Your Birthday!\" or \"Honey Badger Heard It's Your Birthday.\" The inside of both cards said \"Honey Badger Don't Give a S- - -.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 The fronts of two \"Halloween Cards\" showed a picture of a honey badger next to a jack-o-lantern and stated \"Halloween is Here.\" The inside of the cards said either \"Honey Badger\n   don't give a $#*%!\" or \"Honey Badger don't give a s- - -.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 A \"Critter Card\" employed a Twitter-style format showing a series of messages from \"Honey Badger@don'tgiveas- - -.\" The front stated \"Just killed a cobra. Don't give a s- - -\"; \"Just ate a scorpion. Don't give a s- - -\"; and \"Rolling in fire ants. Don't give a s- - -.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The inside said \"Your Birthday's here ... I give a s- - -.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The back cover of each card displayed the mark for \"Recycled Paper Greetings\" and listed the websites www.DCIStudios.com and www.prgreetings.com. DCI's President testified that he drafted all of the cards in question but could not recall what inspired the cards' designs. He claimed to have never heard of a video involving a honey badger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In June 2015, Gordon filed this suit against DCI and PRG, alleging trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, among other claims. The district court granted summary judgment for defendants, holding that defendants' greeting cards were expressive works, and applying the\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   test to bar all of Gordon's claims. Gordon timely appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201051\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ,\"creates a comprehensive framework for regulating the use of trademarks and protecting them against infringement, dilution, and unfair competition.\"\n   <em>\n    Fortune Dynamic, Inc. v.

More concretely, we apply the Act to an expressive work only if the defendant's use of the mark (1) is not artistically relevant to the work or (2) explicitly misleads consumers as to the source or the content of the work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 902.

The\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   test requires the defendant to make a threshold legal showing that its allegedly infringing use is part of an expressive work protected by the First Amendment. If the defendant successfully makes that threshold showing, then the plaintiff claiming trademark infringement bears a heightened burden-the plaintiff must satisfy not only the likelihood-of-confusion test but also at least one of\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   's two prongs.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Makaeff v.

That is, when the defendant demonstrates\n   that First Amendment interests are at stake, the plaintiff claiming infringement must show (1) that it has a valid, protectable trademark, and (2) that the mark is either not artistically relevant to the underlying work\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   explicitly misleading as to the source or content of the work. If the plaintiff satisfies both elements, it still must prove that its trademark has been infringed by showing that the defendant's use of the mark is likely to cause confusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Summary judgment may properly be entered only against a party who has failed to make a showing sufficient to establish a genuine dispute as to the existence of an element essential to his case and upon which the party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Easley v.

When, as here, the defendant moves for summary judgment and has demonstrated that its use of the plaintiff's mark is part of an expressive work, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to raise a genuine dispute as to at least one of\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   's two prongs. In other words, to evade summary judgment, the plaintiff must show a triable issue of fact as to whether the mark is artistically relevant to the underlying work or explicitly misleads consumers as to the source or content of the work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Before applying the\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   test to the instant case, we briefly review the test's origin in the Second Circuit and development in our court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We have applied the\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   test on five separate occasions, and each time we have concluded that it barred the trademark-infringement claim as a matter of law.

We therefore reject the district court's rigid requirement that, to be explicitly misleading, the defendant must make an \"affirmative statement of the plaintiff's sponsorship or endorsement.\" Such a statement may be sufficient to show that the use of a mark is explicitly misleading, but it is not a prerequisite.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2 MCCARTHY \u00a7 10:17.10 (noting that\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   's\n   second prong does not hinge on the junior user \"falsely assert[ing] that there is an affiliation\"). In some instances, the use of a mark alone may explicitly mislead consumers about a product's source if consumers would ordinarily identify the source by the mark itself. If an artist pastes Disney's trademark at the bottom corner of a painting that depicts Mickey Mouse, the use of Disney's mark, while arguably relevant to the subject of the painting, could explicitly mislead consumers that Disney created or authorized the painting, even if those words do not appear alongside the mark itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   To be sure, we have repeatedly observed that \"the mere use of a trademark alone cannot suffice to make such use explicitly misleading.\"\n   <em>\n    E.S.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051400\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/547/1095/#p1099\">\n    547 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1100 (citing\n   <em>\n    MCARecords\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9405627\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/296/894/#p900\">\n    296 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   902 ). But each time we have made this observation, it was clear that consumers would not view the mark alone as identifying the source of the artistic work. No one would think that a song or a photograph titled \"Barbie\" was created by Mattel, because consumers \"do not expect [titles] to identify\" the \"origin\" of the work.\n   <em>\n    MCA Records\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9405627\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/296/894/#p900\">\n    296 F.3d at 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the cases in which we have applied the\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   test, the junior user has employed the mark in a different context-often in an entirely different market-than the senior user. In\n   <em>\n    MCA Records\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Walking Mountain\n   </em>\n   , for example, Mattel's Barbie mark was used in a song and a series of photos. In\n   <em>\n    E.S.S.\n   </em>\n   , the mark of a strip club was used in a video game. And in\n   <em>\n    Twentieth Century Fox\n   </em>\n   , the mark of a record label was used in a television show. In each of these cases, the senior user and junior user used the mark in different ways. This disparate use of the mark was at most \"only suggestive\" of the product's source and therefore did not outweigh the junior user's First Amendment interests.\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535529\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/875/994/\">\n    875 F.2d at 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   But had the junior user in these cases used the mark in the same way as the senior user-had Twentieth Century Fox titled its new show\n   <em>\n    Law &amp; Order: Special Hip-Hop\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Unit\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   -such identical usage could reflect the type of \"explicitly misleading description\" of source that\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   condemns.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535529\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/875/994/\">\n    875 F.2d at 999-1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   itself makes this point by noting that \"misleading titles that are confusingly similar\n   <em>\n    to other titles\n   </em>\n   \" can be explicitly misleading, regardless of artistic relevance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535529\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/875/994/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 999 n.5 (emphasis added). Indeed, the potential for explicitly misleading usage is especially strong when the senior user and the junior user both use the mark in similar artistic expressions. Were we to reflexively apply\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   's second prong in this circumstance, an artist who uses a trademark to identify the source of his or her product would be at a significant disadvantage in warding off infringement by another artist, merely because the product being created by the other artist is also \"art.\" That would turn trademark law on its head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   A second consideration relevant to the \"explicitly misleading\" inquiry is the extent to which the junior user has added his or her own expressive content to the work beyond the mark itself. As\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   explains, the concern that consumers will not be \"misled as to the source of [a]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   product\" is generally allayed when the mark is used as only one component of a junior user's larger expressive creation, such that the use of the mark at most \"implicitly suggest[s]\" that the product is associated with the mark's owner.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535529\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/875/994/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 998-99 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   6 MCCARTHY \u00a7 31:144.50 (\"[T]he deception or confusion must be relatively obvious and express, not subtle and implied.\"). But using a mark as the centerpiece of an expressive work itself, unadorned with any artistic contribution by the junior user, may reflect nothing more than an effort to \"induce the sale of goods or services\" by confusion or \"lessen[ ] the distinctiveness and thus the commercial value of\" a competitor's mark.\n   <em>\n    S.F.

In cases involving the use of a mark in the title of an expressive work-such as the title of a movie (\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ), a song (\n   <em>\n    MCA Records\n   </em>\n   ), a photograph (\n   <em>\n    Walking Mountain\n   </em>\n   ), or a television show (\n   <em>\n    Twentieth Century Fox\n   </em>\n   )-the mark obviously served as only one \"element of the [work] and the [junior user's] artistic expressions.\"\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535529\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/875/994/\">\n    875 F.2d at 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
