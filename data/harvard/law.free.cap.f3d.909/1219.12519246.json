The district court issued a temporary restraining order, finding it likely that, first, the rule of decision itself was inconsistent with existing United States law providing that aliens may apply for asylum \"whether or not [the aliens arrived] at a designated port of arrival,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and second, the Attorney General failed to follow the procedures for enacting the Rule,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He noted that there has been a \"massive increase\" in asylum applications over the past two decades, and because the \"vast majority\" of applicants are found to have a \"credible fear,\" many aliens are released into the United States pending final adjudication of their status and do not appear for subsequent hearings or comply with orders of removal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57,661.

The Organizations claimed that the Rule: (1) was improperly promulgated under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (2) is an invalid exercise of the Attorney General's power under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(C) because it is inconsistent with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The Organizations moved immediately for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Government filed an opposition brief arguing that the Organizations' claims were not justiciable because they lacked both Article III standing and statutory standing. The Government also argued that the Rule was validly promulgated under the APA and does not conflict with \u00a7 1158. On November 19, 2018-ten days after the Rule and Proclamation were issued-the district court held a hearing on the motion for a TRO. The district court granted the TRO later that day. It held that the Organizations could validly assert Article III standing on two theories: organizational standing and third-party standing. The court also held that the Organizations' claims fell within the INA's zone of interests. On the merits, the district court found that the Organizations satisfied the four-factor test for a TRO: a likelihood of success on the merits, a likelihood of irreparable harm in the absence of relief, a favorable balance of the equities, and that a TRO was in the public interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

The TRO took effect immediately and remains in effect until December 19, 2018. The district court scheduled a hearing on a preliminary injunction for that date and issued an order to show cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On November 27, 2018, the Government filed a notice of appeal and an emergency motion in the district court to stay the TRO. The district court denied the motion to stay on November 30. On December 1, the Government filed a motion in this court under Ninth Circuit Rule 27-3 for an emergency administrative stay of the TRO and a stay of the TRO pending appeal. We denied the motion for the emergency administrative stay the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   II. JURISDICTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   We begin with two threshold issues raised by the parties. The Organizations argue that we lack jurisdiction over the Government's stay request because the Government's appeal of the TRO is premature. The Government argues that this case is not justiciable because the Organizations lack standing and because their claims fall outside of the INA's zone of interests. We address each issue in turn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Appealability of the TRO\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Ordinarily, a TRO is not an appealable order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abbott v.

Further, a key distinction between a \"true\" TRO and an appealable preliminary injunction is that a TRO may issue without notice and remains in effect for only 14 days (or longer if the district court finds \"good cause\" to extend it). Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   This TRO meets the criteria for treatment as a preliminary injunction. Most importantly, the Government had an opportunity to be heard: the district court held an adversary hearing, and the Government strongly challenged the court's basis for issuing the order.

The Organizations' declarations state that enforcement of the Rule has frustrated their mission of providing legal aid \"to affirmative asylum applicants who have entered\" the United States between ports of entry, because the Rule significantly discourages a large number of those individuals from seeking asylum given their ineligibility. The Organizations have also offered uncontradicted evidence that enforcement of the Rule has required, and will continue to require, a diversion of resources, independent of expenses for this litigation, from their other initiatives. For example, an official from East Bay affirmed that the Rule will require East Bay to partially convert their affirmative asylum practice into a removal defense program, an overhaul that would require \"developing new training materials\" and \"significant training of existing staff.\" He also stated that East Bay would be forced at the client intake stage to \"conduct detailed screenings for alternative forms of relief to facilitate referrals or other forms of assistance.\" Moreover, several of the Organizations explained that because other forms of relief from removal-such as withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture-do not allow a principal applicant to file a derivative application for family members, the Organizations will have to submit a greater number of applications for family-unit clients who would have otherwise been eligible for asylum. Increasing the resources required to pursue relief for family-unit clients will divert resources away from providing aid to other clients. Finally, the Organizations have each undertaken, and will continue to undertake, education and outreach initiatives regarding the new rule, efforts that require the diversion of resources away from other efforts to provide legal services to their local immigrant communities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   To be sure, as the district court noted, several of our colleagues have criticized certain applications of the\n   <em>\n    Havens Realty\n   </em>\n   organizational standing test as impermissibly diluting Article III's standing requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fair Hous.

In particular, the Government claims that the Rule is \"directly relate[d] to ... ongoing negotiations with Mexico\" and other Northern Triangle countries. The Government believes that the Rule will \"facilitate the likelihood of success in future negotiations\" and asserts that requiring normal notice-and-comment procedures in this situation would hinder the President's ability to address the \"large numbers of aliens ... transiting through Mexico\n   <em>\n    right now\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The Government's argument, in theory, has some merit.

The Government explains that this \"surge\" in illegal border crossing would pose an imminent threat to human life because \"[h]undreds die each year making the dangerous border crossing,\" and because these border crossings \"endanger[ ] ... the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") agents who seek to apprehend them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55,935.

But in this case, the Rule, standing alone, does not change eligibility for asylum for any alien seeking to enter the United States; that change is not effected until the Rule is combined with a presidential proclamation. Thus, we would need to accept the Government's contention that the \"very announcement\" of the Rule itself would give aliens a reason to \"surge\" across the southern border in numbers greater than is currently the case. Absent additional evidence, this inference is too\n   difficult to credit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, even the Government admits that it cannot \"determine how ... entry proclamations involving the southern border could affect the decision calculus for various categories of aliens planning to enter.\" 83 Fed.

The Rule has no direct bearing on the ability of an alien to cross the border outside of designated ports of entry: That conduct is already illegal. The Rule simply imposes severe downstream consequences for asylum applicants based on that criminal conduct as one of many means by which the Government may discourage it. The TRO does not prohibit the Government from combating illegal entry into the United States, and vague assertions that the Rule may \"deter\" this conduct are insufficient. Moreover, there is evidence in the record suggesting that the Government itself is undermining its own goal of channeling asylum-seekers to lawful entry by turning them away upon their arrival at our ports of entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Balance of Hardships and Public Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Because the Government has not \"satisfie[d] the first two factors,\" we need\n   not dwell on the final two factors-\"harm to the opposing party\" and \"the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Nken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"390\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p427\">\n    556 U.S. at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"391\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p427\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We point out, however, a stay of the district court's order would not preserve the status quo: it would upend it, as the TRO has temporarily restored the law to what it had been for many years prior to November 9, 2018. As explained above, the Organizations have adduced evidence indicating that, if a stay were issued, they would be forced to divert substantial resources to its implementation. Moreover, aspects of the public interest favor both sides.
