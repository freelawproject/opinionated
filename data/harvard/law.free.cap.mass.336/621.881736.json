L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 209, \u00a7 32, as amended by St. 1938, c. 136. The husband has appealed from a decree on the wife\u2019s petition which specified cruel and abusive treatment, and ordered that the husband pay $25 a week for the wife\u2019s support, and from a decree dismissing the husband\u2019s petition, which alleged that the wife had left home and refused to return. There is a report of findings of fact made pursuant to the husband\u2019s request. G. L. (Ter. Ed) c. 215, \u00a7 11, as amended by St. 1947, c. 365, \u00a7 3. On the reported facts it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>could reasonably be found that the husband was to blame for long continued conditions within the home which seriously affected the wife\u2019s health and caused her to leave, but with a willingness to return to a home maintained under different conditions. No error is shown in the determination that the wife was living apart for justifiable cause. See <em>Lyster </em>v. <em>Lyster, </em>111 Mass. 327; <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>160 Mass. 464, 467, 468; <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>270 Mass. 449, <em>S. C. </em>274 Mass. 182; <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>296 Mass. 187; <em>Cochrane </em>v. <em>Cochrane, </em>303 Mass. 467, 470-471; <em>Heath </em>v. <em>Heath, </em>325 Mass. 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The issue of the adequacy of the facts to support the order to pay $25 a week, although formally stated as an issue in the husband\u2019s brief, is not argued therein.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is not clear that there was any controversy in the Probate Court in respect thereof. The husband\u2019s petition prayed that the court make \u201csuch order as it deems expedient\u201d concerning the wife\u2019s support. The findings show that the husband was in court and testified. The only possibly relevant findings are these: The wife was under a doctor\u2019s care for a nervous condition having gone from a weight of one hundred seventeen pounds to eighty-one pounds, and the husband in 1954, with his sisters, bought a two tenement house. In the circumstances we do not decide the unargued question (Rule 13 of the Rules for the Regulation of Practice before the Full Court [1952], 328 Mass. 698) of whether in the light of the husband\u2019s obligation to support <em>(Brookfield </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>6 Allen, 585, 587; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pouliot, </em>292 Mass. 229; G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 273, \u00a7 1, as amended by St. 1954, c. 539) and his liability for necessaries <em>(Fisher </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>247 Mass. 178, 182) the facts found would in the circumstances support the order in this respect. See <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>244 Mass. 61; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whiston, </em>306 Mass. 65, 66; <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>313 Mass. 232, 235-236; <em>Whitney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>v. <em>Whitney, </em>325 Mass. 28, 30. Compare <em>Topor </em>v. <em>Topor, </em>287 Mass. 473. We have in mind that application may be made for modification of such a decree when the circumstances require. See <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">\n<em>Decrees of the Probate Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-6\"> In contending that a decree on the wife\u2019s petition was not justified on the statutory ground of failure to support, the husband\u2019s brief does specify the absence of findings of the husband\u2019s ability to support, or to work and earn, and his income.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
