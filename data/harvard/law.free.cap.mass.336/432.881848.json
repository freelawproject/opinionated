Mason \u201cas he is Commissioner of Federal Housing Administration of Chelmsford.\u201d The writ in the District Court case (number 71,017) was dated August 9, 1955, and was returnable October 8, 1955. Service was made by leaving a copy of the writ and a summons at the commissioner\u2019s last and usual place of abode in Chelms-ford. On or about September 29, 1955, a copy of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration was delivered to the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, who on October 10, 1955, filed a petition for removal with the clerk of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The declaration is in five counts, all relating to a housing project in Manchester, New Hampshire. Many allegations are scandalous in nature. Each of the first four counts is expressly based on acts of the defendant or his predecessor or predecessors in office.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The plaintiff filed in the United States District Court a motion to remand, which was not acted upon. That court, however, allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that service of process was ineffective. On January 6, 1956, there was entered an order of dismissal. The judgment of dismissal was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. <em>Garden Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>238 Fed. (2d) 651. The grounds for dismissal were that the Federal Housing Administration was the real defendant in interest; that as an agency of the United States, under Federal decisions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it was to be treated for the service of process as a Federal corporation and as a citizen of the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>trict of Columbia; and that under Massachusetts law service of process <em>upon </em>a corporation could not be made in the manner in which service had been made in the action brought in the District Court of Somerville (pages 653-654).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">According to the allegations of this petition for a writ of certiorari, the petitioner here (the plaintiff there) thereafter filed a motion to default the defendant in the District Court of Somerville; a judge \u201crefused to allow said motion\u201d on the ground that the case after removal was no longer in that court; the judge refused to allow a report to the Appellate Division; and there is no other means of review. These are the rulings sought to be reviewed in the present petition. In the Superior Court a judge denied the petitioner\u2019s application for an order of notice. The case is here on the petitioner\u2019s appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">In this Commonwealth it has not been the practice to order notice as a matter of course upon the filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari any more than upon the filing of a petition for a writ of mandamus. See <em>Snyder, petitioner, </em>284 Mass. 367, 369; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Dacey, </em>329 Mass. 598, 600. It is appropriate that such proceedings at the outset should be subjected to the examination of a judge who can observe whether there is presented a matter of substance proper for judicial consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The judge rightly refused to issue an order of notice. The petition could be disposed of on the ground that there is no remedy by certiorari to review a ruling of a court where another remedy exists. <em>Rines </em>v. <em>Justices of the Superior Court, </em>330 Mass. 368, 372. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 249, \u00a7 4, as amended; c. 213, \u00a7 1A, inserted by St. 1939, c. 257, \u00a7 1, as amended. If a report to the Appellate Division is refused, there is a procedure for establishing a draft report. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 108, as amended. See <em>Haines Corp. </em>v. <em>Winthrop Square Cafe, Inc. </em>335 Mass. 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">We have been informed by counsel that there has been a report by the judge of the District Court of Somerville of the denial of another motion to default the defendant, an opinion of the Appellate Division dismissing the report, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>and an appeal by the petitioner. That appeal has not yet reached us.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We turn to a more fundamental ground upon which the issue of an order of notice was properly refused. The petitioner is attempting to ignore the decision in this very case by the Court of Appeals, which held that \u201cremoval to the federal court was authorized . . . since it was a civil action against an \u2018officer of the United States or any agency thereof\u2019 for an \u2018act under color of such office.\u2019 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1442 (a) (1), 1446 (d).\u201d That decision, unless reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States, is binding upon the parties and upon the courts of this and other States. <em>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway </em>v. <em>McCabe, </em>213 U. S. 207, 219-222. <em>Ex parte Roe, </em>234 U. S. 70. Under the express language of the removal statute now in effect, U. S. C. (1952 ed.) Title 28, \u00a7 1446 (e),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the State court loses all jurisdiction after compliance with that statute until there has been a remand. <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>243 Fed. (2d) 432, 433 (C. A. 5). <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Hatchett, </em>91 Ga. App. 571. <em>Hopson </em>v. <em>North American Ins. Co. </em>71 Idaho, 461. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boone Circuit Court, </em>227 Ind. 327, 334. <em>State </em>v. <em>National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, </em>90 So. (2d) 884 (La.). <em>Bean </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>226 Miss. 892. <em>McCauley </em>v. <em>Consolidated Underwriters, </em>301 S. W. (2d) 181 (Tex. Civ. App.). In the Idaho and Mississippi cases cited, the entry of defaults against defendants, such as the petitioner seeks, were vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The cases of <em>Iowa Central Railway </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>236 U. S. 305, and <em>Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>312 U. S. 563, relied upon by the petitioner, were under a provision of the removal statute, U. S. C. (1946 ed.) Title 28, \u00a7 72, as it stood before its amendment in 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Other arguments of the petitioner questioning the removal do not merit discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\"> <em>Seven Oaks, Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Housing Administration, </em>171 Fed.
