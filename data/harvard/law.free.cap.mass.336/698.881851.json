The trustee is Marilyn Blinder, wife of the settlor, and the principal beneficiary is her minor son, Edward B. Blinder, both residents of Brookline.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">On or about March 15, 1953, the trustee filed a tax return covering income received during the preceding calendar year, during which the income was accumulated and consisted of dividends of $136.92 and realized net gains of $1,236.34 from the sale of intangibles, a total of $1,373.26. In the return the trustee and the beneficiary claimed the benefit of the $2,000 exemption provided by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 8 (a), as amended by St. 1951, c. 800, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During 1952 the beneficiary had no other income, taxable or nontaxable. He had not attained the age of twenty-one years, and he made no other claim for exemption for 1952. On September 1, 1953, the State tax commission assessed a tax of $101.35. The State tax commission denied an application for abatement, and the trustee paid the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>The Appellate Tax Board treated the case as depending entirely upon the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 12,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> relating to exemptions, and held that the beneficiary was a \u201cperson to whom the income ... is payable, or for whose benefit it is accumulated \u201d within the meaning of that section. The State tax commission contends that \u00a7 12 cannot be considered apart from the other sections of c. 62, and, in particular, argues that the beneficiary\u2019s interest is \u201cuncertain\u201d within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 10.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Under the trust instrument payments of income or principal to or for the benefit of Edward are to be in the discretion of the trustee until he attains the age of twenty-one years, at which time the trustee is to pay him one third of the principal. Thereafter the trustee is to pay him all the income until he attains the age of thirty years, at which time he is to receive the entire fund. Should Edward die before attaining the age of thirty years, leaving children, payments of income and principal are to be made to them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>in the discretion of the trustee until all the children shall have attained the age of twenty-one years, at which time they are to receive the principal in equal shares. Should Edward die before attaining the age of thirty years, leaving no children, the instrument contains detailed provisions for payments to other children of the settlor, and failing them to Marilyn or as she may by will appoint, and in default of appointment to her next of kin.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 10, assumed the form which is pertinent to this case in St. 1931, c. 456, entitled, \u201cAn Act relative to the taxation of estates and fiduciaries in respect of income.\u201d Prior to that amendment \u00a7 10 read, \u201cThe income received by estates held in trust by trustees, any one of whom is an inhabitant of the commonwealth . . . shall be subject to the taxes assessed by this chapter to the extent that the persons to whom the income from the trust is payable, or for whose benefit it is accumulated, are inhabitants of the commonwealth. Income accumulated in trust for the benefit of unborn or unascertained persons or persons with contingent interests shall be taxed as if accumulated for the benefit of inhabitants of the commonwealth. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Under \u00a7 10 in its earlier form the income would not have been regarded as accumulated for a person with a contingent interest. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>282 Mass. 113 (decided in 1933). See <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>272 Mass. 422, 425-426. By the 1931 amendment income accumulated for the benefit of \u201cpersons with uncertain interests\u201d was made taxable instead of income accumulated for the benefit of \u201cpersons with contingent interests.\u201d Subsection (3), added by the 1931 amendment, \u201cFor the purposes of this section and of section nine\u201d defined income \u201caccumulated for unborn or unascertained persons or persons with uncertain interests\u201d by trustees subject to \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10 as including income accumulated \u201cfor the benefit of any future interest other than a remainder presently vested in a person or persons in being not subject to be divested by the happening of any contingency expressly mentioned in the instrument creating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>trust.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Second National Bank, </em>308 Mass. 1, 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Net gains from the sale of intangibles are principal gains for the purposes of trust accounting, but for the purposes of income taxation they constitute income for the year in which the gains were made. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>303 Mass. 606, 610. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Bullard, </em>313 Mass. 72, 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The taxpayer concedes that the income is taxable, but makes the contention that Edward, although the holder of an \u201cuncertain\u201d interest, is entitled to the exemption provided by c. 62, \u00a7\u00a7 8 (a) and 12, in that the income was being accumulated for him since he has a present vested right to receive income in the future, and \u00a7 12 gives the trustee the right to claim the exemption at his request. She relies upon <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Second National Bank, </em>308 Mass. 1, 4, where in discussing the taxability of trust income under \u00a7 10 (3) it was said: \u201cThe person for whom income is \u2018accumulated\u2019 ... is not necessarily the person to whom this income will actually be payable by the trustees when the time for such payment arrives. It is \u2018accumulated,\u2019 within the meaning of the statute, for the person or persons who, at the time it is accumulated, have the present right to receive in the future the income so \u2018accumulated,\u2019 that is, the person or persons having the future interests therein.\u201d This language must be read in connection with the actual trust instrument then before the court, where there was at the death of the life beneficiary a reversion (called a remainder interest in the opinion) to the grantor. This, of course, was vested, and, in the words of \u00a7 10 (3), was \u201ca remainder presently vested in a person or persons in being not subject to be divested by the happening of any contingency expressly mentioned in the instrument creating the trust.\u201d In <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Bullard, </em>313 Mass. 72, where the language of the <em>Second National Bank </em>case was quoted at page 75, the holding was that there was no \u201ccontingency.\u201d In our opinion, these cases are not authorities that, within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>the taxing act, Edward has a present right to receive in the future the accumulated income.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The Appellate Tax Board granted the following requests for rulings of the State tax commission: \u201c3. That as a matter of law the interest of Edward Blinder at best is presently vested but subject to be divested by his not reaching the specified ages.\u201d \u201c5. That as a matter of law Edward Blinder\u2019s interest is subject to be cut short by his never reaching the prescribed ages.\u201d In other words, in the trust instrument there are named contingencies which by their happening might divest the interest of the fife beneficiary. The taxpayer, however, argues that these are immaterial considerations under \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">We are dealing with an exemption from taxation, which is a matter of special favor or grace and to be recognized only where the property falls clearly and unmistakably within the express words of a legislative command. <em>Boston Chamber of Commerce </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>315 Mass. 712, 716. The burden is upon the taxpayer to show that she is entitled to the exemption claimed. <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>331 Mass. 329,345.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">We are of opinion that under the trust instrument the trustee has not sustained the burden of showing that she can claim an exemption at the request of Edward. We think that a reading of \u00a7 10 along with \u00a7 8 (a) and \u00a7 12 is not precluded because of the reference only to \u00a7 9 and \u00a7 10 in \u00a7 10 (3). The exemptions granted by \u00a7 8 (a) and \u00a7 12 are intended for the benefit of persons who are taxed. The tax here imposed by \u00a7 10 is not on the ground that there is income accumulated for Edward but because there is income accumulated for \u201cpersons with uncertain interests.\u201d As these persons are uncertain, there is no way in which anyone can invoke under \u00a7 12 the benefit of an exemption under \u00a7 8 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">The trustee is not entitled to the abatement. The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is reversed, and a decision for the State tax commission is to be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-9\"> G.
