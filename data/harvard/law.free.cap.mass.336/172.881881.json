The board refused to hear the testimony of two physicians as to the nature of the employee\u2019s back injuries. The Superior Court ordered an award to be paid to the employee, having on its own accord found him to have been disabled for more than a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The insurer waived notice and claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">A back strain arising out of and in the course of employment has frequently been held to be an injury within the workmen\u2019s compensation act, <em>Brzozowski\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 113, <em>McManus\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 171, <em>Franklin\u2019s Case, </em>333 Mass. 236, and becomes a compensable injury if it results in incapacity which need not be continuous but may be irregular, if it exists for more than a week. See <em>Paterno\u2019s Case, </em>266 Mass. 323, 326; <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, </em>288 Mass. 96; <em>Falcione\u2019s Case, </em>305 Mass. 433; <em>Vass\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 297, 300. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 29, as appearing in St. 1937, c. 382, as amended. The case was reserved not because the employee did not prove that his injuries were causally related to his employment but because he did not prove that they had resulted in disability for the prescribed period of a week as required by \u00a7 29, and to see if the injury would develop or become aggravated in the performance of his duties and lead to definite partial or permanent disability sufficient to prevent him from earning wages. <em>Falcione\u2019s Case, </em>305 Mass. 433. <em>Amon\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 210, 216. <em>Hummer\u2019s Case, </em>317 Mass. 617, 620-621. <em>Carmody\u2019s Case, </em>333 Mass. 249, 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">There was no error in the refusal of the board to hear additional medical testimony showing the nature of the employee\u2019s injury. There seems to be no doubt as to the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>jury but the only question was the duration and extent of the incapacity. Furthermore, the hearing of additional testimony is a matter wholly within the discretion of the board especially where the testimony related to the nature of the injury rather than to its extent. <em>Gramolini\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 86, 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The decree of the Superior Court awarding compensation was erroneous and must be reversed. There was nothing in the report of the reviewing board that would justify an award. The only duty of the Superior Court was to grant the decree required by the facts found by the board. The finding of facts was the exclusive function of the board. <em>Filosa\u2019s Case, </em>295 Mass. 592, 596. <em>Willand\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 677, 678. <em>Lambert\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 516, 518. <em>Gramolini\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 86, 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The decree is reversed and in accordance with the reservation the case, for reasons above mentioned, is remanded to the Industrial Accident Board for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
