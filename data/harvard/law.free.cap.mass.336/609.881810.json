In each case, the defendant filed a motion for a directed verdict which was denied. There were verdicts for the plaintiff. The trial judge, under leave reserved, entered a verdict for each defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">The action against Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (hereinafter called Metropolitan) was to recover under the double indemnity feature of a fife insurance policy covering the life of the plaintiff\u2019s husband (hereinafter called the insured). The action against United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company (hereinafter called Fidelity) was brought to recover under an accident policy taken out by the insured. The provisions, here relevant, of the two policies were closely similar in all substantial respects. The Metropolitan policy fairly raises the questions now presented for decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This policy provided for a special death benefit \u201cupon receipt at the home office of the company ... of due proof of the death of the insured as the result of bodily injury effected solely as described below.\u201d The provision thus referred to provided that the extra indemnity \u201cshall be payable only if the death of the insured results as a consequence of bodily injury effected solely through external, violent, and accidental means within sixty days after such injury independently and exclusively of all other causes. This in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>demnity shall not be payable if the death of the insured results directly or indirectly from disease or from bodily or mental infirmity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The jury, after considering a special question put to them by the trial judge, answered that the accident, mentioned below, was \u201cthe sole cause of death.\u201d The facts stated most favorably to the plaintiff are set out below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The insured was admitted to the Quincy City Hospital on April 8, 1952, following injuries suffered in an accident in which his automobile, after having been hit by another automobile, itself hit a tree. The insured \u201chit the steering wheel with a rather big impact.\u201d Upon the day of his admission to the hospital, he had a blood pressure as high as 226/152. The hospital record showed a history of \u201ca coronary attack around Thanksgiving Day, for which he was admitted and . . . some angina pectoris a few years before that.\u201d The plaintiff was driving with her husband and was also admitted to the hospital as a result of the accident. The insured was discharged on April 16, 1952 (with a blood pressure of 185/120), to \u201crest at home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">On May 21, 1952, the insured was again admitted to the hospital \u201ccomplaining of pain in chest\u201d with a blood pressure of 180/108 and with a history of having \u201cbeen a coronary case for a certain number of years\u201d and \u201cof hypertension and coronary insufficiency.\u201d He was on his way to the hospital to take his wife home, when he developed \"chest pain and vomiting.\u201d He died suddenly late the next afternoon, May 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The plaintiff testified that the insured \u201cprior to the accident . . . was generally very nervous\u201d and became \u201cextremely nervous . . . pitifully so\u201d after the accident; that he \u201cdidn\u2019t look well enough to go home\u201d on April 16, when he was discharged from the hospital; and that he remained in a highly nervous state between April 16 and May 21. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>During this period she saw him every day and found him worried over her health and the family finances. The insured, she said, had \u201cworked constantly until the date of the accident, as far as she knew.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">A qualified doctor, called by the plaintiff, in a long hypothetical question about the cause of the insured\u2019s death, was asked to assume that the insured was \u201ca man fifty-eight years old who has for some time had a condition of heart hypertension, but is otherwise in reasonably good health\u201d with a hospital record showing \u201ccoronary observation\u201d and a \u201chistory of old coronary occlusion and angina\u201d and a diagnosis including \"hypertensive cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease history.\u201d The witness was also asked to assume facts about the accident, in general as stated above, but with some incidents of the accident stated in exaggerated terms \u2014 not appearing otherwise in evidence (for example, that the insured was thrown against the \u201csteering wheel which was broken\u201d and that the \u201ccar was wrecked\u201d). To this question the doctor answered that in his opinion \u201cthe automobile accident was directly the cause of\u201d the insured\u2019s death. The doctor went on to say (a) that the injuries to the insured, who was \u201cexcitable and nervous,\u201d in effect \u201ccaused his blood pressure to rise higher than . . . under normal conditions\u201d thus putting \u201can extra strain on his heart muscle, which caused some damage to that muscle,\u201d and (b) that, following his discharge from the hospital and stay at home, \u201cthe excitement of going to the hospital to pick his wife up . . . and of the emotional factors involved . . . again raised his blood pressure to a point where something happened within his heart muscle\u201d so that he had to be treated for his cardiac condition and died.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The doctor conceded that the insured\u2019s blood pressure was lower when readmitted to the hospital in May than when discharged in April, and that he did not think that the excitement and emotional factors of going to pick up one\u2019s wife would produce a coronary attack in a healthy or normal heart. He further conceded that it happened in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>\u201cbecause of the hypertensive cardiovascular disease that was present\u201d and also that \u201c[lijad he not had the heart disease, the chances are that nothing would have happened to him . . . that the disease of the heart actively cooperated with the accident to cause this death.\u201d The witness \u201cwould not have expected . . . [the insured] to die had he not been involved in the . . . accident.\u201d He pointed out that, although the improved blood pressure readings showed that the \u201cnervousness quieted down,\u201d it had not \u201ccompletely disappeared.\u201d The doctor conceded that his \u201cpurely gratuitous assumption of excitement and emotional factors \u201d on the part of the insured on May 21 was not based on personal knowledge that the insured was excited, and that there was no \u201csupport for his assumption\u201d in the hospital records. This assumption, he agreed, \u201cwas an essential part of the basis ... of his answer to the hypothetical question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The death certificate of the insured was introduced in evidence. It showed the cause of death to be \u201ccoronary artery disease\u201d and made no reference to the automobile accident and injuries. An excerpt from the report of post mortem examination also showed the cause of death as \u201ccoronary artery sclerosis with recent infarction\u201d and showed in various respects serious cardiac defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">1. The hypothetical question, in view of the exaggerated assumptions already mentioned and its failure to mention specifically the Thanksgiving Day coronary attack (only six months prior to the insured\u2019s death), might well have been excluded on the defendants\u2019 objection, when originally asked, or struck from the record at the time of the defendants\u2019 later motion to that effect. See <em>Brownhill </em>v. <em>Kivlin, </em>317 Mass. 168, 170; <em>Charron\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 519, 522-523; <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Blaisdell, </em>333 Mass. 51, 57, and cases cited. See also Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 682. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>323 Mass. 70, 74-75; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Seller, </em>329 Mass. 385, 389. Also, the answer to the question was admittedly based on a \u201cgratuitous assumption of excitement and emotional factors\u201d not shown by any evidence. It is unnecessary, however, to decide whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>trial judge erred (see <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Creeley, </em>257 Mass. 21, 26-27; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Hotel Statler Co. Inc. </em>327 Mass. 28, 31) in failing to strike the answer to the question. Because it was based upon at least this one important \u201cgratuitous assumption\u201d not supported in the record, the opinion of the doctor given in answer to the question \u201cis revealed by the cross-examination to have been no real opinion at all\u201d (see <em>Brownhill </em>v. <em>Kivlin, </em>317 Mass. 168, 170; <em>Maniscalco </em>v. <em>Director of the Division of Employment Security, </em>327 Mass. 211, 215-216; <em>Ralph\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 86, 89-90; see also <em>Nass </em>v. <em>Duxbury, </em>327 Mass. 396, 401-402) and, therefore, not a proper or adequate basis for the jury\u2019s finding on the issue of cause of death. The omission of an apparently undisputed fact about the Thanksgiving Day coronary attack confirms the impropriety (see <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Creeley, </em>257 Mass. 21, 27) of permitting weight to be given to the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">2. Without the answer to the hypothetical question (and even taking it into account in view of its infirmities), there is no evidence adequate to warrant a finding for the plaintiff. The evidence of the plaintiff about the nervous condition of her husband between his discharge from the hospital in April and his death in May, although admissible as a matter of common observation by a lay person (see <em>Koch </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>247 Mass. 459, 463; <em>Vieira </em>v. <em>East Taunton Street Railway, </em>320 Mass. 547, 550-551), was not sufficient, either alone or with any other evidence, to prove what the plaintiff must prove in order to recover, namely, that the insured\u2019s death (in the case of the Metropolitan policy) \u201cresults as a consequence of bodily injury\u201d and not \u201cdirectly or indirectly from disease or . . . bodily . . . infirmity,\u201d and (in the case of the Fidelity policy) arose \u201cfrom bodily injuries effected . . . solely through accidental means \u201d and \u201cnot . . . directly or indirectly, wholly or partly, by disease . . . whether the disease ... is the . . . proximate or a contributing cause of death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The plaintiff is not helped by the doctor\u2019s testimony in addition to his answer to the hypothetical question. The doctor agreed that '(the disease of the heart actively co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>operated with the accident to cause this death,\u201d a statement which, if believed, showed that the heart disease was sufficiently a cause of the insured\u2019s death to make it a \u201ccontributing\u201d cause, so that the injuries could not be the sole cause \u201cindependently of all other causes.\u201d Although the doctor stated that he would not have \u201cexpected . . . [the insured] to die had he not been involved in the automobile accident,\u201d none of the doctor\u2019s testimony, even taken alone and in unduly isolated fragments (compare <em>Woods </em>v. <em>De-Mont, </em>322 Mass. 233, 235, and cases cited in <em>Hannon </em>v. <em>Hayes-Bickford Lunch System, Inc., ante, </em>268, 270), goes to the extent of showing what the plaintiff was bound to show (see <em>Lubianez </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>323 Mass. 16, 18-19; <em>Krantz </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>335 Mass. 703, 713), namely, that the insured\u2019s death was not within the class of cases excluded from each company\u2019s range of liability under its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Each defendant is, of course, to be held only to the liability it assumed under its policy. See <em>Gorski </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>315 Mass. 17, 18-19. Here the plaintiff has failed to show that the insured\u2019s death came within the policies. The rule applicable to cases like the present one was stated in <em>Leland </em>v. <em>Order of United Commercial Travelers of America, </em>233 Mass. 558.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court, in that case, denied recovery because the deceased was suffering from disease \u201cwhich actively co-operated ... in causing death\u201d and because the disease and the accident \u201cwere concurring, efficient and proximate causes in producing the death.\u201d The <em>Leland </em>case has been cited with apparent approval as recently as in <em>Howe </em>v. <em>National Life Ins. Co. </em>321 Mass. 283, 287-288. The <em>Howe </em>case, and authorities therein cited, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>show the clear line of distinction adopted by our decisions between (a) death caused by a disease induced by the injury, even if the insured had some \u201cfrailty or general weakness . . . [or] predisposition to a disease, or ... a disease then . . . dormant\u201d and (b) \u201cthe aggravation of an existing heart disease by an accident\u201d so that death is \u201ccaused by the joint operation of a preexisting disease,\u201d in which event the \u201caccident is not within the scope of the policy\u201d (at page 287). The plaintiff here has clearly failed to show that the insured\u2019s death was \u201cdue to an accident alone and independent of a concurring disease.\u201d She is barred by the doctrine that an \u201caccident that is merely the contributing cause of death cannot be said to be the sole cause operating independently of all other causes\u201d (at page 288). The following cases are distinguishable: <em>Kramer </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>293 Mass. 440, 442-445 (fall caused \u201cgerms present in the [insured\u2019s] body . . . to light up\u201d); <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>296 Mass. 535, 537-538 (insured\u2019s heart condition on conflicting evidence found not to be a cause of death); <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>304 Mass. 564, 566-568 (subsequent disease occurring as result of accident); <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Accident Co. </em>307 Mass. 246, 250-251 (evidence held to show that it was more likely that death occurred as a result of injury within the policy than by other means).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">3. It is not necessary to consider the defendant\u2019s exceptions and they are dismissed. The plaintiff\u2019s exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-11\"> The Fidelity accident policy protected the insured \u201cagainst loss, as herein defined, resulting directly and independently of all other causes, from bodily injuries effected during the term of this policy, solely through accidental means sustained while the insured is operating, . . . riding in ... a private passenger automobile.\u201d This policy also provided \u201cThis insurance shall not cover . . . death . . . caused directly or indirectly, wholly or partly, by disease or infection, whether the disease or infection is the primary, proximate or a contributing cause of death.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-9\"> Each defendant contends that the plaintiff did not present seasonably due proof that the insured\u2019s death was caused in a manner within the policy issued by that defendant. In the view that we take of the case there is no occasion to consider this issue or to state the facts with reference to the proofs filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-6\"> At pages 564-565, Rugg, C.J., said, \u201c[I]f the insured was suffering from a disease, which was accelerated and aggravated by the accident so as to be a cause co-operating with it to produce the fatal end, then there can be no recovery. Manifestly recovery is not barred merely because the insured is suffering from disease. One upon a bed of illness may meet death by . . . accidental means. ... If there is no active disease, but merely a frail general condition, so that powers of resistance are easily overcome, or merely a tendency to disease which is started up and made operative, whereby death results, then there may be recovery even though the accident would not have caused that effect upon a healthy person in a normal state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
