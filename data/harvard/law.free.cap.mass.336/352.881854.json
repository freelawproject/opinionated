West has presented three accounts for allowance. A guardian ad litem, appointed to represent persons unborn or unascertained who may become interested in the trust estate, challenges the propriety of one item charging to principal certain Federal income taxes on capital gains. He agrees, however, that all other items in the accounts are proper. The facts are stipulated and the case is reported to this court by the probate judge without decision in accordance with G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 215, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Frank M. West, by his will, gave the residue of his estate to his trustee in trust to pay the income to his widow (who is still living) for her life.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the widow\u2019s death the income is to be paid in equal shares to the testator\u2019s two daughters (each of whom is still living and unmarried) for their lives, with remainder over at their respective deaths to persons not now ascertainable. The trustee may either allow the trust estate \u201cto remain as,invested, or . . . invest or reinvest the same\u201d in such investments as savings banks are permitted to make in this Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Among the original trust assets transferred to the trustee were three hundred shares of each of two real estate trusts owning residential real estate in Cambridge. During the years 1941 to 1952, inclusive/ the trustee received cash dividends upon these shares in the aggregate amount of $33,600. The trustee was advised that $28,227.10 of these dividends (hereafter for convenience called the \u201ctax exempt\u201d income) did not constitute taxable income for Federal income tax' purposes, because it was \u201ctreated as a return of capital for . . . [such] purposes.\u201d All of these cash dividends (including the \u201ctax exempt\u201d income) were distributed to the widow -and she did not report the \u201ctax exempt\u201d income as income on her Federal income tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">In 1953, during the period covered by the accounts here under review, the trustee sold the shares in the two real estate trusts at a substantial profit over the inventory value. .For purposes of computing the Federal income tax on the capital gains, however, the trustee found it necessary to reduce the cost basis of the shares for Federal income tax purposes \u201cby the aggregate amount of so called \u2018tax exempt\u2019 income received by\u201d the trustee and paid to the widow from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>1941 to 1952, inclusive. These sales<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> resulted in a Federal income tax on the capital gain of $7,935.68 of which, of course, a considerable portion was caused by the reduction, already mentioned, in the cost basis of the shares of the two real estate trusts. The guardian ad litem contends that \u201cso much of the . . . Federal capital gains tax ... as was occasioned by the reduction ... of the cost basis of the . . . shares\u201d should be charged to income rather than to principal. The capital gains tax in fact was paid by the trustee entirely out of principal and was so charged in the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The general rule in Massachusetts is that, as between the current life beneficiary and remainder interests, all cash dividends, however large, are to be treated as income. <em>Minot </em>v. <em>Paine, </em>99 Mass. 101, 108. <em>Talbot </em>v. <em>Milliken, </em>221 Mass. 367, 368. This is a somewhat arbitrary, but exceedingly practical, rule of convenience (see <em>D\u2019Ooge </em>v. <em>Leeds, </em>176 Mass. 558, 560-561) now well established, and \u201c[p)]erhaps the strongest argument in favor of the . . . rule is its simplicity. Whether or not it would be more just to apportion . . ., it is an extremely difficult thing to do in many cases.\u201d See Scott, Trusts, (2d ed.) \u00a7 236.3 at page 1818; Restatement: Trusts (Sup. 1948) \u00a7 236. The courts will not normally go behind the determination of the corporation, trust, or association declaring the dividend as to its source, that is, whether it is to be distributed from the earnings or capital of the entity concerned (see <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Hemenway, </em>223 Mass. 293, 295-297; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>272 Mass. 432, 443), and, \u201c[i]n the absence of facts showing that dividends . . . were a part of the capital of the corporation, or that the payment of them essentially impaired or diminished the value of the shares, they are to be regarded as part of the income to which the cestui que trust for life are entitled.\u201d <em>Lannin </em>v. <em>Buckley, 256 </em>Mass. 78, 84. See Loring, Trustee\u2019s Handbook (Shattuck Rev.) \u00a7 82. On the present record there is no showing that the cash dividends here in issue were improp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>erly paid to the current life tenant, or that they were in any respect a return of capital of the two real estate trusts (see <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>261 Mass. 158, 168-169; Scott, Trusts [2d ed.] \u00a7 236.14) or declared as such, or that they were liquidating dividends (compare <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>272 Mass. 432, 441-444; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>326 Mass. 691, 694-695; Scott, Trusts [2d ed.] \u00a7 236.10), which should have been added to principal. In view of the express authority given to the trustee to allow the trust estate \"to remain as invested,\u201d there was no obligation on the trustee to convert to some new investment authorized by the will the real estate trust shares or to apportion the cash dividends from the real estate trust shares, even if (which does not appear on this record and, in view of the substantial profit realized upon their sale, seems unlikely) they were wasting assets. See <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>261 Mass. 158, 163-168; <em>Dexter </em>v. <em>Dexter, </em>274 Mass. 273, 275-277; <em>Nelligan </em>v. <em>Long, </em>320 Mass. 439, 444-446; Newhall, Settlement of Estates (3d ed.) \u00a7 375 at pages 941-942. Indeed, the guardian ad litem makes no contention that these cash dividends should have been added to principal, in whole or in part. Compare <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>272 Mass. 432, 441-444, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">We do not regard the stipulation that the distributions were \"not taxable for Federal income tax purposes\u201d and were \"considered a return of capital for Federal income tax purposes\u201d as showing that the dividends were properly to be treated, for purposes of trust accounting, as a return of the capital of the two real estate trusts which must be added to principal. The rules governing the treatment of the dividends of corporations, associations, and trusts for income tax purposes frequently vary from the principles governing allocation of the receipts of a trust as between life tenant and remainderman. See, for example, <em>Follett </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>267 Mass. 115, 119-121; <em>Holcombe </em>v. <em>Ginn, </em>296 Mass. 415, 416-417.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Ordinarily, an income tax upon capital gains is to be charged to the principal of the trust as constituting \u201ca tax upon capital transactions the substantial benefit of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>goes to capital.\u201d <em>Holcombe </em>v. <em>Ginn, </em>296 Mass. 415, 416. See Restatement: Trusts, \u00a7 233, comment f; Scott, Trusts (2d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 233-233.3; Newhall, Settlement of Estates (3d ed.) \u00a7 354 at page 872; Loring, Trustee\u2019s Handbook (Shat-tuck Rev.) \u00a7\u00a7 67, 71. In the present case, however, a substantial part of the benefit of the capital gains has gone to the life tenant through the receipt of the \u201ctax exempt\u201d income which has reh'eved her pro tanto of Federal income tax, while, at the same time, increasing (through the consequent reduction of the tax basis of the shares) the amount of possible capital gains tax in the event of sale of the shares. For this reason the guardian ad litem argues that it would be equitable to charge to income that portion of the capit\u00e1l gains tax which is caused by the reduction of the tax basis of the shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In practical operation, the application of the principle behind this ingenious contention would destroy the simplicity Of the Massachusetts rules of allocation of trust receipts and expenses as between life tenant and remainder interests and might even work with great unfairness. Under circumstances like those here presented, it would manifestly be impractical to withhold as a reserve a portion of each cash dividend, equal to the estimated future capital gains tax on that portion of the dividend which represents a tax exempt return of capital, in order to provide for the eventuality that at some time in the future the shares producing th\u00e9 dividend will be sold at a profit. By our usual allocation rules the life tenant is entitled to the whole dividend. The shares may never be sold during the fife of the trust or may even be sold at a loss. Any capital gain in fact realized may be offset by capital losses on other trust investments or by a carry over capital loss. It - would certainly be unfair to charge the whole of - such capital gains tax as is caused by the prior distribution of the \u201ctax exempt\u201d income solely to the income of that one of a series of life tenants who happened to be entitled to the trust income at the time the gain was realized. One or more of the life tenants who have received the benefit of such cash dividends of \u201ctax exempt\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>income may have died before it has been determined that there is to be any tax upon the sale of the shares. The tax laws or the rates of taxation on capital gains may change after the dividend is paid, thus confusing any system of reserving for future gains taxes. Other uncertainties and practical difficulties may be imagined which would make impossible the fair application of any rule charging in part to income taxes on such capital gains. Such a rule could easily become a great obstacle to efficient, simple trust administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Accordingly, we hold, since the record shows no impropriety in the distribution to the life tenant of the whole of the cash dividends here discussed, including the \u201ctax exempt\u201d income, that she took the whole of that income with all its inherent income tax advantages and benefits and without any liability to contribute to the capital gains tax when, as, and if one should be later incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">A decree allowing the accounts here under review as presented is to be entered in the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\"> The will gave to the trastee power, if the widow \u201cshall by reason of want, sickness or necessity, need any . . . principal ... to pay to her . ... from the principal such a sum ... as my children . . . shall from time to time approve.\u201d _ The question here raised has been considered without regard to this provision, since the record discloses no action by the trustee, with respect to the distribution to the widow of the \u201ctax exempt\u201d income (mentioned below), which would constitute compliance with the provision. - \u25a0</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\"> After taking into account certain offsets, not here material, by reason of losses on other sales of securities and a 1951 capital gains loss carry over.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
