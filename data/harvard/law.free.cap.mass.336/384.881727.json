L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 136, \u00a7 5, which provides that \u201cWhoever on the Lord\u2019s day keeps open his shop, warehouse or workhouse, or does any manner of labor, business or work, except works of necessity and charity, shall be punished . . ..\u201d The of-fences with which the defendant is charged are those stated in the first part of the statute, namely, the keeping open of a shop on a Sunday, to which proof that the keeping is a work of necessity or charity is no defence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Has, </em>122 Mass. 40. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dextra, </em>143 Mass. 28. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Starr, </em>144 Mass. 359, 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The cases were submitted on the following agreed facts. The defendant conducts a combination Kosher and super market which, because of his religious convictions, is closed to business every Saturday and Jewish holiday but remains open to business on Sundays. On the days specified in the complaints, which were Sundays, the defendant kept his market open after ten o\u2019clock in the forenoon and until closing time and did sell to the public Kosher meats, bakery goods, vegetables and canned goods of all types. It is apparent that the facts show violations of \u00a7 5 and do not bring the defendant within the limitations provided by \u00a7 6, as amended, namely, that \u00a7 5 shall not prohibit \u201cthe selling or delivering of kosher meat by any person who, according to his religious belief, observes Saturday as the Lord\u2019s day by closing his place of business during the day until six o\u2019clock in the afternoon, or the keeping open of his shop on the Lord\u2019s day for the sale of kosher meat between the hours of six o\u2019clock and ten o\u2019clock in the forenoon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The defendant\u2019s exceptions are to the denial of motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>to dismiss on the grounds \u201cThat the complaints do not set forth a crime fully, plainly, substantially and formally as required by art. 12 of the Constitution and by the standing laws,\u201d and \u201cThat the complaints charge that the defendant did: \u2018keep open your shop at 57 Sumner Avenue for the purpose of doing business therein,\u2019 which does not constitute a crime since the defendant is authorized to keep open his shop under the provisions of the 1950 amendment to \u00a7 6 of c. 136 of the General Laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The complaints adequately charge facts essential to the commission of the alleged offences. It is alleged that the keeping open of the shop was for the transaction of business and therefore for an unlawful purpose. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>2 Cush. 556, 558; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dextra, </em>143 Mass. 28; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>144 Mass. 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">That the rights of the defendant to religious liberty and equality <em>(Glaser </em>v. <em>Congregation Kehillath Israel, </em>263 Mass. 435, 437) under the Constitution of this Commonwealth are not violated by the enforcement of the instant statute is settled. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Has, </em>122 Mass. 40, 42. There was no error in denying the defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
