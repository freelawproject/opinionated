[corporation] to breach their written contracts with said corporation, and to steal certain drawings and blueprints.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">There was evidence that Progressive Machinery, Incorporated (hereinafter called the corporation), was the owner of a special \u201chinge tool\u201d used in the manufacture of small hinges for jewelry boxes, which its president had developed and perfected at a large expense in the space of about two years. The tool was not patented and its methods of manufacture were held by the corporation as trade secrets. The defendants Ernest and Louis Des Vergnes were employed by the corporation under an agreement executed January 19, 1955, under which they were prohibited, without its express consent, \u201cfrom disclosing or using any trade secrets which they learned in the course of their employment.\u201d They were discharged on October 28, 1955, for alleged manipulation of time cards. As a result of the defendant Engleman\u2019s advertisement for \u201chinge tool makers\u201d which it could be inferred was directed to employees or former employees of the corporation, the two Des Vergnes met him at Woon-socket, Rhode Island, on November 26, 1955. \u201cEngleman asked the Des Vergnes if they could make a tool similar to the one used by Progressive Machinery Corp. He promised them \u2018good money\u2019 if they would come to work for him and make such a tool. They told him that they had signed an agreement with Progressive Machinery Corp. by which they were not permitted to divulge the method and operation of the Progressive hinge tool. Engleman told the Des Vergnes brothers not to worry about the agreement, that it did not mean anything and that his lawyer could break it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Louis Des Vergnes arranged for Engleman to meet one Daniel Collins, a draftsman employed by the corporation, to discuss the matter of employment. Engleman thereafter met with Collins and the two Des Vergnes and offered Collins \u201cgood money to come to work for him . . . [saying] he was interested in getting prints and diagrams of Progressive\u2019s hinge tool.\u201d The Des Vergnes agreed to make a \u201chinge tool\u201d like the corporation\u2019s and to assist in securing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>\u201cother help\u201d, who were working for the corporation. \u201cEngleman urged Collins to secure drawings or copies of drawings of the Progressive Machinery Corp. hinge tool, and [said] that Engleman would put Collins on the payroll for some three months while Collins continued to work for Progressive Machinery Corp.; that at the end of the three-month period a hinge tool would have been built for Engle-man from blueprints and designs furnished by Collins and in accordance with the specifications of the Progressive Machinery Corp. tool, and at that time Collins could leave Progressive Machinery Corp. or pick a fight as an excuse to leave and then it could not be said that he had disclosed the trade secret of the hinge tool because it would already be in operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Engleman also talked with Desrosier, a tool maker employed by the corporation, who was in charge of the operation of the hinge tool and offered to pay him well if he \u201cwould take the blueprints of the hinge tool from Progressive . . . and make them available to Engleman.\u201d This was the last overt act by any of the conspirators as immediately after this conversation Engleman was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Each defendant excepted to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict of \u201cNot Guilty\u201d presented at the conclusion of the evidence, and each was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">A criminal conspiracy is generally understood to be \u201ca combination of two or more persons, by some concerted action, to accomplish some criminal or unlawful purpose, or to accomplish some purpose, not in itself criminal or unlawful, by criminal or unlawful means.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>4 Met. 111, 123. In the present case the indictment charges that the three defendants conspired to \u201csteal certain trade secrets, confidential methods, and tools\u201d of the corporation. The word \u201csteal\u201d as so used has, under the definitions of \u201cstealing\u201d in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 277, \u00a7 39, become a term of art and includes the criminal taking of personal property with intent to deprive the owner permanently of the use of it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozlowsky, </em>238 Mass. 379, 383. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farmer, </em>218 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>507, 509. Articles of personal property which may be the subject of larceny, other than those which were so held at common law (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabot, </em>241 Mass. 131, 140-141), are described in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 266, \u00a7 30 (2), as appearing in St. 1945, c. 282, \u00a7 2. Among them are listed \u201ca deed or writing containing a conveyance of land, any valuable contract in force, a receipt, release or defeasance, a writ, process, certificate of title . . ..\u201d All are writings, referred to according to their legal character. It is contended by the Commonwealth that the word \u201cprocess\u201d is sufficiently broad to include \u201ctrade secrets\u201d; but the term must be interpreted in its context and it is manifest that it is used in the sense of a paper or writing issued by some court in the exercise of its jurisdiction. As such secrets and methods are not the subject of larceny, that part of the indictment which charges a conspiracy to steal them states no offence and must be disregarded. Respecting the remaining allegation of conspiring to steal tools belonging to the corporation, there was no evidence that the three defendants or any two of them so conspired. Doubtless it could be found from Engleman\u2019s talks that he would have been willing to obtain by theft anything material to the manufacture of the hinge tool but it did not appear that either of the Des Vergnes agreed to arrange for or to participate in a larceny. Their activities were limited to obtaining information for Engleman and to promising assistance in manufacturing the tool.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The motions of the respective defendants for the direction of verdicts of not guilty should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\n<em>Judgments for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
