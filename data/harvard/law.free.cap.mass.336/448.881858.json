Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the bill read in part as follows: \u201c6. The plaintiff signed . . . upon the specific representation and agreement that the . . . land was to be used as a place ... to sell automobiles and that if a license to sell automobiles was not obtained then the lease was to be . . . void and all sums paid ... to the defendant under said lease would be returned .... 7. By inadvertence of the parties . . . the . . . representation and agreement were . . . not incorporated in the lease . . ..\u201d It is alleged that the request for a license was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">The defendant filed a demurrer which assigned as reasons therefor, among others, (1) the pendency as shown by the bill of actions at law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought by the defendant to recover rent for the months of May, June, July, and August, 1956; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>(2) the adequacy of the remedy at law; (3) that the bill shows \u201cthat the plaintiff seeks to vary a written instrument concerning an interest in land and that the representations . . : were not in writing as required by\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 259, \u00a7 1; and (4) that the allegations of paragraph 7 state a conclusion of law and do not set forth facts to inform the defendant of the claim asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The demurrer was sustained on the third and fourth grounds mentioned, and, the plaintiff having failed to take advantage of leave to amend, a final decree was entered dismissing the bill. The plaintiff appealed both from the interlocutory decree sustaining the demurrer and from the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">1. Paragraph 6 of the bill alleges that the lease was signed \u201cupon the specific representation and agreement\u201d that if a license to sell automobiles was not obtained, the lease was to be void. The quoted words may perhaps indicate that the \u201crepresentation\u201d was oral (see <em>Southwick </em>v. <em>Spevak, </em>252 Mass. 354, 356-357; compare <em>Bank of Commerce &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Schooner, </em>263 Mass. 199, 204-205) but we cannot say that the word \u201cagreement,\u201d even considered with the other allegations of the bill, implies an oral agreement. <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>304 Mass. 15, 16-17 (where it was held that an allegation that the parties \u201centered into an agreement\u201d did n\u00f3t \u201cshow that the contract was oral\u201d although the court also held that the plaintiff, who admitted in his brief that the contract was oral, could not be said to have \u201csuffered any harm\u201d from the sustaining of a demurrer based upon the statute of frauds). Compare <em>Denvir </em>v. <em>North Avenue Savings Bank, </em>290 Mass. 137, 138 (where, with respect to an allegation that the defendant \u201cagreed with the plaintiff\u201d on certain matters it was said that it was \u201cplain from the declaration as a whole that the alleged agreement . . . was oral\u201d); <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>Lowenstein, </em>314 Mass. 642, 645 (allegations that the plaintiff \u201cdid talk\u201d with the defendant, who \u201ctold\u201d the plaintiff certain matters held to \u201cimport that the representations were made orally\u201d); <em>Cluff </em>v. <em>Picardi, </em>331 Mass. 320, 321 (where bill incorporated by reference a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>memorandum inadequate to satisfy the statute of frauds). Compare also <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>5 Cush. 90, 92; <em>Slack </em>v. <em>Black, </em>109 Mass. 496, 499; <em>Ahrend </em>v. <em>Odiorne, </em>118 Mass. 261, 268. Since \u201cit does not appear in the bill that\u201d the agreement \u201cwas not in writing, noncompliance with the statute [of frauds] is not a ground on which the demurrer can be sustained.\u201d <em>West </em>v. <em>Day Trust Co. </em>328 Mass. 381, 384. Compare <em>Ranicar </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>326 Mass. 710, 712-713 (where on the face of the bill it appeared that a promise was oral and a demurrer based upon the statute of frauds was held to have been sustained properly).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">2. The defendant contends that the plaintiff has inadequately pleaded the facts of a mutual mistake, which would support the requested reformation of the lease. It is argued that the allegation of paragraph 7 of the bill, with respect to the omission \u201cby inadvertence\u201d of the alleged agreement for invalidation of the lease (if a license was not obtained), is an allegation only of a conclusion of law (compare <em>Cabot </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>335 Mass. 53, 58, and cases cited) not admitted by demurrer. The words \u201cby inadvertence,\u201d it is contended, do not adequately state the circumstances under which the alleged agreement was omitted from the executed lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In <em>Tremont Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Burack, </em>235 Mass. 398, 402, it was said that the word \u201cinadvertence,\u201d as used in an agreement exonerating a bank from liability for failing to observe an order stopping payment on a check, \u201cembraces the effect of inattention, the result of carelessness, oversight, mistake, or fault of negligence.\u201d Often if not usually, when a mistake occurs, the person who makes it (let alone others) cannot himself explain why or how it occurred. We think that grounds for equitable relief are here sufficiently set forth by the allegations (1) that the parties intended to include the omitted provisions; (2) stating the substance of the omitted provision; (3) stating the provisions of the executed lease; and (4) that the omission was by mistake (that is, human failure of performance) of the parties and \u201cwithout intention or design.\u201d Compare <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Goriansky, </em>321 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>200, 205. Mistakes in the expression, or carrying out, of the agreed intention of the parties have been alleged in other cases, where reformation has been sought, without much more particularity. <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>230 Mass. 544, 546, 553 (omission of seal alleged to be \u201cdue to accident\u201d). <em>Franz </em>v. <em>Franz, </em>308 Mass. 262, 265-266 (examination of original papers shows alleged mistake in conveyance was set forth merely as having occurred \u201cby mutual mistake of the parties\u201d). <em>Century Plastic Corp. </em>v. <em>Tupper Corp. </em>333 Mass. 531 (original papers show bill alleged provision omitted \"by mutual inadvertence and mistake\u201d). The words \u201cof the parties\u201d import sufficiently the mutual character of the mistake necessary for relief. <em>Mates </em>v. <em>Penn Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>316 Mass. 303, 306. <em>Century Plastic Corp. </em>v. <em>Tupper Corp. </em>333 Mass. 531, 533. See <em>Dzuris </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>216 Mass. 132, 135; <em>Eno </em>v. <em>Prime Manuf. Co. </em>317 Mass. 646, 650. Compare <em>Vallis </em>v. <em>Rimer, </em>335 Mass. 528, 532-533 (mistake of expression not mutual).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The situation is unlike that which would be presented by an allegation that performance by the plaintiff had been obtained by \u201cduress\u201d (see <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Dane, </em>298 Mass. 216, 218) or by \u201cfraud\u201d (see <em>Cosmopolitan Trust Co. </em>v. <em>S. L. Agoos Tanning Co. </em>245 Mass. 69, 73; <em>Krebiozen Research Foundation </em>v. <em>Beacon Press, Inc. </em>334 Mass. 86, 90) each of which would plainly be inadequate to state a cause of action in'the absence of detailed statements of the facts constituting the duress or the fraud. Duress or fraud, in a very real sense, are conclusions of law from other facts; but mistake, in the omission from a document of a provision intended to be included, is a fact in itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Doubtless, where practicable, more detailed allegations of the manner in which the mistake occurred as, for example, by the failure of a scrivener to understand and carry out instructions, ought to be made where such specification is practicable. The allegations in the present case, however, seem sufficient to be good against demurrer and adequately to inform the defendant of the mistake which is alleged to have taken place and the basic facts with respect to it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>See <em>Monach </em>v. <em>Koslowski, </em>322 Mass. 466, 468-469. We do not follow cases in other jurisdictions suggesting that an allegation of inadvertence is an allegation of a conclusion of law. See, for example, <em>Glendale Union High School District </em>v. <em>Peoria School District No. </em>11, 51 Ariz. 478, 482-483; <em>Dover </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>186 Ga. 19, 28; <em>Baseman </em>v. <em>Shell Union Oil Corp. </em>138 Pa. Super. 512, 518.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">3. Notwithstanding the statutory right under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 31, to raise equitable defences at law, the plaintiff here is not barred from appropriate equitable relief, by way of reformation, on the ground that it has an adequate remedy at law in the actions brought against it. See <em>Elm Farm Foods Co. </em>v. <em>Cifrino, </em>328 Mass. 549, 553. See also <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad </em>v. <em>Preferred Underwriters, Inc. </em>252 Mass. 1, 6. In various respects the equitable remedy by way of reformation could prove more complete and appropriate than asserting an equitable defence to successive actions at law for rent. The pending actions at law, even though disclosed on the face of the bill, are no bar to appropriate equitable relief. <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>121 Mass. 21, 24, 26. See <em>Bancroft Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Canane, </em>271 Mass. 191, 197-199.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">4. It is unnecessary at this stage of the litigation to consider whether, if at the trial it shall appear that the agreement to include the omitted provision was oral, reformation must be denied because the omitted provision may have been within the statute of frauds,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or whether the omitted provision is of a character, or other circumstances exist, which may make the statute of frauds inapplicable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>5.. The interlocutory decree sustaining the demurrer and the final decree are reversed, the demurrer is to be overruled and the case is to stand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"aqi-dedup-0\"> The bill also alleges that in a prior action the defendant recovered (by default and not after hearing on the merits) rent for the months of February, March, and April, 1956, and that the plaintiff paid rent for September and October, 1955, in advance. The bill does not show whether rent for three additional months was paid before the license was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-7\"> See also 45 Am.
