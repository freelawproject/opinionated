The agreement was in form similar to forms used for the sale of real estate. Cook had been introduced by one of the defendants with whom the plaintiffs had \u201clisted the property for sale.\u201d Cook paid a deposit of $4,750, and this was paid to the defendants under a paragraph of the agreement reading, \u201cIt is understood and agreed that a brokers commission of $4,500 is to be paid to . . . [the defendants] by the seller. Pending final passing of papers said deposit shall be held in escrow by . . . [the defendants].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Cook, on June 15, 1955, the performance date, was unable to produce the required balance due and had at all times been uncertain whether he could do so although the plaintiffs did not have doubts when the agreement was signed. On June 15 Cook and the plaintiffs sent the defendants a letter stating Cook\u2019s acknowledgment of his financial inability to complete, and the plaintiffs\u2019 offer to comply, and requesting the defendants to release the escrowed funds to the plaintiffs. The defendants paid the plaintiffs $250 and retained $4,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The requests for rulings were denied \u201cas not being in accord with the facts found.\u201d There being no findings of fact, this was not a correct way of disposing of the requests. <em>Mericantante </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>291 Mass. 261, 263. But the implications of the evidence stated in the bill of exceptions suggest what the judge had in mind. See <em>Povey </em>v. <em>Colonial Beacon Oil Co. </em>294 Mass. 86, 93; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>296 Mass. 327, 337; <em>Orcutt </em>v. <em>Signouin, </em>302 Mass. 373, 375. The issue presented is, we take it, whether the trial judge could reasonably have concluded that the thing specified to be done in the implied offer of the owners to the brokers was to get the owners the purchase price, or was only to find a buyer who would sign a binding contract. See <em>John T. Burns &amp; Sons Inc. </em>v. <em>Hands, </em>283 Mass. 420, 422. The requests included the general one that \u201cOn all the evidence the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover.\u201d Some of them stated law applicable to a listing with \u201cthe understanding . . . that the plaintiff should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>effect a sale.\u201d <em>Menton </em>v. <em>Melvin, </em>330 Mass. 355, 357. In such a case it is settled that the broker becomes entitled to his commission when the owner executes a binding contract, that by such execution the seller accepts the buyer as ready, able, and willing to purchase on the terms stated, and that the broker\u2019s rights are not affected by the actual inability of the buyer to perform or the return of the deposit, <em>ibid., </em>pages 356-357, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The bill states possibly relevant evidence, additional to that stated above, as follows: One of the plaintiffs testified that they \"listed the property for sale . . . and set the price they were desirous of obtaining, namely, $47,500.\u201d One of the defendants testified that one of the plaintiffs \"listed the property with their office for sale and asked [the] defendants to find a buyer at a selling price of $47,500.\u201d The other defendant \"testified that the listing was given to them and that it was their business to find a buyer.\u201d The agreement of sale was drawn by an attorney who happened to be in the defendants\u2019 office when Cook walked in. The defendants introduced the attorney to Cook and he asked the attorney to take care of the details of the proposed transfer for him. The attorney felt \u201cwhen he prepared the agreement, it was his duty to see that all parties connected were protected.\u201d One of the defendants took Cook to the local bank \u201cin order to assist in the completion of the transaction\u201d and \"felt under some sort of obligation to help the purchaser get the money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">There is nothing in these facts to support a finding that the offer to the brokers was to pay them a commission only if they obtained the purchase price. See <em>Staula </em>v. <em>Carrol, </em>312 Mass. 693; <em>Spritz </em>v. <em>Brockton Savings Bank, </em>305 Mass. 170; <em>E. A. Strout Realty Agency, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gargan, </em>328 Mass. 524, 527. The fact that one defendant felt under some sort of obligation to help Cook \"get the money\u201d did not show that the performance of whatever the obligation was which he felt was a condition of earning the commission. The escrow stated in the agreement between sellers and buyer was manifestly for the protection of the buyer in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>event the sellers were unable to give good title. Even though the brokers had earned their commission upon the signing of the contract, they were not then entitled to retain the buyer\u2019s deposit as the commission. So far as appears the attorney had no instructions from the defendants to reflect their right to a commission in the agreement, so that they would be bound by a suggestion in the agreement that the right to a commission was conditioned on the passing of papers. The statement of the right to a commission is unqualified. The testimony of one defendant that \u201cIf the transaction had been consummated, his commission would be $4,500\u201d is not evidence that he thought he was entitled to a commission only in the event of consummation. It does not negative the implication of the fact of listing that the defendants would earn a commission earlier. It is some evidence of the amount of the commission for the services actually rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">We see nothing to distinguish the case from the ordinary one in which the commission is earned when the customer is found who is ready, able, and willing to buy, as shown by the binding agreement. <em>Frankina </em>v. Salpietro, 269 Mass. 292. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Melbourne, </em>326 Mass. 372. <em>Menton </em>v. <em>Melvin, </em>330 Mass. 355. <em>McKallagat </em>v. <em>LaCognata, </em>335 Mass. 376. The parties affirmed the agreement, recognized the sellers\u2019 rights under it, and the buyer\u2019s forfeiture of his deposit. See <em>Macurdy </em>v. <em>Carver, </em>328 Mass. 434, 435, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The evidence that the brokers in violation of the escrow let the buyer\u2019s attorney, who drew the papers, hold part of the escrow fund does not defeat the brokers\u2019 right to a commission. This wrong action was a breach of an independent obligation and the plaintiffs have not been damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The defendants\u2019 answer that their commission \u201cwas paid them from the deposit\u201d is not sustained on the evidence, but the case has been dealt with as though recoupment had been duly pleaded and we so dispose of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">\n<em>Judgment to be entered for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
