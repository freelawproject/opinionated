No matter what might be said in defense of this method, the fact remains, that it is extremely unethical and wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">\u201cOne can best evaluate this situation by the case of our Selectman, who also, operates a large fleet of trucks. For many years before this truck operator arrived on the scene, it was unheard of, for Town Officials to employ or to hire, private trucks and heavy equipment, except during and after a very heavy snow storm. At that time the work was divided, fairly among our local truck owners, both big and small. Today and for several years, most of the work is given to our Selectman, not only following storms, but thru-out the entire twelve months, every year.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">\u201cOfficials have already pointed out that our Selectman, and truck operator, has bid for this work, and on the basis of bids submitted, is entitled to all Town Trucking contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">\u201cLet us not forget, that the presence of an official, who doubles both as a Selectman and as an operator of a fleet of trucks, not only discourages all competition, but aids his own cause tremendously by his presence on the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">\u201cOne may as well have a fifty foot neon sign erected on the roof of the Town Hall, reading, \u2018All truck owners, stay away, no bids wanted/ as to have a Selectman, operating a fleet of trucks, sitting on the Board, desiring and bidding for Town of Arlington work. The net results would be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\u201cOthers do not bid</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u201cLocal and outside truck operators have told me that they feel it is a waste of their time, to submit bids against our Selectman, also, engaged in the trucking business. Because of this attitude, instead of spirited bidding we have no bidding at all. Truck owners stay away.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u201cBest proof of this statement is the Town Manager\u2019s letter to the Editor. In his recent letter, he stated, that because there was only one bid, he felt compelled to reject the bid and re-issue another call for more bids at a later date. Doesn\u2019t it seem strange that no other trucking operator would be interested in Town work, approximating one hundred thousand dollars each year?</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\u201cThis issue is big and must be faced as well as corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\u201cBecause of the laxity in our Town Laws, and the apathy of Town Officials in correcting them, this situation can lead to corruption. How long must the People wait, before the Board of Selectmen and the Town Manager recognize this evil and do something to correct it?</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Sincerely,</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">Frederick J. Romley, Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">14 Proprietors Way\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">The counts contain allegations appropriate to an action of this kind, namely, that the plaintiff was the person to whom the letter referred; that the charges were false and malicious; and that he has been damaged.; Ajlemurrer by the defendant to each count asserting that the \u201cmatters contained therein are not sufficient in law to enable the plaintiff to maintain his action,\u201d that it \u201cdoes not state a cause of action,\u201d and that \u201cthe statements alleged to have been published by the defendant are not libelous of the plaintiff,\u201d was sustained and the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">The test to be applied as to the defamatory character of published words is whether in the mind of any considerable and respectable class of the community they tend to injure the reputation of the person to whom they refer and expose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>him to hatred, ridicule and contempt. <em>Ingalls </em>v. <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co. </em>304 Mass. 31, 34. <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>Sentinel Printing Co. </em>324 Mass. 13, 14. <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp. </em>324 Mass. 478, 487-488. <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>Boyle, </em>328 Mass. 30. <em>Poland </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co. </em>330 Mass. 701, 704. <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>333 Mass. 26, 27. The letter which the defendant published does not reflect upon the integrity of the plaintiff but criticizes the law by which he as a member of the board of selectmen can legally bid for town work. It does not charge or suggest that the plaintiff has subordinated the interest of the town to his own or has sought by reason of his position to obtain an unfair advantage over other bidders. <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>Boyle, supra, </em>page 32. <em>Poland </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co., supra, </em>pages 704-705. Compare <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Wakefield Item Co. </em>280 Mass. 451, 456; <em>Streeter </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>311 Mass. 180, 182; <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>Sentinel Printing Co., supra, </em>page 15. There was no error in sustaining the demurrer on both counts. In our opinion it is an appropriate case for an order for judgment under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 125. <em>Keljikian </em>v. <em>Star Brewing Co. </em>303 Mass. 53, 61-63. <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>326 Mass. 31, 34. <em>Gavin </em>v. <em>Purdy, </em>335 Mass. 236, 239-240.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
