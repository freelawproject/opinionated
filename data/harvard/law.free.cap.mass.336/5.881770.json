The claimant, who is the widow of the deceased, filed the claim on behalf of herself and her two minor children. She contends that the employee\u2019s death was caused \u201cby reason of the serious and wilful misconduct of an employer or of any person regularly intrusted with and exercising the powers of superintendence.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 28, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 9. The claimant relies upon a violation of \u00a7 147 of bulletin numbered 12 of the regulations of the department of labor and industries, division of industrial safety, made pursuant to G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 149, \u00a7 6, as amended. This regulation apparently relates to the use of safety devices in the demolition of structural steel beams used in the construction of buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">The deceased employee was a foreman for the Shor Construction Company and in charge of the operations in demolishing a building in Springfield when a steel beam fell on him on January 5, 1955, as a result of which he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">The single member found that the employee\u2019s death was caused \u201cby negligence and disregard of the existing regulations on the part of the employer; that the disregard of said regulations was not such as to constitute serious and wilful misconduct nor wanton or reckless disregard of its probable consequences.\u201d He dismissed the claim. Upon a claim of review the reviewing board affirmed and adopted the findings and decision of the single member and denied the claim. The single member and the reviewing board took judicial notice of the regulations of the division of industrial safety. <em>Sciola\u2019s Case, </em>236 Mass. 407, 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">In her brief the claimant has laid stress upon these regulations, but a close examination of the record fails to disclose that these regulations were introduced in evidence at the hearing before the single member. It is true that mention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>was occasionally made of such regulations but at no time were they formally placed before the single member \u201cby some one of the recognized methods by which facts may be agreed upon or evidence introduced.\u201d We cannot take judicial notice of such regulations. <em>Finlay </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing Association, Inc. </em>308 Mass. 20, 27. <em>Mastrullo </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>328 Mass. 621, 622. In the absence of these regulations there was no evidence before us that the death of the employee was caused \u201cby reason of the serious and wilful misconduct of . . . [the] employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">We think that we ought to say, however, that even if the regulations were properly before us the findings of the reviewing board would have to be sustained. <em>Burns\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 8, 10. <em>Scaia\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The question whether an employee\u2019s death was caused \u201cby reason of the serious and wilful misconduct of an employer\u201d is one of fact. <em>Sciola\u2019s Case, </em>236 Mass. 407, 414. \u201c The burden of proof was on the claimant to show that she was entitled to double compensation. The' board found that that burden had not been sustained. This finding was not unsupported by the evidence. It was not contrary to law.\u201d <em>McCarthy\u2019s Case, </em>314 Mass. 610, 612. <em>Herrick\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">7 <em>Decree affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
