The bullet came from a rifle held by a stranger, one Mordeszewski, nearly sixteen years of age, who was alone in his room in a house in the vicinity and engaging in aiming practice. No similar shooting had occurred in the neighborhood, and the employer had no knowledge that Mordeszewski or anyone was in the habit of aiming firearms at its employees. The facts were agreed. The single member, constrained by <em>Harbroe\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 139, ruled that the employee\u2019s injury, although received in the course of his employment, did not arise out of the employment. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 26, as amended. The reviewing board adopted the decision of the single member. From a decree of the Superior Court dismissing his claim for compensation, the employee appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">In <em>Harbroe\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 139, a night watchman who was accidentally shot while on his employer\u2019s premises in an exchange of gunfire with law officers mistaken for robbers was held not to have received an injury arising out of his employment. That case, which was decided in 1916, cannot be accepted as stating the present law of this Commonwealth. Its decision was based, in part at least, upon the supposed absence of a special risk incident to the performance of the employee\u2019s duties (pages 141-143). But in the more recent view of our cases special exposure to the danger is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">We are unable to restrict the effect of certain language in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>those cases as the insurer has urged us to do. We think that they disclose the development of a consistent course which is a departure from the earlier view expressed, for example, in <em>McNicol\u2019s </em>Case, 215 Mass. 497. The injury \u201cneed not arise out of the nature of the employment. An injury arises out of the employment if it arises out of the nature, conditions, obligations or incidents of the employment; in other words, out of the employment looked at in any of its aspects.\u201d <em>Caswell\u2019s Case, </em>305 Mass. 500, 502. \u201cThe question is whether his employment brought him in contact with the risk that in fact caused his death. . . . The inquiry has been whether his employment exposed him to the risk, whatever it was, which actually caused the injury.\u201d <em>Souza\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 332, 334. \u201cThere was a causal connection between the employment and the injury if the employment exposed the employee to the risk which caused the injury.\u201d <em>Kubera\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 419, 420. \u201cIt is true that the employee might have been exposed to a similar risk if he had not been driving the taxi. But that is not the question. The question is whether his employment brought him in contact with the risk that in fact caused his injuries.\u201d <em>McLean\u2019s Case, </em>323 Mass. 35, 38. A material inquiry is whether the employee was upon his employer\u2019s premises occupying himself consistently with his contract of hire in some manner pertaining to or incidental to his employment. <em>Souza\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 332, 335. <em>Bradford\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 621, 622. <em>Zarba </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>322 Mass. 132, 134. <em>Warren\u2019s Case, </em>326 Mass. 718, 720-721. <em>Moore\u2019s Case, </em>330 Mass. 1, 3-4. Such occupation includes the act of leaving the premises at the end of the day\u2019s labor. <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 380. <em>White </em>v. <em>E. T. Slattery Co. </em>236 Mass. 28, 34. <em>Mannering\u2019s Case, </em>290 Mass. 517, 519. <em>Adiletto </em>v. <em>Brockton Cut Sole Corp. </em>322 Mass. 110, 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The insurer, however, objects that the nature of the injury necessarily precludes a finding that it arose out of the employment. Stress is laid upon the lack of relationship between the employee\u2019s work and the injury, upon the remote likelihood of such an occurrence anyway, upon the absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>of similar shootings in the neighborhood, and upon the lack of knowledge that the culprit or anyone thereabouts had a habit of aiming loaded firearms at the insurer\u2019s employees or at other persons. Those considerations would be proper in assessing liability in tort. We are dealing, however, with a workmen\u2019s compensation case. The findings of the board show that the employment brought the employee in contact with the risk of being shot by the particular bullet which struck him. See <em>Burgess\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 90, 92. It is, therefore, our opinion that the employee met with an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">No useful purpose would be served by a discussion of decisions in other jurisdictions. Some would be considered in accord with the result we reach. Some would not. The cases on stray bullets are to be found in Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7\u00a7 10.11-10.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The decree of the Superior Court is reversed, and a decree must be entered for the employee for compensation under the act. Costs of this appeal under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 11 A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 444, as amended, may be allowed by the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
