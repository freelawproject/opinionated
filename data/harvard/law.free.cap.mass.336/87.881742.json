Ahem a permit to use an existing one family dwelling at 444 Broadway, at Virginia Terrace, in a single residence district under the local zone ordinance, as a funeral home and for the services incident thereto. The plaintiffs are residents and landowners in the neighborhood, particularly on Virginia Terrace, a narrow, dead end street. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">Section 4 of the zone ordinance provides that permitted uses in single residence districts include \u201csubject to provisions of Section 23, paragraph H, funeral homes and serv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ices incident thereto.\u201d Section 23 provides that \u201cWhen in its judgment the public convenience and welfare will be substantially served, and where such exception will tend to improve the status of the neighborhood, the Board of Appeals may on petition, after public notice, a hearing, and subject to such appropriate conditions and safeguards as it may impose, in specific cases determine and vary the application of the district regulation^ herein established in harmony with their general purpose and intent as follows: ...(h) Grant permits for use of any building or dwelling in single residence, general residence, apartment house and restricted type apartment house districts for funeral homes and services incident thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">This provision, in the form of the statement of the criteria for action, is similar to that before the court in <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lexington, </em>321 Mass. 649, 652. As we there pointed out, the case under such an ordinance or by-law is not one for a variance. The application to the board of appeals is for a permit under an exception which the ordinance or by-law has created. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 40A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 4, 15. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>333 Mass. 114, 117-118.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The rule that the judge in the Superior Court is to hear the matter de nova and determine the legal validity of the decision of the board upon the facts found by him, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 40A, \u00a7 21, <em>Bicknell Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>330 Mass. 676, 679, <em>Pendergast </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>331 Mass. 555, 558-559, applies equally to cases like this where review is sought of action in respect of a special permit. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>333 Mass. 114, 118-119. <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lowell, </em>295 Mass. 224. <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lexington, </em>321 Mass. 649. <em>Everpure Ice Manuf. Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lawrence, </em>324 Mass. 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">But the stated criteria for determining the validity of the action of the board are not the same as in the case of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>application for a variance and the relevant facts are fewer. In contrast to the severe statutory limitations on the exercise of the variance power (c. 40A, \u00a7 15) the only statutory limitations on exceptions are that they \u201cshall be applicable to all of the districts of a particular class and of a character set forth\u201d in the ordinance or by-law and \u201cshall be in harmony with . . . [its] general purpose and intent\u201d (c. 40A, \u00a7 4). The local discretion is emphasized in the statutory permissions that such an exception \u201cmay be subject to general or specific rules . . . contained [in the ordinance or by-law]\u201d and that the \u201cboard of appeals . . . may, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, grant ... a special permit ... in accordance with such an exception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Under this statutory authority and the particular ordinance the legal validity of the decision of the board turns on whether the applicable \u201cgeneral or specific rules\u201d have been properly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The judge in the Superior Court found facts which are supported in the evidence as follows: The house is a large one, of ten rooms, \u201creally too large for a single residence, except under unusual circumstances . . ..\u201d The Aherns will occupy as a residence the upper part of the house and there will be no substantial structural change in the building. There will be an increase in traffic and of vehicles and people in the neighborhood. There are twenty-six children of tender age living in the residences on Virginia Terrace. A funeral home will adversely affect real estate values. \u201c[T]here is always the question of the hazards of increased traffic.\u201d He noted that in these aspects the funeral home would not tend to improve the status of the neighborhood, but observed also that those adverse factors apply to the coming of any funeral home anywhere and ruled that such factors could not be determinative for if they were there would be no sense in the provision of the zone ordinance allowing funeral homes in residence districts. He concluded, \u201cI find that the board acted within its rights in granting the application, in view of the somewhat peculiar situation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>this property, as hereinbefore set forth. In addition thereto, the property situated on Broadway is fairly adjacent to a business district, a bank and a supermarket. On the whole, it seems to me that the board was warranted in finding that the status of the neighborhood would be improved by the establishment of a well-kept funeral home, rather than having the locus remain unoccupied and unsold until it became unsightly or a derelict in the neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The additional relevant facts shown on the evidence are these: Broadway is a wide street with much traffic but the traffic thereon is lightest at the time when services in the funeral home will normally be conducted. There will be no noise from a funeral home. \u201cBetter than ninety-five per cent\u201d of funerals \u201care held.from funeral homes today.\u201d There are twenty-one such in Lynn. The nearest one is seven tenths of a mile away. From the photographs in evidence it can be reasonably concluded that the house was built some decades ago, and that the density of population near by is substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">1. The facts found and shown are insufficient to support the conclusion of the judge that \u201cthe board was warranted in finding that the status of the neighborhood would be improved\u201d by the change. The alternative to test this is not whether a greater improvement would have resulted if there had been a change, by permit, to a two family house, as \u00a7 23 of the ordinance authorized, or to some other possible alternative also requiring a permit. The alternative is between the probable character of the neighborhood if the permit should not be granted and its character with a funeral home. It was not essential therefore to show that a change to a two family house was not feasible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But the findings and the evidence do not support the conclusion that the \u201clocus [will] remain unoccupied and unsold until it . . . [becomes] unsightly or a derelict in the neighborhood.\u201d The only suggestion of this is in the finding, and the supporting evidence therefor, that \u201cthe house is really too large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>for a single residence, except under unusual circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no showing that there is not such a demand in Lynn for single residences for large families that the house could not be sold and used for a single family residence. The photographs do not show an obviously obsolete mansion. We see no evidence sustaining the implication of the finding that the house \u201chas been on the market ... for some time, and the respondents Ahern finally . . . bought the locus . . . .\u201d In the absence of evidence reasonably supporting the view that the house will become run down there is nothing to show a factor to offset the adverse effect of a funeral home on the status of the neighborhood, which the judge has expressly found to exist. There is doubtless the possibility that the house will bepome a derelict, but this cannot be guessed at. Some evidence to support the probability is required. The findings of the board in its decision do not serve as evidence. <em>Devine </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals of Lynn, </em>332 Mass. 319, 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">2. The trial judge made his findings and rulings with express reference only to the provision of the ordinance that the exception must \u201ctend to improve the status of the neighborhood.\u201d His only reference to the other requirement in the ordinance is in these words, \u201cIn granting the permit, the board of appeals in its judgment decided that the public convenience and welfare would be substantially served by such action. It remains to construe the words of the zoning ordinance [as to improving status].\u201d \u2022 So far as this was a ruling that the decision of the board in this respect was not subject to review it was in error. The provision of the ordinance that the determination that \u201cpublic convenience and welfare will be substantially served\u201d is to be by the board \u201cin its judgment\u201d does not exempt the exercise of that judgment from review on appeal. <em>Pendergast </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>331 Mass. 555. See <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lexington, </em>321 Mass. 649, 654-655. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>This is true even though the ordinance or by-law states few or no express standards for the exercise of judgment. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>333 Mass. 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Perhaps on the evidence it could be ruled that the board did not exceed its authority, that is, act unreasonably, in determining that public convenience and necessity would be served. Supporting facts in the evidence include the facts that funeral homes are now a community necessity, that 444 Broadway is in several aspects a reasonable place for one, that the zone ordinance itself recognizes that such uses belong in single residence districts, that many people live near by, and that the nearest funeral home is seven tenths of a mile away. But there is no evidence from which it can be concluded that there is a demand for funeral homes not fully served by existing such facilities, and in view of the error in the other aspect of the case which is controlling and the absence of an express ruling below on this point, we prefer not to rule on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">3. We have considered the other points made by the plaintiffs and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">4. In cases where we have found error in the decree of the Superior Court upholding the action of the board of appeals we have commonly directed that a decree be entered below that the decision of the board of appeals was in excess of its authority and is annulled. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 40A, \u00a7 21; <em>Blackman </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>334 Mass. 446, 451; <em>Atherton </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Bourne, </em>334 Mass. 451, 455; <em>Spaulding </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Leicester, </em>334 Mass. 688, 692. We think that in this case, however, justice will be served by a determination of the relevant facts in the Superior Court on another trial and to that end the entry will be</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">\n<em>Final decree reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-8\"> Inserted by St. 1954, c. 368, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\"> We find on the record no express evidence to support the finding that \u201cthe cost of converting it into a two family house would be prohibitive.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-6\"> The evidence as to \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d was this: \u201cThe judge: Too large for a single family except as they used to be, isn\u2019t it?
