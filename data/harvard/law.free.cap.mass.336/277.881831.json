Breck, Inc. (hereinafter called Breck), a Massachusetts corporation, has its principal office and factory in Springfield, where it manufactures chemical products \u201cfor sale and purchases other . . . merchandise for sale\u201d and sells such products. Breck \u201cfrom time to time ships merchandise for sale in other States from its Springfield office\u201d and also ships goods from warehouses outside Massachusetts to points outside the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u25a0 Breck filed a 1953 Massachusetts corporate excise return based (so far as concerns income) on that of 1952. Thereafter it sought abatement of $7,532.93 of its 1953 excise imposed under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 32, as amended (see, <em>infra, </em>note 4). The application alleged that too large a part of its net income was apportioned to Massachusetts, as the measure of the portion of its 1953 excise based upon net income, because in applying the formula by which income is to be allocated as between Massachusetts and areas outside Massachusetts the \u201cgross receipts assignable to Massachusetts . . . have been overstated by\u201d the amount of interstate sales shipped from Massachusetts to out-of-state customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">This application was denied by the State tax commission (hereinafter called the commission) and Breck appealed to the Appellate Tax Board, contending that if \u201cany part of the net income [of the corporation] is allocated for taxation in Massachusetts by a formula which measures such part by gross receipts from sales in interstate commerce, the tax on net income as measured by sales in interstate commerce would be in violation of the commerce clause . . . [art. 1, \u00a7 8] of the Constitution of the United States and a taking of property without due process of law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and in excess of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>powers of the state under said Constitution.\u201d The Appellate Tax Board granted the abatement requested and made findings and a report, from which the facts herein stated have been summarized. The commission has appealed pursuant to G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 321, \u00a7 7, as amended.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record includes the evidence before the board, as well as the formal documents referred to in \u00a7 13, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The excises now<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> imposed by Massachusetts on corporations are found in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, as amended. By \u00a7 32, as amended by St. 1939, c. 363, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> all Massachusetts business corporations of the class to which Breck belongs are subject to an excise measured in part by \u201ccorporate excess\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and in part by \u201cits net income determined to be taxable in accordance with . . . this chapter.\u201d \u201cNet in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>come\u201d is defined by \u00a7 30,.par. 5, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 327, \u00a7 3, as \u201cthe gross income from all sources, without exclusion, for the taxable year [here 1952], less the deductions [with certain minor exceptions not here relevant] . . . allowable by the federal revenue act applicable for said taxable year.\u201d Section 37 provides that the commissioner of corporations and taxation shall determine, in the manner provided in that section and \u00a7 38, \u201cthe part of the net income of a domestic business corporation derived from business carried on within the commonwealth.\u201d Under \u00a7\u25a0 37, certain items of income, for example, interest, dividends, and capital gains (except on tangible property situated outside Massachusetts), are to be allocated to Massachusetts. The remainder of the net income is by \u00a7 38, pars. 2 and 3, to be allocated to Massachusetts (if the corporation carries on any business at all outside Massachusetts) by a formula <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which makes use of three fractional or percentage indices, (a) tangible property in Massachusetts <em>related to </em>total property wherever situated; (b) wages and compensation paid by the corporation and assignable to Massachusetts <em>related to </em>total wages and compensation; and (c) gross receipts (mostly sales) assignable to Massachusetts <em>related to </em>total gross receipts. Equal weight is given to each index <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>by dividing the net income into thirds and allocating one third in accordance with each index. No tax is imposed on, or directly measured by, property, wages, or gross receipts. These items are merely used \u201cin combination\u201d as component parts of a single formula for the allocation of <em>net </em>income. See discussion by Rugg, C.J., in <em>Alpha Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>244 Mass. 530, 554-555. Paragraph 6 of \u00a7 38 provides in part that a \u201ccorporation\u2019s gross receipts from business assignable to this commonwealth shall be . . . its gross receipts for the taxable year from . . . sales, except those negotiated ... in behalf of the corporation by agents . . . chiefly situated at, connected with or sent out from premises for the transaction of business owned or rented by the corporation outside the commonwealth.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Breck does not question the allocation of the two third parts of its 1952 net income which were allocated in proportion to tangible property and wages. It complains only of the allocation of that one third part of net income.assigned under \u00a7 38, pars. 2 (c) and 6, in accordance with gross receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The Appellate Tax Board found that Breck\u2019s 1952 gross sales (after returns and allowances) were in effect divided into four groups:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">(a) Receipts [admittedly assignable to Massachusetts] including certain sales by a Massachusetts sales office to Massachusetts customers delivered frota a Massachusetts point to another Massachusetts point . . \u00a7343,425.77</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">\u201c(b) Sales [assignment here in dispute] by salesmen resident in Massachusetts to out-of-State . . . customers, delivery being made outside Massachusetts from stock in Massachusetts ....... 155,289.87</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">\u201c(c) Sales [assignment here in dispute] by salesmen resident outside Massachusetts to out-of-State . . . customers, delivery being made outside of Massachusetts from stock in Massachusetts ...... 3,101,533.66\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>(d) Sales [admittedly <em>not </em>assignable to Massachusetts] by Break\u2019s New York sales office to out-of-State dealers and customers by nonresident salesmen, delivery being made outside Massachusetts from stock in Massachusetts ($623,298.32) and by an out-of-State sales office to out-of-State customers from stock out-of-State <em>($3,636,767.07)......i </em>1,260,065.39</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">Total gross receipts ..... . $7,860,314.69</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The commission assigned to Massachusetts the receipts listed in items (a), (b), and (c) above and treated as gross receipts from outside Massachusetts the sales listed in item (d). The fraction representing the part assigned to Massachusetts of the one third of <em>net </em>income allocated on the basis of gross receipts was thus equal to about 45% derived as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">(a) $343,425.77 plus (b) $155,289.87 plus (c) $3,101,533.66 $7,860,314.69</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">The Appellate Tax Board found that the disputed items (b) and (c) above represented \u201csales in interstate commerce\u201d and ruled that these sales \u201ccould not be used as a basis for a tax on gross receipts.\u201d This determination resulted in an assignment by the board of gross receipts to Massachusetts , $343,425.77 producing an allocation fraction of equal to tJP <em>l </em>jOUUjO JL4:\u00bbOv7 about 4.4% for this third of net income.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Except as already stated, there were no express findings by the board with respect to the extent, if any, to which the salesmen, who effected the sales involved in items (b) and (c), were chiefly connected with or sent out from corporate premises of Breck outside Massachusetts. There were board findings that the territory served by Breck involved in items (b) and (c) was outside Massachusetts; that a \u201cpart of the sales was made by salesmen resident in Massachusetts and a part by salesmen resident outside of Massachusetts\u201d; and that the \u201cmerchandise involved in these appeals was shipped from stock in Massachusetts.\u201d There was, however, before the board an oral concession by counsel for Breck made at the hearing \u201cthat the only issue ... is with reference to [items] . . . (b) and (c) which are the sales billed from the Massachusetts office by salesmen who <em>if connected anywhere are connected with the Massachusetts office, </em>but they are interstate sales\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The commission contends that the Appellate Tax Board erred in its conclusion that the gross receipts from items (b) and (c) \u201care not to be included in the computation of the excise\u201d and \u201cin having considered the assessment . . \u2022. as a direct tax on gross receipts rather than an excise measured by applying the statutory formula ... to a portion of the net income of\u201d Breck. The commission concedes that the sales included in items (b) and (c) \u201care sales in interstate commerce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">We thus have presented these questions: (1) Does the statutory net income allocation formula (\u00a7\u00a7 37, 38) require treating the sales included in items (b) and (c) as sales attributable to Break\u2019s corporate existence and activity in Massachusetts by including them in the numerator of the statutory fraction; and (2) if the statutory formula requires such inclusion of these sales in the Massachusetts numerator, is this inclusion in violation of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution (art. 1, \u00a7 8)?</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">1. The tax involved is \u201ca single excise measured by the sum of a percentage on its corporate excess added to a per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>centage on its net income as those terms are defined in the act.\u201d Originally (and until 1933) it was imposed upon \u201cthe carrying on or doing of business.\u201d <em>Springdale Finishing Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>242 Mass. 37, 40-41. See <em>Fore River Shipbuilding Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>248 Mass. 137, 140-141; <em>Frothingham Buildings </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>249 Mass. 290, 292-293; <em>Carlos Ruggles Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>261 Mass. 450, 452-453; <em>Queens Run Refractories Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>270 Mass. 19, 23-24; <em>Thomson Electric Welding Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>275 Mass. 426, 429, et seq. See also <em>George S. Colton Elastic Web Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>116 Fed. (2d) 202, 204-205 (C. C. A. 1). However, by St. 1933, c. 342, \u00a7 1, the words theretofore in \u00a7 32 (imposing the excise on domestic corporations) \u201cwith respect to the carrying on or doing of business\u201d were deleted with the purpose<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of changing the tax to an excise on the privilege of each domestic business corporation to engage in business based upon its corporate existence (and possession of its corporate franchise) during the taxable year, without regard to whether any business was done. In the <em>Carlos Ruggles Lumber Co. </em>case, at pages 452-453, it was said that the excise was. \u201cnot a tax on tangible property . . . not an income tax.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The excise imposed by \u00a7 32 is not a tax upon or measured by <em>gross </em>receipts. So far as its net income measure is concerned, the tax under \u00a7 32 will be zero (a) unless a domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>corporation subject to \u00a7 32 has a <em>net </em>income, in the sense that its gross income exceeds the expenses (with minor exceptions) allowed as deductions under the Federal income tax law, and (b) unless some of that net income, if there is a net income, is allocable to Massachusetts under the apportionment formula found in \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 38.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The purpose of the formula (\u00a7\u00a737 and 38) is, of course, to limit the net income measure of the excise to that reasonably attributable to activities within or closely associated with Massachusetts, so as fairly to reflect the annual benefit to the taxed corporation of its corporate privileges (including their exercise, if exercised) under Massachusetts law. In giving equal weight to percentage factors of (a) tangible property, (b) wages and other compensation paid, and (c) gross receipts, the Massachusetts formula is similar to formm lac in use in various other States.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">With respect to the one-third weight given to gross receipts, gross receipts from sales are not to be allocated outside of Massachusetts (as by statutes of certain other States) except where the sales are clearly indentifiable with corporate sales offices in other States through having been \u201cnegotiated ... by [\u00a1corporate)] agents . . . connected with or sent out from premises . . . owned or rented by the corporation outside the commonwealth.\u201d The statutory language of \u00a7 38, par. 6, is explicit and must be applied in accordance with its natural meaning (see <em>Carlos Ruggles Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>261 Mass. 450, 455) to the extent that constitutional considerations permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Few court decisions have discussed the allocation formula since its enactment thirty-eight years ago. In <em>Carlos </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number><em>Ruggles Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>261 Mass. 450, 454 \u2014 456, this court passed upon a 1924 excise on a domestic corporation doing some intrastate business in Massachusetts and apparently a volume of business, largely in interstate commerce,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in other States. This court (at page 455) said, \u201cIt is not essential to interstate commerce that persons engaged in it have established places of business in the several States or in more than a single State\u201d and held that the petitioner \u201cwas subject to ... [a Massachusetts] excise tax but was entitled to have that tax allocated on the basis of carrying on business both inside and outside of this Commonwealth,\u201d obviously because it conducted interstate commerce outside Massachusetts. No consideration was given to the details of the allocating method prescribed in \u00a7 38. In <em>Alpha Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>244 Mass. 530, 555,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> it was said that, in considering the effect of the tripartite formula based upon property, wages, and gross receipts, the question \u201cis not whether a subsidiary percentage standing <em>alone </em>may impinge upon property outside the Commonwealth, but whether the use of <em>all </em>the percentages <em>makes </em>the final result a tax which violates constitutional guarantees\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Breck relies principally upon <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>308 Mass. 558, where this court considered the minimum excise on each of a class <em>of foreign </em>business corporations, imposed by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 39C,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> amounting to \u201cone twentieth of one per cent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>of . . . gross receipts from business assignable to this commonwealth as defined in\u201d \u00a7 38, par. 6. Such <em>gross </em>receipts assignable to Massachusetts are thus used in the <em>Ford </em>case directly as the measure of the excise imposed by \u00a7 39C rather than as a means of allocation of <em>net </em>income as in the case of the excises imposed by \u00a7 32 and \u00a7 39.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To have construed \u00a7 38, par. 6, as including (for the purpose of \u00a7 39C), as receipts assignable to Massachusetts, gross receipts from interstate sales negotiated through a Massachusetts office would have involved measuring <em>directly </em>by gross receipts from interstate commerce an excise on a foreign corporation, for the privilege of doing intrastate business in Massachusetts. This court, in the <em>Ford </em>case, held (at page 568) that \u201ca State may not put a direct and immediate burden upon interstate commerce in the form of a tax, without apportionment, upon the <em>gross </em>proceeds derived from such commerce\u201d and (at page 569) \u201cmay not exact an excise not apportioned to intrastate activities but measured by a percentage of the entire <em>gross </em>receipts derived from commercial activities extending beyond the boundaries of the taxing State\u201d (emphasis supplied). The decision thus held that \u00a7 38, par. 6, could not be applied, to the full extent warranted by its language, to bring any interstate business within the Ford company\u2019s gross receipts assignable to Massachusetts <em>for the purposes of the minimum excise im</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>posed by </em>\u00a7 <em>89C, </em>because cases decided by the Supreme Court of the United States (see pages 568-569) determined that a tax like that in \u00a7 39C, <em>directly </em>measured by <em>gross </em>receipts* would impose an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. This court in the <em>Ford </em>ease did not pass upon the validity of assigning to Massachusetts, in accordance with the plain language of \u00a7 38, par. 6, gross receipts from sales negotiated through a Massachusetts office for the wholly different purpose of allocating a fair proportion of <em>net </em>income to Massachusetts as a measure of an excise under \u00a7 32 upon a domestic <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In this state of the authorities, we construe \u00a7 38, par. 6 (as applied, for purposes of the excise imposed by \u00a7 32, to the allocation to Massachusetts of a share of the <em>net </em>income of a <em>domestic </em>corporation), <em>first, </em>to require including in \u201cgross receipts . . . assignable to\u201d Massachusetts under paragraph 6 the gross receipts from all sales which are not attributable to efforts closely associated with a corporate sales office outside of Massachusetts, and, <em>second, </em>to attribute receipts from sales, in either interstate or intrastate commerce, to the sales offices with which the salesmen effecting them are affiliated. Of course, if \u00a7 38, par. 6, thus construed, will operate to impose an unconstitutional burden in a particular case, it can be given only the maximum scope which will still leave its application within constitutional limits, but we think that the legislative intention was to apply the section <em>literally </em>to the full extent permitted by constitutional principles. See <em>W. &amp; J. Sloane </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>253 Mass. 529, 534; <em>Dexter </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>316 Mass. 31, 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Upon this construction of the allocation formula, the question of fact under the statute to be determined by the Appellate Tax Board was whether the gross receipts from sales (in amount [b] $155,289.87 and [c] $3,101,533.66), which Breck contends were wrongly assigned under \u00a7 38, par. 6, to Massachusetts, were negotiated by agents \u201cchiefly situated at, connected with or sent out from [corporate] premises . . . outside\u201d Massachusetts. The board has not made express findings on this matter. However, in the absence of anything contrary to the concession of counsel on this matter, it is apparent that the board acted upon the basis that the sales involved in items (b) and (c) were made by salesmen who (in the language of the concession of counsel) \u201cif connected anywhere are connected with the Massachusetts office.\u201d No other conclusion would be warranted by the evidence, which showed, among other things, that, with respect to the disputed sales, reports which were necessary were made by the salesmen to the Massachusetts office, which in turn gave them necessary instructions. Accordingly, we deal with the case as one in which Breck has not sustained the burden resting upon it of showing that the disputed sales in items (b) and (c) were negotiated by salesmen chiefly connected with a sales office outside Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">2. We must also pass upon the constitutional issues raised by Breck in view of the fact that the Appellate Tax Board has ruled that no gross receipts from interstate sales carried out by shipments originating in Massachusetts may be allocated to Massachusetts for the purposes of the formula for the apportionment of net income contained in \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 38. If this ruling is correct, the decision of the board must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Under the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, real doubt<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> continues to exist about the limits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>proper State taxation of corporations engaged in both intrastate and interstate commerce. See <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Hewit, </em>329 U. S. 249, 252. Compare <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>332 Mass. 785, 789. However, certain principles have been established which are binding upon us.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">(A) A State may not impose an excise (even one which does not discriminate against interstate commerce), at least upon a foreign corporation,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> for the privilege of doing <em>exclusively </em>an interstate business within its borders. <em>Cheney Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>246 U. S. 147, 153. <em>Alpha Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>268 U. S. 203. <em>Spector Motor Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>340 U. S. 602, 609.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See also <em>Crew Levick Co. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>245 U. S. 292; <em>Ozark Pipe Line Corp. </em>v. <em>Monier, </em>266 U. S. 555. This principle does not apply to the present case because Breck (1) is a Massachusetts corporation maintaining its corporate existence here; (2) does all its manufacturing in Massachusetts as an intrastate activity; and (3) carries on substantial intrastate sales in Massachusetts, as well as many important functions of a local character in administering all its sales operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">(B) A State occupation tax measured <em>directly </em>by the <em>gross </em>receipts from interstate commerce, unapportioned, is invalid, at least where the privilege of engaging in the occupation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>including interstate commerce, is the subject of the tax. <em>Fisher\u2019s Blend Station, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission, </em>297 U. S. 650. <em>Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission, </em>302 U. S. 90, 92-94 (but compare pages 94-95).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. </em>v. <em>Calvert, </em>347 U. S. 157, 166 (tax at a fixed rate per unit of gas on the occupation of \u201cgathering gas\u201d for the purpose of immediate interstate shipment held invalid). See <em>Memphis Steam Laundry Cleaner, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>342 U. S. 389, 392-393. See also <em>Nippert </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>327 U. S. 416. Compare <em>Memphis Natural Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>335 U. S. 80, 89. Compare also <em>American Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>St. Louis, </em>250 U. S. 459, 463 (sustaining a license tax on manufacturing in St. Louis measured by value of manufactured goods sold, payable after value established by sale).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">(C) A State may not tax directly sales or the gross receipts from sales in interstate commerce, at least without apportionment, or unless the taxable event is one which is adequately separated from the actual movement in interstate commerce. <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Hewit, </em>329 U. S. 249<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (where the court held that an Indiana tax on gross income could not be imposed upon the gross proceeds of the sale of securities in New York). Compare <em>International Harvester Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Treasury, </em>322 U. S. 340, 348 (Indiana gross income tax upheld with respect to proceeds of certain sales having important incidents in Indiana). In the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>case the excise is not imposed with respect to any activity which is part of the stream of interstate commerce, but rather is laid on the existence of the corporate privileges. Also, as has already been said, the Massachusetts excise on Breck is measured by <em>net </em>income, <em>not </em>gross income. Accordingly the principles mentioned in this paragraph (C) and in paragraph (B) above are not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">(D) A State tax which discriminates against interstate commerce is invalid. <em>Memphis Steam Laundry Cleaner, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>342 U. S. 389, 394-395. <em>West Point Wholesale Grocery Co. </em>v. <em>Opelika, </em>354 U. S. 390. Compare, however, <em>Interstate Busses Corp. </em>v. <em>Blodgett, </em>276 U. S. 245, 251 (holding that a taxpayer complaining of discrimination against it and against interstate commerce must show \u201cthat in actual practice the tax of which it complains\u201d in fact is discriminatory in economic effect). In the present case there is no indication whatsoever of discrimination against interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The commission relies upon those decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States in which it has been stated consistently, in substance, that a State tax (a) upon corporate <em>net </em>income or (b) upon a privilege granted by the taxing State, measured by corporate <em>net </em>income, reasonably apportioned to activities of the taxpayer within the taxing State, will not impose a direct or constitutionally objectionable burden upon interstate commerce even if income from interstate commerce is taken into account. In <em>United States Glue Co. </em>v. <em>Oak Creek, </em>247 U. S. 321, the court considered a Wisconsin general income tax upon a Wisconsin corporation\u2019s net income including that derived from business transacted within Wisconsin, determined by an allocation formula (page 324). Within income assigned to Wisconsin were included (page 325) the taxpayer\u2019s receipts from goods sold to customers outside Wisconsin from its Wisconsin factory and from goods manufactured in Wisconsin shipped to sales branches outside Wisconsin and there sold, all presumably interstate commerce. The court said (at page 329) that the tax \u201ccan not be deemed to be so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>direct a burden upon plaintiff\u2019s . . . business as to amount to an unconstitutional interference with . . . commerce among the States. It was measured not by the gross receipts, but by the net proceeds from this part of plaintiff\u2019s business, along with a like imposition upon its income derived from other sources, and in the same way that other corporations doing business within the State are taxed upon that proportion of their income derived from business transacted and property located within the State, whatever the nature of their business.\u201d In distinguishing the <em>Crew Levick </em>case (245 U. S. 292) the court said (at pages 328-329), \u201cThe difference in effect between a tax measured by gross receipts and one measured by net income, recognized by our decisions, is . . . substantial, and it affords a . . . workable basis of distinction between a direct and immediate burden upon the business affected and a charge that is only indirect and incidental. A tax upon gross receipts affects each transaction in proportion to its magnitude and irrespective of whether it is profitable or otherwise. ...

Interstate sales (see pages 292, 294) through salesmen working out of an Illinois sales office were included in Illinois business for the purpose of the allocation formula.

Under the taxing statute a part of total net income was to be apportioned to New York in accordance with stated criteria, including (among others) tangible property and accounts receivable. The tax was sustained largely upon the authority of the <em>Underwood Typewriter </em>case. The court (at page 282) pointed out that the taxpayer \u201ccarried on the unitary business of manufacturing and selling . . : in which its profits were earned by a series of transactions beginning with the manufacture in England and ending in sales in New York and other places \u2014 the process of manufacturing resulting in no profits until it ends in sales\u201d and indicated that New York was justified in attributing (through the operation of the allocation formula) to itself \u201ca just proportion of the profits . . . from such unitary business.\u201d See <em>John Deere Plow Co. of Moline </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board, </em>38 Cal.

The tax was measured by the value of the tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>payer\u2019s capital stock. One half was apportioned on the basis of a fraction (at pages 419-420) \u201cthe numerator of which is the value of all the taxpayer\u2019s Ohio property, and the denominator of which is the total value of all its property .... The other half is multiplied by another fraction whose numerator is the total value of the 'business done\u2019 in the State and whose denominator is country-wide business. ...

A part of the measure of the tax is consequently an amount equal to the sales price of Ohio-manufactured goods sold and delivered to customers in other states.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The court (at pages 420-423) upheld the excise, under both the commerce clause (art. 1, \u00a7 8) and the due process clause (Fourteenth Amendment) of the Federal Constitution, as a tax on intrastate activities legitimately measured by the value of the goods produced by the Ohio factories, saying (at page 421), \u201cNor does the fact that a computation such as that under Ohio\u2019s law includes receipts from interstate sales affect the validity of a fair apportionment [citing, among others, the <em>Hump Hairpin </em>and <em>Underwood Typewriter </em>cases].\u201d The court went on to say (pages 421-422) that \u201cit clearly appears . . . that the whole purpose of the . . . formula was to arrive, without undue complication, at a fair conclusion as to what was the value of the intrastate business for which its franchise was granted. . . . Plainly Ohio sought to tax only what she was entitled to tax, and there is nothing about application of the formula in this case that indicates a potentially unfair result under any circumstances. . . . [T]his Court has long realized the practical impossibility of a state\u2019s achieving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>a perfect apportionment of expansive, complex business activities . . . and has declared that \u2018rough approximation rather than precision\u2019 is sufficient.\u201d In the <em>Spector </em>case (340 U.

See note 20, <em>supra), </em>although holding that a Connecticut excise could not be imposed on a foreign corporation with respect to the privilege of doing an exclusively interstate business in Connecticut, the court said, \u201cOur conclusion is not in conflict with the principle that, where a taxpayer is engaged both in intrastate and interstate commerce, a state may tax the privilege of carrying on intrastate business and, within reasonable limits, may compute the amount of the charge by applying the tax rate to a fair proportion of the taxpayer\u2019s business done within the state, including both interstate and intrastate [\u00a1citing the <em>International Harvester </em>case, 329 U.

S. 746, the courts approved a Pennsylvania excise based upon a net income allocation formula bearing close resemblance to that contained in \u00a7 38, pars. 2, 6, under which gross receipts from sales were not to be allocated to another State, absent the existence and use (in negotiating the sales) of a formal out-of-State corporate office. The sales in issue in the <em>Bayuk </em>case (see 345 Pa. at pages 356-357) were made by salesmen \u201csupervised, directed and controlled by the home office in Philadelphia, from which . . . they received their instructions . . . [\u00a1T]heir orders were . . . shipped from . . . Pennsylvania . . . [\u00a1T]he itinerant nature of their employment required them to be \u2018constantly traveling . . .\u2019 and . . . they must be regarded as \u2018not chiefly situated at, connected with, or sent out from, premises . . . owned or rented by the corporation outside the Commonwealth\u2019.\u201d Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Continental Rubber Works, </em>347 Pa. 514. The <em>Bayuk </em>case (which wholly supports the excise upon Breck in the present case) establishes that, in a formula designed to allocate net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>income approximately, it is reasonable for a Legislature to assign gross receipts from sales to the formal corporate office having supervision over the salesmen who effect the sales.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">These decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, as we understand them, sustain the constitutionality under the commerce clause of a State excise (like that in the present case) on a domestic corporation for possessing or exercising its corporate privileges, if measured by net income, apportioned, as in the present case, in a practical way (which need not by any means be precise) to give a reasonable and rough approximation of values attributable to the taxing State granting the privileges. The fact that net income from interstate transactions (and the value given to intrastate privileges by them) may be taken into account reasonably in the tax computations is immaterial. Accordingly, we hold that the Appellate Tax Board erred (a) in treating the tax complained of as in effect a tax measured by gross receipts from interstate commerce rather than as an excise using, as one of its measures, aHpart of the taxpayer\u2019s net income apportioned to Massachusetts on a basis which takes into account fairly the sales here in dispute, admittedly interstate transactions, and (b) in holding that gross receipts from interstate sales (not assignable to non-Massachusetts sales offices under \u00a7 38, par. 6) should not be taken into the Massachusetts numerator of the allocation fraction under \u00a7 38, par. 2 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Breck argues that the aggregate effect of the excise as assessed by the commission is so unreasonable, as applied to it, as to come within the principle of <em>Hans Rees\u2019 Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>283 U. S. 123, 134, which held that in a particular instance North Carolina had applied a formula method, \u201cwhich, albeit fair on its face, operates so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>reach profits . . . in no just sense attributable to transactions within\u201d. North Carolina\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> No such showing of fact has been made here by Breck. Indeed, if the gross receipts from the disputed sales were to be excluded from the formula computation, it would result only in a reduction of the portion of Breck\u2019s 1952 <em>net </em>income assigned to Massachusetts from 71% to 57% (see note 8, <em>supra). </em>There are no findings of fact by the Appellate Tax Board and no evidence on which could be based a ruling that an allocation to Massachusetts of 71% of net income (as required by the total effect of the statutory formula which must be viewed as a whole) necessarily resulted in overvaluation, by fourteen percentage points, of the aggregate intrastate privileges (including basic corporate existence and authority to do business, manufacture, home office supervision, maintenance of local sales office, supervision of salesmen, warehousing, shipping, and so forth) subject to tax. The burden is clearly on Breck to establish facts which show the impropriety of the statutory formula. See <em>Butler Brothers </em>v. <em>McColgan, </em>315 U. S. 501, 506-508.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Breck contends also that the assignment of the disputed sales to Massachusetts for the purposes of \u00a7 38, par. 6, will involve risk of double taxation of those sales, because under pertinent Supreme Court decisions (see, for example, <em>McGoldrick </em>v. <em>Berwind-White Coal Mining Co. </em>309 U. S. 33; <em>General Trading Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission, </em>322 U. S. 335) the States of destination of the goods sold might be able to impose taxes upon their sale or use. The tax imposed by \u00a7 32 is not a sales tax or a use tax based upon gross receipts but an excise on corporate privileges based on a net income measure designed to reflect solely Massachusetts values. No other State can impose a tax on those privileges or values. See <em>Western Live Stock </em>v. <em>Bureau of Revenue, </em>303 U. S. 250, 260. See also <em>Memphis Natural Gas Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number><em>Stone, </em>335 U. S. 80, 93-94, 96-97. Any minor overlapping of measures of net income, if any other State should impose a similar excise on comparable privileges of Breck to do business in that State, using a somewhat different (but similarly reasonable) net income apportionment formula, would be at most an inconsequential result of the \u201chonest state efforts to make apportionments\u201d of Massachusetts and such other State, intended to reach a fair approximation of the value of the respective privileges subjected to tax. Any inaccuracy would be well within the limits of action permitted to the States. <em>International Harvester Co. </em>v. <em>Evatt, </em>329 U. S. 416, 422-423. Here there is no evidence of any potential duplication of tax burden which could raise doubt about the propriety of the excise.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">3. Breck is not entitled to have any abatement of that part of its 1953 corporate excise measured by net income. The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is reversed and a decision for the State tax commission is to be entered. The State tax commission is to have costs of the appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-9\"> Only questions with respect to the effect of the excise here involved upon interstate commerce have been seriously argued. The Appellate Tax Board did not deal with any question of due process. The cases which seem controlling on the interstate commerce issue seem also to control any question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>which might be raised on the issue of due process.

L. c. 14, \u00a7\u00a7 37-40; St. 1909, c. 490, Part III, \u00a7 43; <em>Eaton, Crane &amp; Pike Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>237 Mass. 523, 526-529.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Since the 1933 revision, the excise, imposed by \u00a7 32 with respect to a domestic corporation, has been discussed in <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation v. Bristol County Kennel Club, Inc. </em>301 Mass. 27, 29, in which there was no occasion to consider with precision the nature of the excise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\"> See, as to the interpretation of the generally similar excise still imposed by \u00a7 39 \u201cwith respect to the carrying on or doing of business . . . within the commonwealth\u201d by foreign corporations, <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>308 Mass. 558, 563-564, and cases cited.

For example, assuming all net income of each of two corporations to be assignable to Massachusetts, corporation A with a gross income of $1,000,000 and a net income (after deductions) of only $10,000 would pay at the basic 2%% rate an excise of $250; while corporation B with a gross income of $500,000 and a net income of $20,000 would pay an excise of $500.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b325-9\"> See Altman &amp; Keesling, Allocation of Income in State Taxation (2d ed.) 89, 97-159, and table at pages 158-159; Silverstein, Problems of Apportionment in Taxation of Multistate Business, 4 Tax L.

L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 32A, as amended, and on certain foreign corporations by \u00a7 39C as amended. It is assessed only in the event that such minimum excise on a particular corporation exceeds its usual excise computed under whichever section (\u00a7 32 in the case of domestic corporations and \u00a7 39 in the ease of foreign corporations) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>applicable. Section 390 (prior to its amendment by St. 1956, c. 550, \u00a7 10) read: \u201cEvery foreign corporation deriving its profits principally from the ownership, sale, rental or use of real estate or tangible personal property shall pay annually, with respect to the carrying on or doing of business by it, a total excise under this chapter not less in amount than one twentieth of one per cent of said corporation\u2019s gross receipts from business assignable to this commonwealth as defined in clause six of section thirty-eight.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b327-6\"> Section 39C was not a part of the revised excise tax law adopted by St. 1919, o. 355. It was first enacted by St. 1923, c. 424, \u00a7 4, together with a similar minimum excise (see \u00a7 2 of the 1923 act) on certain domestic corporations found in \u00a7 32A (see <em>Essex Theatres Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>265 Mass. 210; <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>J. G. McCrory Co. </em>280 Mass. 273, 279) to provide an effective minimum excise on corporations doing business in Massachusetts which otherwise would pay little or no excise. 1923 House Doc. No. 1240, pages 29, 58. See 1923 Senate Doc. No. 323, pages 3, 5. In making use of \u00a7 38, par. 6, as a definition of gross receipts for the purposes of \u00a7 390, imposing an excise measured <em>directly </em>by gross receipts, \u00a7 39C used paragraph 6 for a purpose wholly different from that for which it had originally been intended. For this new purpose paragraph 6 could not be employed, so far as concerns gross receipts from interstate commerce, for reasons stated later in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\"> In the case of a foreign corporation doing intrastate business in Massachusetts and also business elsewhere, the commissioner is authorized by \u00a7 42, as amended by St. 1933, c. 342, \u00a7 5 (see further amendments by St. 1953, c. 654, \u00a7 59, and St. 1956, c. 550, \u00a7 11), to apply an appropriate alternate method of allocating net income (for the purposes of the tax under \u00a7 39) where the normal formula \u201cis not reasonably adapted to approximate\u201d the income derived from doing business in Massachusetts. No such alternative exists with respect to the excise on a domestic corporation, beyond the provisions of \u00a7 38, par. 3, not here applicable. Section 42 thus provides, in the case of foreign corporations, a method of avoiding any possible unconstitutional burdens, in particular cases, which might result from giving full scope to the language of \u00a7 38, par. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\"> Discussions of the perplexing problems raised by the decisions will be found in the following authorities: Powell, More Ado about Gross Receipts Taxes, 60 Harv.
