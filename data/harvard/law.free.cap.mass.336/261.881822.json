The case is here after a verdict for the plaintiff on the defendant\u2019s exceptions to rulings on evidence and to the denial of its motion for a directed verdict in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">There is little dispute as to the facts. The plaintiff was a welder in the employ of Roy Construction Company, hereinafter referred to as Roy. On the day of his injury Roy was engaged under a contract with the defendant in making substantial alterations in the latter\u2019s yard at Southbridge Street. The defendant was a self insurer under the workmen\u2019s compensation act. The contract called for Roy to furnish all labor, materials, equipment, transportation and insurance, required for the removal of track and ties, the demolition of coal chutes, hopper, pressure tank and house, engine house, other houses, garage, cars, the relocation of diesel fuel lines, the relocation of steam line outlet, a \u201csurvey location,\u201d a \u201cclean up job\u201d and the grading off the area at a total price of $30,150. The price for \u201crelocation diesel fuel lines\u201d was $1,100. The contract was dated March 11, 1953, and by April 6 the required work apparently had largely been completed by the contractor. There remained the relocation of the diesel fuel lines which were used to pump oil from tank cars to diesel engines. The pipes had been laid under ground and ran through a pump house in which the apparatus for pumping was located. The contemplated relocation required that the pipes be taken up, the pump house moved, the pipes relaid in a different location, and the necessary connections made.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">One Tetreault was general superintendent of the work for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the defendant. Roy employed on the job a supervisor and a labor foreman, through whom Tetreault gave orders as to the work to be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">There was evidence from the plaintiff that he had been employed as a welder by Roy for about two months. Previously thereto he had worked as a welder for twenty-two or twenty-three years, principally on steam fitting, but had never welded pipes which had contained fuel oil. He knew that Roy had a contract with the defendant and during its performance had been to the yard once or twice to weld temporary fuel lines. On Saturday, April 4, Roy\u2019s manager told him to get his equipment together and to go over to the yard early Monday morning and report to Tetreault who would tell him what he wanted done. On Monday the plaintiff, taking with him the welding generator, bottles of acetylene and oxygen and \u201call the equipment he needed,\u201d reported to Tetreault. Zingarelli, Roy\u2019s labor foreman, with the men in his gang, had taken up the old fuel line, cut the pipe into lengths and laid them on the ground beside the new trench which had been opened. Zingarelli knew that the pipes had contained oil because of the drippings which came from the sections of pipe as they were taken out. There was testimony by the plaintiff that Tetreault \u201ctold me what he wanted to do with the pipes and how he wanted them to run, and I asked him about if those pipes were all right to work on. Those were the pipes? And he said, \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d The plaintiff welded three or four lengths of pipe and they were lowered into the trench. He then waited to complete the welding until Roy\u2019s employees had moved the pump house with a crane. The pipe from the pump house was to be connected with the pipe in the ground by use of two elbows or \u201ctube turn[s]\u201d and a riser. There were two flanges in the short length of pipe between the pump and the upper elbow. Tetreault gave the plaintiff a piece of steel from which to cut a \u201cblank,\u201d which was a thin piece of metal to be inserted loosely between the flanges to keep \u201cslag or sludge\u201d from getting into the pump, and told him \u201cevery step to make.\u201d A pipe fitter having bolted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u201cblank\u201d in place, the plaintiff said to Tetreault, \u201cIs everything all right now, Leo?\u201d and Leo (Tetreault) replied, \u201cI believe everything is all right. Go right ahead with it now.\u201d The plaintiff put on his goggles, gloves and welding equipment and started to weld the joint from \u201cthe eccentric reducer onto the pipe which was open. The riser that comes up to that eccentric reducer goes down into that tube turn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">He squatted in the trench and used an oxy-acetylene torch and a steel filler rod with which to \u201cfill in that joint, [and] to fuse it together.\u201d He had worked ten or fifteen minutes and had about \u201ctwo inches more of weld to make\u201d when there was a roar, and a flash came from the quarter inch of. space \u201cbetween the two joints.\u201d It was \u201ca roaring flame like a blow torch\u201d and he was severely burned.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">An expert called by the plaintiff testified that the cause of the flash explosion could have been residual oil on the inside of the pipe; and that one would get some pure hydrogen when diesel fuel is heated to a high temperature and that would have a high explosive potential. Subject to the defendant\u2019s exception he was allowed to read the following passage from a manual of the American Welding Society entitled \"Safe Practices for Welding and Cutting Containers that Have Held Combustibles.\u201d \u201cWelding or cutting of containers that have held combustibles should be attempted only by experienced welders or cutters and under the direct supervision of persons familiar with the characteristics of the previous contents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">He testified that there were three possible explanations why there was an explosion when one joint was welded and not when another joint was welded. One was that the welder might have worked longer on the last joint than on previous joints and therefore heated more pipe and vaporized more oil. A second was that by reason of the blank there was no open end on one side and the gas might have been less diluted with air. He did not consider it good welding practice to have put the blank in the flange, A third possible explanation, but not a likely one, was that, on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>wide gap joint liquid steel could drop down into the vertical section of the pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u201c[T]here was some reduction in likelihood of a hazardous explosion in using an arc weld [rather] than in using an acetylene torch. The acetylene torch is a lower temperature source and requires a longer time to achieve a fusion joint, \u2018and in that greater length of time you heat up more pipe, which in this case is bad.\u2019 . . . He would not advocate any welding on a pipe where fuel oil had been used without some considerable precautionary steps. It might involve cleaning out in some method, and there are other precautions. Whether or not the plaintiff as an \u2018experienced welder\u2019 used the ordinary precautions would depend upon the welder\u2019s particular experience. If he had been experienced in the welding of oil pipe lines then he certainly did not take the necessary precautions, but if he hadn\u2019t done that kind of welding, he wouldn\u2019t necessarily know enough to recognize the danger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Regulations of the board of fire prevention regulations promulgated under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 148, \u00a7 10, as amended, relating to the licensing of buildings or structures to be used for the storage of inflammable fluids (\u00a7\u00a7 9 and 13, as amended) and regulations promulgated under \u00a7 38, as amended, relating to permits for the maintenance and use of tanks of more than 10,000 gallons capacity (\u00a7 37) were admitted in evidence, over the objection and exception of the defendant. It was conceded by the defendant that it had obtained no license or permit for the tank cars from which oil was pumped to the diesel engines. At the conclusion of the evidence the judge directed a verdict for the defendant on count 2 of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration wherein recovery was sought under the Federal employers\u2019 liability act and subject to the defendant\u2019s exception denied its motion for a directed verdict on count 1 for negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">In support of its motion the defendant urged, first, that the plaintiff could not maintain his action at common law -on the ground that by virtue of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 18, .he was restricted to recovery under the workmen\u2019s com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>pensation act and, second, that there was. no evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence. The judge was. not in a position to rule upon the effect of the'compensation act without preliminary findings of fact. He therefore properly submitted to the jury <em>(Cozzo </em>v. <em>Atlantic Refining Co. </em>299 Mass. .260; <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>318 Mass. 373) the question, \u201cDid the injuries of the plaintiff . . . arise out of and in the course of employment which was a part of or process in the trade or business carried on by the defendant railroad and not merely ancillary or incidental to it?\u201d As the jury answered \u201cNo\u201d and returned a verdict for the plaintiff, the question for decision is whether there was-evidence from which they could find that the defendant was negligent. -</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The plaintiff was on the defendant\u2019s premises by invitation to assist in the work for which his employer had contracted and particularly to do the welding required in relocating the diesel fuel lines. : He assumed those risks incidental to the work which his employer Roy had sent him to perform which were obvious or apparent on proper examination. <em>Favereau </em>v. <em>Gabele, </em>262 Mass. 118, 119, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The railroad\u2019s duty was to \u201cwarn him of the dangers incident to his work which he did not know of. or appreciate, and could not reasonably have discovered . . . [but] which dangers . . . [it] knew or should have known.\u201d <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Sinclair Refining Co. </em>237 Mass. 230, 234. In general there is \u201cno duty to warn unless the person on whom the duty would be cast has some reason to suppose that a warming is needed.\u201d <em>Cadogan </em>v. <em>Boston Consolidated Gas Co. </em>290 Mass. 496, 499-500. <em>Hyland </em>v. <em>Seaver, </em>312 Mass. 535, 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The plaintiff contends that he did not know that the pipes he was to weld had contained fuel oil, that he-had no experience in welding pipes which had contained oil, and that Tetreault should have warned him of the condition of the pipes and the danger incidental to w\u00e9lding them. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence shows that the condition of the pipes was known to Roy\u2019s foreman and presumably to other employees who had r\u00e9moved them from their former location. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Previous to the accident the plaintiff had already welded together several of the pipe l\u00e9ngths which had been taken up. There is no evidence from which it could be inferred that Tetreault had reason to think that any warning to the plaintiff of their condition was required. See <em>Trott </em>v. <em>Yankee Network, Inc. </em>335 Mass. 9, 14. He could rightfully assume that the contractor Roy knew of the condition of the pipes which its employees had taken up <em>(Sarna </em>v. <em>American Bosch Magneto Corp. </em>290 Mass. 340, 343) and had provided an experienced welder competent to reconnect them. See <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Rockland Trust Co. </em>311 Mass. 663, 667. It did not appear that Tetreault had knowledge of any risk in welding superior to that of the plaintiff, of whom the expert testified that if he \u201chadn\u2019t done that kind of welding, he wouldn\u2019t necessarily know enough to recognize the danger.\u201d The evidence does not support the plaintiff\u2019s contention that Tetreault gave him an assurance of safety. See <em>Burwick </em>v. <em>McClure, </em>318 Mass. 626, 631; <em>Carriere </em>v. <em>Merrick Lumber Co. </em>203 Mass. 322, 327; <em>Archer </em>v. <em>Eldredge, </em>204 Mass. 323, 327. Tetreault told him only where and when the welding was to be done. He did not tell him how it should be done. His language was nothing more than that to be expected from a general superintendent to one charged with the performance of a specific expert job, namely, that it was all right for him to proceed with his work. The insertion of the blank was no part of the welding process. Whether its use was causally related to the explosion is a matter of conjecture. <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Cambridge Gas Light Co. </em>331 Mass. 56, 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">We do not pause to consider whether the plaintiff as the employee of an independent contractor must, in the situation disclosed by the evidence, be held to have assumed the risk of welding pipes which had contained oil, see <em>Boisvert </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>199 Mass. 594; <em>Archer </em>v. <em>Eldredge, </em>204 Mass. 323; <em>Pilling </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>251 Mass. 425, 426-427; <em>Favereau </em>v. <em>Gabele, </em>262 Mass. 118, 119; <em>Taunton </em>v. <em>Hoar, </em>288 Mass. 326, for we think there was no evidence of the defendant\u2019s violation of any duty owed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The regulations, to the admission of which the defendant excepted, may be disregarded. They were erroneously admitted in evidence. The tank cars were not buildings or structures within the purview of pertinent license requirements. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.)|c. 148, \u00a7\u00a1\u00a11, as amended; <em>Nowell </em>v. <em>Boston Academy of Notre Dame, </em>130 Mass. 209, 210; <em>Small </em>v. <em>Parkway Auto Supplies, Inc. </em>258 Mass. 30, 33; <em>Jenney </em>v. <em>Hynes, </em>285 Mass. 332, 335; <em>H. W. Robinson Carpet Co. </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>315 Mass. 350, 353; <em>Hemenway </em>v. <em>Bartevian, </em>321 Mass. 226, 229. Nor did it appear that they were tanks of more than 10,000 gallons capacity requiring permits. The only evidence of their capacity was a photograph which showed a label on one of the cars \u201c8,111 gallons.\u201d If the regulations were properly in evidence it is plain that their alleged violation had no causal connection with the plaintiff\u2019s accident and furnished no evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence. In view of our conclusion on this issue of negligence it is unnecessary to discuss the admissibility of the manual of the American Welding Society. The motion of the defendant for a directed verdict should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">, <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
