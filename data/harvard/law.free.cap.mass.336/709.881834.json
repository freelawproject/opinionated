(hereinafter called Roux), to recover damages for a severe skin infection alleged to have been caused to the plaintiff by the use of hair dye made by Roux, which the plaintiff purchased from Jacobson in April, 1949. The action was dismissed as against Roux after hearing on an answer in abatement. Jacobson\u2019s bill of exceptions presents only an exception to the trial judge\u2019s denial of Jacobson\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. There was a verdict for the plaintiff. The facts are stated in their aspect most favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">Jacobson conducted a drug store in Revere. \u201c[Tjncluded in the merchandise offered for sale . . . was a product known as Roux oil shampoo tint ... a preparation for use on human hair.\u201d The plaintiff went to Jacobson\u2019s store and asked \u201cfor a package of Roux 104.\u201d That number was out of stock, but the druggist had 105, which was \u201ca little bit darker\u201d shade. She bought Roux 105. She then went to the house of a Mrs. Kelly, who some years before had \u201cworked with a hairdresser, \u201d but was not herself a licensed hairdresser, to have the Roux dye applied. They \u201copened . . . the package . . . and read the directions.\u201d The plaintiff \u201cread the instructions both on the cover and in the booklet\u201d including the \u201cportion on.the cover of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Roux entitled \u2018 caution \u2019 just before she used the dye. . . . [S]he and Mrs. Kelly read the whole instruction book carefully . . . [and] there was nothing confusing about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The package in which the bottles of hair dye were enclosed and the label on the bottles contained identical warning notices reading, \u201ccaution This product contains ingredients which may cause skin irritation on certain individuals and a preliminary test according to accompanying directions should first be made. This product must not be used for dyeing the eyelashes or eyebrows; to do so may cause blindness.\u201d On page 2 of the accompanying small booklet (three and three quarters inches high by two and one half inches wide) of instructions appeared printed in small type: \u201cthe preliminary or patch test Medical science has established the fact that a susceptible person may be allergic to even the simplest product. Of the millions of persons using or contemplating the use of hair colorings, a limited few may be allergic or hypersensitive to them. The common method used by medical authorities in detecting those hypersensitive persons is by a preliminary or patch test. Therefore, before contacting or using this product, a test, in strict accordance with the following directions, should be made.\u201d Immediately thereafter appears, \u201cThe Patch Test In order to ascertain whether you are hypersensitive to this product, the following test should be made before every application.\u201d The procedure to be used in the patch test was then described in detail on pages 2, 3, and 4 of the pamphlet.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Mrs. Kelly applied the dye with a new toothbrush and, in the course of that night, the plaintiff\u2019s head began \u201cto burn.\u201d She consulted a doctor. The condition became worse and she was hospitalized with \u201csores through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>scalp, face and down .her body . . . her eyes were swollen badly.\u201d She was \u201cblown- up like a balloon, her eyes were slits, and her ears were big, she had sores all over her face and her neck and they were running.\u201d She was prevented from working \u201cthat summer\u201d and \u201cit took about a year for the redness to .clear up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">When Mrs. Kelly finished applying the dye there was a small portion left. This \u201cshe put ... on her back porch with the toothbrush; the next morning she noticed the toothbrush had practically been eaten away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The plaintiff \u201chad been using hair dye ... for some twenty odd years; she always used Roux . . . every three, four or six months.\u201d Prior to April, 1949, when she last used Roux 104, she \u201chad no trouble.\u201d She admitted that \u201cthere was no patch test performed just prior to this application in April Q949J . . . she did not do a patch test at the time before this . . . ; she had used Roux so many times she didn\u2019t need a patch test; she doesn\u2019t remember whether a patch test was done eight months previous to that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">There was medical\u2022 testimony of \u201ca causal relationship between the contact with the dye and the condition\u201d of the plaintiff. It was agreed that the plaintiff gave seasonable notice to Jacobson of the alleged breach of warranty. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 106, \u00a7 38; <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. </em>329 Mass. 440, 443-445.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">\u00bb1. .Count 3 of the declaration, which states the cause of action against Jacobson, sets up a claim based upon (a) breach of express and implied warranties by him that the product \u201cwas fit for a particular purpose and . . . was of.merchantable quality and ... fit to be used upon her hair,\u201d and (b) the plaintiff\u2019s reliance on these \u201cwarranties\u201d to her damage. There is no allegation or proof whatsoever of any negligence on the part of Jacobson.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>2. Under the circumstances in which the hair dye was sold by its trade name, there was no implied warranty of the product\u2019s \u201cfitness for any particular purpose.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 106, \u00a7 17 (4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Dekofski </em>v. <em>Leite, ante, </em>127, 129, and cases cited. Williston, Sales (Rev. ed.) \u00a7 236a. Harper and James, Law of Torts, \u00a7 28.20, at page 1582. Prosser, Torts (2d ed.) \u00a7 83. Here the plaintiff asked \u201cfor a package of Roux 104 which . . . she had always used and . . . [Jacobson] told her . . . that he had 105, which was the same ingredients, only that the shade was a little bit darker.\u201d There was no evidence that what he actually said was in any degree inaccurate, even if the plaintiff relied upon it. We think that this evidence was insufficient to warrant a finding either (a) that the plaintiff relied upon Jacobson to select the product for her or (b) that he expressly or impliedly warranted that it was fit for any particular purpose, in a manner beyond the scope of the implied warranty of merchantability next mentioned. Compare <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co. </em>319 Mass. 690, 692. A finding that this was not a sale by trade name could not properly have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">3. General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 106, \u00a7 17 (2), provides, \u201c(2) Where the goods are bought by description from a seller who deals in goods of that description, whether he be the . . . manufacturer or not, there is an implied warranty that they shall be of merchantable quality.\u201d Purchase by trade name does not exclude liability under this subsection. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. </em>329 Mass. 440, 442, and cases cited. Williston, Sales (Rev. ed.) \u00a7 236a. See \u00a7 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The Roux hair dye here involved was \u201cmerchantable,\u201d in the sense in which the term is used in \u00a7 17 (2), if it was \u201creasonably suitable for the ordinary uses for which goods of that description are sold,\u201d here obviously for a hair dye <em>(McCabe </em>v. <em>Liggett Drug Co. Inc. </em>330 Mass. 177, 179), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>if the goods were reasonably standard and uniform for their brand and equivalent to other articles sold under the same name and description. See <em>F. W. Stock &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>226 Mass. 499, 503. See also <em>Inter-State Grocer Co. </em>v. <em>George William Bentley Co. </em>214 Mass. 227, 231; <em>Agoos Kid Co.

Rev. 117, 141-143; Harper and James, Law of Torts, \u00a7 28.20; Note, 23 Tenn. L. Rev. 385, 400.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The evidence that the dye was not of standard or merchantable quality is meager. It is not necessary, however, to determine whether it is sufficient to warrant a finding that the dye was not of standard quality or unsuitable for its intended use by one who had a normal skin, or whether it could be inferred that the plaintiff had such a skin. See <em>Payne </em>v. <em>R. H. White Co. </em>314 Mass. 63, 65-66; <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co. </em>319 Mass. 690, 693; Note, 25 Fordham L. Rev. 306, 310-313. Compare <em>Longo </em>v. <em>Touraine Stores, Inc. </em>319 Mass. 727. The present case depends upon the weight to be given to the instructions and warning to take a \u201cpatch test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Jacobson argues that, because of the instructions, his implied warranty of merchantability means only that the dye \u201cwas reasonably fit to dye hair . . . when used in conformity with the accompanying instructions\u201d and that compliance with the instructions by the buyer was an integral part of the warranty. He relies on <em>Holt </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>294 Mass. 21, 24 (warranty as to food held to be \u201c.that it was fit to eat after ordinary domestic cooking\u201d); <em>McCabe </em>v. <em>Liggett Drug Co. Inc. </em>330 Mass. 177, 180 (whether a coffee machine was merchantable depended on its capability, when properly used in accordance with instructions); and <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. </em>329 Mass. 440, 441. See <em>Bianchi </em>v. <em>Denholm &amp; McKay Co. </em>302 Mass. 469, 473\u2014474 (where weight is given to the absence there of \u201cevidence that the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>the face powder . . . was not precisely in the manner for which it was intended\u201d). See also <em>Horton </em>v. <em>North Attleborough, </em>302 Mass. 137, 142; <em>Ringstad </em>v. <em>I. Magnin &amp; Co. </em>39 Wash. (2d) 923, 933. Compare <em>Middleby-Marshall Oven Co. </em>v. <em>Wagoner, </em>106 Ind. App. 278, 283; <em>Fredendall </em>v. <em>Abraham &amp; Straus, Inc. </em>279 N. Y. 146, 147-148; <em>Landers v. Safeway Stores, Inc. </em>172 Ore. 116, 122-139.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">If Jacobson, the retail vendor, did not adopt the directions and warnings given by Roux, the manufacturer, the directions and warnings have no tendency to limit or disclaim the implied warranty which Jacobson is held by law to have given. As a practical matter, when a retail druggist sells (without express warranties or representations of his own) one of the many thousand manufactured products in his stock in trade, which has been asked for by trade name, it is a necessary inference that he adopts as his own any cautionary statements, disclaimers and limitations of warranties made (on the package and in accompanying circulars) by the manufacturer who best knows the infirmities of his product.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In <em>Sokoloski </em>v. <em>Splann, </em>311 Mass. 203, 208, to be sure, it was held, on the particular facts of that case, that a finding was not required that a wholesaler\u2019s statement on a seed package, denying the existence of warranties, had been adopted by a retail vendor of the seed. The <em>Sokoloski </em>case was one in which \u201cfield corn\u201d was bought, not under a trade name but by that more general description, and this court stated (at page 207) that it could have been found on the evidence \u201cthat the corn delivered . . . was not \u2018field com\u2019 of merchantable quality under that name,\u201d which, if it met that description, could be used as seed corn. The disclaimer by the wholesaler was a tag tied to the corn \u201cField Corn . . . [X Company] Give no warranty, express or implied, as to description, quality, productiveness or any other matter of any seeds . . . and . . . will not be . . . responsible for the crop.\u201d There was also evidence that the clerk selling the corn described it to the purchaser as \u201c Good field corn\u201d (page 205). We think that the present case is distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>. Here the plaintiff admits that she read and understood the instructions and did not comply with them. She is bound by this testimony. <em>Hannon </em>v. <em>Hayes-Bickford Lunch System, Inc., ante, </em>268, 273. Doubtless, she knew about the warnings and instructions when she bought the hair dye, in view of her long prior use of the product, and their existence was a circumstance which should have been within her contemplation when the sale was made. See Williston, Sales (Rev. ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 239-239c, especially at pages 628-631; Prosser, The Implied Warranty of Merchantable Quality, 27 Minn. L. Rev. 117, 136, 157-167; Harper and James, Law of Torts, \u00a7 28.25, at page 1589. We thus need not consider what would be the governing rule with respect to instructions not read, because in fine print or because otherwise not calculated to reach the buyer\u2019s attention.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We hold (on the authority of the cases relied on by Jacobson already cited) that a retailer\u2019s implied warranty of merchantability with respect to goods not of bis manufacture is no wider than that they are reasonably suitable for the ordinary uses for Avhich goods of that description are sold Avhen used in accordance with reasonable, intelligible and adequate warnings and instructions lcnoAvn, or which should have been knoAvn, to the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">4. It remains for us to consider whether the instructions and warning AA^ere sufficiently clear. A majority of the court are of the opinion (a) that the instructions were sufficiently explicit and adequate to point out the necessity of a patch test, and (b) that the implied warranty was only that the dye was merchantable if it was used after the user had taken the prescribed patch test without any indication from the test that use of the dye would be harmful. This view is supported (1) by the words on the bottle that the \u201cproduct contains ingredients which may cause skin irritation on certain individuals and a preliminary test according to accompanying directions should first be made\u201d; (2) by the detailed instructions about hoAv to make the patch test; (3) by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>the instructions that \u201cbefore contracting or using this product, a test, in strict accordance with the following directions, should be made\u201d; and (4) by the words in the patch test instructions that the \u201ctest should be made before every application.\u201d See also footnote 1, <em>supra. </em>The position gains support also from <em>Schilling </em>v. <em>Roux Distributing Co. Inc. </em>240 Minn. 71, 88-89, 91, where the Minnesota court, considering the same product and instructions, permitted a purchaser, injured while \u201cretouching\u201d her hair, to recover because of the ambiguity of the instructions to users contemplating a \u201cretouching\u201d as opposed to a complete \u201capplication\u201d of the dye, but said that \u201cthe instructions would imply that the test was required prior to an original application.\u201d See also <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Ashford, </em>[1950] 2 All E. R. 76 (where, in an action of tort for negligence against the manufacturer of hair dye, instructions and warnings that \u201cthe dye . . . might be dangerous to certain skins and advising that a test should be made before use\u201d were disregarded by a hairdresser who had read the instructions, with the result that recovery against the manufacturer was denied; but the court, at page 77, expressly did not pass upon the question whether the warning would have been sufficient \u201cwhere the substance is used by a woman on her own hair\u201d). The majority feel that the \u201climited few,\u201d mentioned below, were sufficiently warned by the express statements on the bottle and in the circular, which were read and understood by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Mr. Justice Counihan and the writer of this opinion, on this phase of the case, wish to record their view that the instructions (1) could reasonably be regarded as a delicately phrased attempt to afford protection from claims by the \u201climited few [who] may be allergic or hypersensitive to\u201d hair dyes, without scaring away as potential customers any substantial part of the \u201cmillions of persons using or contemplating the use of hair colorings\u201d (see text of warnings, quoted <em>supra), </em>and (2) are not sufficiently explicit and emphatic as a disclaimer (compare <em>S. F. Bowser &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Independent Dye House, Inc. </em>276 Mass. 289, 295-297; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number><em>Dekofski </em>v. <em>Leite, </em>ante, 127, 129,) to direct consumers\u2019 attention to the real nature of the various serious dangers involved in disregarding instructions, including the special dangers of a gradually developing sensitivity or allergy in a customer who had used the product previously without injurious effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">5. Since the plaintiff disregarded instructions, held here to be adequate, she has not shown that she was within the scope of any implied warranty given by Jacobson. The motion for a directed verdict for the defendant should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-7\"> The final paragraph describing this procedure was: \u201c5 . . . examine the test area within the next <em>24 </em>hours [after applying a test solution to a small area of scalp or skin].
