Shipps, Jr., appeals. He also appeals two convictions of armed assault in a dwelling house, see G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18A (1984 ed.), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>two convictions of armed robbery, see G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17 (1984 ed.). The defendant asserts error in (1) the denials of his various motions to suppress incriminating statements, identification evidence, scientific tests, and evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; (2) the denial of his motion for a mistrial based on evidence of unrelated crimes allegedly intentionally introduced by the prosecutor; and (3) other instances of prosecutorial misconduct. The defendant also requests that we exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1984 ed.), and reverse his convictions of murder in the first degree and order a new trial, or, at a minimum, vacate the consecutive life sentence imposed on the second conviction of murder in the first degree. We conclude that there was no reversible error. We decline to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">We summarize the evidence. In the early morning hours of July 24, 1982, an elderly brother and sister were murdered in their home in Stoughton. The victims, John J. Lucey and Esther L. King, were fatally wounded during an armed robbery. Ballistics evidence showed that the weapon used was one capable of firing .38 caliber ammunition, either a .38 or a .357 caliber weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">A few hours prior to the murders, the defendant was in his home in Stoughton with a friend, Darren Carey. Carey<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> said that he arrived at the defendant\u2019s home sometime after midnight on July 24, 1982. When Carey arrived, the defendant showed him a pair of car speakers which the defendant stated that he had taken \u201cfrom a car up the street.\u201d The defendant also produced a gun which he said he had stolen from the home of a police officer in Easton.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Carey stated that the weapon he had seen the defendant with was a black revolver with a brown handle. Shortly after Carey arrived at the defendant\u2019s home, the gun accidentally fired into the wall in the defendant\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>In the early morning hours, Carey stated that he and the defendant went into the garage of a residence near the defendant\u2019s home. There they found barbells and weights, which they decided to steal. The two men removed the weights to nearby woods. While Carey continued this process, the defendant went across the street and broke into two cars. Carey did not see the defendant steal anything from these cars. Shortly thereafter, Carey and the defendant went into the garage of the victims\u2019 residence. Carey stated that the defendant tried to open a window at the front of the house. Carey told the defendant that there were people inside. According to Carey, the defendant stated that only one old man lived in the house. The defendant then made a punching motion and said, \u201cOne . . . and he\u2019s out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">The two men parted and Carey started toward his own home. He changed his mind and headed back to the hiding place and began assembling the weights. As he was assembling the weights, Carey saw the defendant walking up the street in the general direction of the victims\u2019 home. Carey left the woods with the weights and went in the opposite direction from that which the defendant had taken.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">At approximately 11:15 a.m. on July 24,1982, victimKing\u2019s son in-law arrived at the victims\u2019 home. The son-in-law testified that he found King lying face up in her blood-stained bed. The contents of her bureau drawers were strewn about the room. King was still alive at this time. The son-in-law then entered the bedroom of Lucey and found no apparent signs of life. The contents of Lucey\u2019s bureau drawers were also strewn about his room. When the police and ambulance arrived, King was taken to a local hospital. King died shortly after her arrival at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">1. <em>Motion to suppress the incriminating statements. </em>Thirteen months after the murders, on August 25, 1983, the defendant and a friend were arrested in an apartment complex in Stoughton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>and charged with disorderly conduct. The two men had consumed a substantial quantity of alcohol. A Stoughton police officer transported the two men to the police station and the reasons stated on the booking sheet for the defendant\u2019s arrest were disorderly conduct, being a minor in possession of alcohol and a controlled substance, and protective custody.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">During the booking, the defendant saw State Trooper Robert Murphy, an individual whom the defendant recognized as involved in the murder investigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Murphy was not on duty that evening. When the defendant saw Murphy, he called out that he wanted to talk to Murphy. Murphy responded that he would speak to the defendant later and left the booking area. The defendant called to Murphy to remind him not to leave the station without talking to him (the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">After being booked, the defendant made two telephone calls. He then met with Murphy. Murphy recited the Miranda warnings for a second time and the defendant said that he understood the warnings. Murphy then asked the defendant what he wanted to talk to him about. In the ensuing conversation, the defendant made some damaging remarks. The defendant stated: \u201c[Y]ou\u2019ve been following me and my friends. You think I killed those people. I didn\u2019t kill those people.\u201d The defendant told Murphy that he was home asleep on the night of the murders. The defendant further stated that he would have told the trooper earlier, but his lawyer in the firearms matter had advised him not to speak to Murphy. The defendant also said that he was aware that the police were searching for the gun and stated that the police would not be able to find the gun without his help. The defendant then said that the gun they were searching for was a \u201cThree, Five, Seven.\u201d The defendant also told Murphy that, although Murphy might know what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>happened, the police could not prove anything. Finally, the defendant said that on the day after the murders he told his sister and girl friend that he had heard that \u201c50G\u2019s\u201d had been stolen from the house and that he wished he had made the \u201chit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress those statements. In his motion, the defendant asserted that because of his youth<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and intoxication, he made these statements without a knowing and voluntary waiver of his rights. The defendant also argued that the police action violated his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights because Murphy knew the defendant had been represented by counsel on the firearms charges the year before. Finally, the defendant claimed that the police violated the protective custody statute, see G. L. c. 111B, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 10 (1984 ed.), and as a result his statements should be suppressed. The judge denied the motions. The defendant claims error in that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The judge made the following findings of fact. At the police station, the police recited the Miranda warnings on at least two occasions. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966). The defendant said that he understood those warnings. The judge found that, even though he had been drinking earlier that evening, the defendant understood the warnings. The police also informed the defendant of his right to take a breathalyzer examination. See G. L. c. 111B, \u00a7 8. The defendant declined to do so. The judge further found that the defendant initiated the conversation with Murphy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>The judge found that, after being advised of his right to make a telephone call, the defendant made two telephone calls to a friend\u2019s mother. See G. L. c. 111B, \u00a7 8; G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 33A (1984 ed.). The judge found that the defendant made those telephone calls without any assistance. During the course of the defendant\u2019s booking, the defendant\u2019s family learned of his arrest. The judge found that the defendant\u2019s sister was present at the arrest and that his friend\u2019s mother had telephoned the defendant\u2019s mother to inform her of his status and whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">As to the defendant\u2019s degree of intoxication, the judge found that, while the defendant appeared glassy-eyed and smelled of alcohol, he had no difficulty walking or speaking. The defendant had no difficulty understanding questions concerning his address, age, telephone number, and mother\u2019s maiden name. The judge found that he answered all questions appropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Initially, the defendant argues that his degree of intoxication precludes a conclusion that he voluntarily and knowingly waived the constitutional rights protected by the Miranda warnings. Special care must be taken in assessing a waiver and the voluntariness of the statements where there is evidence that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. An otherwise voluntary act is not necessarily rendered involuntary simply because an individual has been drinking or using drugs. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>391 Mass. 443, 448 (1984). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parham, </em>390 Mass. 833, 839 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">The details of the booking procedure and the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s statement do not support his contention that his waiver was involuntary. The officers who saw the defendant that night concluded that, although he had been drinking, he was not drunk. Although the defendant asserted that he was so drunk that he was unable to waive his rights, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>could disbelieve his testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Credibility is for the fact finder. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santo, </em>375 Mass. 299, 303 (1978). We do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial judge, who heard and saw the witnesses. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernette, </em>398 Mass. 658, 663 nn. 9 &amp; 10 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">We also find no merit in the defendant\u2019s contention that his youth and low intelligence precluded a voluntary waiver. \u201cIt is well settled that a minor may waive his constitutional rights and make an incriminating statement to the police that is admissible against him\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>388 Mass. 846, 851 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 146, cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>366 Mass. 601, 605 (1975). The defendant was age seventeen, eleven months. The defendant had had at least one prior arrest. He was twice given Miranda warnings. He decided to waive his rights and take the opportunity to offer an alibi. Further, the defendant initiated the conversation with Murphy. The police officers did not seek to obtain information from the defendant. There is no evidence that the police employed any unfair tactics to prompt the defendant to incriminate himself. We conclude that the judge correctly determined that the Commonwealth met its burden of proving that the defendant validly waived the rights protected by the Miranda warnings and that his statements were made voluntarily. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, supra </em>at 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">As to the defendant\u2019s contention that his right to counsel was violated, the defendant did not invoke his right to counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>after receiving the Miranda warnings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pennellatore, </em>392 Mass. 382, 387 (1984). The judge found that, although the defendant had counsel on the firearms charge, there was no evidence that this representation extended beyond the firearms charge. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">The defendant\u2019s final argument concerning the incriminating statements involves the violation of the protective custody statute, G. L. c. 111B, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 10.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After the defendant was placed in protective custody, the police did not telephone either of his parents to state that he was in protective custody. Nonetheless, the defendant concedes that his mother had notice of his protective custody booking shortly after it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">According to the mother, she telephoned the police station between 1:30 a.m. and 2 a.m. and requested the release of her son.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The officer informed her that she could not pick up her son because he was being held in protective custody. This statement was misinformation conveyed to the mother in conflict with the provisions of G. L. c. 111B, \u00a7 10. The judge ruled that even if the officer told the defendant\u2019s mother not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>to come to the police station, the defendant\u2019s statements were made voluntarily after waiver of his rights and should not be suppressed at trial. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">An unlawful arrest does not compel suppression of statements not related to the unlawful arrest. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>373 Mass. 478, 487 (1977). So too, improper conduct unrelated to the statements does not compel suppression of the statements. While the initial arrest and protective custody were lawful, the subsequent conduct of the police in misinforming the defendant\u2019s mother as to whether the defendant could be released was improper. Thus, the issue is whether that illegality requires suppression of the statements. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590 (1975), and <em>Dunaway </em>v. <em>New York, </em>442 U.S. 200 (1979), the Supreme Court stated that the important factors to be analyzed in the determination of the admissibility of statements made following an illegal arrest are: (1) Miranda warnings; (2) the temporal proximity of the arrest and the confession; (3) the presence of intervening circumstances; and (4) the purpose and flagrancy of the police misconduct. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra </em>at 603-604. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 258 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvia, </em>380 Mass. 180, 183 (1980). We turn to the defendant\u2019s statements with these factors in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The police informed the defendant of the Miranda warnings on at least two occasions. The temporal proximity between the protective custody booking and the statements was fairly close. The police arrested the defendant at approximately 12:30 a.m. The booking process was fairly brief and, according to the record, the defendant telephoned his friend\u2019s mother about 12:40 a.m. The conversation with Murphy occurred shortly after this telephone call, and lasted for, at most, one-half hour. Thus, the time between the arrest and the statements was about forty-five minutes. The most crucial intervening circumstance was the presence of Murphy at the station, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>and the defendant\u2019s insistence on speaking with him.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Finally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>the police did not attempt to exploit the circumstances of the arrest. The statutory violation was not a deliberate one aimed at encouraging the defendant to incriminate himself. There appears to be no causal relationship between the statement and the subsequent detention. \u201cIn these circumstances, outlawing [the defendant\u2019s] statements] would hardly have served an important demonstrative purpose of deterring the police from future malfeasance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvia, supra at </em>184.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">2. <em>Motion to suppress the identification evidence. </em>Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress two different forms of identification evidence. The defendant sought to suppress evidence of a jewelry store employee\u2019s identification of his photograph. The defendant also filed a motion to suppress the identification of a picture of a weapon which the Commonwealth\u2019s witness, Carey, stated looked similar to the weapon he had seen in the defendant\u2019s bedroom on the night of the murders. The judge denied both motions. There was no error in the judge\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">On September 29, 1983, a detective from the Stoughton police department went to a local jewelry store and showed an employee a piece of paper with photographs of two different individuals and a list of stolen items. This employee immediately recognized the photograph of the defendant. The employee also recalled some of the items that the defendant had sold to her. The employee said that the defendant came into her store several times in August and September, 1983. She had purchased from the defendant three silhouette charms, two of female heads and one of a male head, a watch case, a pearl ring, two pearl earrings, and a pearl clasp.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">The defendant contends that the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive and that the use of a photograph of the defendant, taken in connection with a prior juvenile matter, violated the statutory protections given juveniles.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>the defendant argued that G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 60A (1984 ed.), prohibited police use of the defendant\u2019s photograph. The defendant did not argue, however, that the police lacked the authority under G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 1A (1984 ed.), to photograph juveniles arrested for the equivalent of a felony but charged with delinquency. He makes both arguments on appeal. As to the defendant\u2019s contention that G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 60A, prohibits police use of his photograph, a reading of the statute does not support the defendant\u2019s contention. As to the defendant\u2019s contention that the police lack authority to photograph a juvenile charged with the equivalent of a felony, we consider the statute to determine whether a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice has occurred. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">The judge found that the jewelry store employee had seen the defendant on four or five occasions over a six-week period. The employee saw the defendant under lighting that existed in the store. The judge did not find the procedure employed by the police to be suggestive. In the totality of circumstances, the judge concluded that the employee was able to make a credible identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">The jewelry store employee\u2019s identification of the defendant occurred during the police investigation of the homicides. Because certain jewelry had been stolen from the victims, the police circulated information with photographs of two suspects and a list of the stolen items to precious metal dealers in the area. In presenting the material to the jewelry store employee, the officer simply asked whether she recognized either individual. He did not seek to influence her choice in any way. We agree with the judge that this identification was not so suggestive as to give rise to a substantial likelihood of misidentification. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Botelho, 369 </em>Mass. 860 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">As to the defendant\u2019s second challenge to the identification, the use of his photograph taken as a result of a prior juvenile proceeding, the judge determined that G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 60A,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>did not prohibit police use of this photograph. The judge concluded that the statute applied to court proceedings and was not applicable by its terms to police investigations, especially those occurring before arrest. Thus, he concluded that the use by police of the defendant\u2019s photograph during the murder investigations did not give rise to a \u00a7 60A violation. We conclude that the judge correctly ruled the statute by its terms does not apply to police investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the police do not have the authority to photograph juveniles arrested on a charge which would be a felony if the offender were an adult. Under G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 1A (1984 ed.), the police are empowered to fingerprint and photograph anyone who is taken into custody and charged with a felony. See G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 1 (1984 ed.). A juvenile who is arrested for the commission of the equivalent of a felony may be charged only with delinquency. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 53, 54 (1984 ed.). Therefore, the defendant argues that G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 1A, by its terms, is inapplicable to individuals charged with delinquency. Thus, he concludes that the police lack authority to photograph or fingerprint any person who is arrested and charged with delinquency pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 54. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">In <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Dorchester Dist., </em>374 Mass. 640, 647 (1978), we left open the question whether the statutory authority to photograph and fingerprint individuals charged with a felony includes juveniles arrested for the equivalent of a felony but charged with delinquency.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we recognized in <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra </em>at 655, that \u201c[t]he maintenance of fingerprint, photograph and arrest records serves an important law enforcement function.\u201d The Legislature did not explicitly exclude juveniles from G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 1A. Thus, we constfue G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 1A, to include an individual who is arrested for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>offense classified as a felony but who is later charged with delinquency because of age.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Tielsch, </em>84 Wash. 2d 217 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">The defendant also challenges testimony by Darren Carey that the gun he had seen in the defendant\u2019s bedroom on the night of the murders resembled a picture of a gun which an investigating officer had shown him. Carey was shown pictures of four guns, all of which were either .38 or .357 caliber weapons. The defendant contends that the officer\u2019s action, in opening up a book with pictures of guns to a particular page, was unnecessarily suggestive. We disagree. The officer\u2019s action in directing Carey\u2019s attention to a particular page of a book did not result in a prejudicial and unreliable identification of the gun. Defense counsel had the opportunity to bring out the weakness of the identification of the gun on cross-examination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>383 Mass. 46, 52 (1981). The judge correctly ruled that any infirmities of this identification evidence went to the weight, not the admissibility, of Carey\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">3. <em>Motion to suppress the results of scientific tests. </em>The Commonwealth performed destructive chemical testing on the three charms which were recovered from the jewelry store.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>The daughter of one of the victims identified these charms as belonging to her mother. The daughter stated that she had given these three charms to her mother with her name and birth date engraved on one female silhouette. Her children\u2019s names and birth dates were engraved on the other two silhouette charms. When the charms were recovered at the jewelry store, the surface of the charms had been filed or ground down so that any engraving was not legible.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">A chemist for the Commonwealth attempted to restore any markings which may have been on the charms by applying different acid solutions to the surface of the charms. On the male silhouette charm, the chemist observed a number five or six followed by the number one on the right side of the charm. On the second charm, the chemist observed no markings after applications of the chemical solution. On the third charm, the chemist noted on the left side of the charm the number nine, and the number six. These numbers corresponded to some of the numbers in the birth dates of the children, and so corroborated the daughter\u2019s identification of the charms as those of her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The markings that were exposed by the testing were visible for approximately two hours. They then disappeared completely. The chemist made notes of his observations at each stage of the test. The chemist also prepared a report containing the results of this testing. Finally, the chemist made sketches to record what he had observed. He did not, however, photograph any of the steps of the testing procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The defendant argues that the admission of the results of these tests, where the testing procedure destroyed the evidence in the process of testing, violates his right to due process. After an evidentiary hearing, the judge found that this testing was done before the defendant had been arrested. Therefore, there was no lawyer to whom notice could have been given concerning the testing. The judge also found that nondestructive testing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>was not an alternative in this case. According to both the Commonwealth and the defense experts, all the available testing methods involved some reduction of the surface of the metal. Although the judge concluded that photographs of the test procedure would have provided a better record, the chemist\u2019s report was made available to the defendant. The judge did not find the absence of photographs to be fatal to admissibility, thus he denied the motion to suppress the test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Due process requires that the prosecution disclose to a defendant, on request, evidence in its possession that is material either to guilt or to punishment. <em>California </em>v. <em>Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 485 (1984). <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Liebman, </em>388 Mass. 483, 487 (1983). This obligation includes \u201cevidence which provides some significant aid to the defendant\u2019s case, whether it furnishes corroboration of the defendant\u2019s story, calls into question a material, although not indispensable, element of the prosecution\u2019s version of the events, or challenges the credibility of a key prosecution witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>376 Mass. 1, 22 (1978). Obviously, in the case of destructive testing, the prosecution no longer has the evidence in its possession, but that is not dispositive of the issue of the Commonwealth\u2019s obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence. \u201cOtherwise, disclosure might be avoided by destroying vital evidence before prosecution begins or before defendants hear of its existence.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>439 F.2d 642, 651 (D.C. Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">In cases where potentially exculpatory evidence has been lost or destroyed, courts have employed a balancing test, weighing the culpability of the government, the materiality of the evidence, and the potential prejudice to the defendant to determine the necessity or appropriateness of sanctions or other remedial action. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>397 Mass. 1, 14 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 544, 547-548 (1982). See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arra, </em>630 F.2d 836, 848 (1st Cir. 1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilks, </em>629 F.2d 669, 674 (10th Cir. 1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Herndon, </em>536 F.2d 1027, 1029 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bryant, supra </em>at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>In assessing the culpability of the government in this case, the judge\u2019s findings reveal that the Commonwealth\u2019s expert knew of no test procedures which were nondestructive. The defendant\u2019s expert suggested that polishing the surface of the metal might remove the scrapings and reveal the engraving underneath. But, if this polishing technique were not successful, the defendant\u2019s expert' conceded that the application of chemicals to reveal the engraving would involve a reduction of the surface of the metal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beltempo, </em>675 F.2d 472, 479 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1135 (1982) (good faith loss which came about as a necessary consequence of the testing method used).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Any culpability of the Commonwealth arises in the failure to photograph each step of the test procedure. Because there had been no indictment or arrest in connection with the murders, the defendant did not have an attorney or an expert who could be notified concerning the testing. In this setting, the better practice would have involved careful documentation and photographing of the entire test. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bridges, </em>499 F.2d 179, 185 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1010 (1974); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shafer, </em>445 F.2d 579, 582 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 986 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>267 N.W.2d 170, 175 n.4 (Minn. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Against this failure of the government to photograph the test procedure, we balance the materiality of the evidence and the potential prejudice to the defendant. \u201cThe mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish \u2018materiality\u2019 in the constitutional sense.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 109-110 (1976). See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilday, </em>382 Mass. 166, 178-179 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>376 Mass. 1, 23-25 (1978). It seems clear that if the defendant had had the ability to perform tests on the charms which revealed numbers or letters not included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>in the names and birthdates engraved on the charms of the victim, the evidence would have been material. 'But, even if that had occurred, those test results would not have proved that the defendant did not commit the murders. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Preziosi, </em>ante 748, 752 (1987). The victim\u2019s daughter also had identified at the jewelry store the watch back with the name \u201cBill\u201d engraved on it as belonging to her mother. The defendant had sold this item to the jewelry store along with the charms. Additionally, the daughter was able to identify her mother\u2019s watch band which the defendant had sold because it had some distinctive broken places in the basketweave mesh of the band. The daughter also stated that some pearl jewelry belonging to her mother was missing. The jewelry store employee had purchased various pieces of pearl jewelry from the defendant, but, given that the daughter looked at over one hundred pieces of jewelry at the jewelry store, she was not able positively to identify this jewelry. Regardless of any defense testing on the charms, the testimony regarding the other jewelry clearly was probative of the defendant\u2019s guilt. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Preziosi, supra </em>(failure to test for fingerprints does not relate directly to guilt or innocence); <em>Wilks, supra </em>at 675 (missing evidence, rendering test for defendant\u2019s fingerprints impossible, could not have proved innocence). Error, if any, was nonprejudicial in view of the other evidence connecting the defendant to the sale of the jewelry similar to that stolen from the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">4. <em>The motion for a mistrial. </em>On the sixth day of trial, Trooper Murphy testified to the details of the police investigation of the homicides. On cross-examination, the defendant brought out several deficiencies in the police investigation. In particular, the defendant opened up the subject of the items recovered by the police pursuant to three search warrants. The police had recovered relevant evidence as a result of the first search warrant,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but the other two searches did not produce items which pertained to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>In redirect examination, the prosecutor sought to rehabilitate his witness by clarifying that the police did recover some items pursuant to the third search warrant. The trooper said, over objection, that in the third search of the defendant\u2019s bedroom he found a bag containing forty to fifty pieces of silver jewelry. The judge ruled that, because the defendant had opened up the subject of the warrants, the trooper could testify as to what was found. After the trooper then stated that the jewelry was unrelated to this case, the judge requested a bench conference with the parties and reprimanded the prosecutor for introducing evidence which might suggest other crimes.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The defendant then moved for a mistrial. The judge denied this motion. The defendant did not move to strike this testimony. In addition, the record reflects that the defendant did not seek a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">The prosecutor should not have allowed the witness to make this reference to jewelry unrelated to the case.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The suggestion of other crimes was so vague and the evidence inculpating the defendant so strong that, on balance, we conclude that this did not taint the defendant\u2019s trial and thus reversal of the convictions is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">5. <em>Prosecutorial misconduct. </em>The defendant challenges one remark made by the prosecutor concerning the qualifications of the defendant\u2019s expert. The defendant also asserts that he was unfairly prejudiced by two statements of the prosecutor during his closing argument. We find no merit in these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>A metallurgist testified on behalf of the defendant. After he testified to his qualifications in his field of expertise, the prosecutor objected. In front of the jury, the prosecutor stated that it was unclear whether the expert had two years of high school or elementary school training in chemistry. The defendant objected to the prosecutor\u2019s disparaging remarks in front of the jury. The judge promptly corrected the prosecutor\u2019s improper remark by instructing the jury that the statement was inappropriate and that the objection was simply to the lack of qualifications.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> While it was unfortunate that the prosecutor made this improper comment in front of the jury, the judge promptly and forcefully corrected this misstatement. Any possible harm was eliminated promptly by the judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagan, </em>357 Mass. 585, 592 (1970). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernette, </em>398 Mass. 658, 665-666 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">Prior to the closing arguments in this case, the prosecutor indicated to the judge that he sought an instruction on the theory of murder with extreme cruelty or atrocity. The record reflects that the judge did not indicate to the parties whether he would give an instruction on this theory of murder in the first degree until after the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 24 (b), 378 Mass. 895 (1979). Thus, the prosecutor argued this theory of murder in his closing statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">At the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing statement, the judge indicated to the parties that, although these crimes were certainly vicious, he did not believe it was appropriate to instruct the jury on the extreme atrocity or cruelty theory of murder in the first degree. The defendant requested that the judge give an instruction to \u201csanitize\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s remarks on this theory of murder. In his instructions, the judge explained to the jury that, although the prosecutor had argued the atrocity or cruelty theory of murder, it was \u201cnot a proper principle\u201d for the jury to consider in connection with murder in the first degree. At the conclusion of the instructions, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>raised no objection to the judge\u2019s handling of this issue. There was no error in the prosecutor\u2019s summation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Because the judge had not informed the parties whether he would submit the case to the jury on this theory of murder, there was no prosecutorial misconduct in arguing to the jury the evidence and asserting that from this evidence the jurors could conclude that the murders were committed with atrocity or cruelty. \u201cWe have never criticized a prosecutor for arguing forcefully for a conviction based on the evidence and on inferences that may reasonably be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, ante </em>514, 516 (1987). Here, the prosecutor\u2019s argument was properly based on the physical evidence and inferences drawn from that evidence. While some of this argument was graphic and unpleasant, as the judge noted, this was an extremely vicious crime. The argument was based on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">6. <em>Review pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>Pursuant to our duty under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we have reviewed the record and conclude that there is no reason to order entry of a verdict of lesser degree of guilt or a new trial on the convictions of murder in the first degree. The defendant suggests that the sentences on the two murder convictions should run concurrently. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>375 Mass. 380, 390-393 (1978) (\u201csame evidence rule\u201d). Because there were two murders, there is no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-7\"> Carey had immunity from prosecution. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 20C-20G (1984 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b838-8\"> The defendant also told Carey that he had stolen two other guns in addition to the one he showed Carey. The calibers of the three stolen weapons were .38, .22, and .357.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b839-7\"> Neighbors\u2019 testimony and the physical evidence corroborated several aspects of Carey\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The defendant presented evidence from his family which would tend to support his alibi that he was home asleep on the night of the murders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b840-6\"> At the time of this disorderly conduct arrest, the defendant was seventeen years old. At the station, his status was as an individual in protective custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\"> The defendant recognized Trooper Murphy because he had arrested the defendant on firearms charges in August, 1982. See G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (1984 ed.). The defendant was prosecuted for unlawful possession of .38 and .22 caliber revolvers. These guns were stolen from the residence of an Easton police officer. The defendant was incarcerated for these convictions from August, 1982, until June 16, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b841-6\"> The defendant was seventeen years old at the time of this arrest. But, at the time of the murders, the defendant was sixteen years old. Thus, delinquency complaints were originally brought against the defendant. After transfer proceedings, it was determined'that the defendant\u2019s case should be bound over to the Superior Court and the juvenile complaints were dismissed. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61 (1984 ed.). <em>Two Juveniles </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 736 (1980). There is no argument that it was error to transfer the case. Issues not argued are deemed waived. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cundriff, </em>382 Mass. 137, 150 n.22 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 973 (1981). See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 919 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b841-7\"> According to the findings, Murphy was at the police station on a social visit and was not involved in the defendant\u2019s arrest. The judge found that Trooper Murphy had a longstanding practice to visit with officers at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>Stoughton police station. On this particular evening, the judge found that Murphy had been working in Sharon until about 10:30 p.m. Murphy then stopped for coffee at a doughnut shop, visited with a friend, and proceeded to the Stoughton police station.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The defendant relies heavily on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hosey, </em>368 Mass. 571 (1975), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>377 Mass. 552 (1979), cert. dismissed, 445 U.S. 39 (1980). Those cases are inapposite. In <em>Hosey, </em>the officer testified that the defendant was extremely \u201chigh\u201d and emotional. The officer had difficulty making sense of the defendant\u2019s statements. <em>Id. </em>at 575. On these facts, the <em>Hosey </em>court stated that it could not \u201ccondone an attempt to induce a waiver in this manner.\u201d <em>Hosey, supra </em>at 578. The defendant here did not suffer the same mental and physical impairment as the defendant in <em>Hosey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">In <em>Meehan, supra </em>at 567, the court suppressed statements made as a result of the defendant\u2019s intoxication and youth, and the failure of the police to permit the defendant to make a telephone call. This combination of factors lead the court to conclude that suppression was appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b844-6\">In relevant part, G.

See note 5, <em>supra. </em>In this trial, the defendant claims that the arrest on the firearms charge was a pretext. This he cannot do. The defendant\u2019s challenge amounts to a collateral attack on a prior arrest. Any question concerning the validity of this prior arrest was appropriate only during the prior proceedings. We note that there is nothing in the record to show that the defendant challenged the validity of the arrest in the prior proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\">In addition to the three charms, other pieces of the jewelry similar to the victim\u2019s were recovered at this jewelry store.
