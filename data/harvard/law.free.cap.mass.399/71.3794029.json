The defendant also seeks relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1984 ed.). We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-14\">The challenged confession is contained in a report prepared by Lieutenant Alfred Duemling of the State police. The report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>is signed by the defendant and his grandfather, and by Duemling and Lynn police Lieutenant Joseph Coppinger as witnesses. The contents of the confession bear on the question whether the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his rights protected by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution before making the confession. Furthermore, because we answer that question in the affirmative, the confession is relevant to our consideration of the entire case under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to see whether justice requires a change in the verdict. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanderpool, </em>367 Mass. 743, 749 (1975). According to the report, the defendant initially denied that he had killed Bonnie Mitchell, the victim. He accounted for his whereabouts during the relevant time period in considerable detail. The report then states that the police told the defendant in the presence of his grandfather that the defendant was not telling the truth, and that several people had told the police that the defendant had shown them the victim\u2019s body and had told them that he had killed her. The rest of the report is as follows: \u201cWe asked him to stop lying and tell us the truth. He then stated, \u2018Yes, I killed her, I told her to stay out of my life but she wouldn\u2019t. \u2019 \u2018She had other girls beat up my girl. \u2019 \u2018Sunday I thought about killing her and I thought of strangling her with a rope.\u2019 \u2018Sunday I found a rope at Cook Street Park and I was going to use it. I put it in my coat and took it home.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u201cI got up at 7:45 a.m. , took a bath and left the house about 9:00 a.m. or so and went to my mother\u2019s house. On the way down I threw the rope away. I left my mother\u2019s about 9:40 a.m. I walked to Frank\u2019s house on Rock Avenue. My mother lives at 7 Essex Circle. It took me about 10 minutes to walk there. On the way I picked up another length of rope in a parking lot on Brownville Avenue. It was about two or two and half feet long. It was like clothes line rope. I put it in my pocket. I didn\u2019t know if I was going to go through with it or not but I still had the rope. I had thrown the other rope away because I had changed my mind at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u201cAt Frank\u2019s house I was talking with Billy and Melissa Bragen. Bill had some pot and we smoked it, Bill and I. Bonnie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>came and I asked her to go for a walk with me. I had decided to kill her, we went to the Pine Grove. Sunday I had thought about killing her at the Pine Grove because it was close. At the Pine Grove we walked to the little bathroom and she wanted to see what was inside. I knew the house was there from a while, ago. She wanted to stay inside because she was cold. We were in there about 45 minutes talking about why she wanted to beat and kill Tracy. She told me that, \u2018If she couldn\u2019t have me no one could, and if she couldn\u2019t beat them up she would get someone to do it for her.\u2019 At that time she was sitting on the hopper and I was on the ledge above her with my feet on the opposite window and I was behind her, I had made up my mind to kill her, it was now or never. I took the rope out of my pocket and one foot on the hopper, my left, and my right knee in her back. I had one end of the rope in each hand and put it around her neck. I pulled the rope around her neck and held it for 3-4 minutes. She attempted to get her finger under the rope but couldn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t make any noise. I let go of the rope and she fell on the floor. The rope was still around her neck and I took the ends and tied them to the hopper seat. I did this because I read in a book that if you strangle someone and don\u2019t hold it long enough they are just unconscious. So I thought if I tied the rope from her neck to the hopper and she woke up she would strangle herself. I wanted to make sure I killed her. I didn\u2019t hate her, I just loved my girlfriend and I didn\u2019t want to lose my baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u201cI told my friends that I killed her and they didn\u2019t believe me. So I told them where the body was and they saw her, Tracy, Bill Newhall, Ted, Darryl. I went back to Tracy\u2019s house and we met John Davis and I told him that I killed her. He asked me and I told him. Tracy told me that she felt sick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">As further background, especially in connection with our duty to determine whether the conviction ought to be reduced, we note that, at trial, several Commonwealth witnesses essentially corroborated, and also supplemented, the defendant\u2019s confession. The witnesses testified that on the day of the killing and on the previous day the defendant told his friends that he intended to kill Mitchell, his former girl friend, because she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>had threatened his current girl friend whom he believed to be pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The defendant testified at the trial. He denied that he had killed Mitchell. He said that another person killed her in his presence, and that that person threatened him with a gun and told him to say that he, the defendant, had killed Mitchell. The defendant testified that, later, Mitchell\u2019s killer told him that he would kill the defendant\u2019s current girl friend if the defendant did not confess to Mitchell\u2019s killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">We now specifically turn our attention to the motion to suppress the confession. The defendant\u2019s contention is that the Commonwealth has failed to sustain its heavy burden of showing that he waived his Fifth Amendment rights voluntarily with an understanding of their nature and the possible consequences of waiving them. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S 436, 475 (1966). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>385 Mass. 660, 664 (1982). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>379 Mass. 422, 428-431 (1980). \u201cSpecial caution, of course, must be exercised in examining the validity of inculpatory statements made by juveniles.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 602, 609 (1984). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>361 Mass. 224, 228 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The judge found the following facts beyond a reasonable doubt. At approximately 9:35 p.m. on October 19, 1981, Lynn police officers met the defendant and his grandfather at the building where the grandfather lived.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The police and the grandfather made an unsuccessful effort to find the defendant\u2019s mother. At around 10 p.m. on the same night, Lieutenant Alfred Duemling of the State police went to the grandfather\u2019s apartment and told the defendant and the grandparents that his visit concerned the death of Mitchell. Duemling noticed nothing wrong with the grandfather\u2019s speech or behavior. The defendant and his grandfather were asked to go to the police station. They went there in a police cruiser, and at 10:30p.m. Duemling, Lieutenant Coppinger, the defendant, and the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>grandfather went into a small room containing a table and four chairs. The door was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The judge found that Duemling told the defendant and his grandfather that he was investigating Mitchell\u2019s death and that he had heard that the defendant was involved. Duemling then read the Miranda warnings to the defendant and the grandfather. After being asked if he understood his rights, the defendant replied that he did and that he wanted to talk to the police. The grandfather also responded that the defendant could talk to the police. The defendant and the defendant\u2019s grandfather read the Miranda card and signed it. The defendant, the judge found, \u201cthen gave a cogent and detailed statement\u201d denying any involvement with Mitchell\u2019s death, but, when Duemling told the defendant to stop lying, the defendant stated that he did kill her \u201cand went on with a detailed explanation of why and how he killed her.\u201d When the confession was completed, the defendant and the grandfather signed it, as did the officers as witnesses. The interrogation lasted one hour, during which the defendant was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. He had been given a soft drink during the interrogation, and he remained unemotional and \u201cexhibited no unusual signs\u201d during that time. At 11:45 p.m. the defendant telephoned his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The judge found that the defendant was born on February 17, 1965 (making him sixteen years and eight months old at the time of the incident), that he had gone no further in school than completion of the eighth grade, and that he left school because the teachers were not giving him enough work (the defendant had so testified). The judge also found that the defendant had never before been arrested or been in a police station, and that, while being held awaiting trial, the defendant \u201cpretended to be attempting to commit suicide in order to be transferred to Bridgewater wherePhe sought to study law books.\u201d The judge further reported that he had \u201cobserved the defendant on the stand, and he appeared bright and answered the questions with appropriate responses. He appears to be stoic in his mannerisms and countenance.\u201d After explicitly acknowledging the Commonwealth\u2019s heavy burden of proving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, and that for a waiver the defendant must understand \u201cthe import of each Miranda warning,\u201d the judge, expressly employing \u201cspecial caution\u201d in view of the defendant\u2019s youth, concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally and without any form of coercion relinquished his Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In the absence of clear error, we accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corriveau, </em>396 Mass. 319, 326 (1985). Also, we give substantial deference to a judge\u2019s ultimate findings. <em>Id. </em>Of course, we must make our own determination of the correctness of the judge\u2019s application of law to his or her findings. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings were clearly warranted by the evidence, and no reason appears for rejecting his ultimate findings. The judge correctly applied the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The defendant relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>389 Mass. 128 (1983), decided several months after this case was tried, and argues that the several requirements for a valid determination that a juvenile has waived his Fifth Amendment rights announced in that case apply to this case as well, and that they were not met. Specifically, the defendant argues that the police failed to make an adequate effort to have his mother, instead of his grandfather, present with him at the police station, and that this failure may have prejudiced his rights. He further argues that the judge failed to find that the grandfather understood the defendant\u2019s rights and the possible consequences of waiving them, and that the defendant and the grandfather engaged in no discussion about those matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, supra </em>at 133-134, we said: \u201cIn those jurisdictions which have adopted the \u2018interested adult\u2019 rule, the courts have generally held that to demonstrate a knowing and intelligent waiver by a juvenile the State must first prove that the juvenile and his parent, or if a parent is not available, someone in loco parentis, were fully advised of the juvenile\u2019s right against self-incrimination through administration of the standard Miranda warnings. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>[472 Pa. 492, 497 (1977)]. We conclude that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>for the Commonwealth successfully to demonstrate a knowing and intelligent waiver by a juvenile, in most cases it should show that a parent or an interested adult was present, understood the warnings, and had the opportunity to explain his rights to the juvenile so that the juvenile understands the significance of waiver of these rights. For the purpose of obtaining the waiver in the case of juveniles who are under the age of fourteen, we conclude that no waiver can be effective without this added protection. This procedure reflects our assumption that an informed parent, or person standing in loco parentis, will be better able to understand the child\u2019s rights, rights which a child of such tender years is unlikely to comprehend fully without the assistance of such a person. For cases involving a juvenile who has reached the age of fourteen, there should ordinarily be a meaningful consultation with the parent, interested adult, or attorney to ensure that the waiver is knowing and intelligent. For a waiver to be valid without such a consultation the circumstances should demonstrate a high degree of intelligence, experience, knowledge, or sophistication on the part of the juvenile.\u201d (Footnote concerning the retroactivity of the per se rule applicable to juveniles under fourteen omitted.) The standards we set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, supra, </em>for assuring that a juvenile defendant who has reached fourteen years of age has knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his Fifth Amendment rights have been met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, supra, </em>we specifically allowed for someone other than a parent, such as a grandfather, to be present with the juvenile. Of course, deliberate police avoidance of a parent\u2019s participation in an exchange between the police and a juvenile ordinarily would be highly suspect, but no such conduct is indicated here. At best it may be said that the search for the defendant\u2019s mother does not appear to have been extensive, but we have not announced minimum search requirements, and we are not inclined to do so. In the absence of contrary indications, it is fairly inferrable that a grandfather in whose home a juvenile is found, and who accompanies the juvenile to the police station, is sufficiently interested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>in the juvenile\u2019s welfare to afford the juvenile appropriate protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">It is true that the judge, not having the benefit of our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>389 Mass. 128 (1983), did not specifically find that the defendant\u2019s grandfather understood the Miranda warnings. However, the judge did focus on the grandfather\u2019s mental capacity. He found that Lieutenant Duemling noticed nothing wrong with the grandfather\u2019s speech or behavior immediately before the trip to the police station, and in his memorandum of findings, the judge explicitly stated that he disbelieved the grandfather\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing that he was drunk at the police station and knew very little about what had happened. Furthermore, the judge found that Duemling read the Miranda warnings to the grandfather, who subsequently read and signed the Miranda card. Nothing more need be shown to demonstrate that the presence of the grandfather gave the defendant a realistic opportunity to get helpful advice if he needed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The facts that the defendant did not actually seek his grandfather\u2019s advice and that his grandfather did not expressly offer it, are without consequence. It is the juvenile\u2019s opportunity to consult that is critical, not whether he avails himself of it. That opportunity was present here. Without the benefit of context, our statement in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, supra </em>at 134, that \u201c[f]or cases involving a juvenile who has reached the age of fourteen, there should ordinarily be a meaningful consultation with the parent, interested adult, or attorney,\u201d might suggest that a mere opportunity for a consultation without a consultation actually taking place is insufficient, but the context makes clear that no more than genuine opportunity is required. Both before and after the quoted language, the opinion explicitly speaks of the importance of the defendant\u2019s having an \u201copportunity\u201d to consult with an adult. In the Pennsylvania case on which this court relied in <em>A Juvenile, </em>the court held that opportunity is enough, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, supra </em>at 502-503, rejecting the view, expressed in a concurring opinion, that there can be no waiver in the absence of an actual consultation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, supra </em>at 506 (Manderino, J., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>concurring). Furthermore, the ultimate question is whether the juvenile has understood his rights and the potential consequences of waiving them before talking to the police. The choice of a sixteen year old juvenile not to consult with an available friendly advisor concerning those matters suggests that the juvenile\u2019s understanding was such that consultation was unnecessary. We conclude, therefore, that the judge\u2019s determination that the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his Fifth Amendment rights was well warranted even if we take the view that the judge\u2019s findings do not amount to findings of \u201ca high degree of intelligence, experience, knowledge, or sophistication\u201d on the defendant\u2019s part. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, supra </em>at 134. Accordingly, we perceive no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In addition to the defendant\u2019s claim that the denial of his motion to suppress was error, he seeks reduction of the conviction pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We have considered the entire record, including the confession, and we are satisfied that the interests of justice would not be served by our granting relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-7\"> The uncontroverted evidence adduced at the suppression hearing was that the grandfather was sixty-eight years old.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
