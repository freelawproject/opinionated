After our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>392 Mass. 632 (1984), the defendant sought a new trial on the conviction of murder in the first degree on the ground that, as in the <em>Brown </em>case, the judge\u2019s instructions were flawed on the issue of the degree of murder. The motion judge denied the motion for a new trial without a hearing. A single justice granted the defendant leave to appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1984 ed.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the order denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>372 Mass. 783, 795 (1977), we stated that the language of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, providing that \u201c[t]he degree of murder shall be found by the jury,\u201d requires that the judge give an instruction on murder in the second degree \u201ceven though it could be argued that the evidence would support only one of two verdicts: either not guilty or guilty of murder in the first degree.\u201d Our opinion in <em>Dickerson </em>clearly foreshadowed <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>392 Mass. 632, 645 (1984), a case in which we again interpreted the language of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, as requiring a \u201ctrial judge to instruct on murder in the first and second degrees if there is evidence of murder in the first degree, even though there appears to be no hypothesis in the evidence to support a verdict of murder in the second degree.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 645. Our decision in the <em>Brown </em>case \u201cdid not announce any new legal principles but merely clarified the meaning\u201d of the statutory language, and therefore the <em>Brown </em>case governs the judge\u2019s charge at the defendant\u2019s trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marley, </em>396 Mass. 433, 437 (1985). The defendant failed to raise this issue on his appeal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>379 Mass. 177 (1979). Thus, this issue was not timely raised. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pisa, </em>384 Mass. 362, 365-366 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>364 Mass. 211, 229 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stout, </em>356 Mass. 237, 243 (1969); <em>Murch </em>v. <em>Mottram, </em>409 U.S. 41, 45 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Although the defendant did not raise the issue in a timely fashion, we nonetheless comment briefly on some of the defendant\u2019s arguments because there may be some confusion as to instructions in a felony-murder case. The defendant complains that the jurors were never instructed that they could convict the defendant of armed robbery and murder in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>second degree. There was no error on that ground. An instruction that \u201ceven if they found that the killing had been committed during the commission of a felony punishable by life imprisonment, they might return a verdict of either murder in the first degree or murder in the second degree\u201d is erroneous. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>375 Mass. 380, 390 (1978). \u201cA homicide which the jury determined to be an armed robbery-murder is not properly reduced ... to murder in the second degree.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>372 Mass. 783, 796 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Further, the Commonwealth is entitled to an instruction that the jurors \u201chave a duty, if they conclude that the defendant is guilty, to return a verdict of guilty of the highest crime which has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt against the defendant\u201d and \u201cto consider the evidence in light of the principles of law given to them by the judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickerson, supra </em>at 797.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, a defendant is not entitled to an instruction that informs the jurors \u201cthat they [are] \u2018empowered\u2019 to return a lesser verdict than that which the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence proves.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernette, </em>398 Mass. 658, 670 (1986). The statute requires that the jurors be told that the degree of murder is for them to determine in light of the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The order denying the motion for a new trial is affirmed. The defendant\u2019s request that, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we reduce his conviction from murder in the first degree to murder in the second degree is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b30-13\">The court also affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction of armed robbery. The present appeal concerns only the conviction of murder in the first degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b31-7\"> The statute provides in relevant part: \u201cIf any motion is filed in the superior court after rescript, no appeal shall lie from the decision of that court upon such motion unless the appeal is allowed by a single justice of the supreme judicial court on the ground that it presents a new and substantial question which ought to be determined by the full court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b32-8\"> We said in <em>Dickerson, supra </em>at 797, that, \u201c[w]here a jury reach a determination that the statutory \u2018circumstance\u2019 (in this case armed robbery-murder) has been met, they should return a verdict of murder in the first degree.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
