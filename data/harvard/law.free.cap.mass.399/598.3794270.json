See <em>Gulezian </em>v. <em>Lincoln Ins. Co., post </em>606 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-15\">In January, 1977, Irene Reilly allegedly sustained personal injuries as a result of a fall on premises owned by Roy Farr. The Reillys commenced a tort action against Farr in the Superior Court in Essex County. Farr had primary insurance covering the claim in the amount of $300,000 with Reserve Insurance Company (Reserve) and umbrella excess third-party liability insurance coverage (from $300,000 to $5,000,000) with Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>tinental Casualty Company (Continental). In May, 1979, Reserve was declared insolvent and, pursuant to G. L. c. 175D (1984 ed.), the Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund (Fund) took over the defense of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">In this action, commenced in March, 1982, the Fund seeks a determination that it is not liable for any judgment in the Essex County tort case, that Continental will be liable to satisfy any judgment in that action, and that Continental is obliged to take over defense of that action. The case was submitted on cross motions for summary judgment. The Fund and Continental agree that, if Continental\u2019s insurance policy provides first dollar coverage in the event of the insolvency of the primary insurer, Continental and not the Fund is obliged to satisfy any judgment in the tort action, up to the limits of Continental\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The judge ordered the entry of a judgment in favor of the Fund which declared that the Fund is not liable for any judgment against Farr in the Essex County tort action and that Continental is so liable up to the limit of its coverage. He based his decision on what he concluded was ambiguous policy language which he ruled should be read in favor of the insured (and thus the Fund) to provide first dollar coverage by Continental. Continental appealed, and we allowed the Fund\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We need not accept all the judge\u2019s reasoning to conclude that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The Continental policy in part provided as to its liability over primary coverage that it \u201cwill indemnify the insured for loss in excess of the total applicable limits of liability of underlying insurance stated in the schedule.\u201d The schedule provided for underlying coverage for general liability, automobile liability, and employers\u2019 liability insurance to various dollar limits of coverage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>The Continental policy provides further that, if the underlying limit of liability has been \u201creduced,\u201d the policy becomes excess of that reduced limit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, if the underlying coverage is reduced to nothing, the excess policy in effect provides first dollar coverage. Was there at least an ambiguity as to whether the insolvency of the underlying insurer would cause the aggregate limit of the underlying insurance to be \u201creduced\u201d ? The motion judge thought so, and we agree. The policy is ambiguous as to whether the excess insurer will step in when the underlying coverage becomes unavailable due to the primary insurer\u2019s insolvency. On traditional analysis, such an ambiguity must be construed against the insurance company. See <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Connecticut General Life Ins. Co., </em>387 Mass. 142, 146 (1982); <em>August A. Busch &amp; Co. of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>339 Mass. 239, 243 (1959), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">In terms of what a reasonable insured might conclude looking at its insurance policy, a matter of a hypothetical insured\u2019s reasonable expectations,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the clearest fact is that the policy does not explicitly confront the consequences of the insolvency of the underlying insurer. An insurance company no doubt would view the amount of the underlying coverage as a kind of deductible amount assumed by the policyholder in all circumstances. On the other hand, if a reasonable policyholder thought about the subject at all, it probably would have assumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>that the excess insurer would step into the void whenever, for whatever reason, the primary insurance company could not or would not meet its policy obligations. The result because of the ambiguity, or, if one prefers, because of the reasonable expectations of a policyholder looking at the policy, is that a reduction in the limit of the underlying coverage includes a reduction due to the financial failure of the primary insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Continental argues that the reduction of the limit of the underlying coverage must refer only to a reduction due to payment of a loss or losses. Its excess policy required the insured to maintain the policies listed in the schedule of underlying insurance (or other policies no more restrictive) during the pendency of the policy \u201cexcept for any reduction of the aggregate limits of liability in the underlying insurance because of injury or destruction.\u201d In this policy language the cause of the reduction in the aggregate limits of liability is stated, namely, losses paid by the appropriate primary insurance. On the other hand, as noted above, when stating that the excess policy drops down to become excess of any reduced limit of liability, the policy does not restrict or define the causes of the reduction. The difference in the language concerning reduction of coverage is fatal to Continental\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">A number of cases have held that, if an excess policy says it will drop down when there has been a reduction or exhaustion in the primary coverage due to the payment of losses, the excess policy does not drop down when the primary coverage is reduced or exhausted due to the insolvency of the primary insurer. <em>See Mission Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Duke Transp. Co., </em>792 F.2d 550, 553 (5th Cir. 1986); <em>Molina </em>v. <em>United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>574 F.2d 1176, 1178 (4th Cir. 1978); <em>Prince Carpentry, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cosmopolitan Mut. Ins. Co., </em>124 Misc. 2d 919, 930 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1984); <em>Guaranty Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bayside Resort, Inc., </em>635 F. Supp. 1456, 1459 (D.V.I. 1986). The implication of these cases is that, as we hold, an excess policy that says without limitation that it drops down when the underlying coverage is reduced provides first dollar coverage when the primary insurer becomes insolvent and unable to make any payment on a claim. See <em>Fageol Truck &amp; Coach Co. </em>v. <em>Pacific </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>Indent. Co., </em>18 Cal. 2d 748, 751-752 (1941) (coverage drops down on insolvency of primary insurer because primary coverage was \u201cexhausted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\"> We need not decide whether the motion judge was correct in concluding that the words \u201capplicable limits of liability\u201d were ambiguous and thus permitted the word \u201capplicable\u201d to mean \u201ccollectible\u201d at the time of judgment. We do consider the question in the context of a different policy in <em>Gulezian </em>v. <em>Lincoln Ins. Co., supra </em>at 608-612.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">If an excess policy provides that underlying coverage has to be collectible or recoverable at the time of judgment, the lower limit of the excess coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>drops down if the primary insurer becomes insolvent.

There is no need to rely on that concept in this case where the policy is conspicuously ambiguous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b618-5\">O\u2019Connor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGz\">(dissenting). Reserve\u2019s limits of liability stated in the schedule of underlying insurance attached to Continental\u2019s policy are $300,000 per occurrence and $300,000 in the aggregate. Thus, it is clear from the schedule that any payment made by Reserve on account of a loss sustained by its insured reduces Reserve\u2019s maximum indebtedness to its insured on account of subsequent losses. The resulting limit of liability for subsequent losses would be less than $300,000, although the new reduced limit would not appear on the schedule. Thus, in the event of a prior indemnity payment by Reserve, Continental\u2019s promise to \u201cindemnify the insured for loss in excess of the total applicable limits of liability of underlying insurance <em>stated in the </em>schedule\u201d (emphasis added) would leave the insured unprotected to the extent of a new occurrence resulting in a loss that exceeds the reduced limit of Reserve\u2019s coverage but is less than the $300,000 stated in the schedule as Reserve\u2019s per occurrence limit of liability. To plug that gap, the policy provides that \u201cif the applicable limit of liability of the underlying insurance is less than as stated in the schedule of underlying insurance because the aggregate limit of liability of the underlying insurance has been reduced this policy becomes excess of such reduced limit of liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The latter provision is not ambiguous. Nevertheless, the court concludes otherwise, and it bases its conclusion primarily on the following provision focusing on the insured\u2019s promise to maintain underlying insurance at certain levels of coverage: \u201cThe insured agrees that the policies listed in the schedule of underlying insurance . . . shall be maintained without alteration of terms or conditions in full effect during the currency of this policy except for any reduction of the aggregate limits of liability in the underlying insurance because of injury or destruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>tion.\u201d The latter provision specifically refers to reduction \u201cbecause of injury or destruction,\u201d while the provision setting forth Continental\u2019s promise to pay losses in excess of stated limits of liability as they may be reduced does not specifically refer to a cause or causes of reduction. From this, the court concludes that it is unclear whether Continental has promised to pay losses in excess of the underlying policy\u2019s stated limit of liability, reduced by causes other than \u201cinjury or destruction,\u201d including the underlying insurer\u2019s insolvency. In keeping with established principles, the court then resolves the perceived ambiguity in favor of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">But, there is no ambiguity. An underlying insurer\u2019s aggregate limit of liability cannot be reduced except by a prior payment. Even if it could be reduced in some other way, the one fact that is critical to the resolution of this case is that the aggregate limit of liability of an insurer <em>cannot </em>be reduced by insolvency. In the absence of special terms, not present here, the insolvency of an insurer, or that of any other debtor, does not affect the amount of its indebtedness. \u201cLiability\u201d is simply another word for indebtedness, and a limit of liability set forth in an insurance policy is but a ceiling on its indebtedness in the event of a loss incurred by its insured. The inability of an insurer to pay its debts does not extinguish them nor lower the ceiling on its indebtedness. Therefore, it cannot rightly be said that, because of Reserve\u2019s insolvency, \u201cthe applicable limit of liability of the underlying insurance is less than as stated in the schedule of underlying insurance because the aggregate limit of liability of the underlying insurance has been reduced.\u201d The aggregate limits of Reserve\u2019s liability simply were not reduced by Reserve\u2019s insolvency. Therefore, Continental\u2019s policy did not provide first dollar coverage to the insured. Nothing in <em>Fageol Truck &amp; Coach Co. </em>v. <em>Pacific Indent. Co., </em>18 Cal.2d 748, 751-752 (1941), cited by the court as supportive of its holding, suggests otherwise. Unlike the present case, the policy there did not provide coverage in excess of the limits of underlying insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The court does not consider whether the words \u201capplicable limits of liability\u201d are ambiguous, nor whether the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>\u201capplicable\u201d may be interpreted as meaning \u201ccollectible.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 599 note 2. The plaintiff argues that the word \u201capplicable\u201d may fairly be construed as meaning \u201ccapable of being applied\u201d at the appropriate time for payment, and that, since no money was collectible from Reserve at that time, the limit of liability capable of being applied (applicable) was zero. That argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The word \u201capplicable,\u201d modifying the words \u201climits of liability of underlying insurance,\u201d simply and unambiguously distinguishes the limits of liability stated in the underlying policy covering the loss from the limits of liability contained in irrelevant underlying policies. Since the insured\u2019s loss in this case arose out of a claimant\u2019s falling down on its premises, Reserve\u2019s general liability policy, including its limit of liability, covered the loss, that is, it was capable of being applied. On the other hand, use of the word \u201ccollectible\u201d to modify \u201climits of liability\u201d would make no sense. Limits of liability, that is, ceilings placed on obligations, simply are not collectible. Money is collectible, but rights and duties and limits thereon, since they cannot be gathered or received, are not \u201ccollectible\u201d as that word is commonly understood. Collectibility of the underlying insurance proceeds, therefore, has nothing to do with establishing the \u201capplicable limits of liability of underlying insurance.\u201d It follows that the applicable limits of liability in this case were $300,000, and not zero dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The court disclaims reliance on \u201cthe concept of an insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations as a possible guide to the determination of an insured\u2019s rights under an insurance policy. See <em>Home Indem. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Merchants Distribs., Inc., </em>396 Mass. 103, 107 (1985), and cases cited.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 600, n.4. Nevertheless, the court states that, \u201cif a reasonable policyholder thought about the subject at all, it probably would have assumed that the excess insurer would step into the void whenever, for whatever reason, the primary insurance company could not or would not meet its policy obligations.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 600-601. I do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">As I have attempted to show, there is nothing in Continental\u2019s policy that even suggests an undertaking by Continental to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>protect the insured from the risk of an underlying insurer\u2019s insolvency. Furthermore, there has been no showing that the \u201cstructure, content, manner of printing of the [insurance contract], or the methods and practices of marketing . . . creat[ed] reasonable expectations of a [greater area] of coverage\u201d than is set forth in the unambiguous provisions of Continental\u2019s policy which are discussed in the court\u2019s opinion and in mine. <em>Jefferson Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 472, 477 (1987), quoting <em>Davenport Peters Co. </em>v. <em>Royal Globe Ins. Co., </em>490 F. Supp. 286, 291-292 (D.
