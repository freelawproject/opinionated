The complaint charged rape based upon the digital penetration of a five year old victim. A judge in the District Court dismissed the complaint on the defendant\u2019s motion. The defendant argued that a child under fourteen is conclusively presumed incapable of committing rape and that, in any event, a decision not to follow the rule could not constitutionally be applied ex post facto to this case. We granted an application for direct appellate review and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">1. Under English common law, a child under the age of fourteen was conclusively presumed incapable of committing rape. <em>See Commonwealth v. Green, </em>2 Pick. <em>380 (1824); Regina </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>2 Q.B. 600, 601 (1892). See also J.R. Nolan, Criminal Law \u00a7 646, at 470 (1976); 3 C. Torc\u00eda, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 286, at 24 (14th ed. 1980). Though the origins of the presumption are unclear, the rationale most often stated is that males in' England seldom reached puberty before age fourteen and that a boy who was not sexually mature could not commit the common law crime of rape. See, e.g., 3 C. Torc\u00eda, <em>supra </em>at 25. Another rationale recognized as a possible explanation for the rule\u2019s origin is that, since the crime of rape at common law was a capital offense, judges were reluctant to hang one so young for this crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The majority of jurisdictions in this country have rejected the common law presumption as it was applied in England, and instead have adopted the rule as a rebuttable presumption. See 3 C. Torcia, <em>supra; </em>Annot., 23 A.L.R.3d 1351, 1359 (1969), and cases cited therein. We have never directly decided the question whether the rule applied in the Commonwealth. While this court discussed the rule in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>the court held the rule inapplicable to the lesser offense of assault with intent to rape. Any reference to the rule, therefore, was not essential to any issue before the court. However, we need not consider the continuing validity of the rule as we consider it inapplicable on the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The common law presumption regarding the capacity of a person to commit rape is necessarily limited to the crime as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>was defined at common law; i.e., \u201cthe penetration of the female sex organ by the male sex organ, with or without emission.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 584 (1977). The defendant here is not charged with rape as defined at common law, but rather with conduct that falls within the proscriptive phrase \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse.\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, as appearing in St. 1974, c. 474, \u00a7 2 (defining rape to include \u201csexual intercourse <em>or </em>unnatural sexual intercourse\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, supra </em>at 584 (definition of \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d includes fellatio, cunnilingus, \u201cand other intrusions of a part of a person\u2019s body . . . into the genital or anal opening of another person\u2019s body\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 708 (1977) (penetration of the female sex organ by a finger constitutes \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d). Since the act upon which the rape charge is based did not constitute rape at common law the presumption can have no application here. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s sexual maturity no longer has any rational connection to his capacity to commit the crime. Thus, we conclude that, whatever may be the rule on other facts, the common law presumption is irrelevant and does not apply where the defendant\u2019s sexual maturity has no relation to his capacity or ability to commit the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">2. The defendant also contends that any abrogation of the common law presumption must be done prospectively. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Of paramount importance in determining the application of our decision is the fact that the common law rule has never been applied to the conduct described here; there is no \u201cold rule\u201d which applies to this case. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>381 Mass. 411, 418 (1980), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>450 U.S. 929 (1981) (abandoning the \u201cyear and a day\u201d rule which formerly precluded prosecution for homicide if the victim survived more than one year past the crime). Unlike the situation confronting the <em>Lewis </em>court, it cannot be said \u201cwith confidence\u201d that the presumption at issue here has become part of the \u201claw of the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415. In fact, the principal case relied on by the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>criticizes the rule as being \u201cartificial.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Green, <em>supra </em>at 382. Finally, we note that this court cast doubt on the viability of the common law presumption. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra </em>at 418 n.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the common law presumption deeming a child under fourteen incapable of committing rape is inapplicable to the case at bar and order the charge against the defendant reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
