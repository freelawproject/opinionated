The Appeals Court affirmed the conviction. 22 Mass. App. Ct. 977 (1986). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">The defendant and a male friend were driving around Salem and Beverly in the defendant\u2019s car on the evening of April 1, 1982. They stopped at a liquor store, where they met the alleged victim (victim), then age seventeen, and her female friend, then age fifteen. The defendant agreed to purchase some vodka for them, and also purchased some beer for himself and his friend. The four then drove in the defendant\u2019s car to several locations, while conversing and drinking. After a period of time, the defendant\u2019s male friend separated from the group. Later in the evening, the defendant drove to the home of the victim\u2019s female friend. The defendant and the victim remained in the defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">From this point, the victim and the defendant related different accounts. The victim testified that the defendant offered to drive her home, but claimed he first needed to get gasoline. The defendant drove past a gas station, claimed it was closed, and drove toward \u201cThe Willows,\u201d a Salem amusement park where the four had previously parked that evening to drink and \u201cparty.\u201d The victim testified that the defendant parked in a dark area behind a building. Without saying anything, the defendant \u201cjumped on\u201d her, pulling at her clothes and holding her down. The victim \u201c[sjtarted screaming,\u201d hitting the defendant in the face and on the arms, and pulling his hair. The defendant bent the victim\u2019s fingers back to halt her struggle, and had sexual intercourse with her despite her resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The victim left the automobile. Once outside the defendant\u2019s car, the victim testified, she hid in a trash barrel and then in some bushes until the defendant drove away. She then walked across a bridge toward a bar, which was closed. While she was walking, the defendant drove up, stopped, and offered her a ride, saying he was sorry. The victim refused, and ran to a doughnut shop, where she called both her sister and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>female friend she had been with earlier in the evening, and told both that she had been raped.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">The Salem police took the victim to the emergency room at Salem Hospital. The attending nurse testified that the victim\u2019s makeup was smudged, her hair was out of place, and there were bluish marks and dirt on her face. In addition, one of the the victim\u2019s fingers was swollen, there was a small laceration on the left side of her nose, finger markings on the inside of her left thigh, and an abrasion in her vagina. A chemist employed by the laboratory of the Department of Public Safety testified that blood was found on the victim\u2019s socks and on the seat and crotch of her pants, as well as on the seat of the defendant\u2019s car. Seminal fluid and sperm cells were detected on the vaginal smears taken from the victim. The chemist testified that no attempt was made to determine blood groupings of the donor because the laboratory was not equipped to perform this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The police went to the defendant\u2019s house with an arrest warrant at approximately 3 a.m. on April 3, 1982. When the defendant came to the door, the police noticed scratches along his neck and face and a bandage on his right arm. The defendant told the police that the scratches were the result of a fight with his girl friend, and that he had burned his arm. Although the police took a photograph of the defendant, it was not introduced in evidence. In addition to finding the bloodstain on the seat of the defendant\u2019s car, the police found hair barrettes belonging to the victim in the crevice of the front passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The defendant, who testified at trial, recounted a different version of what happened that evening. The defendant testified that the victim persuaded him to drive around more after they had dropped off her friend. The defendant stated that they stopped to get gasoline, and then drove toward The Willows, where the victim asked him to stop so that she could \u201cgo to the bathroom.\u201d He pulled over, began talking with the victim, who had remained in the car, and they began kissing and \u201cpetting.\u201d The victim interrupted to leave the car to remove her tampon, and then returned to the car, and they continued kissing. Both of them began to take off the victim\u2019s clothes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>According to the defendant, the victim became frightened, and said \u201cshe didn\u2019t want to go through with it.\u201d The defendant testified that he, without using physical force, tried for several minutes to persuade the victim to have sex with him. The victim said no, and then bit him in the arm hard enough to draw blood. The defendant testified that the victim said no a second time, at which point he sat back in his own seat. The defendant denied having engaged in intercourse with the victim. He stated that the victim requested that he drop her off at the bar rather than take her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">1. In closing argument, defense counsel asked the jury to consider why the Commonwealth had not introduced in evidence a postarrest photograph of the defendant to corroborate the testimony that he had scratches on his face. In addition, defense counsel noted the inconclusiveness of the scientific tests that were performed, and questioned why the Commonwealth had not sought the defendant\u2019s clothes as evidence. On two separate occasions during the closing argument, the judge interrupted the argument to instruct the jury that the \u201conly comments counsel ought to make . . . [regard] what was in fact in evidence. What was not in evidence is not for the consideration of the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Within the bounds of the evidence and the fair inferences from the evidence, great latitude should be permitted to counsel in argument. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pettie, </em>363 Mass. 836, 840 (1973), and cases cited. Evidence of the alleged inadequacies of the police investigation and the failure to perform scientific tests is relevant and admissible at trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>378 Mass. 296, 308 (1979). Counsel may suggest inferences which the jury may draw from the evidence, and the judge should not \u201cinvade the province of the jury to decide what inferences to draw from certain evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 486 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">In this case, defense counsel argued that the Commonwealth had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had raped the victim. Defense counsel\u2019s arguments were within the range of fair inferences from the evidence. \u201cThe fact that certain tests were not conducted or certain police procedures not followed could raise a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt in the minds of the jurors.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>The judge twice interrupted defense counsel\u2019s closing argument to instruct the jury that they were to consider only the \u201cevidence introduced in fact in this case.\u201d Not only did the judge prevent defense counsel from pursuing a permissible line of argument, but he also in effect invaded \u201cthe province of the jury to decide what inferences to draw from certain evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defense counsel objected to the judge\u2019s instructions. In addition, the judge interrupted defense counsel\u2019s argument and, in effect, instructed the jury to disregard defense counsel\u2019s immediately preceding argument. In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the judge committed error requiring that the defendant be given a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">2. Because it is likely to recur at a new trial, we address the defendant\u2019s contention that the judge erred in declining to instruct the jury on assault and battery as a lesser included offense to the crime of rape. We conclude that the evidence warranted an instruction on assault and battery, and that the judge should have given the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">\u201c \u2018A judge is required to charge the jury concerning lesser included offenses if the evidence provides a rational basis for acquitting the defendant of the crime charged and convicting him of the lesser included offense.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santo, </em>375 Mass. 299, 305 (1978). In determining whether any view of the evidence would support a conviction on a lesser included offense, \u2018all reasonable inferences must be resolved in favor of the defendant,\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanderpool, </em>367 Mass. 743, 746 (1975).\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egerton, </em>396 Mass. 499, 503 (1986). We have stated that a defendant may be convicted of assault and battery on an indictment charging rape. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>379 Mass. 557, 562 (1980), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">The evidence in this case provides a rational basis for convicting the defendant of assault and battery. The defendant\u2019s version of the events is not an alibi. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egerton, supra </em>at 504. The defendant admits that he was with the victim, and that the victim resisted his advances., even to the point of biting the defendant\u2019s arm with enough force to draw blood. The jury could have believed portions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>testimony of both the victim and the defendant, finding that the assault and battery occurred, but that the defendant had never penetrated the victim. See <em>id. </em>at 505, citing <em>Lenn </em>v. <em>Rich\u00e9, </em>331 Mass. 104, 111 (1954). The defendant attempted to support this interpretation by pointing out the failure of the police to conduct further tests on the seminal fluid found in the victim and to find evidence on the defendant\u2019s clothes.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the defendant\u2019s version of the events would not support a conviction of assault and battery because he denied having committed any unconsented-to touching. The jury were not, however, obligated to accept one witness\u2019s version in its entirety. Whether a charge is required depends on, whether, viewed as a whole, there is \u201csome evidence on the element differentiating the greater and lesser offenses.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egerton, supra </em>at 505. We decline to conclude, as the Commonwealth urges, that a defendant is required to admit to facts sufficient to convict him of the lesser crime to be entitled to an instruction on a lesser included offense. Finally, the evidence at trial was consistent with assault and battery, and not only indecent assault and battery. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>385 Mass. 863, 871-872 (1982). There was evidence from which the jury could have found simple assault and battery but no unconsented-to \u201ctouching of portions of the anatomy commonly thought private.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 234, 238 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">3. In conclusion, the judgment is reversed, the verdict is set aside, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-5\"> The following exchange occurred during defense counsel\u2019s closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">Defense counsel: \u201cNow [the prosecutor] also introduced an array of quite a bit of physical evidence. You\u2019re going to have that evidence with you in the jury room and you\u2019re going to be able to examine that evidence. Now when you examine evidence there are two ways of looking at it. First, you can say, what have I been told, and examine that. Then you can also question what should have I been told? What should I expect from the evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">\u201cNow he brought in the chemist. She testified as to the result of her examination and materials that [the police officer] sent to her. They sent fingernail scrapings. [The victim] indicated that she fought wildly, that she scratched Mr. Gilmore. The officer indicated that he saw scratches on Mr. Gilmore\u2019s neck. Now they took a photograph of Mr. Gilmore when he was arrested, but that wasn\u2019t introduced to you, so you don\u2019t know whether there are any scratches in that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-8\">The prosecutor: \u201cObjection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-9\">The judge: \u201cThe jury will be instructed later. This is only comments counsel ought to make, it\u2019s what was in fact in evidence. What was not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>evidence is not for the consideration of the jury. The jury may make considerations based only on the evidence that was introduced in the case and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from that evidence. You may continue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMt\">Defense counsel: \u201cThe Commonwealth offered fingernail scrapings. The fingernail scrapings showed nothing. The Commonwealth offered pubic hair combings. The pubic hair combings showed nothing. The Commonwealth offered that there was evidence of semen on one of the slides, I believe the exhibit says. Regarding that, the young lady testified that Mr. Gilmore forced himself on her, that Mr. Gilmore penetrated her. Her first response when asked by [the prosecutor] was, he tried to; her second response to [the prosecutor] \u2014 go a little bit further \u2014 was, yes, he penetrated and it hurt. And it seemed like a very brief interlude, but there was no testimony of ejaculation by Mr. Gilmore either by the girl or telling the officer or telling the nurse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">\u201cNow the Commonwealth also did not offer, or there is no proof of any search for Mr. Gilmore\u2019s clothes, or any articles that Mr. Gilmore owned that would place him doing what the Commonwealth says. You\u2019d think that they would look for a pair of pants, underpants, something like this, that would have the tell-tale sign that would absolutely lock him into doing what the Commonwealth said he did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">The judge: \u201cThe only evidence for the jury to consider would be evidence introduced in fact in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">Defense counsel: \u201cI object.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">The judge: \u201cWell your objection is noted.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
