L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (hereafter \u00a7 2B); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>and, if not, whether the statute is unconstitutional because it is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States or art. 11 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">These questions come to us on a scanty record, comprised largely of the pleadings. Nonetheless, the following facts are not disputed. On November 18,1980, fire ravaged an apartment at 120 Ironside Way in Charlestown, the residence of Patricia Dighton and her family. As a result of that fire, death came to Dighton\u2019s foster children, James Abbott and Casandra Chiminello. Dighton and her two sons were injured as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Three years later, Dighton and her sons brought suit in Suffolk Superior Court against Federal Pacific, alleging negligence and breach of warranty with respect to a circuit breaker manufactured by the defendant and \u201clocated on the premises\u201d where the fire occurred. On the same date, a similar action for wrongful death was brought against Federal Pacific by Leslie W. Abbott and Richard Stafford, acting in their respective capacities as administrators of the estates of James Abbott and Casandra Chiminello. On a motion by Federal Pacific, these actions were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">In 1985, the judge permitted Federal Pacific to implead several third-party defendants as to both actions. Among these was the architectural firm which had designed the building, Sert, Jackson &amp; Associates, Incorporated (Sert Jackson).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>1986, the judge granted Sert Jackson\u2019s motion to dismiss Federal Pacific\u2019s third-party complaint because Sert Jackson could be liable for contribution only if it could be directly liable to the plaintiffs, see <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Westerlind, </em>374 Mass. 524 (1978), and because any direct claims by the plaintiffs against Sert Jackson were barred by \u00a7 2B. Separate and final judgment was entered for Sert Jackson, and Federal Pacific appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">At the time he granted Sert Jackson\u2019s motion, the judge also denied a motion by Federal Pacific under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Federal Pacific claimed the protection of \u00a7 2B, arguing that, as one similarly situated to architects, it was entitled to the same statutory protection under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, as Sert Jackson. Federal Pacific had conceded in its memorandum, however, that its status was solely that of \u201ca supplier and a manufacturer of a construction component\u201d; the judge noted as well that the defendant did not claim to have rendered any \u201cconstruction services.\u201d Relying on what was said about the intended scope of \u00a7 2B in <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>386 Mass. 701 (1982), the judge ruled that Federal Pacific, \u201cas a supplier, does not fall within the statutory class envisioned by the legislature.\u201d Relying on what was said in <em>Milligan </em>v. <em>Tibbetts Eng\u2019 g Corp., </em>391 Mass. 364 (1984), the judge held that Federal Pacific\u2019s circuit breaker panel \u201cdid not constitute [an] . . . improvement to real property\u201d under \u00a7 2B because it was neither \u201cpermanent\u201d nor \u201cintimately connected with the real property.\u201d The judge then exercised his discretion pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974), and reported to the Appeals Court the following questions of law: \u201c1. Under G. L. c. 260 \u00a7 2B is a manufacturer who supplies a construction component that becomes an integral part of structure within the class of entities involved in \u2018the design, planning, construction or general administration of an improvement to real property\u2019? 2. Do the acts of designing, manufacturing and supplying a circuit breaker panel that subsequently becomes an integral part of a structure constitute an \u2018improvement to real property\u2019 within the meaning of G. L. c. 260 \u00a7 2B?\u201d The Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Court granted a motion by Federal Pacific to consolidate the judge\u2019s reports and its appeals of his orders dismissing the third-party actions against Sert Jackson. We granted Federal Pacific\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Federal Pacific advances several arguments in support of its contention that the judge erred by dismissing its third-party complaint against Sert Jackson. It also argues, with respect to the court\u2019s denial of its own motion to dismiss, that we should adopt one of two alternative positions: (a) that the judge should have construed \u00a7 2B to include Federal Pacific within its protective ambit; or (b) that the judge construed \u00a7 2B correctly, but that such a construction renders \u00a7 2B unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, with the result that the judge\u2019s order dismissing Federal Pacific\u2019s claims against Sert Jackson must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">We hold that dismissal was properly ordered as to Sert Jackson. We further hold that the judge properly denied Federal Pacific\u2019s motion to dismiss. We answer both of the reported questions in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">1. <em>Dismissal of the third-party complaint. </em>Federal Pacific argues that \u00a7 2B does not apply to its third-party action for contribution because \u00a7 2B, by its terms, only bars any \u201c [ajctions of tort.\u201d Contribution is available, however, only \u201cwhere two or more persons become jointly liable <em>in </em>tort\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 231B, \u00a7 1 <em>(a), </em>inserted by St. 1962, c. 730, \u00a7 1. The right to contribution is derivative of the joint liability in tort of the third-party plaintiff and the third-party defendant. See generally <em>O\u2019Mara </em>v. <em>H.P. Hood &amp; Sons, </em>359 Mass. 235, 238 (1971), and cases cited. See also <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Westerlind, supra. </em>Without liability in tort, there is no right to contribution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>James Ferrera &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Samuels, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 170, 174 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Federal Pacific claims, in addition, that since \u201c \u2018misuse\u2019 of a product by an architect\u201d is alleged in the third-party complaint, it is not barred by the language of \u00a7 2B. \u201cMisuse,\u201d however, is clearly encompassed within the statutory reference to \u201ca\u00aby <em>deficiency </em>or neglect in the design, planning, construction or general administration of an improvement to real property\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Federal Pacific cites, as authority for its contention, our statement that \u201c[a]n action for contribution is not barred if, <em>at the time the tortious activity occurred, </em>the party from whom contribution is sought could have been held liable in tort\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>397 Mass. 775, 781 (1986). <em>McGrath </em>is inapposite. In that decision, we considered the effect on the third-party plaintiffs\u2019 rights to contribution from a public entity where primary plaintiffs were barred from suing the public entity directly, due to the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to make timely presentment as required by the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 4 (1984 ed.). In those circumstances, we held that c. 258 did not require dismissal of the third-party complaint because, by its explicit language, \u201c[t]he Legislature simply created an exemption from the notice provisions of \u00a7 4 for all third-party claims regardless of whether presentment had been made by the party originating the action.\u201d <em>McGrath, supra </em>at 780.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No analogous exemption appears in \u00a7 2B to suggest a legislative intent to permit third-party actions that would otherwise be prohibited by \u00a7 2B.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Federal Pacific also maintains that, because its liability may result solely from the architect\u2019s negligence, denial of the right to seek contribution is violative of art. 11 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. What was said of the plaintiff in <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>386 Mass. 701 (1982), may be said of Federal Pacific as third-party plaintiff here: \u201cWe agree . . . that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, does abolish [the] cause of action against [Sert Jackson] without providing an alternative remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 711. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>But while art. 11 guarantees the right to \u201ca certain remedy, by having recourse to the laws, for all injuries or wrongs,\u201d Federal Pacific does not claim that \u00a7 2B operates to deny it any fundamental right, nor any right against Sert Jackson that vested prior to the enactment of \u00a7 2B. In these circumstances, there is no escape from our prior holding that application of \u00a7 2B does not violate art. 11. <em>Id. </em>at 711-713.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">The judge did not err in mling that \u00a7 2B applied to Sert Jackson\u2019s motion for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">2. <em>Construction and constitutionality of \u00a7 2B. </em>While Federal Pacific acknowledges that we recently have held to the contrary, see <em>Klein, supra, </em>it urges us either to construe \u00a7 2B as including it within the class of protected defendants, or to declare that the statute violates the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment for its failure to protect suppliers whose situations are similar to those of protected architects, construction engineers, and contractors. For the reasons stated in our <em>Klein </em>decision, we continue to hold that \u00a7 2B is constitutional even if construed to exclude \u201csuppliers, owners, tenants, and others in possession or control\u201d but not \u201carchitects, engineers, contractors and others involved in the design, planning, construction, or general administration of improvements to real property.\u201d <em>Klein, supra </em>at 715, 717.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>We consider the questions reported. The judge has framed the single question, whether Federal Pacific is entitled to the protection of \u00a7 2B, in bipartite form, asking first whether Federal Pacific, as a supplier of construction components, is an <em>actor </em>comprehended by \u00a7 2B, and then asking whether its <em>acts </em>\u2014 designing, manufacturing, and supplying a circuit breaker panel \u2014 are comprehended within the statutory reference to \u201cdesign, planning, construction or general administration of an improvement to real property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">On its face, \u00a7 2B defines the protected actor largely by reference to protected acts. The body of \u00a7 2B names no class of protected actors. Rather, its terms extend protection to persons allegedly responsible for acts, i.e., those who commit \u201cany deficiency or neglect in the design, planning, construction, or general administration of an improvement to real property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">\u201cOur task is to interpret the statute \u2018according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated. \u2019 <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364 (1975), quoting <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934).\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 482, 487-488 (1984).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>On the same day we decided <em>Klein, </em>we remanded a similar case where \u201cit [was] not clear whether [the defendants] were materialmen, whether they rendered architectural or engineering services for the construction of the building ... or whether they furnished both supplies and engineering or architectural services.\u201d <em>King\u2019s Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Poley-Abrams Corp., </em>386 Mass. 1008, 1009 (1982). We indicated, \u201c[t]o the extent that these defendants are materialmen, they are not within the protection of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Just as clearly, any conclusion that Federal Pacific was merely a materialman (and therefore a nonprotected actor) requires a finding that Federal Pacific had not performed protected acts, i.e., that Federal Pacific had not \u201crendered architectural or engineering services for the construction of the building.\u201d Conversely, when faced with cases in which the defendants were protected by \u00a7 2B, see <em>Anthoney\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crandall Dry Dock Eng\u2019rs, Inc., </em>396 Mass. 818 (1986); <em>Milligan </em>v. <em>Tibbetts Eng\u2019g Corp., </em>391 Mass. 364 (1984); <em>Raffel </em>v. <em>Perley, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 242 (1982), the courts of this Commonwealth have focused their inquiry on whether the acts alleged to have caused injury were performed with respect to \u201cimprovement to real estate.\u201d See <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc., supra </em>at 823 n.8; <em>Milligan, supra </em>at 366-368; <em>Raffel, supra </em>at 243-245.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Because \u201cthe inspection, supervision and observation of construction by architects and contractors involves <em>individual expertise </em>not susceptible of the quality control standards of the factory\u201d (emphasis supplied), <em>Burmaster </em>v. <em>Gravity Drainage Dist. No. 2 of the Parish of St. Charles, </em>366 So. 2d 1381, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>1386 (La. 1978), we think that the Legislature, by enacting \u00a7 2B, meant to protect providers of \u201cindividual expertise\u201d in the business of designing, planning, constructing, and administering improvements to real estate. We reiterate that \u00a7 2B was intended not to apply to mere suppliers of standardized products, but only to the kinds of economic actors who perform acts of \u201cindividual expertise\u201d akin to those commonly thought to be performed by architects and contractors \u2014 that is to say, to parties who render particularized services for the design and construction of particular improvements to particular pieces of real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Federal Pacific does not claim to have rendered any such particularized services with respect to design or construction of the building which burned. Thus, it clearly falls outside that class of economic actors which \u00a7 2B was intended to protect. In this regard, however, Federal Pacific argues that, because it designed, manufactured, and supplied a component which became affixed to real property, it was involved sufficiently in acts relating to an \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d for us to hold that the Legislature intended it to benefit from the protection of \u00a7 2B. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">To begin, we note that \u201c[t]he statute does not define \u2018improvement, \u2019 <em>\"Raffel, supra </em>at 243, and \u201c[t]he legislative history of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, does not indicate precisely what the Legislature meant the term to encompass.\u201d <em>Milligan, supra </em>at 366. Federal Pacific invites us to make the scope of \u00a7 2B dependent on the common law of \u201cfixtures.\u201d But \u00a7 2B makes no reference to \u201cfixtures, \u201d nor does it appear that the Legislature intended, by its choice of the common term \u201cimprovement,\u201d to subsume that tangle of highly technical meanings, often distinct in diverse legal contexts, which is the law of fixtures. We align ourselves with \u201c[t]he overwhelming majority of courts [which] have eschewed a rigid fixture analysis . . . .\u201d Heller, The District of Columbia\u2019s Architects\u2019 and Builders\u2019 Statute of Repose: Its Application and Need for Amendment, 34 Cath. U.L. Rev. 919, 932 (1985).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Federal Pacific also argues that it should be protected by \u00a7 2B because, when incorporated into the building that was burned, its circuit breaker panel constituted an \u201cimprovement\u201d within the definition of that term which appears in Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 1138 (1971).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Admittedly, we have said that it is not \u201cout of place\u201d to consider Webster\u2019s definition, <em>Milligan, supra </em>at 368. Accord <em>Raffel, supra </em>at 245. See also <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc., supra </em>at 823 n.8. In none of those cases, however, was the defendants\u2019 status as a protected actor in doubt. Where the actor is clearly within the statute, as an architect or a construction engineer, the use of a broad definition such as Webster\u2019s is apt to give full scope to the remedial purposes of \u00a7 2B when divining whether the allegedly tortious act is also within the statute. Here, however, we are urged to use that definition for a different purpose \u2014 to decide which actors were intended to be comprehended by \u00a7 2B. The utility of the definition is doubtful in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">For example, if a piece of metal sculpture were welded to an exposed girder in a building, it certainly could be characterized as \u201ca permanent addition to or betterment of\u2019 the property, one \u201cenhancing] its capital value,\u201d one \u201cinvolving] the expenditure of labor or money,\u201d one \u201cdesigned to make the property more . . . valuable,\u201d and one clearly \u201cdistinguish[able] from ordinary repairs.\u201d But would that tell us whether, or to what extent, the sculptor had been involved in the protected <em>activity </em>of \u201cimprovement to real property?\u201d We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>think not. If he produced the sculpture on commission by the developer to specifications provided in part by the architect and the engineer, we might conclude that he is protected by \u00a7 2B; but if he mass-produced the sculpture and sold it for use in a variety of contexts, or for incorporation into any building, we would conclude that he had been involved merely in the activity of producing and selling a fungible commodity, and not in the activity of improving real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Thus, the fact that a producer\u2019s product may be usable by persons involved in protected acts tells us nothing about whether the producer\u2019s activity is protected, even though the product may fit within Webster\u2019s definition of an \u201cimprovement.\u201d That the use involves affixation to real property is likewise of no consequence, nor is the permanence of the fixation.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">We are led by our analysis to agree with the plaintiffs, that Federal Pacific can best be described as a producer and seller of \u201cgoods,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the limits of its liability are governed by G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-318, not by \u00a7 2B. To be sure, the goods sold were usable in what became an improvement to real property, i.e., construction of the building, but the activity of designing, producing, and marketing those goods was no more involved in the protected activity of improving real property than would be Sert Jackson\u2019s activity of designing hammers, should the latter undertake to do so. Thus, we conclude that the Legislature intended tort actions arising from such activity to be governed by provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and not by \u00a7 2B.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">This conclusion is further supported by our realization that, when \u00a7 2B was enacted in 1968, the liability of manufacturers and suppliers for injuries caused by the failures of their products was already encompassed to a certain extent within the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Laws. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 2-314 and 2-318 (impliedwarranty of merchantability actionable in limited circumstances, absent privity of contract).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Actions based upon these laws were also governed by an existing statute of limitations. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-725 (1984 ed.). We assume, of course, that the Legislature was aware of these provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code when it enacted \u00a7 2B. <em>See Hadley </em>v. <em>Amherst, </em>372 Mass. 46, 51 (1977). We are mindful, as well, that we cannot construe \u00a7 2B to have repealed, or superseded, these provisions, even in part, unless we find in \u00a7 2B \u201cexpress words\u201d or a \u201cclear implication\u201d to that effect. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Price, </em>273 Mass. 303, 309 (1930). We find neither. Both reported questions are answered, \u201cNo,\u201d and the judgments of dismissal are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b704-14\">General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 2B, inserted by St. 1968, c. 612, and amended by St. 1973, c. 777, \u00a7 2, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2I\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>\u201cActions of tort for damages arising out of any deficiency or neglect in the design, planning, construction or general administration of an improvement to real property shall be commenced only within three years next after the cause of action accrues; provided, however, that in no event shall such actions be commenced more than six years after the performance or furnishing of such design, planning, construction or general administration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">The statute was further amended through St. 1984, c. 484, \u00a7 53, in ways not material to this case.

L. c. 258, \u00a7 4, is: \u201cThe provisions of this section shall not apply to such claims as may be asserted by third-party complaint, cross-claim or counterclaim.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b709-6\"> Federal Pacific also claims that the judge erred in permitting Sert Jackson to benefit from \u00a7 2B because \u201cit is unclear if c. 260 Section 2B is even, generally, founded upon a valid state or public interest as the statute may encourage a builder or architect to perform in a less than workmanlike manner, secure in the knowledge that he will be immune from liability after the passage of six years.\u201d Were we inclined to read between the lines of this cryptic comment, we might infer a challenge to the validity of \u00a7 2B under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Because this question is inadequately argued in Federal Pacific\u2019s brief, we will not address it. Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 919 (1975). We note, however, that we have held that \u00a7 2B does not violate Federal guarantees to due process. <em>Klein, supra </em>at 707-711.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\"> The equal protection arguments raised by Federal Pacific were fully aired and answered in <em>Klein. </em>Federal Pacific merely lists a number of bases upon which we held that the Legislature might conceivably have made a rational choice to protect a limited class of defendants; then it asserts that, because those particular bases apply equally to it, its situation is wholly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>indistinguishable from that of protected defendants. Federal Pacific ignores those bases alluded to in <em>Klein </em>which do not apply to it, e.g., the difficulties arising where \u201c[a]rchitectural plans may have been discarded, [or] copies of building codes in force at the time of construction may no longer be in existence.\u201d <em>Klein, supra </em>at 709-710. And it ignores the distinction drawn in <em>Klein </em>between the situations of builders and suppliers \u201cbecause they work under dissimilar conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 716. We see no reason to reconsider our holding on the constitutional question determined by <em>Klein.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\"> The legislative history of \u00a7 2B is replete with references to classes of actors, such as architects, engineers, contractors, and surveyors. See 1967 House Doc. No. 2603; 1967 House Doc. No. 4815; Report of the Legislative Research Council Relative to a Statute of Limitations for Malpractice Against Architects, Engineers and Surveyors, 1968 Senate Doc. No. 1050; 1968 Senate Doc. No. 339. None of these sources refers at all to problems of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>repose encountered by manufacturers or suppliers of construction components, although the problems anticipated by architects and engineers were understood to result from the decline of the \u201cprivity\u201d doctrine. See <em>Klein, supra </em>at 708 n.7; 1968 Senate Doc. No. 1050, at 16-17. However, the relevance of these sources is doubtful. \u201c[WJhere the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous, . . . legislative history is not ordinarily a proper source of construction.\u201d <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977). It is clear from the language of the statute, and our decisions, that \u00a7 2B does not apply to materialmen and suppliers. Any ambiguity that may arise in the application of \u00a7 2B arises only from the question whether a party acted as a materialman or supplier or as an architect, engineer, contractor, or surveyor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\"> The plaintiffs argue that the test should be that which the judge applied, one which asks whether the product alleged to have caused harm was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number><em>permanently </em>affixed to real property. This distinction gives rise to problems of line-drawing analogous to those encountered with respect to fixture analysis. For example, a circuit breaker panel may be intended by the installer to be as \u201cpermanent\u201d as a window or a shingle or a length of electrical wiring. However, like a window which breaks, or a shingle that wears out, or a wire that \u201cshorts,\u201d a circuit breaker panel is replaceable if need be; and, in that sense, none of these can be called \u201cpermanent\u201d in fact. Because we construe the scope of \u00a7 2B to turn on questions of fact not at issue here, we also reject the argument advanced by Kaiser Aluminum that summary judgment was granted prematurely in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b713-6\"> Webster\u2019s defines \u201cimprovement\u201d as: \u201c[A] permanent addition to or betterment of real property that enhances its capital value and that involves the expenditure of labor or money and is designed to make the property more useful or valuable as distinguished from ordinary repairs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b714-7\">It is indisputable that, at the moment when Federal Pacific\u2019s circuit breaker panel was \u201cidentified\u201d to its contract of sale for use in the subject building, that product was \u201cmovable\u201d and thus an item of commercial \u201cgoods\u201d within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-105 (1) (1984 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b714-8\"> See note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b715-6\"> Section 2-318 of c. 106 was first amended in 1971 to abolish entirely the requirement of privity of contract.

We express no opinion as to whether the plaintiffs\u2019 actions for breach of warranty, if not barred by \u00a7 2B, may nonetheless be barred by the privity requirements stated in the original version of \u00a7 2-318.
