L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> gives a town a right of subrogation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>against proceeds to be paid to a police officer (plaintiff) pursuant to the underinsured motor vehicle coverage (G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) provision of insurance policies purchased by the plaintiff, who had been injured while on duty, through no fault of his own, by an underinsured motorist. General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF, mandates that a town be reimbursed for any amounts paid under \u00a7 11 IF to the extent that the legal liability of a third party who has paid damages has yielded additional relief to the injured police officer. The principal issue presented by this appeal is whether the obligation of the plaintiff\u2019s own insurance company to make payments under the underinsured motorist provision constitutes a \u201clegal liability\u201d to pay \u201cdamages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">The facts are undisputed. On April 16, 1985, the plaintiff was driving a motorcycle in the performance of his duties as a West Springfield police officer. Through no fault of his own, the plaintiff was struck and injured by an automobile driven by Marie Thompson. His injuries prevented him from returning to active duty until May 5, 1986. The town, in accordance with G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF, paid his regular salary and medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The plaintiff commenced a civil action against Thompson which was settled with the consent of the town and the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>tiff\u2019s own insurance company. The plaintiff received $10,000 from Thompson\u2019s insurer, the liability limit under Thompson\u2019s policy. Pursuant to the statute, the town received as reimbursement, $6,598.40, the net proceeds after the deduction of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Prior to the accident, the plaintiff had purchased privately three motor vehicle insurance policies from United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company (USF&amp;G). These policies, which were in force when the accident occurred, obligated USF&amp;G to pay the plaintiff benefits for bodily injury caused by an underinsured motorist (Coverage U). The company is willing to pay these benefits to the plaintiff. The town, however, claims that it is entitled to the proceeds of these policies to the extent that it has or will pay compensation to the plaintiff as required by G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The plaintiff initiated this action seeking a declaration that the statute does not obligate him to turn over to the town the proceeds from these policies. The plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment. The judge ruled in favor of the plaintiff, and the town appealed. Because this case is one of first impression in Massachusetts, we granted the town\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The town claims that the phrase \u201clegal liability\u201d indicates that the Legislature intended to sweep broadly and to include within the statute\u2019s boundaries any individual or corporation who has a legal obligation to make payments to an injured officer. We do not accept this argument because it ignores the word \u201cdamages\u201d which clearly serves to qualify the liability of the third party. \u201cDamages is the word which expresses in dollars and cents the injury sustained by a plaintiff.\u201d <em>Berube </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Edgartown, </em>336 Mass. 634, 639 (1958), quoting <em>Turcotte </em>v. <em>DeWitt, </em>333 Mass. 389, 392 (1955). The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 12A (1965), defines \u201cdamages\u201d as \u201ca sum of money awarded to a person injured by the tort of another.\u201d Thus, we think it clear that the Legislature used \u201cdamages\u201d to denote the money payable by a tortfeasor who is liable for injuries caused by his tortious act. The statute only subrogates the town to the employee\u2019s rights against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>tortfeasor to the extent of the compensation the officer receives from the tortfeasor. \u201cA payment made in performance of a contractual obligation is not a payment of \u2018damages.\u2019 \u201d <em>State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Am. Ins. Co., </em>550 S.W.2d 554, 557 (Ky. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The facts in this case are somewhat similar to those presented to the Supreme Court of Minnesota in <em>Janzen </em>v. <em>Land O\u2019Lakes, Inc., </em>278 N.W.2d 67 (Minn. 1979), where an employee was fatally injured while driving his own automobile in the course of his employment. His wife received money as workmen\u2019s compensation. The decedent had private uninsured motorist coverage, and his insurer paid his wife a sum of money under that coverage. The employer sought subrogation as an offset against the compensation which the company had paid. The disputed statutory language centered , on the phrase \u201ccircumstances which created a legal .liability for damages.\u201d The court held that the presence, of \u201cdamages\u201d in the statute referred to tort liability and did \u201cnot include contract liability based on uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Moreover, the town is not a third-party beneficiary under the contract. The town claims that it qualifies for this status because it has incurred and will continue to incur \u201cdamages\u201d as a result of the accident. This argument is not tenable. First, the town\u2019s payments of the plaintiff\u2019s salary and medical bills are not \u201cdamages.\u201d Instead, they are more properly characterized as expenses. <em>Berube, supra </em>at 639-640. Second, it is illusory for the town to maintain that it is an intended beneficiary of the contractual payments promised by USF&amp;G to the plaintiff if he were involved in an accident with an under-insured motorist. The town has not established that the contracting parties intended the town to be a beneficiary of their contract. See <em>Flattery v. Gregory, </em>397 Mass. 143, 148-149 (1986). Indeed, the policy between the plaintiff and USF&amp;G expressly provides that no part of the proceeds obtained under Coverage U will \u201cbenefit any insurer or self-insurer under a workers\u2019 compensation law or <em>any similar law\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF, is such a \u201csimilar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The town \u201chas no third-party beneficiary rights in the contractual rights which [the plaintiff] bought and paid for.\u201d <em>Reliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Robertson, 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 735, 738 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Therefore, the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment was properly allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-14\"> General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 111F (1984 ed.), provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhenever a police officer'. . . of a . . . town ... is incapacitated for duty because of injury sustained in the performance of his duty without fault of his own ... he shall be granted leave without loss of pay for the period of such incapacity ....

Under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 69, police officers are expressly excluded from the Act\u2019s coverage. Hence, the need for G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F. Section 11 IF is not a \u201cpure\u201d workmen\u2019s compensation law, because, unlike G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 2, a police officer is not entitled to benefits merely because he was injured in the course of his employment: the officer must be injured through no fault of his own. This additional requirement is not sufficient to render the two laws dissimilar for the purposes of the policy language.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
