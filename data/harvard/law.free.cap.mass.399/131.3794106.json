The defendant moved in May, 1985, to exclude the presentation of psychiatric evidence, specifically, \u201cany evidence derived directly or indirectly from a psychiatric consultation between Children\u2019s Hospital staff, Dr. [Barbara] Burr and the defendant occurring on March 4, 1984.\u201d According to the defendant, she had consulted with Dr. Burr, a staff psychiatrist<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>at Children\u2019s Hospital in Boston, \u201cto assist her in dealing with the emotional problems as a result of her child\u2019s illness.\u201d A psychiatric report on that consultation was placed in the infant\u2019s medical file and was provided to the district attorney\u2019s office without the defendant\u2019s authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The defendant has maintained that disclosure of the report, or any information derived from the consultation, would violate her rights under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B (1984 ed.), which creates a privilege as to certain communications between a patient and a psychotherapist. Following an evidentiary hearing on January 16,1986, the motion judge entered an order on April 14, 1986, denying the defendant\u2019s motion. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1984 ed.), the defendant filed an application with this court seeking leave to appeal from the denial of her motion to exclude. A single justice of this court granted the application, and the case was transferred to the full court on April 30, 1986.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ay3\">The facts are as follows. The defendant\u2019s eleven month old son, admitted to Children\u2019s Hospital for \u201cfailure to thrive,\u201d was transferred to the medical intensive care unit when he became acutely ill with sodium chloride intoxication. The director of the hospital\u2019s emergency psychiatric services, a staff psychiatrist, asked Dr. Burr to speak with the defendant \u201cbecause of the emergency nature of the situation.\u201d Dr. Burr testified that she spoke to the defendant \u201cbecause it was perceived that this mother was in the midst of a crisis situation and it was the wish of the staff to see if there was anything further the hospital could offer by way of help or assistance to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">At the outset of her meeting with the defendant, Dr. Bun-introduced herself as a psychiatrist. Dr. Bun testified as fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>lows: \u201cI told [the defendant] that I understood that her baby was in critical condition; that I realized that that was probably very difficult for her; and I would be interested to [szc] hearing anything she had to tell me about her feelings about the situation; and whether there was something we could do to be helpful.\u201d Alone in a family room in the intensive care unit, they talked for approximately forty-five minutes. Dr. Burr obtained a brief history from the defendant; evaluated her \u201cmental status\u201d; and formed a clinical impression. She noted that the defendant\u2019s \u201caffect\u201d was somewhat inconsistent with her son\u2019s life-threatening situation. The history and assessment was reported on a three-page consultation request/report form, together with a \u201cplan\u201d for continued psychiatric and social services.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The judge entered an order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to exclude presentation of psychiatric evidence, based on the following findings and conclusions. \u201cThe Court finds that the defendant was not a \u2018patient\u2019 as defined by General Laws, Chapter 233, Section 20 B in that the consultation was not during the course of diagnosis or treatment. There was no diagnosis or treatment. Assuming arguendo, [the defendant] was a patient, it is problematical whether Dr. Burr would qualify under definition of \u2018psychotherapist\u2019 under General Laws, Chapter 233, Section 20B. Any \u2018communications\u2019 between Dr. Burr and [the defendant] were not relative to diagnosis or treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">A judge\u2019s findings of fact must stand unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Accaputo, </em>380 Mass. 435, 448 n.18 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moynihan, </em>376 Mass. 468, 473 (1978). The ultimate legal conclusions to be drawn from the subsidiary findings of fact, however, are matters for review by this court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hosey, </em>368 Mass. 571, 574-575 n.1 (1975). In this case, both the ultimate findings and the conclusions of the judge were clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 20B, grants to a \u201cpatient\u201d the privilege of refusing to disclose, and of preventing a witness from disclosing, \u201cany communication,\u201d wherever made, between that patient and a \u201cpsychotherapist\u201d relative to the diag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>nosis or treatment of the patient\u2019s mental or emotional condition. \u201cPatient\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who, during the course of diagnosis or treatment, communicates with a psychotherapist.\u201d G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, a proper ruling as to whether the defendant was a \u201cpatient\u201d of Dr. Burr at the time of her consultation with the doctor turns, in part, on whether she communicated during the course of diagnosis <em>or </em>treatment. We need consider only the latter of these terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Neither the terms of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, nor cases interpreting that statute define \u201ctreatment.\u201d We have stated, however, that words or phrases in a statute are to be given their ordinary meaning and are to be construed according to their natural import and approved usage. <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Newton, </em>374 Mass. 450, 452 (1978). We need not define precisely what \u201ctreatment\u201d means for purposes of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, to conclude, as we do, that the term must encompass the situation presented by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">At the request of a senior psychiatrist, Dr. Burr, a psychiatric fellow, initiated a conversation with a mother in the intensive care unit where her critically ill infant was being treated. Dr. Burr introduced herself as a psychiatrist, asked if there was anything the staff could do to be helpful, and said that she \u201cwould be interested to <em>[sic] </em>hearing anything she had to tell [her] about her feelings about the situation.\u201d The nineteen year old single mother talked with the doctor for forty-five minutes. Based on this private conversation, the physician wrote a three-page \u201cconsultation request/report\u201d which included a plan for follow-up care. To hold that this communication was not privileged would be clearly in contravention of the legislative policy of confidentiality expressed by the Legislature in the enactment of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B. \u201cWe are not free to water down the legislative policy embodied in the statute by loose construction or by giving our approval to informal procedures different from those prescribed.\u201d <em>Usen </em>v. <em>Usen, </em>359 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>453, 457 (1971). See <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, 395 </em>Mass. 59, 67 (1985) (public policy favors a patient\u2019s right to confidentiality). It would tell parents of critically ill children that they cannot trust that their conversations with hospital psychiatrists under these circumstances would remain confidential, even in the context of a children\u2019s hospital which must, of necessity, try to help parents as it treats their children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the defendant can assert no privilege regarding her communication with Dr. Burr because no \u201cconfidential relationship\u201d had been established between them. To support that proposition, the Commonwealth notes that the conversation was initiated by Dr. Burr, not by the defendant, and that the defendant repeated to others the comments she had made to Dr. Burr. Neither consideration defeats the defendant\u2019s privilege. The fact that the defendant did not initiate the communication is immaterial. Where the statute specifically provides that communications are privileged \u201cregardless of the patient\u2019s awareness of such conversations,\u201d the question who initiated the conversation cannot determine whether it is privileged. That some of the information communicated to Dr. Burr was later repeated to others is also irrelevant. That a client tells a friend what he also tells his attorney in no way undermines the attorney-client privilege as to what was communicated to the attorney. That this was the patient\u2019s first, or last, conversation with the doctor similarly does not place it outside the privilege. We note that the attorney-client privilege, for example, may extend to preliminary communications looking toward representation, even if representation is never undertaken. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>377 Mass. 772, 775 (1979), citing 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 2292, 2304 (McNaughton rev. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Denying the defendant\u2019s motion, the trial judge also stated that \u201cit is problematical whether Dr. Burr would qualify under definition of \u2018psychotherapist\u2019\u201d under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B. We disagree. The statute defines \u201cpsychotherapist,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201ca person licensed to practice medicine who devotes a substantial portion of his time to the practice of psychiatry.\u201d Dr. Burr testified, and the Commonwealth does not dispute, that she is a licensed physician, board certified in pediatrics, and was employed as a fellow in child psychiatry at Children\u2019s Hospital from 1983 until 1985. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>386 Mass. 393, 408-409 (1982) (unlicensed staff psychologist not a \u201cpsychotherapist\u201d within G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B). At the time of her conversation with the defendant, Dr. Burr had been assigned exclusively to the psychiatric service department for approximately eight months. Her only duties and responsibilities were in the hospital\u2019s psychiatric department. She thus clearly comes within the statutory definition of \u201cpsychotherapist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The judge\u2019s order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the presentation of psychiatric evidence is vacated. An order allowing the motion is to be entered in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-14\"> Dr. Burr testified that she is a licensed physician, board certified in pediatrics. She was a fellow in child pyschiatry at Children\u2019s Hospital at the time of her consultation with the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b148-8\"> The application presented to the single justice also sought an interlocutory appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E (1984 ed.), and Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (b) (2), 378 Mass. 882 (1979), as to the denial of a motion to suppress other evidence. The single justice allowed both aspects of the application. Subsequently, the matters were bifurcated for purposes of hearing by the full bench. The interlocutory appeal on the motion to suppress other evidence is also before the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b150-7\"> We note that the word \u201cpatient\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1792 (2d ed. 1959) as \u201c[a] sick person, now commonly, one under treatment or care, as by a physician or surgeon . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\"> In <em>Usen </em>v. <em>Usen, supra </em>at 456, this court thought it \u201cclear that the patient did not lose her privilege to prevent disclosure of a communication merely because it was made part of a hospital record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In <em>Usen, </em>the court held that letters written by psychotherapists, relating to the diagnosis and treatment of a patient\u2019s mental and emotional condition, together with testimony disclosing conversations relating to the same, were inadmissible under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B. <em>Id. </em>at 445-456.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
