Cullen \u2014 against the defendant, Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association (\u201cFair Plan\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for proceeds under a fire insurance policy issued in compliance with G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 99, by the Fair Plan to Cullen Enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-14\">The basic facts are as follows.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In May, 1973, the plaintiff James Cullen sold to William Saccone and Barbara Saccone all the shares of stock in his restaurant business, incorporated under the name Cullen Enterprises, Inc. William Saccone agreed to continue making payments to the Ipswich Savings Bank on the first mortgage. Saccone also gave Cullen a partial down payment and a promissory note secured by a mortgage in the amount of $181,000. Saccone became delinquent on his payments to Cullen, and business declined at the restaurant. In March, 1975, Saccone made his last payment to Cullen.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>In the spring of 1975, Saccone sought protection from his creditors by filing a petition under c. 11 of the Bankruptcy Code of 1898s in the United States Bankruptcy Court. The bankruptcy judge appointed the plaintiff Losinno receiver of Cullen Enterprises, Inc., in May, 1975. In addition, Saccone applied for and received from the Fair Plan a fire insurance policy in the amount of $200,000 covering the building and $50,000 covering the contents for a term of one year beginning on July 25, 1975. The Ipswich Savings Bank was named as first mortgagee on the insurance policy, and Cullen was named as second mortgagee. Losinno was listed after the two mortgagees in the mortgage interest section of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">On September 29, 1975,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a fire totally destroyed the restaurant. The fire was of suspicious origin. There was evidence that Saccone had set it. In October, 1975, the Fair Plan paid Ipswich Savings Bank, the first mortgagee, the amount due on its mortgage in return for an assignment of the note and mortgage. The Fair Plan refused to pay either Cullen or Losinno, who became the trustee in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Cullen and Losinno commenced this action against the Fair Plan in September, 1977. The Fair Plan in its answer raised the affirmative defense that the plaintiffs violated the fraud and concealment clause of the policy. The complaint was amended in March, 1978, by substituting Losinno as trustee in bankruptcy and by adding a count for relief under G. L. c. 93A. Cullen moved for partial summary judgment on his mortgage claim. The motion judge allowed the motion for summary judgment as to the Fair Plan\u2019s liability. Cullen was awarded the money left on the building portion of the policy after the payment to Ipswich Savings Bank and an additional $20,000, which had been paid to the Fair Plan after the trustee in bankruptcy sold the property of Cullen Enterprises. The Fair Plan filed a timely notice of appeal. The Fair Plan moved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>vacate the partial summary judgment. The judge denied the motion to vacate. The Fair Plan again filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">In 1984, after a jury-waived trial on Cullen\u2019s c. 93A'claim and on Losinno\u2019s claim, the judge concluded that there was no merit to the c. 93A claim against the Fair Plan. The judge also determined that Losinno was not entitled to recover under the insurance policy because he succeeded to Saccone\u2019s interest and Saccone was not entitled to recover any proceeds from the policy because he was involved in the arson. Cullen and Losinno appeal these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">We affirm the allowance of the motion for partial summary judgment for Cullen, the denial of the Fair Plan\u2019s motion to vacate, and the denial of relief to Cullen under c. 93A. We reverse the trial judge\u2019s denial of Losinno\u2019s claim under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">1. <em>Cullen\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. </em>On April 20, 1982, the plaintiff Cullen filed a motion for summary judgment. The judge considered the pleadings and the affidavits of the following individuals with attached copies of correspondence: Gardner Stratton, the independent insurance adjuster retained by the Fair Plan; Frank Barber, III, the Fair Plan\u2019s attorney; Richard L. Levine, Cullen\u2019s attorney from 1970 to 1979; and Cullen.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Based on this information, the judge allowed Cullen\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On appeal, the Fair Plan argues that this ruling was erroneous. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">If the pleadings and affidavits before the judge<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,\u201d summary judgment is appropriate. Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). Once a motion for summary judgment is made and supported by affidavits, the \u201cadverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but'his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (e). \u201cConclusory statements, general denials, and factual allegations not based on personal knowledge [are] insufficient to avoid summary judgment.\u201d <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Erwin, </em>395 Mass. 715, 721 (1985), quoting <em>Olympic Junior, Inc. </em>v. <em>David Crystal, Inc., </em>463 F.2d 1141, 1146 (3d Cir. 1972). See <em>McDonnell </em>v. <em>Flaharty, </em>636 F.2d 184, 187 (7th Cir. <em>1980); Liberty Leasing Co. </em>v. <em>Hillsum Sales Corp., </em>380 F.2d 1013, 1014-1015 (5th Cir. 1967). If the opposing party fails properly to present specific facts establishing a genuine, triable issue, summary judgment should be granted. See <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 554 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Those issues material to Cullen\u2019s claim include (1) whether he has a valid mortgage interest and (2) whether he was responsible in any way for the fire that destroyed the building. If he has a valid interest and if he were not involved with the suspicious fire, he is entitled to judgment. See G.L.c. 175, \u00a7\u00a797 and 99 (1984 ed.). There were no facts in the defendant\u2019s affidavits at the time of the motion for partial summary judgment indicating that Cullen was involved in the fire.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>the only facts material to the partial summary judgment concerned whether Cullen\u2019s claimed mortgage interest was valid and whether the Fair Plan received adequate notice of Cullen\u2019s status as mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">On this issue, we look to the documentary evidence accompanying the affidavits submitted for the judge\u2019s consideration. On June 18, 1976, Stratton, the Fair Plan\u2019s insurance adjuster, wrote a letter to Mr. Levine, Cullen\u2019s attorney, requesting information concerning Cullen\u2019s mortgage interest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On February 2,1977, Mr. Levine sent a letter back to Stratton, noting that Mr. Levine had no record of his having responded to the June 18, 1976, letter and asking that Stratton let him know if any response still was necessary. On both March 11 and April 11, 1977, Stratton again requested the information. On April 12, 1977, Mr. Levine responded, enclosing a copy of the promissory note, the mortgage, and a security agreement as to personalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">On April 21, 1977, Stratton in a letter acknowledged receipt of Mr. Levine\u2019s April 12 letter. He requested \u201ca photostatic copy of Mr. Cullen\u2019s records showing the dates and amounts of all payments received by him under the promissory note.\u201d He added that, \u201c[wjhen this information has been received, this matter will be referred to counsel for [the Fair Plan].\u201d On May 27, 1977, Mr. Levine sent copies of cancelled checks written by Saccone to the Cullen account at the Ipswich Savings Bank.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Finally, on October 6, 1977, Mr. Levine sent Stratton a letter with computations as to the amount of money owed Cullen on the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">This documentary history tended to establish that Cullen supplied the insurance adjuster with all the information re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>quested to substantiate his interest: the adjuster had the promissory note, the mortgage, the cancelled checks, and a statement of the amount owed Cullen on the mortgage. The burden thus shifted to the Fair Plan, as the opposing party on the motion for partial summary judgment, to provide some record support for its position that, in fact, Cullen did not provide information sufficient to substantiate his claim. See <em>Brown </em>v. TWA, 746 F.2d 1354, 1358-1359 (8th Cir. 1984); 10A C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller \u00a7 2727, at 143-145 (1983). The affidavits of Stratton and the Fair Plan\u2019s counsel simply contained bare assertions that they had not received the necessary information.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Fair Plan did not file an affidavit establishing what further information it wanted and could not obtain beyond that already provided by the plaintiff. The Fair Plan\u2019s general denials do not contravene the documents before the judge. The Fair Plan made no claim under Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (f) that it was unable to present by affidavit facts essential to justify its opposition to the motion. It did not \u201cshow [any] circumstances which hamstring [it] in presenting that proof by affidavit in opposition to the motion.\u201d Kaplan, Amendments of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 1961-1963 (ii), 77 Harv. L. Rev. 801, 826 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">The documentary evidence before the motion judge, in sum, does not support the Fair Plan\u2019s contentions. Based on the evidence before him, the judge could conclude that the material facts which were not disputed showed that Cullen provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>the documentation requested by the Fair Plan. We affirm the allowance of the motion for partial summary judgment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">2. <em>The Fair Plan\u2019s motion to vacate. </em>After the motion for partial summary judgment was allowed, the Fair Plan fil\u00e9d a motion to vacate the order. In support of its motion, the Fair Plan asserted that it had obtained information, undiscovered and unavailable at the time of consideration of the motion for partial summary judgment, establishing a genuine issue of fact as to Cullen\u2019s knowledge of the arson and thus as to the Fair Plan\u2019s liability to Cullen.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That information was in the deposition testimony of one Allan Ponn, an attorney who represented Saccone from 1972 to 1979.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The judge denied the motion to vacate. We affirm this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 60 (b), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), provides that, \u201c[o]n motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following [, among other,] reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>to move for a new trial under Rule 59 (b).\u201d In a motion under subsection (1) of rule 60 (b), the moving party bears the burden of justifying the motion, see Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Civil Procedure at 585 (1982), and \u201cmust make some showing of why he was justified in failing to avoid mistake or inadvertence\u201d (footnote omitted). 11 C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller \u00a7 2858, at 170 (1973). See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admin., </em>377 Mass. 217, 227-228 (1979). Relief is not justified for \u201cany kind of garden-variety oversight.\u201d <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Barron, </em>382 Mass. 181, 186 (1980), quoting <em>Pasquale </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>418 F.2d 627, 630 (1st Cir. 1969). Instead, \u201c[t]he inadvertence, mistake or surprise as well as neglect must be excusable in order to give the court power to set aside the judgment.\u201d <em>Geigel </em>v. <em>Sea Land Serv., Inc., </em>44 F.R.D. 1, 2 (D. P.R. 1968). Similar considerations are relevant under rule 60 (b) (2).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The moving party may prevail only if \u201cthe evidence relied on was not available ... for introduction at the original [proceeding] by the exercise of reasonable diligence . . . .\u201d <em>DeLuca </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>312 Mass. 495, 497 (1942). If the moving party fails to show why he did not have the evidence at the time of the original proceeding, the party will not prevail. 11 Wright &amp; Miller, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 2859, at 183-184.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Resolution of a rule 60 (b) motion rests in the discretion of the trial judge, and we \u201cwill show marked deference to the lower court\u2019s resolution of such a motion.\u201d <em>Chu-Kun Woon </em>v. <em>Moy, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 949 (1983). See <em>DeLuca </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., supra. A </em>denial of a rule 60 (b) motion \u201cwill be set aside only on a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Murphy, supra </em>at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">In its motion, the Fair Plan presented no evidence compelling the judge to make \u201cthe threshold finding that the evidence, claimed to be newly discovered, \u2018was not available [during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>the proceedings on the summary judgment motion] ... by the exercise of reasonable diligence. . . <em>Graci </em>v. <em>Damon, 6 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 160, 166, aff\u2019d 376 Mass. 927 (1978), quoting <em>DeLuca </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., supra </em>at 497. The Fair Plan asserts only that because the deponent Ponn represented Sac-cone from 1972 until 1979, Ponn\u2019s testimony was unavailable prior to the filing of the motion to vacate. The partial summary judgment motion, however, was filed and heard in 1982-1983.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> There is no explanation of why an affidavit from Ponn or at least an affidavit from an officer of the Fair Plan was not filed explaining why the Fair Plan was unable to file an affidavit under rule 56 (f). See Kaplan, <em>supra. </em>On the record, there is no evidence from the Fair Plan that it was unable to file an affidavit between 1979 and 1982, the year the motion was heard. The judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion to vacate the partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">3. <em>Cullen\u2019s claim under G. L. c. 93A. </em>In March, 1978, the plaintiffs<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> amended their complaint by adding a claim alleging that the knowing and wilful failure of the Fair Plan to make payments under the policy constituted an unfair and deceptive practice under G. L. c. 93 A. After trial, a judge of the Superior Court denied relief under c. 93A. Cullen appeals, arguing that the Fair Plan\u2019s actions, violating the principles of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3, (9) (d), (e), (f), and (n), also violated c. 93A.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>We summarize the facts as found by the judge on Cullen\u2019s c. 93A claim. In September, 1977, Cullen commenced his action against the Fair Plan. The judge found that Cullen did not provide the full information required by the Fair Plan to process the claim until October, 1977. See <em>supra </em>at 891-892. The judge further found that the checks in payment of Saccone\u2019s promissory note to Cullen \u201ccreated some legitimate confusion in the Fair Plan\u2019s adjuster\u2019s mind as to who[m] exactly those checks were made payable to and caused the adjuster to question Cullen\u2019s interest.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The judge found that the Fair Plan\u2019s attorney chose to defend the claims against the Fair Plan and \u201creasonably concluded that it was futile to seek to settle the matter.\u201d The judge concluded that, in these circumstances, \u201cthe Fair Plan did not engage in any deceptive conduct\u201d and that \u201cit would be stretching matters beyond any reasonable bounds to conclude that it acted unfairly . . . .\u201d While the issue was close, the judge evidently believed that the Fair Plan\u2019s claims manager and adjuster were uncertain and confused as to whether Cullen had a legitimate interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>property.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Because he determined that the Fair Plan\u2019s representatives were credible, he concluded that the Fair Plan\u2019s delay in determining whether to pay Cullen was not a violation of c. 93A. Credibility is for the trier of fact, <em>Lupia </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>353 Mass. 749 (1967); <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Bragdon, </em>289 Mass. 595, 597 (1935), and we do not substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact. <em>Joseph Amara &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Providence Steamboat Company, </em>360 Mass. 850, 851 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Essentially, Cullen complains about the Fair Plan\u2019s delay in paying his claim under the policy. The Fair Plan, however, had every right to conduct its investigation both of the validity of Cullen\u2019s mortgage interest and of the possibility that Cullen was involved in the arson. After the partial summary judgment, the Fair Plan certainly had the right to appeal the judgment. Moreover, the major reason for the delay in finally resolving the issue of the Fair Plan\u2019s liability was the intervening trial on the c. 93A claim. Cullen could have hastened the appeal by moving for entry of a final judgment as to the partial summary judgment under Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974), which provides that, if there is an express determination that there is no just reason for delay, the court may direct entry of final judgment on some but not all of the claims. An appeal then could follow on the claims on which the judge entered a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">4. <em>The claim of the trustee in bankruptcy. </em>At trial, the judge denied the claim of the plaintiff Losinno, the trustee in bankruptcy of Cullen Enterprises, for recovery under the fire insurance policy for the value of the contents of the restaurant.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Losinno appeals, essentially arguing that, because of his status first as custodial receiver in bankruptcy and later as trustee in bankruptcy, recovery under the policy should not be denied based on Saccone\u2019s arson.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We agree with this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>The facts relevant to Losinno\u2019s claim as found by the judge are summarized as follows. In approximately April, 1975, Saccone as president of Cullen Enterprises filed a petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court under c. 11 of the Bankruptcy Code of 1898, seeking protection from creditors. The Bankruptcy Court appointed Losinno as custodial receiver of Cullen Enterprises in May, 1975. As custodial receiver, Losinno received weekly reports from Saconne regarding the business. Based on this information, Losinno made periodic reports to the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">After Losinno\u2019s appointment as receiver, Cullen Enterprises, Inc., William Saccone, president, and Ipswich Steak and Seafood House took out the fire insurance policy from the Fair Plan. \u201cVincent Losinno, Receiver in bankruptcy, AHIMA\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> was listed as the third mortgage interest behind Ipswich Savings Bank and James Cullen. In 1978, Cullen Enterprises was adjudicated bankrupt and Losinno was appointed trustee in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The judge concluded Saccone caused the September 29, 1975, fire. The judge ruled that \u201cLosinno can have no more rights in this matter than Saccone\u201d and that the defense of arson thus was available to the Fair Plan as to Losinno\u2019s claim under the policy. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The purpose of the policy in the case at bar was to protect the assets and the property of Cullen Enterprises. The policy was taken out when Cullen Enterprises already was within the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court. See <em>Imperial Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>49 F.2d 745, 747 (8th Cir. 1931). The benefit of insuring the property and assets of Cullen Enterprises did not inure to Saccone, as president of the corporation, but instead inured to the potential bankruptcy estate and the creditors of the corporation. At the time the corporation took out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>the policy, Losinno was the receiver. The duty of a receiver is to preserve and protect the bankruptcy estate until termination of the bankruptcy proceedings or the appointment of the trustee. See <em>Meehan </em>v. <em>King, </em>54 F.2d 761, 763 (1st Cir. 1932); <em>Bingaman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Trust Co., </em>1 F.2d 505 (D. Pa. 1924). Thus, at the time the policy was taken out, Losinno was the insured party because it was he who represented the interests of the potential bankruptcy estate. Saccone, the president of-the corporation which was involved in bankruptcy proceedings, was not insured under the policy. He merely managed the property on behalf of the creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Because Losinno was the insured party under the contract, Saccone\u2019s arson has no bearing on Losinno\u2019s rights. The fraud committed by Saccone was not fraud committed by the insured. The insured, Losinno, is entitled to recover.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The Fair Plan\u2019s mistake placing Losinno\u2019s name in the mortgage interest section of the policy does not change this result. The named insured was \u201cCullen Enterprises, Inc.\u201d Because that entity filed for bankruptcy before the policy was taken out, the only individual possible to represent the interests of the corporation was Losinno. Thus, the error in placing Losinno\u2019s name in the mortgage section rather than explicitly as the insured is only a slight discrepancy, and, as such, is without significance. See 2A M.S. Rhodes, Couch\u2019s Cyclopedia of Insurance Law \u00a7 23:7 (2d ed. rev. 1984). Moreover, the Fair Plan, placing Losinno\u2019s name on the policy as receiver in bankruptcy, issued the policy with knowledge of the relative rights of Losinno and the potential bankruptcy estate. The policy cannot be avoided by reason of a mistake made in recording the insured\u2019s name by an employee of the insurer to whom the Fair Plan assigned the risk. See <em>id.; </em>7 M.S. Rhodes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number><em>supra </em>at \u00a7 35:178. \u201cThe fact that the defendant ] erroneously described [the plaintiff\u2019s interest] . . . should not affect his right to recover on the basis of his actual interest.\u201d <em>Bergeron </em>v. <em>Fontaine, </em>109 N.H. 370, 373 (1969).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order allowing the motion for partial summary judgment is affirmed, the order denying the motion to vacate is affirmed, and the ruling denying Cullen\u2019s claim under c. 93A is affirmed. The ruling denying Losinno\u2019s claim for recovery under the policy is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b903-15\"> The Fair Plan consists of an association of all insurers licensed to provide property insurance in the Commonwealth.

Reliance on facts not before the motion judge is improper. In our review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>a motion for summary judgment we are \u201cconfined to an examination of the materials before the court at the time the rulings were made.

The photocopy in our records is poor. As best as we can read it, it requests a copy of the mortgage note, a copy of any security agreement, and a statement of \u201cany amounts which have been paid on the original mortgage note, including dates and amounts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b907-10\">On September 13, 1977, Stratton referred the matter to the Fair Plan\u2019s counsel. In that letter, he wrote that he still was awaiting further information from the second mortgagee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b908-5\"> Stratton\u2019s affidavit of December 17, 1981, asserted that, despite his repeated requests for \u201cany written documentation relative to Mr. Cullen\u2019s alleged second mortgage interest, including any records of payment by the mortgagor to Mr. Cullen [so that the] . . . claim could be evaluated, both in terms of its legitimacy and its true amount,\u201d he had not received the necessary documentation. Barber, the Fair Plan\u2019s attorney, stated in his affidavit taken on the same day, that \u201c[o]n information and belief, the alleged second mortgagee, James Cullen, never provided satisfactory documentary evidence of the extent of any legitimate mortgage interest in the property, if any.\" Assertions \u201cmade on information and belief, as opposed to personal knowledge, are . . . disregarded in considering a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Shapiro Equip. Corp. </em>v. <em>Morris &amp; Son Constr. Corp., </em>369 Mass. 968 (1976). See <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Erwin, supra </em>at 721.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b909-6\"> The Fair Plan also argues that an agreement between Cullen and Losinno filed in Bankruptcy Court totally bars Cullen\u2019s claim under the fire insurance policy. Pursuant to that agreement, Cullen\u2019s claim as a secured creditor was recognized and declared valid but was \u201csubordinated to the interests of unsecured creditors sufficient to pay (a) all priority claims, fees and expenses of administration allowed by the Court including any commissions and/or fees allowed to the Receiver, the Trustee and their counsel, and (b) a dividend of 75% on allowed claims of general unsecured creditors. Nothing herein shall prejudice the right of any party hereto to object to any claim, or application for compensation or the like.\u201d This agreement was not before the motion judge whose ruling we are reviewing. It is therefore not before us for this purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b909-7\">General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 99, cl. twelfth, provides that \u201cno act or default of any person other than [the] mortgagee or his agent or those claiming under him, whether the same occurs before or during the term of this policy, shall render this policy void as to such mortgagee.\u201d The fraud and concealment provision explains that a policy is void \u201cif, whether before or after a loss, the insured has wilfully concealed or misrepresented any material fact.\u201d These two provisions suggest that if the mortgagee concealed the arson, he, like the insured, would be in default.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b909-8\"> Ponn was disbarred in 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b910-7\">The standard applicable in rule 60 (b) (2) motions is the same as that applicable in rule 59 (b) motions; therefore, decisions construing rule 59 (b) are authoritative in construing rule 60 (b) (2). 11 C.A.

App. Ct. 340, 347 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b911-6\"> The motion for partial summary judgment was filed in 1982, and the judge allowed the motion in February, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b911-7\"> Both Cullen and Losinno moved to amend the original complaint to add the c. 93A claim. Apparently only Cullen pursued the c. 93A claim at trial, because the judge\u2019s findings on the claim deal only with the claim as to Cullen. Cullen alone appeals from the judge\u2019s denial of relief under c. 93A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b911-8\"> General Laws c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (1984 ed.), provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following are hereby defined as unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance:</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">\u201c(9) Unfair claim settlement practices: an unfair claim settlement practice shall consist of any of the following acts or omissions:</p>\n<p id=\"AU0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>\u201c(d) Refusing to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation based upon all available information;</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">\u201c(e) Failing to affirm or deny coverage of claims within a reasonable time after proof of loss statements have been completed;</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\"><em>\u201c(f) </em>Failing to effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonbly clear; \u00ed\u00ed</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">\u201c(\u00ab) Failing to provide promptly a reasonable explanation of the basis in the insurance policy in relation to the facts or applicable law for denial of a claim or for the offer of a compromise settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 9(1), as amended by St. 1979, c. 406, \u00a7 1, specifically provides that any person whose rights are affected by another person violating the provisions of c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9), may bring an action for relief. Even prior to 1979, we held that c. 176D does not bar application of c. 93A to unfair and deceptive insurance practices and that c. 93A, \u00a7 2(a), \u201ccovers insurance practices in its prohibition of unfair or deceptive acts or practices in any trade or commerce.\u201d <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins.

Because the Ipswich Savings Bank was the first mortgagee, this caused some confusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b913-7\">The claims manager testified at trial.

Because Losinno had title to Saccone\u2019s property as of the time the bankruptcy petition was filed, Saccone\u2019s arson should hot affect Losinno\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b916-6\"> The placement of Losinno\u2019s name in the mortgage interest section of the insurance policy creates an ambiguity because Losinno had no mortgage interest in the corporation\u2019s real estate. Because the contract of insurance is unclear, we look to that interpretation which \u201cbest effectuates the main manifested design of the parties. . . .\u201d <em>Joseph E. Bennett Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>344 Mass. 99, 103-104 (1962), quoting <em>Rezendes </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>285 Mass. 505, 511 (1934); <em>King </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>359 Mass. 46, 50 (1971). The contract must be interpreted as a whole to give effect to its general purpose. See <em>Ober </em>v. <em>National Casualty Co., </em>318 Mass. 27, 31 (1945). The general purpose of the contract was to protect the assets of the corporation for the bankruptcy estate. It is consistent with the purpose for Losinno to recover as the trustee in bankruptcy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
