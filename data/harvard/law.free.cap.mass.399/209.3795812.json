While hospitalized at Children\u2019s Hospital in Boston for \u201cfailure to thrive,\u201d the child suddenly became critically ill on March 3,1984. Tests revealed a dangerously high level of sodium chloride (sodium) in the child\u2019s blood and in his formula. Dr. David Perlmutter, -the staff physician in charge of his care, went to the child\u2019s room looking for \u201canything . . . that might explain the baby\u2019s condition.\u201d Finding a partially filled \u201cplastic playtex nurser baby bottle\u201d (nurser no. 1) in a cloth zippered bag among the defendant\u2019s belongings, he had a sample of the formula in the nurser tested. The sample contained a very high concentration of sodium.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The defendant moved in March, 1985, to suppress nurser no. 1 which Dr. Perlmutter had discovered, an empty nurser (nurser no. 2) which the defendant subsequently turned over to the hospital\u2019s general counsel, and test results derived from chemical analysis of the two nursers and their contents. She has maintained that the evidence was obtained pursuant to an unlawful warrantless search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">After hearing evidence for thirteen days between September 19, 1985, and January 16, 1986, the motion judge denied the motion to suppress on April 10, 1986.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P.\u2018 15 (b) (2), 378 Mass. 882 (1979), the defendant filed an application to this court seeking leave to appeal the denial of her motion. A single justice of this court granted the application and transferred the case to the full court on April 30, 1986.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>The forty-five page findings of the motion judge can be summarized as follows. The defendant\u2019s child entered Children\u2019s Hospital on February 27, 1984. The defendant, who had been sleeping in her child\u2019s room,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> observed, in the early morning of March 3, 1984, that he was very puffy and was having difficulty breathing. She reported this to a nurse\u2019s aide. The child\u2019s blood was tested. A dangerously high level of sodium was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Dr. Perlmutter was informed and sought to discover the source of the sodium. He tasted, then had tested, a sample of the hospital formula which was designated for the child and kept in a quart bottle in the ward kitchen refrigerator.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The test showed excessive sodium in the formula. Dr. Perlmutter then went to the child\u2019s room \u201cto search for further diagnostic and medical clues as to the source of the sodium and to determine whether other children at the hospital were at risk.\u201d Inside the cloth zippered bag, among the defendant\u2019s belongings, he found nurser no. 1, which was used to feed the child.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The physician took some of its contents, returned the nurser to the bag, and then had the hospital\u2019s chemist test the sample.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Test results showing a high concentration of sodium were reported at approximately 2 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">At the hospital\u2019s request, Lawrence Curran, vice president and general counsel of the private investigatory agency which provides the hospital\u2019s security services, came to the hospital at approximately 6 p.m. on March 3, 1984. Responding to Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Curran\u2019s call, Assistant District Attorney John Dawley arrived at 8:25 p.m. Although Mr. Dawley met with Mr. Curran and several hospital administrators, the judge found that \u201c [n]o one asked [Mr. Dawley] to take any action. He did not, at any time or in any way, direct the course of events that evening or thereafter. His position at this time is best described as an observer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The defendant consented to meet with Mr. Curran and the hospital\u2019s general counsel, Ellen Weiss, at 10:15 that evening. She was told that the purpose of the meeting was to gather further information on the child\u2019s routine. Mr. Dawley was present. When the defendant arrived, Mr. Curran introduced himself, Ms. Weiss, and Mr. Dawley. He expressed the hospital\u2019s concern for her situation and asked whether she would speak to them \u201cas part of a number of efforts being undertaken to figure out what happened.\u201d The defendant indicated that she was \u201cvery willing to cooperate to determine what had happened.\u201d She was asked to relate what had happened during the day with her child. Although present at Mr. Curran\u2019s invitation, Mr. Dawley did not participate in any way. He took some notes. He did not ask the defendant any questions or interact in any way with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">During this interview, the defendant indicated that her child drank the hospital\u2019s formula and that she used plastic nursers which she had brought to the hospital. When Mr. Curran asked if the defendant had \u201cany objection to giving the [nurser] to the hospital so [that it] could be secured,\u201d she said, \u201c [Absolutely none.\u201d She indicated that she would be happy to get it.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The judge found that the defendant \u201cvoluntarily offered and agreed without any objection at all to give the [nurser] to the hospital.\u201d The judge also found that the defendant voluntarily gave Ms. Weiss the two nursers and that she knew by this time that her child\u2019s formula had been analyzed. The judge further found that the defendant reasonably expected that the nursers\u2019 contents would be analyzed. Mr. Dawley, who was not present when the defendant handed over the nursers, neither directed that they be obtained nor suggested what should be done with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The defendant\u2019s child died on March 5, 1984. On March 16, 1984, the defendant was interrogated at the Springfield police department.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She was represented by counsel and received her Miranda warnings. Assistant District Attorney John Kiernan asked the defendant if she had \u201cany problem with [his] keeping\u201d the nursers. She said she did not. The judge found that her consent was voluntary. The defendant reiterated twice during the interview that \u201cif anyone had asked her on March 3, 1984 for permission to look through her bags or other belongings she would have volunteered to let them do so and would have opened them up and helped anyone or let anyone look at everything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">On March 16, 1984, Terence Law, chemistry supervisor at Children\u2019s Hospital, conducted a simulation test at Mr. Kiernan\u2019s request to determine how sodium behaves chemically in the kind of formula which the child had received in the hospital. This test did not involve any of the formula prepared for the defendant\u2019s child. On March 28, 1984, again at Mr. Kieman\u2019s direction, Law tested samples from the quart bottle and nurser no. 1 for sodium concentration. The test results, confirming that both samples contained tainted formula of a high sodium level, were relayed to the office of the district attorney. On April 30, 1984, Law tested nurser no. 2 and its nipple for sodium. This testing also was done at Mr. Kieman\u2019s request. Some sodium was found. The test results were relayed to the office of the district attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">On the basis of the facts summarized above, the judge concluded that the two nursers, as well as the test results of March 16, March 28, and April 30, 1984, would be admissible in evidence. The judge mled that Dr. Perlmutter\u2019s acts on March 3, 1984 \u2014 removing the nurser from the defendant\u2019s bag, taking a sample of the formula, and returning the nurser to the bag \u2014 were \u201centirely the acts of a private party.\u201d Neither directed nor encouraged by any governmental agency, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>actions \u201cwere done solely for medical and diagnostic reasons and in the furtherance of the hospital\u2019s interest in caring for and protecting the [defendant\u2019s] baby and its other patients.\u201d The judge further ruled that Mr. Curran and Ms. Weiss \u201cwere each functioning as a private party when [the defendant] gave the [nursers] to [Ms.] Weiss and not as agents or instrumentalities of the police. No police official instigated or participated in these actions .... Therefore, any actions concerning the bottles do not trigger any Fourth Amendment or Article 14 protections, or require the application of the exclusionary rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Thus, the judge ruled that \u201c [t]here was no state action involved in the hospital\u2019s obtaining of the playtex nurser bottles from [the defendant],\u201d and that the nursers were not subject to suppression. Further, the judge ruled that, even if State action had been involved, the defendant retained no legitimate expectation of privacy in the nursers because she voluntarily gave them to the hospital staff. Consequently, the subsequent transmittal of the nursers by members of the hospital staff to the office of the district attorney did not violate the defendant\u2019s right against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">As to the tests, the judge found that all three of the challenged tests, conducted at Mr. Kiernan\u2019s direction or request, were the result of State action. Nevertheless, the judge found nothing in the record to indicate that the defendant intended to limit her consent so as to exclude chemical testing of the nursers or their contents. The judge concluded that the March 16, 1984, test \u201cwas merely a repeat\u201d of the prior private test, and that the defendant had consented, in any event. The judge ruled that the tests conducted on March 28, 1984, were not a significant expansion of the hospital\u2019s testing on March 3, 1984, and that, even if they were, they were done with the defendant\u2019s consent. Finally, the April 30, 1984, test on the second nurser was found to be admissible because the defendant had consented voluntarily to giving it to members of the hospital staff on March 3, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The evidence before the motion judge consisted primarily of oral testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\u201cThe determination of the weight and credibility of the testimony is the function and responsibility of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses, and not of this court. In such a situation, where subsidiary findings of fact have been made by the trial judge, they will be accepted by this court, and we do not substitute our judgment for [hers], absent clear error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>362 Mass. 542, 547 (1972). <em>Commonwealth v. Harmond, </em>376 Mass. 557, 560-561 (1978)\u201d (and other cases cited).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-5\"><em>Commonwealth v. Moon, </em>380 Mass. 751, 756 (1980). The ultimate legal conclusions to be drawn from the subsidiary findings of fact, however, are matters for review by this court. <em>Commonwealth v. Hosey, </em>368 Mass. 571, 574 n.1 (1975). In this case, we find no error requiring reversal of the motion judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The defendant argues that (1) Mr. Dawley\u2019s participation in the decision to obtain the nursers from the defendant and his presence at the interview with the defendant on March 3,1984, constituted State action; (2) the defendant\u2019s consent to the taking of the nursers was not voluntary because she was unaware of the State\u2019s participation; (3) the subsequent testing was an impermissible search because it constituted governmental expansion of the hospital\u2019s tests of the nursers without the defendant\u2019s consent; and (4) the defendant\u2019s March 16, 1984, statement that she had \u201cno problem\u201d with the assistant district attorney\u2019s \u201ckeeping\u201d the nursers did not retroactively authorize the Commonwealth\u2019s seizure and testing of the nursers.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Counsel for the defendant has conceded that no State action was involved prior to the arrival of the assistant district attorney at the hospital at 8:25 p.m. on March 3, 1984. The judge ruled correctly that the testing done that afternoon at Dr. Perlmutter\u2019s direction is admissible. \u201cEvidence discovered and seized by private parties is admissible without regard to the methods used, unless State officials have instigated or participated in the search.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Leone, </em>386 Mass. 329, 333 (1982). <em>Commonwealth v. Richmond, </em>379 Mass. 557, 561-562 (1980). But see <em>District Attorney for the Plymouth Dist. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number><em>Coffey, </em>386 Mass. 218, 226, 229 (1982) (Liacos, J., concurring) (private action does not fall within the exclusionary rule so long as it is limited to private purpose); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leone, supra </em>at 334 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The parties disagree as to whether State action arose on the evening of March 3, 1984, when the assistant district attorney arrived at the hospital. While the judge found that there was no State action involved when the members of the hospital staff subsequently obtained the nursers from the defendant, the defendant takes strong exception to the judge\u2019s rulings sustaining the prosecution\u2019s objections to questions which she maintains were properly exploring the State action issue. In effect, the defendant maintains that the judge precluded her counsel from eliciting the information necessary to the court\u2019s determination whether the government participated in, directed, or encouraged the acquisition of the nursers. We have reviewed the entire transcript and agree that the judge prevented the defendant from developing this theory.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The motion judge\u2019s refusal to allow counsel to present testimony necessary to resolve complex pretrial issues was error. As the United States Supreme Court has stated, \u201cthe question whether particular conduct is \u2018private,\u2019 on the one hand, or \u2018state action,\u2019 on the other, frequently admits of no easy answer.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 349-350 (1974). \u201cThe true nature of the State\u2019s involvement may not be immediately obvious, and detailed inquiry may be required in order to determine whether the test [of State action] is met\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The error of the judge\u2019s rulings on this issue is not ground for reversal, however. Even if we assume that there had been State action commencing after Mr. Dawley\u2019s arrival in the evening of March 3, 1984, this fact would not affect the result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>we reach because we conclude that the issue of the defendant\u2019s consent was explored fully and that the judge\u2019s findings on that issue were not in error. The record amply supports the judge\u2019s findings that the defendant consented to giving the nursers to Ms. Weiss on March 3, 1984, and assented, on March 16, 1984, to the assistant district attorney\u2019s request to keep the nursers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">\u201cWhen the Commonwealth relies on consent as the basis for a warrantless search, it must demonstrate \u2018consent unfettered by coercion, express or implied, . . . [which is] something more than mere \u201cacquiescence to a claim of lawful authority\u201d [citation omitted].\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>370 Mass. 548, 555, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 943 (1976). See <em>Bumper </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 548-549 (1968); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Antobenedetto, </em>366 Mass. 51, 57 (1974). Voluntariness of consent \u2018is a question of fact to be determined in the circumstances of each case . . . . \u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aguiar, </em>370 Mass. 490, 496 (1976). The neglect or failure of the police to explain the right of the defendant to refuse to consent to a search is a factor suggesting coercion, but it is not conclusive. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, supra. Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 248-249 (1973). This is true even when a suspect is in custody when asked for permission to search. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaBriola, </em>370 Mass. 366, 367 (1976): <em>United States </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 424-425 (1976).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harmond, </em>376 Mass. 557, 561 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"AgE\">The defendant claims that \u201cher consent to give the hospital the [nursers], not knowing of the State\u2019s involvement in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>decision to obtain such [nursers], was not \u2018voluntary\u2019 as a matter of law.\u201d There is conflicting evidence whether the defendant knew that Mr. Dawley was an assistant district attorney when she met with him, Mr. Curran, and Ms. Weiss on the evening of March 3, 1984. \u201cIn reviewing the record on this issue, \u2018 [w]e accept, as we must, the trial judge\u2019s resolution of conflicting testimony . . . .\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, </em>368 Mass. 662, 666-667 (1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 959 (1976) .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>373 Mass. 676, 682 n.2 (1977) . Furthermore, \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s claim that [her] apparent consent was involuntary should be carefully scrutinized to avoid giving [her] an unfair advantage. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>DiPrima, </em>472 F.2d 550, 551 (1st Cir. 1973).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harmond, supra </em>at 562. The judge found that the defendant acted voluntarily at all times. Whether the defendant knew Mr. Dawley to be an assistant district attorney at the time does not appear material, in light of the defendant\u2019s continued, voluntary cooperation with the police as exemplified by her statement on March 16, 1984, at an interrogation where she had received Miranda warnings and was represented by counsel. <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We note also that, even if the defendant had not consented to the tests on March 16, March 28, and April 30, 1984, they were found by the judge on ample evidence to be cumulative of the private, uncontested testing conducted at Dr. Perlmutter\u2019s request on March 3, 1984.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The resolution of the defendant\u2019s arguments regarding State action and the voluntariness of her consent make it unnecessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>to address her two other claims on appeal. The judge\u2019s order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\"> There is no explanation in the record to indicate the reasons for the length of time between the conclusion of the hearings on January 16, 1986, and the date of the judge\u2019s written findings and rulings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1984 ed.), the complaint presented to the single justice also sought leave to appeal from the motion judge\u2019s denial of a motion to exclude other evidence. The matter subsequently was bifurcated for hearing before the full court. The interlocutory appeal on the motion to exclude was decided in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, ante </em>131 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\">It was the practice at Children\u2019s Hospital to allow parents to sleep in their children\u2019s rooms.

Included in those belongings was the cloth bag in which Dr. Perlmutter found nurser no. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\"> The defendant does not contest the validity of Dr. Perlmutter\u2019s action in taking the quart bottle from the refrigerator, or in asking for a sodium analysis of its contents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\"> During prior hospitalizations, the child had experienced difficulty using the nursers provided by the hospital.

Although no prejudice to the defendant is shown in the circumstances of this case, we frown on the practice of allowing a private party to participate fully in a suppression hearing. The role of private counsel is best limited to advising witnesses whom they represent as to any purported privilege of the witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\"> The United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 227 (1973): \u201c [T]he question whether a consent to a search was in fact \u2018voluntary\u2019 or was the product of duress or coercion, express or implied, is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of all the circumstances.\u201d See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cantalupo, </em>380 Mass. 173, 177 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harmond, </em>376 Mass. 557, 561 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aguiar, </em>370 Mass. 490, 496 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\"> As this court stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aguiar, </em>370 Mass. 490, 496 (1976), \u201c[E]ven if a search and seizure is involved here, consent vitiating the need for a search warrant may be found in cooperative conduct. <em>Commonwealth v.
