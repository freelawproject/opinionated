Hence, we shall not repeat the facts. Cobb was convicted of murder in the second degree; his codefendants, Andrew J. Millyan and Arthur A. Corbett, were found guilty of murder in the first degree. After Millyan\u2019s verdict was reduced to murder in the second degree, a hearing was conducted on Cobb\u2019s motion to reduce the verdict under Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (b) (2), 378 Mass. 896 (1979). The judge ordered Cobb\u2019s conviction reduced to manslaughter. Both the Commonwealth and Cobb appealed and we transferred the appeals to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-15\">Cobb requests that we reverse his conviction and order a new trial on the grounds that (1) the trial judge erroneously instructed the jury on joint venture; (2) evidence of Millyan\u2019s state of mind was improperly excluded; (3) the judge failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>instruct the jury on the possibility of accident; and (4) Millyan\u2019s testimony was erroneously impeached by the faulty introduction of criminal records. .These claims were all decided adversely to the defendants in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millyan, supra </em>at 184-185, and therefore Cobb\u2019s motion for a new trial was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The only issue left is the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal from the reduction of Cobb\u2019s verdict. Rule 25 (b) (2) vests broad power in the trial judge. We defer to the trial judge because he has the advantage of face to face evaluation of the witnesses and the evidence at trial. He is in a far better position than we are to make the judgment required by the rule. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, </em>383 Mass. 543, 557 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">As we stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millyan, supra </em>at 189, rule 25 (b) (2) does not mean that a judge, in deciding whether to reduce a verdict, is confined to the standard used on a motion for a required finding of not guilty. Thus, the Commonwealth\u2019s analysis of the judge\u2019s failure to use this standard is misguided. Nor are we persuaded that the judge abused his discretion in reducing the verdict. The evidence in the record is sufficient to support the judge\u2019s conclusion that, due to his intoxication, Cobb acted in a reckless fashion rather than out of malice. This was not an arbitrary or unreasonable conclusion. Therefore, we will not disturb the reduction of Cobb\u2019s verdict to manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
