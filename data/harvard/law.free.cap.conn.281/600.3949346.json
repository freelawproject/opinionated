The board reversed the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner (commissioner) that the plaintiffs injury was compensable under \u00a7 7-314a by the defendants, the town of Watertown (town) and its insurer, RSKCo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Services, Inc. <em>Hardt </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>95 Conn. App. 52, 60, 895 A.2d 846 (2006). We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The Appellate Court majority opinion sets forth the following facts and procedural history. \u201cAt all relevant times, the plaintiff was a deputy fire chief for the [town\u2019s volunteer fire] department [department]. Members of the department were required to pass annual physical examinations, but there were no additional physical fitness requirements for the department. Although the department did not have a structured physical fitness program, it arranged a weekly open gymnasium basketball program for the exclusive participation of its members. The program was voluntary, but department leadership encouraged its members to participate by announcing the program over department radio and by posting information about it in each of the two department firehouses. The chief of the department characterized the basketball program as a \u2018loosely organized physical fitness program [that] is also recreational.\u2019<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">\u201cOn April 23, 2001, the plaintiff injured his knee while playing basketball in the department\u2019s basketball program. The chief of the department described the plaintiffs injury as \u2018having occurred while he was participating in the voluntary fire department sponsored open gym (physical fitness program).\u2019 The plaintiff subsequently filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d Id., 54-55. After a hearing, the commissioner concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Id., 55. The defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>dants then appealed to the board, which reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The plaintiff appealed from the decision of the board to the Appellate Court, the majority of which concluded that the word \u201c \u2018training\u2019 \u201d as used in \u00a7 7-314a (a) does not mean \u201ctraining for the general physical demands of the position, as opposed to learning about and practicing the skills associated with fighting fires. Although we acknowledge that firefighting requires a certain degree of physical fitness, we are unable to conclude that members of volunteer fire departments are entitled to workers\u2019 compensation for injuries sustained while they are engaged in purely voluntary physical fitness activities.\u201d Id., 60. Accordingly, the Appellate Court, with one judge dissenting, affirmed the decision of the board. Id. This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the word training under \u00a7 7-314a encompasses department sponsored activities intended \u201cto assist the firefighters in their efforts to maintain the level of physical fitness\u201d required for firefighting under local and national guidelines. The plaintiff relies on the definition of \u201c \u2018fire duties\u2019 \u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 7-314 (a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which encompasses certain fire service-specific training and instructional activities, as well as on the public policy arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>discussed in Chief Judge Lavery\u2019s dissenting opinion. Id., 60-62 (Lavery, <em>C. J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Our examination of the record and briefs, and our consideration of the arguments of the parties, persuade us that the judgment of the Appellate Court should be affirmed. The issues were resolved properly in the Appellate Court majority\u2019s concise and well reasoned opinion. Because that opinion fully addresses the arguments raised in this appeal, we adopt it as a proper statement of the issues and the applicable law concerning those issues. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. <em>News America Marketing In-Store, Inc. </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>276 Conn. 310, 314, 885 A.2d 758 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 7-314a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Except as provided in subsections (e) and (f) of this section, active members of volunteer fire departments and active members of organizations certified as a volunteer ambulance service in accordance with section 19a-180 shall be construed to be employees of the municipality for the benefit of which volunteer fire services or such ambulance services are rendered while in training or engaged in volunteer fire duty or such ambulance service and shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission and shall be compensated in accordance with the provisions of chapter 568 for death, disability or injury incurred while in training for or engaged in volunteer fire duty or such ambulance service. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-11\"> We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the claimant was not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits based upon General Statutes \u00a7 7-314a?\u201d <em>Hardt </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>278 Conn. 923, 901 A.2d 1220 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\"> \u201cIn addition, members who participated in the basketball program earned points toward retirement benefits.
