On appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiffs claim that the defendant should have permitted them to use certain net operating losses as a basis for downward modifications on their state income taxes, and that the trial court improperly declined to exercise its equitable powers pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-730,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to permit them to pursue a claim for a refund of overpaid taxes that otherwise was barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly declined to apply the doctrines of equitable estoppel and equitable recoupment. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The record reveals the fo\u00fcowing facts and procedural history. The plaintiffs are Connecticut residents who lived in the town of Wilton at all times relevant to this appeal. Kenneth Fadner, who has a degree in finance, regularly prepared the plaintiffs\u2019 tax returns. In 1992 and 1993, the plaintiffs incurred substantial net operating losses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For federal income tax purposes, the plaintiffs elected to carry back the net operating losses to the years 1989 and 1990.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They subsequently filed amended federal income tax returns for 1989 and 1990, in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>they deducted the net operating losses, reducing their federal adjusted gross income to zero for both years and entitling them to a refund from the federal government. The plaintiffs did not, however, amend their Connecticut tax returns for 1989 and 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Calculation of Connecticut income tax begins with a taxpayer\u2019s federal adjusted gross income with certain modifications. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 12-701(a)(20)-l (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The modifications do not include the subtraction of net operating losses from a taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-701 (a) (20) (B). Nevertheless, the plaintiffs chose to modify their adjusted gross income in 1995 and 1996 by subtracting the net operating losses they had incurred in 1992 and 1993.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In 1995, the plaintiffs took a modification of $3,189,607, and in 1996, a modification of $3,170,061.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">It is undisputed that the modifications were improper under the applicable state tax law,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but the plaintiffs claim that Kenneth Fadner was advised to take the modifications when he called the toll-free number (help line) maintained by the Department of Revenue Ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>vices (department), to assist taxpayers. According to Kenneth Fadner, he had telephoned the help line and asked about whether he could carry back the net operating losses because Connecticut did not have a state income tax until 1991.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiffs claim that a help line representative informed Kenneth Fadner that he could not carry back the losses, but could carry them forward for the years 1994 through 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In May 1999, the defendant informed the plaintiffs via letter that, following an audit of their 1995 and 1996 state income tax returns, it was disallowing the net operating loss modifications taken by the plaintiffs in those years. This required the defendant to add the net operating loss amounts to the plaintiffs\u2019 federal adjusted gross income for Connecticut income tax purposes, which resulted in a total deficiency against the plaintiffs of $26,154.84, including penalties and interest.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the plaintiffs protested the assessments, the department\u2019s appellate division upheld the audit findings of deficiency for 1995 and 1996, and denied their petition for reassessment in March, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The plaintiffs appealed to the trial court pursuant to \u00a7 12-730, challenging the denial of their petition. After a court trial, the trial court concluded that (1) the defendant was not required to allow the plaintiffs to subtract the 1992 and 1993 net operating losses from their adjusted gross income on their 1995 and 1996 returns because net operating losses are not included within the specific modifications permitted by \u00a7 12-701 (a) (20) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>(B), (2) the plaintiffs\u2019 request to file amended tax returns for 1989 and 1990 to claim net operating losses incurred in 1992 and 1993 was barred by General Statutes \u00a7 12-515, the applicable statute of limitations, and (3) the defendant was not estopped from making deficiency assessments and denying the plaintiffs the use of the net operating losses that they had incurred in 1992 and 1993. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly declined to exercise its equitable power to estop the defendant from imposing additional assessments. The plaintiffs also argue that the trial court improperly failed to apply \u201cgeneral equitable principles\u201d to allow them to recoup their overpaid taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">The trial court concluded that the doctrine of equitable estoppel did not bar the defendant from assessing deficiencies against the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs claim that this decision was improper because they relied to their detriment on advice from the tax help fine in determining how to treat net operating losses under the income tax law, which was new at the time. The defendant argues in response that (1) the plaintiffs have failed to meet the factual burden of proving equitable estoppel against a public agency, and (2) even if one of its agents had provided the plaintiffs with mistaken information, the defendant can never be estopped from correcting misinterpretations of the law. We agree with the defendant\u2019s first claim, and conclude that the plaintiffs failed to establish a factual basis for the application of equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">Because tax appeals are de novo proceedings; <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>264 Conn. 286, 294, 823 A.2d 1184 (2003); \u201c[w]e first set forth the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>standard of review and applicable legal principles that guide our resolution of this claim. The party claiming estoppel . . . has the burden of proof. . . . Whether that burden has been met is a question of fact that will not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous. . . . A court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous only in cases in which the record contains no evidence to support it, or in cases in which there is evidence, but the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. . . . The legal conclusions of the trial court will stand, however, only if they are legally and logically correct and are consistent with the facts of the case. . . . Accordingly, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding estoppel only if they involve an erroneous application of the law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Celentano </em>v. <em>Oaks Condominium Assn., </em>265 Conn. 579, 614, 830 A.2d 164 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">\u201cThere are two essential elements to an estoppel\u2014 the party must do or say something that is intended or calculated to induce another to believe in the existence of certain facts and to act upon that belief; and the other party, influenced thereby, must actually change his position or do some act to his injury which he otherwise would not have done.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pet Car Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>150 Conn. 42, 53-54, 184 A.2d 797 (1962). \u201cIn addition, estoppel against a public agency is limited and may be invoked: (1) only with great caution; (2) only when the action in question has been induced by an agent having authority in such matters; and (3) only when special circumstances make it highly inequitable or oppressive not to estop the agency. ... As noted, this exception applies where the party claiming estoppel would be subjected to substantial loss if the public agency were permitted to negate the acts of its agents.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Kimberly-Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>204 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>137, 148, 527 A.2d 679 (1987); see also <em>Dupuis </em>v. <em>Submarine Base Credit Union, Inc., </em>170 Conn. 344, 354, 365 A.2d 1093 (1976) (application of equitable estoppel against government agency is \u201climited and invoked [1] only with great caution, [2] only when the resulting violation has been unjustifiably induced by an agent having authority in such matters, and [3] only when special circumstances make it highly inequitable or oppressive to enforce the . . . regulations\u201d). We previously have held these principles to be applicable to the department of revenue services. <em>Kimberly-Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">A party seeking to justify the application of the estoppel doctrine by establishing that a public agency has induced his actions carries a significant burden of proof. For example, in <em>Dupuis, </em>the town of Groton sought an order compelling the defendant credit union to secure a permit for the construction of a new building on the Groton submarine base. <em>Dupuis </em>v. <em>Submarine Base Credit Union, Inc., </em>supra, 170 Conn. 345. In its defense, the credit union claimed that, prior to beginning construction, its representative had called the town building inspector\u2019s office to inquire specifically about the necessity of a permit, and was told that it did not need one because it was building on federal property. Id., 355. The credit union also claimed that it had telephoned the town building inspector\u2019s office two additional times about issues that had arisen after the project began, and was never told that it needed a permit. Id. This court held that these facts were insufficient to invoke the doctrine of equitable estoppel because the plaintiff, having failed to introduce any evidence to identify whom the project superintendent had spoken to when he had called the inspector\u2019s office, could not show, \u201cby whom [the] reliance ha[d] been unjustifiably induced.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>In this case, the trial court found that the plaintiffs were unable to establish whom Kenneth Fadner had spoken with when he telephoned the tax help line, the date on which he had telephoned the tax help line, or the questions that he had asked the defendant\u2019s representative. The plaintiffs, however, point to the testimony of Elaine Leon, the department\u2019s director of taxpayer services, who stated that taxpayers are entitled to rely on the advice they receive from the taxpayer services division, as evidence that Kenneth Fadner was justified in relying on the advice he received from the tax help line. The plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on Leon\u2019s testimony is unavailing because her testimony established only that <em>if </em>the plaintiffs had received such advice, <em>then </em>they would have been entitled to rely on it. Her testimony does nothing to prove that the plaintiffs in fact received the advice as they claim. Without such evidence in the record, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that there was insufficient evidence that the defendant or its agents had induced the plaintiffs\u2019 actions was clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the trial court properly declined to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel against the defendant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">EQUITABLE RECOUPMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">We turn next to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly refused to exercise its equitable powers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>allow them to offset their past overpayments of income taxes against the deficiencies later assessed by the defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Both parties agree that the plaintiffs\u2019 treatment of the net operating losses was incorrect under the applicable statutes, which resulted in the plaintiffs\u2019 paying more than their share of taxes in 1990 and less than their share of taxes in 1995 and 1996. The plaintiffs argue that, because both the overpayments and the deficiencies arose out of their mistaken treatment of the same net operating losses, they have satisfied the requirements of the doctrine of equitable recoupment as outlined by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Bull </em>v. <em>United States, </em>295 U.S. 247, 262-63, 55 S. Ct. 695, 79 L. Ed. 1421 (1935), and are, therefore, entitled to offset the amount owed to the defendant by the amount overpaid. The defendant contends, in essence, that the doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>trine does not apply to the facts of this case because the events in question constitute more than one transaction, and thus fail to satisfy the requirements of <em>Bull.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Our review of the doctrine of equitable recoupment leads us to conclude that, even if we were to adopt the doctrine in its broadest sense, it is not applicable to the facts of this case. Consequently, we agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Ordinarily, we apply a deferential standard of review to atrial court\u2019s equitable determinations: \u201cThe determination of what equity requires in a particular case, the balancing of the equities, is a matter for the discretion of the trial court. . . . Our standard of review is whether the trial court abused its discretion. ... In determining whether the trial court has abused its discretion, we must make every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fernandes </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>90 Conn. App. 601, 609, 879 A.2d 897, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 927, 883 A.2d 1243 (2005), cert. denied, U.S. , 126 S. Ct. 1585, 164 L. Ed. 2d 312 (2006). The defendant\u2019s argument, however, requires us first to determine whether Connecticut courts have adopted the common-law doctrine of equitable recoupment as it has been applied by the federal judiciary to tax appeals, which presents a question of law to which the plenary standard of review applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">\u201cRecoupment . . . refers to the defendant\u2019s right, in the same action, to cut down the plaintiffs demand, either because the plaintiff has not complied with some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>cross obligation of the contract on which he or she sues or because the plaintiff has violated some legal duty in the making or performance of that contract. . . . The practice serves to avoid needless delay and unnecessary litigation\u201d by permitting a court to examine all aspects of the transaction that is the subject of the action. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Premier Capital, Inc. </em>v. <em>Grossman, </em>68 Conn. App. 51, 58, 789 A.2d 565, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 917, 797 A.2d 514 (2002). Although recoupment has been employed by our courts as a tool of equity despite statutes of limitations since at least the nineteenth century,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> particularly in contract and probate disputes, no Connecticut court to date has addressed the applicability of that doctrine to tax disputes.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>The equitable recoupment doctrine is a form of relief developed by the federal courts and adopted by some state courts. Equitable recoupment is a narrow exception to the legislative policy of barring claims in tax matters by statutes of limitations. It was first applied by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Bull </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 295 U.S. 247, a case involving a probated estate. In <em>Bull, </em>the taxpayer had paid estate taxes on the decedent\u2019s interest in a partnership, and later was assessed a deficiency by the federal government on the basis of its determination that the money should have been classified and taxed as income. Id., 251-52. The Supreme Court, by applying the doctrine of equitable recoupment, permitted the taxpayer to use its previously paid taxes to offset the assessed deficiency despite the passage of the statute of limitations on the taxpayer\u2019s claim for a refund. Id., 263. The court chose to exercise its equitable powers because the retention by the government of money that it is not entitled to is \u201cagainst morality and conscience\u201d; id., 260; as well as \u201cimmoral and amounts in law to a fraud on the taxpayer\u2019s rights.\u201d Id., 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Subsequent Supreme Court cases summarize the doctrine as applicable in situations in which the taxing authority has applied two inconsistent tax theories to the same transaction, and that inconsistency has been challenged as a defense to a timely proceeding.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number><em>States </em>v. <em>Dalm, </em>494 U.S. 596, 608, 110 S. Ct. 1361, 108 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1990) (\u201ca party litigating a tax claim in a timely proceeding may, in that proceeding, seek recoupment of a related, and inconsistent, but now time-barred tax claim relating to the same transaction\u201d); <em>Rothensies </em>v. <em>Electric Storage Battery Co., </em>329 U.S. 296, 299, 67 S. Ct. 271, 91 L. Ed. 296 (1946) (\u201crecoupment is in the nature of a defense arising out of some feature of the transaction upon which the plaintiffs action is grounded\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). These cases also make it clear that the government, as well as taxpayers, may use equitable recoupment as a defense; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>White, </em>301 U.S. 532, 539, 57 S. Ct. 851, 81 L. Ed. 1265 (1937); and that the taxpayer may be treated as a defendant even though he was the party who filed the action. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dalm, </em>supra, 617 (\u201cin a refund action based on the multiple and inconsistent taxation of a single transaction, the taxpayer is to be treated as though she were the defendant even though she is actually the plaintiff\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Thus, in the federal courts, recoupment \u201chas never been thought to allow one transaction to be offset against another, but only to permit a transaction which is made the subject of suit by a plaintiff to be examined in all its aspects, and judgment to be rendered that does justice in view of the one transaction as a whole.\u201d <em>Rothensies </em>v. <em>Electric Storage Battery Co., </em>supra, 329 U.S. 299. The doctrine \u201capplies only in cases that satisfy three elements. First, a single transaction must be the taxable event to be considered in recoupment. Second, the single transaction must be subject to two taxes based upon inconsistent legal theories. Finally, the statute of limitations must bar recoupment, while either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>the government\u2019s asserted deficiency or the taxpayer\u2019s claim for a refund must be timely.\u201d <em>Catalano </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal </em>Revenue, 240 F.3d 842, 844 (9th Cir. 2001); see also <em>Rothensies </em>v. <em>Electric Storage Battery Co., </em>supra, 299-300; <em>Kolom </em>v. <em>United States, </em>791 F.2d 762, 767 (9th Cir. 1986).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Several of our sister states have adopted the federal judiciary\u2019s doctrine of equitable recoupment. See <em>Dept. of State Revenue </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>473 N.E.2d 611, 615 (Ind. 1985); <em>Superior Air Products International, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director, Division of Taxation, </em>9 N.J. Tax 463, 470, 476 (1988), aff'd per curiam, 10 N.J. Tax 238 (App. Div. 1988); <em>Vivigen, Inc. </em>v. <em>Minzner, </em>117 N.M. 224, 231, 870 P.2d 1382 (1994); <em>National Cash Register Co. </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>299 N.Y. 200, 203, 86 N.E.2d 561 (1949); <em>Estate of Kasishke </em>v. <em>Tax Commission, </em>541 P.2d 848, 852-53 (Okla. 1975); <em>Allied Timber Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Revenue, </em>296 Or. 412, 415, 677 P.2d 33 (1984); <em>American Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Revenue, </em>64 Wis. 2d 337, 351-53, 219 N.W.2d 300 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Other state courts have declined to apply the doctrine of equitable recoupment to the facts of cases before them, but seemingly have left open the question of whether their state recognizes the doctrine. See <em>Independent Iron Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization, </em>167 Cal. App. 2d 318, 326, 334 P.2d 236 (1959) (\u201cFor the purposes of this opinion, but without deciding the issue, it may be assumed that the doctrine of equitable recoupment exists in this state. Such an assumption would not assist the appellant, because, under the facts of this case, the doctrine, even in its broadest application, is not applicable.\u201d); <em>Harman\u2019s of Idaho, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission, </em>114 Idaho 740, 742, 760 P.2d 1156 (1988) (\u201cThe taxpayer contends that this is an appropriate case for the application of the doctrine of equitable recoupment.

Co. of Kentucky, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revenue Cabinet, </em>173 S.W.3d 910, 915 (Ky. App. 2004) (\u201cwhile it is arguable that Kentucky has implicitly recognized equitable recoupment ... it has also been held that if equitable relief is not provided for by statute then it is unavailable\u201d [citation omitted]), review denied, 2005 Ky.

Commw. 398, 406, 376 A.2d 309 (1977) (describing equitable recoupment as \u201ca creature of the federal judiciary\u201d but concluding same transaction requirement not met). At least one state has specifically declined to adopt the doctrine of equitable recoupment. See <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Limbach, </em>67 Ohio St. 3d 90, 92-93, 616 N.E.2d 204 (1993) (rejecting doctrine based on courts\u2019 lack of jurisdiction to grant equitable remedies in tax cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">In the present case, we need not decide whether to adopt the doctrine of equitable recoupment, because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>applies \u201conly where the [g] ovemment has taxed a <em>single transaction, item, or taxable event </em>under two inconsistent theories.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dalm, </em>supra, 494 U.S. 605 n.5. The threshold issue with respect to whether the doctrine of equitable recoupment is applicable to the facts of this case is, therefore, whether the events in question constitute more than one taxable event. The plaintiffs claim that the taxable event in question is the treatment of the net operating losses, which necessarily affects more than one tax year. The defendant argues in response that \u201cthe plaintiffs are attempting to offset [a] 1995 and 1996 assessment with a claim that relates to 1990 and not to the 1995 and 1996 tax years.\u201d Under the defendant\u2019s reasoning, the taxable event is the imposition of the income tax.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Because we agree with the defendant, we leave for another day the question of whether to adopt the doctrine of equitable recoupment.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">There are two approaches to defining \u201ctransaction\u201d in the equitable recoupment case law. The first is followed by the majority of state jurisdictions that have adopted equitable recoupment and is modeled on the federal doctrine, which requires that the same transaction, literally, must be the basis for both the claim for refund and the claim of deficiency. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dalm, </em>supra, 494 U.S. 605-606; <em>Rothensies </em>v. <em>Electric Storage Battery Co., </em>supra, 329 U.S. 300-301; <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 F.2d 233, 236 (3d Cir. 1965); <em>Superior Air Products International, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director, Division of Taxation, </em>supra, 9 N.J.

We note that a minority of state courts, including the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which has had the opportunity to examine the doctrine of equitable recoupment on several occasions, have adopted a broader definition of \u201c \u2018same transaction,\u2019 \u201d so that the term encompasses \u201cany transaction in the tax period involved in either a claim by the taxpayer for refund or by the state for additional assessment . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>American Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Revenue, </em>supra, 64 Wis. 2d 353; see also <em>Estate of Kasishke </em>v. <em>Tax Commission, </em>supra, 541 P.2d 853 (concluding, on basis of reasoning of <em>American Motors </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number><em>Corp., </em>that payment of estate tax constitutes single transaction); <em>Dept. of Revenue </em>v. <em>Van Engel, </em>230 Wis. 2d 607, 614-16, 601 N.W.2d 830 (acknowledging Wisconsin\u2019s adoption of broadened definition of same transaction), review denied, 231 Wis. 2d 374, 607 N.W.2d 290 (1999). Under either definition of transaction, however, the question of whether the net operating losses in the present case constitute more than one taxable event is unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Our research has revealed little case law on this specific question. No federal court has determined squarely whether treatment of net operating losses over a period of more than one tax year meets the same transaction requirement.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The two state appellate level courts that directly have addressed this issue support the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>dant\u2019s claim that the transaction in question is the imposition of the income tax, not the treatment of the net operating losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\"><em>In Harman\u2019s of Idaho, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission, </em>supra, 114 Idaho 741, the defendant tax commission assessed a tax deficiency after it determined that the taxpayer improperly had carried forward certain net operating losses without first carrying them back for three years, as required by the applicable statute. The taxpayer claimed that the amount that it had overpaid in the years when it should have carried back the losses, should have been used to offset the subsequent deficiency assessment. Id. The Idaho Supreme Court determined that the taxpayer\u2019s claim for refund was barred by the three year statute of limitations, which was specifically targeted to claims for credit or refund relating to overpayment attributable to a net operating loss carryback. Id., 742. The court rejected the claim that the deficiency assessment reopened the time period for making a refund claim relating to the years in which the taxpayer should have claimed the net operating losses. Id., 741-42. The court also concluded that the doctrine of equitable recoupment did not apply because \u201c[t]he [net operating losses] are not a taxable event, but merely the basis for deductions. The [net operating losses] do not generate a tax, but are only a means of avoiding the payment of some tax. The [net operating losses] were not subjected to two taxes based on inconsistent theories.\u201d Id., 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Similarly, in <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Appeals Tribunal, </em>214 App. Div. 2d 238, 242-43, 633 N.Y.S.2d 226 (1995), appeal denied, 87 N.Y.2d 811, 666 N.E.2d 1058, 644 N.Y.S.2d 144 (1996), the court declined to apply principles of equitable recoupment to a company\u2019s attempt to offset part of a deficiency assessed against it for 1986 by the amount that it had overpaid in 1978, due to an error in its utilization of net operating losses. The New York court stated that the doctrine of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>equitable recoupment could not be applied because \u201cthat doctrine only applies when the overpayment to be recouped was made during the period under review, and thus can be considered part of the same \u2018transaction ....\u201d\u2019 Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">We find the reasoning of the Idaho and New York courts with regard to the definition of transaction convincing. Net operating losses are not, as the Idaho court noted, \u201ca taxable event, but merely the basis for deductions.\u201d <em>Harman\u2019s of Idaho, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission, </em>supra, 114 Idaho 743. We, therefore, conclude that, even if we were to assume, without deciding, that the doctrine of equitable recoupment should be adopted, it is not applicable to the present case because the plaintiffs failed to satisfy the \u201csame transaction\u201d requirement under even the broader definition of transaction applied by a minority of courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">We note that, were we to hold for the plaintiffs, we would in effect be endorsing an even broader definition of transaction than that adopted by the minority of state courts. Such a result would all but eviscerate the statute of limitations on refund claims and the finality of tax settlements in our state. As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Rothensies: </em>\u201cIt probably would be all but intolerable, at least Congress has regarded it as ill-advised, to have an income tax system under which there never would come a day of final settlement and which required both the taxpayer and the [government to stand ready forever and a day to produce vouchers, prove events, establish values and recall details of all that goes into an income tax contest. Hence, a statute of limitation is an almost indispensable element of fairness as well as of practical administration of an income tax policy.\u201d <em>Rothensies </em>v. <em>Electric Storage Battery Co., </em>supra, 329 U.S. 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">The court also recognized that \u201c[a]s statutes of limitation are applied in the field of taxation, the taxpayer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>sometimes gets advantages and at other times the [government gets them. Both hardships to the taxpayers and losses to the revenues may be pointed out. They tempt the equity-minded judge to seek for ways of relief in individual cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">\u201cBut if we should approve a doctrine of recoupment of the breadth here applied we would seriously undermine the statute of limitations in tax matters. In many, if not most, cases of asserted deficiency the items which occasion it relate to past years closed by statute, at least as closely as does the item involved here. . . . The same is true of items which form the basis of refund claims. Every assessment of deficiency and each claim for refund would invite a search of the taxpayer\u2019s entire tax histoiy for items to recoup. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">\u201cWe cannot approve such encroachments on the policy of the statute out of consideration for a taxpayer who for many years failed to file or prosecute its refund claim. If there are to be exceptions to the statute of limitations, it is for Congress rather than for the courts to create and limit them.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 302-303. Adoption of a more expansive definition of transaction also would contravene our state\u2019s policy of encouraging finality of tax decisions, which ultimately serves both the taxpayer and the state. See, e.g., <em>Chatterjee </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, 277 </em>Conn. 681, 696, 894 A.2d 919 (2006) (income tax scheme\u2019s \u201cthree year statute of limitations balances the state\u2019s important interest in financial stability with the plaintiffs\u2019 interest in recouping their allegedly improper payment of taxes\u201d); see also <em>National CSS, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>195 Conn. 587, 597-98, 489 A.2d 1034 (1985) (noting with regard to one year statute of limitations for seeking refund of excess real property tax payments that \u201c[p]ublic policy requires . . . that this court not permit taxes collected or paid to be the subject of perpetual litigation, at any time, to suit the convenience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>of the taxpayer\u201d). Thus, in the context of net operating losses, which, as the plaintiffs note, necessarily affect multiple years of taxable income, the benefits of a narrower definition of \u201csame transaction\u201d are particularly significant. Our conclusion may not comport with the <em>plaintiffs\u2019 </em>notion of fairness and equity, but the \u201capplication of the statute of limitations in tax matters is often not \u2018fair.\u2019 Rather, it is applied for salutary reasons of predictability and repose . . . <em>Superior Air Products International, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director, Division of Taxation, </em>supra, 9 N.J.

The trial court\u2019s holding was based on an opinion by the United States Tax Court and an unpublished opinion from Washington, both of which support the proposition that equitable estoppel does not apply to erroneous advice relating to construction of statutory provisions. See <em>Neri </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>54 T.C. 767 (1970); <em>Chiawana, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Revenue, </em>Court of Appeals of Washington, Division Three, No. 21559-8-III (January 27, 2004). This court previously has not adopted that proposition, and it is unnecessary for us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>to consider it now, because the plaintiffs have failed to carry their factual burden of establishing equitable estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\"> The plaintiffs did not specifically refer to the doctrine of equitable recoupment before the trial court or in the tax appeal proceeding. Although we are not \u201cbound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial\u201d; Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; we have in the past addressed issues that were \u201cfunctionally,\u201d albeit not specifically, raised by parties in trial court proceedings.

In addition, the plaintiffs\u2019 continued references to <em>Federal Deposit Ins.

We, therefore, conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for equitable recoupment was raised at least functionally in the trial court proceedings, so that it is preserved for our consideration in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b754-8\"> The defendant also argues that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is barred by the statute of limitations because it is properly characterized as a claim for refund. The plaintiffs do not dispute that if they had brought an independent claim for refund, such a claim would have been barred. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-515. They argue instead that, because their claim was raised as a defense to the deficiency assessment, it is a claim for recoupment. We agree that the plaintiffs request recoupment, rather than a refund, so their claim is not barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b755-6\"> See <em>Beecher </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>55 Conn. 419, 12 A. 401 (1887).

It rests on the principle that both sides of a transaction should be settled at one time in order to prevent circuity of actions.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Genovese </em>v. <em>J. N.

Corp. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>251 Conn. 748, 760-61, 741 A.2d 956 (1999). We disagree. The primary issue in <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>was whether the trial court had jurisdiction to consider the claims of the plaintiff, the receiver of two insolvent banks, challenging certain tax deficiency assessments, when the banks had not filed amended tax returns and claims for refunds. The decision addressed the question of \u201cwhether the [receiver] may utilize the same legal theory that would have underlain such a claim for refund, not for the purpose of seeking a refund of the taxes that the banks paid, but in order to offset additional taxes in the form of deficiency assessments imposed by the commissioner.\u201d Id. This court held that, although the receiver had forfeited its right to seek a refund due to its failure to comply with time limits for such a claim, it had a right to regain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>additional taxes imposed by deficiency assessments that the banks had paid under protest. Id., 759-60. Although the remedy fashioned was similar to an equitable recoupment remedy, <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>was not a case about two inconsistent taxes being applied to the same transaction. Rather, the decision was based on the scope of the trial court\u2019s de novo review of the receiver\u2019s tax appeal under General Statutes \u00a7 12-237, which outlined the tax appeal process. Although this court recognized the broad equitable powers that may be exercised by a court hearing a de novo tax appeal, the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that we adopted the doctrine of equitable recoupment in <em>Federal Deposit Ins.

Some courts also consider, as a separate requirement, the need for the court in which the recoupment claim is heard to independently have jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim, so that the equitable recoupment claim is not the sole basis of jurisdiction.

In <em>National Cash Register Co., </em>a dispute over the amount <em>of </em>city sales tax a company owed arose when the city issued a deficiency determination in 1945 against the company for the years 1935 to 1940. The company responded with a claim for refund or offset based on overpayments by the company in the years 1936 to 1940. Id., 202. Although the claims would have been barred by the statute of limitations if the company had brought an independent refund action, the court allowed the company to setoff against the deficiency the amount it had overpaid because the city had opened the question of the company\u2019s sales tax liability in the years at issue. Id., 203. The opinion is very brief and does not provide the details of the transactions at issue, but is often cited in other cases and characterized as an expansion of the doctrine of equitable recoupment because it seemingly defines transaction as an entire year or tax period. See, e.g., <em>Superior Air Products International, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director, Division of Taxation, </em>supra, 9 N.J. Tax 474; <em>Vivigen, Inc. </em>v. <em>Minzner, </em>supra, 117 N.M. 230; <em>Dept. of Revenue </em>v. <em>Van Engel, </em>supra, 230 Wis. 2d 615-16. We note that our reading of <em>National Cash Register Co. </em>does not lead us to conclude that the New York court, did, in fact, expand the doctrine, because it specifically stated: \u201cHere the city reopened the matter of the sales tax liability of the vendor for the period September 1, 1935, to December 31, 1940, and assessed a tax deficiency against it for that period. The vendor, as we think, was thereby given an equitable right to plead against the city <em>a recoupment claim for taxes of the same type which the vendor (as it alleges) had erroneously paid to the comptroller in the same period.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>National Cash Register Co. </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>supra, 203.

The court noted in dicta that even if it had found that the inconsistent theories prong of the equitable recoupment test had been met, it would not have applied the doctrine because \u201c[c]ourts should not lump together related, but nonetheless separate transactions so that the facts of a case can be viewed as one transaction as a whole.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

As the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit correctly noted in <em>Parker, </em>in lumping together such transactions, \u201ca court risks bringing about the all but intolerable circumstance of having a tax system under which there would never come a day of final settlement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Parker </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">One District Court has indicated, in dicta, that it may classify treatment of net operating losses as a taxable event. See <em>Lockheed Sanders, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>862 F. Sup. 677, 683 (D.N.H. 1994) (listing as separate taxable events \u201cthe ability to utilize previous net operating loss deductions, credits and interest to offset income, derived in other years\u201d). In <em>Lockheed Sanders, Inc., </em>however, the court also referred to net operating loss \u201ccarrybacks and carryforwards\u201d as \u201csuperseding events giving rise to the refund claim\u201d; id., 682; which does not seem to support the theory of net operating losses as a taxable event. The court declined to apply equitable recoupment on other grounds, so it did not reach the issue before us in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
