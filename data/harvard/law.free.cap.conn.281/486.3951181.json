We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In connection with two separate victims, the defendant was charged, in four informations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with fourteen counts of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (8). The trial court consolidated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>four cases against the defendant for trial, and the jury found the defendant guilty of all charges. Thereafter, the defendant moved for judgments of acquittal and, on April 14, 2004, the trial court granted the motion with respect to count four of the information in Docket No. CR02-0004040-T. See footnote 3 of this opinion. The trial court subsequently rendered judgments of conviction in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict on the remaining charges, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The juiy reasonably could have found the following relevant facts. From September, 2000, through October, 2001, the defendant was employed by the New Haven board of education as a Latin teacher at Hill Regional Career Magnet High School (Career School), which is a secondary school located in the city of New Haven. The first victim, N.R., was a student enrolled in Career School from September, 2000, through June, 2002, and the second victim, P.L., was a student enrolled in Career School from January, 2001, through June, 2002.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In September, 2000, N.R. was sixteen years old<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and a junior enrolled in the defendant\u2019s Latin class. At some point in the fall of that year, the defendant began to tutor N.R. in the subjects of Latin and math. N.R. would meet the defendant in the Career School library almost every school day to receive tutoring in these subjects. Eventually, the defendant and N.R. began to develop a personal relationship. N.R. began to confide in the defendant concerning her personal problems, such as her strained relationship with her mother. Likewise, the defendant began to confide in N.R. concerning his family and his relationship with his wife and his two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>children. Although the defendant often embraced his female students, including N.R., the physical contact between the defendant and N.R. became more frequent and intimate as their personal relationship deepened. The defendant began to embrace N.R. more tightly and sometimes pinched her buttocks, even when other students were present. Additionally, the defendant often commented on N.R.\u2019s physical appearance. For example, the defendant frequently told N.R. that she had an \u201coutrageous body\u201d and that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t let it go to waste.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">One afternoon, while N.R. and her friend S.B. were in the back comer of the Career School library talking to the defendant, the defendant suddenly kissed N.R. on the lips. Although N.R. was surprised by the kiss, she enjoyed it and was flattered by the defendant\u2019s attention. Sometime thereafter, the defendant offered to give N.R. and S.B. a ride home from school. Both girls accepted the defendant\u2019s offer, and the defendant drove them to downtown New Haven, where he dropped S.B. off at a bus stop. The defendant then asked N.R. if she would like to go for a drive, and N.R. responded that she \u201cdidn\u2019t care, [because she] didn\u2019t have to be right home . . . .\u201d The defendant drove N.R. to Long Wharf, which is located in the city of New Haven. The defendant and N.R. walked along the beach at Long Wharf, until they reached a secluded area, where they sat down on a nearby log. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>began to mb N.R.\u2019s legs, and told her to sit on his lap. N.R. complied, and the defendant kissed her on the lips. The defendant proceeded to pull down the front of N.R.\u2019s dress, revealing her breasts, and then kissed her breasts. N.R. \u201cjust kind of sat there and let him\u201d kiss her for a few minutes. Afterward, the defendant dropped N.R. off near her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The defendant and N.R. continued to maintain a sexual relationship through the summer of 2001. One afternoon in July, 2001, the defendant drove N.R. to East Rock Park, which is located in the city of New Haven. While parked in the defendant\u2019s car, the defendant began to mb N.R.\u2019s legs and to kiss her lips. At some point, he moved his hands beneath N.R.\u2019s skirt, and began to mb her vagina over her underwear. The defendant eventually shifted N.R. \u2019s underwear aside, and penetrated her vagina digitally. N.R. testified that she had \u201cliked it\u201d and had \u201clet him do it.\u201d At another point in July, 2001, the defendant drove N.R. to Foote School, which is located in the city of New Haven. After parking his car on the street, the defendant began to mb N.R.\u2019s legs and to kiss her lips, eventually moving his hands beneath her skirt and penetrating her vagina digitally. On another occasion, the defendant performed oral sex on N.R. in a secluded comer of the Fairfield University Library, which is located in the city of Fairfield. At some point in July or August, 2001, while the defendant and N.R. were parked in a car in the parking lot of East Rock Park, the defendant asked N.R. \u201cwhen [she] was going to suck his dick,\u201d and she responded that she \u201cwasn\u2019t going to.\u201d Thereafter, the defendant and N.R. discontinued their sexual relationship because N.R. had realized that \u201cit wasn\u2019t right what was going on . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Meanwhile, on January 2, 2001, P.L., who was then sixteen years old,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> enrolled in Career School as a junior. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>On her first day of school, P.L. was introduced to the defendant by a fellow student. At this first meeting, the defendant told P.L. that she was \u201ca very pretty girl . . . .\u201d Although P.L. was not a student in the defendant\u2019s Latin class, she often spent her free time in the Career School library, where the defendant\u2019s office was located. The defendant and P.L. soon began to meet in the library almost everyday, where they would talk about \u201ceverything,\u201d including P.L.\u2019s dysfunctional relationship with her family and her relationship with her boyfriend. P.L. considered the defendant to be her counselor and friend. Indeed, whenever the defendant saw P.L., he would embrace her, hold her hand or kiss her on the cheek.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Sometime during the last week of classes at Career School in June, 2001, P.L. visited the defendant in his classroom. The defendant was sitting at his desk working on his computer, and P.L. sat down beside him. Although other students were present in the classroom, the defendant grabbed P.L.\u2019s hand and intertwined his fingers with hers. P.L. began to flip through the defendant\u2019s daily planner, which was located on his desk, and immediately noticed a photograph of N.R. inside. The defendant explained to P.L. that N.R. had given the photograph to him, and chastised P.L. for her failure to do the same. At that point, the bell signaling the end of classes rang and the remaining students dispersed from the classroom. P.L. rose from her seat, and leaned forward to hug the defendant goodbye. The defendant embraced P.L. tightly, and proceeded to kiss her on the neck, the cheek and the lips. P.L. was shocked, surprised and amazed by the kiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">During the summer of 2001, the defendant was employed as a math instructor in Aspirations for Higher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Learning (Aspirations), a six week long college preparatory program administered by the New Haven Public Schools. During this same time period, P.L. was enrolled as a student in Aspirations. On the morning of June 9, 2001, the defendant picked P.L. up at her home and drove her to the Aspirations orientation to take a placement exam in connection with the Aspirations program. After the exam, the defendant drove P.L. home, parking his car some distance from her house.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant proceeded to kiss P.L. on the lips, to fondle her breasts and buttocks, and to penetrate her vagina digitally. Thereafter, the defendant unzipped his pants and exposed his penis. The defendant told P.L., \u201cI\u2019m going to make you do this,\u201d and he pushed her head toward his penis. Although P.L. was surprised, she put the defendant\u2019s penis in her mouth for a few seconds. Afterward, as P.L. was leaving the defendant\u2019s car, he kissed her goodbye and slapped her buttocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">On another occasion in the summer of 2001, the defendant drove P.L. to the Fairfield University Library. The defendant explained to her that \u201clibraries made him homy,\u201d and directed her to a secluded comer on the second floor of the library. The defendant proceeded to kiss P.L. on the lips and to mn his hands over her body. The defendant then informed P.L. that it is \u201can honor when a woman opens or spreads her legs out to a man . . . .\u2019\u2019In response, P.L. opened her legs, whereupon the defendant unbuttoned his pants and penetrated her vagina with his penis. Afterward, the defendant and P.L. proceeded to the basement of the library, where they again had penile-vaginal sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">At another point in the summer of2001, the defendant drove P.L. to the Whitlock Farms bookstore, which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>located in the town of Bethany. After perusing the books, the defendant directed P.L. to a secluded hallway at the back of the store, where he lifted her skirt and penetrated her vagina with his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">During the summer of 2001, the defendant and P.L. also had sexual intercourse at East Rock Park on three separate occasions. On the first occasion, the defendant and P.L. walked to a secluded area of the park behind a large boulder, where they had penile-vaginal sexual intercourse. On the second occasion, the defendant drove P.L. to the summit of East Rock Park, where he and P.L. had penile-vaginal sexual intercourse in the defendant\u2019s parked car. On the third occasion, the defendant and P.L. returned to the sheltered area behind the large boulder, where P.L. performed oral sex on the defendant and had penile-vaginal sexual intercourse with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Sometime after classes had commenced at Career School in August or September, 2001, the defendant suggested to P.L. that they should jog together on weekday mornings. P.L. agreed, and she arranged to meet the defendant the next day at approximately 6:15 a.m. at the Holocaust Memorial (memorial), which is located on Whalley Avenue in the city of New Haven. When P.L. arrived at the memorial as planned, the defendant told her that he wanted to show her something in the surrounding woods. P.L. and the defendant walked along a trail until they reached a secluded area in the bushes, where they proceeded to have penile-vaginal sexual intercourse. The defendant and P.L. continued to meet at the memorial nearly every morning until October 24, 2001. Although they jogged together occasionally, on most days, they had penile-vaginal sexual intercourse instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Although N.R. and P.L. were classmates, they were not friends. Indeed, the two girls avoided each other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>throughout the spring and fall of 2001. This was because the defendant often told P.L. to steer clear of N.R. because she \u201chated [P.L.\u2019s] guts\u201d and likely would \u201ckick [her] and throw [her] down the stairs . . . .\u201d Likewise, the defendant often told N.R. that she and P.L. \u201cwouldn\u2019t mix well because [P.L.] was kind of snotty . . . .\u201d Despite the defendant\u2019s efforts, at some point in October, 2001, N.R. approached P.L. and said, \u201cI don\u2019t like you, you don\u2019t like me, let\u2019s find out why we\u2019re not friends.\u201d The two girls began to talk, and soon discovered that the defendant had been maintaining a sexual relationship with each of them. Thereafter, N.R. and P.L. decided to confront the defendant with their newly acquired knowledge, and to inform school authorities about the defendant\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">On October 24, 2001, when N.R. and P.L. confronted the defendant in the Career School library, the defendant admitted that he had had sexual intercourse with P.L. After P.L. became very upset, N.R. escorted her out of the library into the hallway. At that point, A.D., a friend of P.L.\u2019s, persuaded both N.R. and P.L. to inform the school authorities of the defendant\u2019s misconduct. The three girls proceeded to the nurse\u2019s office, where A.D. asked the school nurse, Allison Daley, whether a student should report a sexual relationship with a teacher. Daley responded that \u201cit should be reported because no teacher or any faculty should be having any kind of relationship with a student that is sexual\u201d in nature. Thereafter, N.R. and P.L. informed various school officials and police officers that they each had had sexual intercourse with the defendant. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">WHETHER THE DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTIONS VIOLATE THE RIGHT OF PRIVACY GUARANTEED BY THE FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The defendant first claims that \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (8) is invalid on its face and as applied to the facts of the present case because it violates his fundamental right of privacy guaranteed by both the federal and state constitutions, which he claims includes the right to engage in noncommercial consensual sexual intercourse with individuals over the age of consent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The state responds that neither the federal nor the state constitution guarantees a right of sexual privacy but, in any event, even if such a right exists, it does not protect sexual acts between individuals who are situated in an inherently coercive relationship, such as the teacher-student relationship. We need not decide whether a fundamental right of sexual privacy exists generally because we agree with the state that, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>such a right exists, it does not protect sexual intimacy in the context of an inherently coercive relationship, such as the teacher-student relationship, wherein consent might not easily be refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">As a preliminary matter, we note that the defendant\u2019s claim encompasses both a facial challenge and an as applied challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (8). A facial challenge essentially is \u201ca claim that the law is invalid in toto \u2014 and therefore incapable of any valid application.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>268 Conn. 508, 522 n.21, 847 A.2d 862, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 969, 125 S. Ct. 424, 160 L. Ed. 2d 340 (2004). By contrast, an as applied challenge is a claim that the law is invalid as applied to the defendant under the facts of that particular case. Id. Thus, \u201cin order to challenge successfully the facial validity of a statute, [the challenging] party [must] demonstrate as a threshold matter that the statute may not be applied constitutionally to the facts of his case.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Packer </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number><em>Board of Education, </em>246 Conn. 89, 106, 717 A.2d 117 (1998). Because the defendant\u2019s facial challenge necessarily must fail if we conclude that \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (8) may be applied constitutionally to the facts of the present case; see footnote 10 of this opinion; we limit our analysis to the defendant\u2019s as applied challenge to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The constitutionality of a statute presents a question of law over which our review is plenary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 520. It is well established that \u201ca validly enacted statute carries with it a strong presumption of constitutionality, [and that] those who challenge its constitutionality must sustain the heavy burden of proving its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . The court will indulge in every presumption in favor of the statute\u2019s constitutionality .... Therefore, [w]hen a question of constitutionality is raised, courts must approach it with caution, examine it with care, and sustain the legislation unless its invalidity is clear.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Before addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we review the following relevant statutory provisions. Under our statutory scheme, a minor generally has the legal capacity to consent to sexual intercourse once he or she attains the age of sixteen. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) (prohibiting sexual intercourse with individual under sixteen years of age, unless actor is less than two years older than individual); see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-ld (\u201cthe terms \u2018minor\u2019, \u2018infant\u2019 and \u2018infancy\u2019 shall be deemed to refer to a person under the age of eighteen\u201d). Accordingly, the legislature has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>determined that, under most circumstances, an individual who is sixteen years of age or older is \u201can adult capable of making an intelligent choice in matters relating to sex.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Perruccio, </em>192 Conn. 154, 164, 471 A.2d 632, appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 801, 105 S. Ct. 55, 83 L. Ed. 2d 6 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">With this background in mind, we turn to \u00a7 53a-71 (a), which provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and ... (8) the actor is a school employee and such other person is a student enrolled in a school in which the actor works or a school under the jurisdiction of the local or regional board of education which employs the actor . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (13) defines the term \u201c \u2018[s]chool employee\u2019 \u201d as \u201ca teacher, substitute teacher, school administrator, school superintendent, guidance counselor, psychologist, social worker, nurse, physician, school paraprofessional or coach employed by a local or regional board of education or a private elementary or secondary school or working in a public or private elementary or secondary school.\u201d Accordingly, \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (8) prohibits a secondary schoolteacher from having sexual intercourse with a student enrolled in the school in which that teacher is employed, regardless of the age of the student and regardless of the allegedly consensual nature of the sexual relationship.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Right of Sexual Privacy under the Federal Constitution</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The defendant first claims that his convictions under \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (8) violate his fundamental right of sexual privacy guaranteed by the constitution of the United States. Specifically, the defendant claims that, in <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 578, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508 (2003), the United States Supreme Court explicitly recognized that the right of privacy includes the right to engage in private noncommercial consensual sexual intercourse with individuals over the age of consent. Because the defendant was convicted under \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (8) for having consensual sexual intercourse with two of his students, N.R and P.L., both of whom were over the age of consent when the sexual intercourse took place, the defendant claims that his convictions are unconstitutional. We conclude that the right of privacy guaranteed by the federal constitution does not encompass the right of a teacher to have sexual intercourse with students enrolled in the school system in which the teacher is employed. We further conclude that \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (8) rationally is related to a legitimate government interest and, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s convictions are constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\u201cWhile there is no right of privacy found in any specific guarantee of the [constitution, the [United States Supreme] Court has recognized that zones of privacy may be created by more specific constitutional guarantees and thereby impose limits upon government power. . . . [T]he [court] has recognized a right to privacy in the penumbra of the Bill of Rights, specifically in the protections of the first, third, fourth and fifth amendments. . . . Justice Brand\u00e9is has referred to this right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>as the right to be let alone \u2014 the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u201c[Aside from the unreasonable search and seizure privacy cases, the] other right of privacy cases, while defying categorical description, deal generally with substantive aspects of the [fourteenth [a]mendment. . . . The activities detailed as being within this definition . . . [include] matters relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education. In these areas it has been held that there are limitations on the [spates\u2019 power to substantively regulate conduct. . . . [T]he Supreme Court has extended their protection only to the most basic personal decisions. . . . Nor has the Supreme Court been quick to expand these rights to new fields.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Michaela Lee R., </em>253 Conn. 570, 598-99, 756 A.2d 214 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">In <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Hardwick, </em>478 U.S. 186, 190, 106 S. Ct. 2841, 92 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1986), the United States Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a Georgia statute that criminalized private noncommercial consensual sexual intercourse between adults of the same sex. The court first considered whether the \u201c[federal [constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. The court observed that the constitution provides heightened protection only to \u201cthose fundamental liberties that are \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\u2019 \u201d; id., 191; or that are \u201c \u2018deeply rooted in this [n]ation\u2019s history and tradition.\u2019 \u201d Id., 192. Because the proscription against homosexual sodomy has \u201cancient roots\u201d; id.; the court concluded that it would be, \u201cat best, facetious,\u201d to claim that a right to engage in such conduct is \u201c \u2018deeply rooted in this [njation\u2019s history and tradition\u2019 or \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\u2019 . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 195. Having concluded that the Georgia statute did not implicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>a fundamental right, the court addressed whether the statute was rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Id., 196. The sole rational basis for the statute, the court observed, was \u201cthe presumed belief of the majority of the electorate in Georgia that homosexual sodomy is immoral and unacceptable.\u201d Id. The court concluded that Georgia\u2019s interest in preserving morality was legitimate, and that the prohibition on homosexual sodomy rationally was related to this interest. The court noted that, \u201c[t]he law ... is constantly based on notions of morality, and if all laws representing essentially moral choices are to be invalidated under the [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause, the courts will be very busy indeed.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Seventeen years later, in <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>supra, 539 U.S. 562, the United States Supreme Court again considered the constitutionality of a statute that criminalized private noncommercial consensual sexual intercourse between adults of the same sex. The court recognized that, in <em>Bowers, </em>it explicitly had upheld the constitutionality of such statutes. The court concluded, nonetheless, that in <em>Bowers </em>the court had \u201cmisapprehended the claim of liberty there presented to it\u201d; id., 567; by asking whether the statute violated a fundamental right to engage in a particular sexual act. Instead, the court determined, the issue properly should be characterized as whether freely consenting adults have a liberty interest in intimate personal relationships fostered in the privacy of their own home. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">With the question thus properly framed, the court reconsidered the validity of its holding in <em>Bowers. </em>The court observed that, in upholding the constitutionality of the Georgia statute at issue in that case, it had relied principally on the fact that \u201cfor centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral. The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>behavior, and respect for the traditional family.\u201d Id., 571. Although \u201c[for <em>many </em>persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles\u201d; id.; the court concluded that these principles are not dispositive. This is because the issue presented in <em>Bowers, </em>like the issue presented in <em>Lawrence, </em>was not whether the proscribed sexual act historically has been viewed as immoral, but, rather, \u201cwhether the majority may use the power of the [s]tate to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law.\u201d Id. In answering this question, the court observed that its \u201cprior cases make two propositions abundantly clear. First, the fact that the governing majority in a [s]tate has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice; neither history nor tradition could save a law prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional attack. Second, individual decisions by married persons, concerning the intimacies of their physical relationship, even when not intended to produce offspring, are a form of liberty protected by the [d]ue [pjrocess [cjlause of the [fourteenth [a]mendment. Moreover, this protection extends to intimate choices by unmarried as well as married persons.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 577-78. In light of these two principles, the court concluded that <em>\"Bowers </em>was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today. It ought not to remain binding precedent. [Bowers] should be and now is overruled.\u201d Id., 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Having concluded that it was not constrained by the precedent established in <em>Bowers, </em>the court next addressed whether the statute at issue in <em>Lawrence </em>was constitutional. The court observed that, \u201c[t]he present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>refused. It does not involve public conduct or prostitution. . . . The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle.\u201d Id. In light of these facts, the court concluded that \u201c[t]he petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The [s]tate cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government.\u201d Id. Because the \u201cstatute further[ed] no legitimate state interest which [could] justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual\u201d; id.; the court concluded that it was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The defendant claims that <em>Lawrence </em>stands for the proposition that sexual privacy is a fundamental right entitled to strict scrutiny under the due process clause of the federal constitution. We need not determine whether <em>Lawrence </em>established a fundamental right of sexual privacy under the federal constitution because, even assuming arguendo that it did so, the defendant\u2019s sexual conduct in the present case would not be protected by that right. The defendant engaged in sexual intercourse with two victims, N.R. and P.L., both of whom were students enrolled in the school system in which the defendant was employed as a teacher. In light of the disparity of power inherent in the teacher-student relationship, we conclude that both victims were situated in an inherently coercive relationship with the defendant wherein consent might not easily be refused. Cf. <em>Loomis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>68 Fed. Cl. 503, 519 (2005) (\u201cthe nature of the relationship [between lieutenant colonel and private first class] while not directly within a chain of command, is such that consent might not easily be refused and thus it is outside of the liberty interest protected by <em>Lawrence\u201d'), </em>appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>dismissed, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 23206 (August 31, 2006); <em>Talbert </em>v. <em>State, </em>367 Ark. 262, 269, 239 S.W.3d 504 (2006) (defendant did not have fundamental right under <em>Lawrence </em>to use position of trust and authority as clergyman to engage in sexual conduct); <em>Commonwealth v. Mayfield, </em>574 Pa. 460, 472, 832 A.2d 418 (2003) (\u201c[s]exual contact between correctional staff and inmates is obviously rife with the possibility of coercion, both subtle and overt, given the extensive power guards exercise over inmates\u201d and, accordingly, <em>Lawrence </em>is inapplicable). Accordingly, the right of sexual privacy purportedly delineated in <em>Lawrence </em>would not apply to the circumstances of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">We next address whether \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (8) rationally is related to a legitimate government interest. See <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>259 Conn. 855, 888, 792 A.2d 774 (2002) (if statute \u201cdoes not implicate a fundamental right, we review [it] under a rational basis test\u201d and \u201c[i]n such circumstances, the state must show only that the law is not arbitrary or capricious, that is, that it bears a reasonable relation to some legitimate state purpose\u201d). The state contends that the government has a legitimate interest in promoting a safe school environment. The state further contends that \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (8) rationally is related to this interest because it prohibits a teacher from using his or her position of authority to pursue sexual relationships with students enrolled in the school system in which the teacher is employed. We agree. It is beyond cavil that the government has a legitimate interest in providing a safe and healthy educational environment for elementary and secondary school students. See, e.g., <em>Wolman </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>433 U.S. 229, 236, 97 S. Ct. 2593, 53 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1977) (\u201cwe have no difficulty with . . . [concluding that a state has a] legitimate interest in protecting the health of its youth and in providing a fertile educational environment for all the schoolchildren of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>[s]tate\u201d), overruled in part on other grounds <em>by Mitchell </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>530 U.S. 793, 835, 120 S.

Ed. 2d 660 (2000); <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 647, 376 A.2d 359 (1977) (\u201cConnecticut has for centuries recognized it as her right and duty to provide for the proper education of the young\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). To this end, the legislature reasonably could have concluded that school employees \u201care given unique access to students, and are thereby vested with great trust and confidence by the school, parents, and public, and [the legislature could have] sought to preserve or strengthen that trust by unequivocally prohibiting school employees from misusing their access to students as a conduit for sex.\u201d <em>Ex parte Morales, </em>03-05-00489-CR (Tex. App. July 21, 2006) (Texas statute that prohibited teachers from having sexual intercourse with students rationally was related to legitimate government interest). Moreover, the legislature reasonably could have concluded that a sexually charged learning environment likely would confuse, disturb and distract students, thereby undermining the quality of education in the state. Id. Accordingly, we conclude that the proscription on sexual intercourse between school employees and students in \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (8) rationally is related to a legitimate government interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Right of Sexual Privacy under the State Constitution</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The defendant next claims that the state constitution provides greater protection for the right of privacy than does the federal constitution, and that this protection includes the right of a teacher to engage in consensual sexual intercourse with students over the age of consent enrolled in the school system in which the teacher is employed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u201cIt is well established that federal constitutional and statutory law establishes a minimum national standard for the exercise of individual rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of protection for such rights. . . . Furthermore, although we often rely on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the amendments to the constitution of the United States to delineate the boundaries of the protections provided by the constitution of Connecticut, we have also recognized that, in some instances, our state constitution provides protections beyond those provided by the federal constitution, as that document has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. . . . The analytical framework by which we determine whether, in any given instance, our state constitution affords broader protection to our citizens than the federal constitutional minimum is well settled. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>[222 Conn. 672, 684-86, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992)], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>we enumerated the following six factors to be considered in determining that issue: (1) persuasive relevant federal precedents; (2) the text of the operative constitutional provisions; (3) historical insights into the intent of our constitutional forebears; (4) related Connecticut precedents; (5) persuasive precedents of other state courts; and (6) contemporary understandings of applicable economic and sociological norms, or as otherwise described, relevant public policies.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>275 Conn. 534, 560-61, 881 A.2d 290 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S 1082, 126 S. Ct. 1798, 164 L. Ed. 2d 537 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The first <em>Geisler </em>factor, federal precedent, favors the state. As explained in part I A of this opinion, even if we were to assume arguendo that a fundamental right of sexual privacy exists under the federal constitution, that right would not extend to sexual acts performed on or by \u201cpersons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused.\u201d <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>supra, 539 U.S. 578. In light of our determination in part I A of this opinion that the teacher-student relationship is an. inherently coercive relationship wherein consent might not easily be refused, the defendant\u2019s sexual conduct in the present case is not entitled to federal constitutional protection.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>The second <em>Geisler </em>factor, the textual approach, also favors the state. The right of privacy, which cannot be found in any specific guarantee either of the federal or state constitution, is protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution; <em>Paul </em>v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 712-13, 96 S. Ct. 1155, 47 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1976); and the due process clause of article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut. The text of these two constitutional provisions is virtually identical. Compare U.S. Const., amend. XIV, \u00a7 1 (\u201c[n]o [s]tate shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law\u201d), with Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8 (\u201c[n]o person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law\u201d). The textual similarity between the federal and state due process clauses undermines the defendant\u2019s claim that the state constitution affords greater protection of the right of sexual privacy than the federal constitution and, instead, \u201csupports] a common source<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and, thus, a common interpretation of the provisions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">The third <em>Geisler </em>factor, the historical approach, is neutral. Neither the defendant nor the state has identified any relevant evidence of the intent of our constitutional forebears with respect to the right of privacy. Id., 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The fourth <em>Geisler </em>factor, Connecticut precedent, favors the state. \u201cIn determining the scope of our state constitution\u2019s due process clauses, we have taken as a point of departure those constitutional or quasi-consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>tutional rights that were recognized at common law in this state prior to 1818.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>254 Conn. 799, 838, 761 A.2d 705 (2000). The defendant has not provided any historical evidence that a right of sexual privacy between a teacher and a student was recognized in this state prior to 1818. Additionally, the defendant has not pointed to any case law in which this court has construed the right of privacy protected by the due process clause of the state constitution to be broader than its federal counterpart. Cf. id., 837-38 (although state constitution may provide greater substantive due process protection than federal constitution, plaintiff failed to establish that \u201cour state constitution contains greater rights of \u2018family autonomy\u2019 than does the federal constitution\u201d). In support of his constitutional claim, the defendant relies on cases such as <em>State </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>251 Conn. 636, 645, 742 A.2d 775 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 924, 121 S. Ct. 299, 148 L. Ed. 2d 240 (2000), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 646-53, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992), in which this court concluded that article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9, of the state constitution provide greater protection against unreasonable searches and seizures than the fourth amendment of the federal constitution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Although these cases support the proposition that the state constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures is broader than its federal counterpart, they do not support the proposition that the state constitutional right of privacy protected by article first, \u00a7 8, provides greater protection than the federal constitutional right of privacy guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The fifth <em>Geisler </em>factor, sister state precedent, favors the state. As the defendant points out, various state courts have concluded that the right of sexual privacy is a fundamental right protected by their respective state constitutions. See, e.g., <em>B. B. </em>v. <em>State, </em>659 So. 2d 256, 258 (Fla. 1995) (statute that criminalized minor\u2019s \u201ccarnal intercourse with [another] unmarried minor of previous chaste character\u201d violated right of privacy protected by Florida constitution); <em>Powell </em>v. <em>State, </em>270 Ga. 327, 336, 510 S.E.2d 18 (1998) (statute that criminalized private noncommercial consensual sodomy violated right of privacy protected by Georgia constitution); <em>Gryczan </em>v. <em>State, </em>283 Mont. 433, 447-56, 942 P.2d 112 (1997) (statute that criminalized consensual sexual acts between adults of same sex violated right of privacy protected by Montana constitution); <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Sundquist, </em>926 S.W.2d 250, 258-66 (Tenn. App. 1996) (statute that criminalized consensual homosexual acts violated right of privacy protected by Tennessee constitution). These courts, however, have construed their state constitutions to protect the right of freely consenting adults to engage in noncommercial sexual acts in the privacy of their own homes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Notably, no state has concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>that a state constitutional right of sexual privacy exists when a significant disparity of power is inherent in the prohibited sexual relationship, such as the disparity of power endemic to the teacher-student relationship. See part I A of this opinion. Indeed, as the defendant concedes, numerous states have enacted penal statutes prohibiting elementary or secondary schoolteachers from having sexual intercourse with their students, regardless of the allegedly consensual nature of the sexual relationship. See, e.g., Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-14-125 (a) (6) (Michie 2006); Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7 709.15 (3) (West Sup. 2006); Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 21-3520 (a) (8) (Sup. 2005); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, \u00a7 253 (2) (F) (West 2006); Mich. Comp. Laws Serv. \u00a7 750.520d (1) (e) (LexisNexis 2003); Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 97-29-3 (LexisNexis 2006); Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 201.540 (2005); N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30-9-13 (D) (2) (Michie 2004); N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14-27.7 (b) (LexisNexis 2005); Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, \u00a7 1111 (A) (8) (West 2002); Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 21.12 (Vernon Sup. 2006); Wash. Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 9A.44.093 (1) (b) (West Sup. 2005); Wis. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 948.095 (West 2005). Accordingly, we conclude that this <em>Geisler </em>factor tips in favor of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Finally, the sixth <em>Geisler </em>factor, economic and sociological considerations, favors the state. Elementary and secondary schoolteachers are entrusted with the important task of cultivating and educating impressionable young minds. Thus, not only are teachers afforded unique access to students, they also are vested with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>significant authority and control over those students. As such, a teacher easily could use his or her position of trust and authority to coerce a student into a sexual relationship. Indeed, in light of the significant disparity of power inherent in the teacher-student relationship, a student reasonably may not be able to refuse a teacher\u2019s sexual advances. Because the state has a strong interest in protecting and educating the elementary and secondary school students of this state, and because the defendant has failed to highlight any societal interest furthered by a recognition of a state constitutional right of sexual privacy between a teacher and a student, we conclude that this <em>Geisler </em>factor weighs heavily in favor of the state. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>226 Conn. 514, 540, 628 A.2d 567 (1993) (\u201c[i]n effect, [the sixth Geisler] factor directs our attention to considerations of public policy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">None of the <em>Geisler </em>factors weighs in favor of the defendant\u2019s claim that the state constitution confers a fundamental right of sexual privacy on an elementary or secondary schoolteacher to engage in consensual sexual intercourse with students over the age of consent enrolled in the school system in which the teacher is employed. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY CONSOLIDATED THE CASES OF N.R. AND P.L. AND IMPROPERLY ADMITTED EVIDENCE OF UNCHARGED MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly consolidated the cases of N.R. and P.L. because it improperly concluded that, if the cases had been tried separately, evidence of the defendant\u2019s uncharged sexual misconduct with each victim would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>admissible in the case of the other to establish a common scheme or plan.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Alternatively, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly consolidated the cases of N.R. and P.L. under <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>204 Conn. 714, 719-23, 529 A.2d 1260 (1987), because the crimes charged did not involve discrete, easily distinguishable factual scenarios and were of a brutal and shocking nature. Lastly, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of the defendant\u2019s uncharged sexual misconduct with a third victim, R.S., to establish a common scheme or plan in the cases of N.R. and P.L. because the nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship with R.S. was distinct from the nature of the defendant\u2019s relationships with both N.R. and P.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The state responds that the trial court properly consolidated the cases of N.R. and P.L. because, if the cases had been tried separately, the evidence of the defendant\u2019s uncharged sexual misconduct with each victim would have been admissible to establish a common scheme or plan in the case of the other. Alternatively, the state maintains that the trial court properly exercised its discretion to consolidate the two cases under <em>Boscarino. </em>Lastly, the state claims that the trial court properly admitted evidence of the defendant\u2019s uncharged sexual misconduct with R.S. to establish a common scheme or plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">We conclude that the trial court properly determined that, if the cases of N.R. and P.L. had been tried separately, evidence of the defendant\u2019s uncharged sexual misconduct with each victim would have been admissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>ble to establish a common scheme or plan in the case of the other. Because separate trials would have provided the defendant with no significant benefit, we conclude that the trial court properly consolidated the cases of N.R. and P.L. We further conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of the defendant\u2019s uncharged sexual misconduct with R.S. to establish a common scheme or plan in the cases of N.R. and P.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claims. The defendant originally was charged in five informations. Four of the informations concerned N.R. and P.L. and alleged a total of nine counts of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (8). The fifth information involved a third victim, R.S., and alleged one count of sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (6).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On August 13, 2003, the state filed a motion to consolidate the five cases against the defendant for trial, to which the defendant objected. On November 17, 2003, the trial court, <em>Devlin, J., </em>held a hearing on the issue of joinder. At the hearing, the state claimed that consolidation was appropriate under the factors set forth in <em>Boscarino, </em>because the charges involved discrete, easily distinguishable factual scenarios, the crimes charged were not brutal or shocking in nature, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>and the trial would not be lengthy or complex. Additionally, the state claimed that consolidation of the five cases would not prejudice the defendant because evidence of the defendant\u2019s uncharged sexual misconduct with each victim would be admissible to establish a common scheme or plan in the cases of the other victims. The defendant agreed that the charges involving N.R. should be consolidated and tried jointly, and that the charges involving P.L. should be consolidated and tried jointly. The defendant maintained, however, that the cases of N.R., P.L. andR.S. should be tried separately to avoid undue prejudice to the defendant. Specifically, with respect to the cases of N.R. and P.L., the defendant claimed that the factual similarity between the charges, namely, sexual intercourse in East Rock Park or the Fairfield University Library with a female student enrolled in Career School, would make it difficult for the jury \u201cto keep [the charges] straight . . . .\u201d Additionally, the defendant claimed that the sexual assault charges were brutal and shocking in nature. The defendant further maintained that evidence of his uncharged sexual misconduct with each victim would not be admissible to establish a common scheme or plan in the cases of N.R., P.L. or R.S. because the alleged misconduct was not distinctive and, therefore, could not be characterized as a \u201csignature crime.\u201d Lastly, the defendant claimed that it would be prejudicial to consolidate the case of R.S., which involved one charge of sexual assault in the fourth degree, with the cases of N.R. and P.L., which both involved multiple charges of sexual assault in the second degree, because the defendant\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct with R.S. was significantly less severe and less frequent than was his alleged sexual misconduct with N.R. and P.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">With respect to the cases of N.R. and P.L., the trial court concluded that evidence of the defendant\u2019s uncharged sexual misconduct with each victim would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>be admissible to establish a common scheme or plan in the case of the other. The court noted that the alleged sexual misconduct had occurred during the same relevant time period and shared key factual similarities, such as the enrollment status and age of the victim. As such, the trial court concluded that the defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct \u201cdemonstrates a plan on the part of the defendant to, basically, exploit his position as a teacher to . . . [seduce], and then, sexually assault the students,\u201d and that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. Accordingly, the trial court granted the state\u2019s motion to consolidate the cases of N.R. and P.L.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court denied the state\u2019s motion to consolidate the case of R.S., however, \u201cbecause of the difference in the degree of sexual conduct alleged.\u201d The trial court nonetheless concluded that evidence of the defendant\u2019s uncharged sexual misconduct with R.S. would be admissible to establish a common scheme or plan in the consolidated case of N.R. and P.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Consolidation of Cases concerning N.R. and P.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly consolidated the cases of N.R. and P.L. for trial. General Statutes \u00a7 54-57 provides: \u201cWhenever two or more cases are pending at the same time against the same party in the same court for offenses of the same character, counts for such offenses may be joined in one information unless the court orders otherwise.\u201d See also Practice Book \u00a7 41-19 (\u201c[t]he judicial authority may, upon its own motion or the motion of any party, order that two or more informations, whether against the same defendant or different defendants, be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>tried together\u201d). \u201cIn deciding whether to sever informations joined for trial, the trial court enjoys broad discretion, which, in the absence of manifest abuse, an appellate court may not disturb. . . . The defendant bears a heavy burden of showing that the denial of severance resulted in substantial injustice, and that any resulting prejudice was beyond the curative power of the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>210 Conn. 78, 94-95, 554 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912, 109 S.

Consolidation under such circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>stances, however, may expose the defendant \u201cto potential prejudice for three reasons: First, when several charges have been made against the defendant, the jury may consider that a person charged with doing so many things is abad [person] who must have done something, and may cumulate evidence against him .... Second, the jury may have used the evidence of one case to convict the defendant in another case even though that evidence would have been inadmissible at a separate trial. . . . [Third] joinder of cases that are factually similar but legally unconnected . . . presents] the . . . danger that a defendant will be subjected to the omnipresent risk . . . that although so much [of the evidence] as would be admissible upon any one of the charges might not [persuade the jury] of the accused\u2019s guilt, the sum of it will convince them as to all.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>270 Conn. 337, 374-75, 852 A.2d 676 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Despite the existence of these risks, this court consistently has recognized \u201ca clear presumption in favor of joinder and against severance . . . and, therefore, absent an abuse of discretion . . . will not second guess the considered judgment of the trial court as to the joinder or severance of two or more charges.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Accordingly, we first address whether the trial court properly concluded that, if the cases of N.R. and P.L. had been tried separately, evidence of the defendant\u2019s uncharged sexual misconduct with one victim would have been admissible to establish a common scheme or plan in the case of the other. \u201cAs a general rule, evidence of prior misconduct is inadmissible to prove that a criminal defendant is guilty of the crime of which the defendant is accused. . . . Such evidence cannot be used to suggest that the defendant has a bad character or a propensity for criminal behavior. ... On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>other hand, evidence of crimes so connected with the principal crime by circumstance, motive, design, or innate peculiarity, that the commission of the collateral crime tends directly to prove the commission of the principal crime, is admissible. The rules of policy have no application whatever to evidence of any crime which directly tends to prove that the accused is guilty of the specific offense for which he is on trial. . . . We have developed a two part test to determine the admissibility of such evidence.

Second, the probative value of the evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u201cWhen evidence of other offenses is offered to show a common plan or design the marks which the uncharged and the charged offenses have in common must be such that it may be logically inferred that if the defendant is guilty of one he must be guilty of the other. ... To guide this analysis, we have held that [e]vidence of prior sex offenses committed with persons other than the prosecuting witness is admissible to show a common design or plan where the prior offenses (1) are not too remote in time; (2) are similar to the offense charged; and (3) are committed upon persons similar to the prosecuting witness. . . . We are more liberal in admitting evidence of other criminal acts to show a common scheme or pattern in sex related crimes than other crimes.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>272 Conn. 798, 820-21, 865 A.2d 1135 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The defendant concedes that both the first and third factors are satisfied in the present case because the defendant\u2019s sexual misconduct with N.R. and P.L. occurred during the same relevant time period and both victims were similar in age and circumstance. The defendant contends, however, that the second factor is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>not satisfied because the charged and uncharged offenses are not similar in character. He points out that his sexual misconduct with P.L. \u201cwas more extreme and far more frequent than [his sexual] activity involving [N.R.].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In support of this claim, the defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 352-68, wherein we concluded that the trial court improperly had denied the defendant\u2019s motion in limine to exclude evidence of uncharged sexual misconduct involving three victims, Julia S., Kristin C. and Kaitlyn M., in the case of a fourth victim, Sarah S., because \u201cSarah S.\u2019s relationship with the defendant differed in several important respects from his relationship with the other girls\u201d and because \u201cthere were few similarities between [the defendant\u2019s] abuse of Sarah S. and his abuse of the other girls.\u201d Id., 358. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Ellis </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In <em>Ellis, </em>the defendant, a softball coach, was charged, inter alia, with ten counts of sexual misconduct with Sarah S., the younger sister of a softball player whom the defendant had coached. Id., 339-40, 346. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion in limine to exclude evidence of uncharged sexual misconduct involving Julia S., Kristin C. and Kaitlyn M., all of whom were players on the defendant\u2019s softball team. Id., 354, 361. We concluded that the trial court improperly had denied the motion because, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s relationship with Sarah S. differed in several key respects from his relationships with the other girls.\u201d Id., 360. Specifically, \u201cSarah S., unlike the other girls, was not a member of [the defendant\u2019s] softball team, did not have frequent and continuous contact with the defendant as a player, did not take weekly private lessons with the defendant over a period of several years, did not develop a close personal relationship with the defendant and did not regard him as a confidant. Even more significantly, she did not feel compelled, as did the other girls, to cultivate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>or continue a relationship with the defendant following the abuse because of his ability to assist her in obtaining a college softball scholarship.\u201d Id., 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Moreover, the defendant\u2019s sexual misconduct with Sarah S. was far more frequent and severe than was his sexual misconduct with the other three victims. The defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of Sarah S. consisted of \u201ca wide range of misconduct, including: (1) \u2018talking dirty\u2019 on the telephone and attempted phone sex; (2) multiple incidents of touching her breasts, thighs and in between her legs; (3) masturbating and ejaculating in'her presence; (4) attempting to force her to perform oral sex; (5) attempting to force his tongue into her mouth; (6) digital penetration; (7) attempting to climb on top of her while she was lying in bed; and (8) repeated requests that she \u2018pleasure\u2019 him.\u201d Id., 359. By contrast, there only was one incident of sexual abuse involving Julia S., two involving Kristin C., and one involving Kaitlyn M. Id. \u201cIn the cases of Julia S. and Kristin C., the defendant grabbed and fondled the victims\u2019 breasts. In the case of Kaitlyn M., the defendant made sexual comments, touched her leg and kissed her. He also attempted to force his tongue into her mouth and told her that he loved her in ways that she could not understand.\u201d Id., 359-60. Although \u201cthe defendant\u2019s abuse of Julia S., Kristin C. and Kaitlyn M. bore some similarities, it had very little in common with his [frequent and severe] abuse of Sarah S.\u201d Id., 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The defendant concedes that, unlike the victims at issue in <em>Ellis, </em>both victims in the present case shared a similar relationship with the defendant. At the time of the misconduct, both N.R. and P.L. were sixteen year old female students enrolled in Career School who had developed a personal, confidential and sexual relationship with the defendant. The defendant claims, however, that, pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 352-68, his sexual misconduct with N.R. and P.L. lacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>sufficient similarity to be admissible under the common scheme or plan exception because his sexual misconduct with P.L. was far more frequent and severe than his sexual misconduct with N.R. We disagree. The defendant\u2019s sexual relationships with both N.R. and P.L. began at Career School with intimate sexual embraces. The defendant first kissed N.R. in the late spring of her junior year while she and the defendant were in the library of Career School. Likewise, the defendant first kissed P.L. in the late spring of her junior year while she and the defendant were in an empty classroom in Career School. The defendant had sexual intercourse with N.R. in a car parked in East Rock Park, and in a car parked outside of Foote School, by penetrating her vagina digitally. Similarly, the defendant had sexual intercourse with P.L. in a car parked in East Rock Park, and in a car parked outside of P.L.\u2019s home, by means of digital and penile vaginal penetration. The defendant performed oral sex on N.R. in a secluded comer on the second floor of the Fairfield University Library. Similarly, the defendant performed oral sex on P.L., and had penile-vaginal sexual intercourse with P.L., in a secluded corner on the second floor of the Fairfield University Library. On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s sexual misconduct with N.R. and P.L. was sufficiently similar to permit the jury to infer that, if he was guilty of the offenses involving one victim, then he also was guilty of the offenses involving the other. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Morowitz, </em>200 Conn. 440, 443, 512 A.2d 175 (1986) (\u201c[w]hen evidence of prior misconduct is offered to show a common plan or design, the marks which the [charged] and the [uncharged] offenses have in common must be such that it may be logically inferred that if the defendant is guilty of one he must be guilty of the other\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">We recognize that the defendant\u2019s sexual misconduct with P.L. was more frequent than his sexual misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>with N.R. Specifically, N.R. testified that she had had sexual intercourse with the defendant on three separate occasions, whereas P.L. testified that she had had sexual intercourse with the defendant on numerous occasions. In light of the striking qualitative similarity between the defendant\u2019s misconduct with the two victims, we conclude that this quantitative distinction, standing alone, is insufficient to support the defendant\u2019s claim that the offenses were not similar in character. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>James G., </em>268 Conn. 382, 394, 844 A.2d 810 (2004) (although uncharged misconduct was more frequent and severe than charged misconduct, trial court properly admitted evidence to establish defendant\u2019s common scheme or plan to abuse his daughters sexually); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hauck, </em>172 Conn. 140, 146-47, 374 A.2d 150 (1976) (although uncharged misconduct was less frequent and severe than charged misconduct, trial court properly admitted evidence to establish defendant\u2019s common scheme or plan to extort sexual favors from female students in exchange for passing grades).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Moreover, given the marked similarity between the defendant\u2019s behavior with both N.R. and P.L., we further conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the probative value of this evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>264 Conn. 617, 664, 835 A.2d 895 (2003) (\u201c[i]n light of the marked similarities between the charged and uncharged misconduct, the probative value of the latter was significant in regard to the issue of common plan or scheme\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>George B., </em>258 Conn. 779, 793, 785 A.2d 573 (2001) (trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that probative value of uncharged sexual misconduct evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect, even though charged conduct involved greater degree of force).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that, if the cases of N.R. and P.L. had been tried separately, evidence of the defendant\u2019s sexual misconduct with each victim would have been admissible to establish a common scheme or plan in the case of the other. Consequently, because the defendant was not substantially prejudiced by joinder of the cases for trial, we conclude that the trial court properly consolidated the cases of N.R. and P.L. for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Evidence of Uncharged Sexual Misconduct with R.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of the defendant\u2019s uncharged sexual misconduct with R.S. to establish a common scheme or plan in the cases of N.R. and P.L. The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. At the defendant\u2019s trial, the state moved, outside the presence of the jury, to introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s uncharged sexual misconduct with R.S. to establish a common scheme or plan. As an offer of proof, the state represented that R.S. was a student enrolled in Career School during the 2000-2001 academic year, and that, during this time period, the defendant had embraced R.S. in a sexual manner on multiple occasions and had made statements to R.S. that were sexual in nature. The defendant objected to the admission of this evidence, claiming that it did not establish a common scheme or plan and that its prejudicial effect exceeded its probative value. The trial court concluded that the evidence was \u201crelevant to establish a common plan or scheme on the part of the defendant to have inappropriate sexual conduct [and] conversations with female students, high school-aged students\u201d and that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Thereafter, R.S. testified that she was a student enrolled in her junior year at Career School during the 2000-2001 academic year. In the third semester of her junior year, she and her best friend, P.L., had a conversation with the defendant in the library of Career School in which the defendant told them \u201cthat since [they] were virgins [they] should have sex with someone around his age because, I guess, because they are more experienced at his age.\u201d The defendant \u201calso said maybe a while later, that if [R.S. and P.L.] were to say anything about any of the conversations that [they] had, he wouldn\u2019t get in trouble because he has money, and . . . he was going to school, he has degrees and everything, so it wouldn\u2019t affect him.\u201d R.S. also testified that, on several occasions, the defendant had embraced her in a sexual manner when she encountered him in the hallways of Career School. For example, on one occasion, the defendant had wrapped his arms around R.S. and then \u201cpicked [her] up off the ground by holding [her] butt, behind.\u201d R.S. testified that it was \u201cnot a normal hug that you would give to somebody,\u201d that she \u201cdidn\u2019t like it at all.\u201d On at least four other occasions, the defendant had given R.S. hugs that she described as \u201ckind of tight,\u201d in which he pressed his chest against her breasts, and his penis against her vagina. Although R.S. informed her mother and brother about the defendant\u2019s conduct, she did not notify officials at Career School.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Prior to the admission of R.S.\u2019s testimony, the trial court gave the jury a limiting instruction. The court instructed the jury that it only could consider R.S.\u2019s testimony to the extent that it found her testimony to be believable, and \u201cthat it logically, rationally and conclusively supported the issues for which it [had been offered],\u201d namely, the defendant\u2019s alleged \u201ccommon plan or scheme to sexually abuse high school-aged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>girls.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The trial court reiterated this limiting instruction in its final charge to the jury.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">As previously explained, although evidence of prior misconduct generally is inadmissible \u201cto prove that a criminal defendant is guilty of the crime of which the defendant is accused,\u201d it is admissible only if it is \u201cso connected with the principal crime by circumstance, motive, design, or innate peculiarity, that the commission of the collateral crime tends directly to prove the commission of the principal crime .... We have developed a two part test to determine the admissibility of such evidence. First, the evidence must be relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions. . . . Second, the probative value of the evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\u201cWhen evidence of other offenses is offered to show a common plan or design the marks which the uncharged and the charged offenses have in common must be such that it may be logically inferred that if the defendant is guilty of one he must be guilty of the other. ... To guide this analysis, we have held that [e]vidence of prior sex offenses committed with persons other than the prosecuting witness is admissible to show a common design or plan where the prior offenses (1) are not too remote in time; (2) are similar to the offense charged; and (3) are committed upon persons similar to the prosecuting witness. . . . We are more liberal in admitting evidence of other criminal acts to show a common scheme or pattern in sex related crimes than other crimes.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>supra, 272 Conn. 820-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The defendant claims that his uncharged sexual misconduct with R.S. does not satisfy the second or third factors because it was less severe than his sexual misconduct with N.R. and P.L., and his relationship with R.S. was \u201cvastly different than [his] alleged intimate and confidential relationships with N.R. and P.L.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>are not persuaded. R.S., like both N.R. and P.L., was a female student enrolled in her junior year at Career School when the defendant\u2019s sexual misconduct took place. Thus, the defendant had unique access to, and was in a position of authority and control over, all three victims. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hauck, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 146 (student victims similarly situated because defendant teacher used \u201chis position of authority to obtain or to seek to obtain sex-related favors in return for a passing grade in his science course\u201d); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>76 Conn. App. 410, 418, 819 A.2d 871 (victims similarly situated because defendant was in position of professional authority over them), cert. denied, 264 Conn. 912, 826 A.2d 1156 (2003). Moreover, the defendant\u2019s sexual misconduct with R.S. was similar to the initial stages of his sexual misconduct with both N.R. and P.L. At first, the defendant had intimate personal conversations with N.R. and P.L. in the library of Career School. Later, he began to embrace both victims more frequently, intimately and tightly when he encountered them in the hallways of Career School. Although the defendant\u2019s sexual misconduct with R.S. did not progress beyond this initial stage, the jury reasonably could have inferred from R.S.\u2019s testimony that his misconduct ceased only after she rebuffed his sexual advances and reported his behavior to her mother and brother. Accordingly, contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, the fact that R.S. suffered less severe sexual misconduct than N.R. and P.L. \u201cdoes not illustrate a behavioral distinction of any significance.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>James G., </em>supra, 268 Conn. 394; id. (common scheme or plan testimony by witness admissible when defendant\u2019s early abuse of witness was similar to abuse of victim); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>230 Conn. 43, 62-63, 644 A.2d 887 (1994) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">We next address whether the trial court improperly concluded that the probative value of R.S.\u2019s testimony outweighed its prejudicial effect. \u201cWe consistently have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>indicated that [t]he primary responsibility for . . . determin[ing] whether [prior misconduct] evidence is more probative than prejudicial rests with the trial court, and its conclusion will be disturbed only for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . Moreover, [w]hen the trial court has heard a lengthy offer of proof and arguments of counsel before performing the required balancing test, has specifically found that the evidence was highly probative and material, and that its probative value significantly outweighed the prejudicial effect, and has instructed the jury on the limited use of the evidence in order to safeguard against misuse and to minimize the prejudicial impact ... we have found no abuse of discretion . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>269 Conn. 481, 502, 849 A.2d 760 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In the present case, the state presented an offer of proof as to the anticipated testimony of R.S., and the trial court heard lengthy oral arguments from both the state and the defendant with respect to the probative value versus the prejudicial effect of this testimony. The court concluded that the \u201cprobative value . . . does exceed its prejudicial effect, principally on the basis of the fact that we\u2019re talking about alleged victims that are essentially identical to each other and in close time frame.\u201d Moreover, prior to the admission of R.S.\u2019s testimony and again during its final charge, the trial court instructed the jury as to the limited purpose for which it could consider the evidence of the defendant\u2019s uncharged sexual misconduct with R.S. See footnotes 20 and 21 of this opinion. Although this evidence certainly carried with it some degree of prejudice, we are not persuaded that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that its probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>dence of the defendant\u2019s uncharged sexual misconduct with R.S. to establish a common scheme or plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">CONSTANCY OF ACCUSATION TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Lastly, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly admitted the constancy of accusation testimony of S.C., A.D. and K.J.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> because such testimony \u201cserves no legitimate purpose in the case of a consensual sexual relationship between consenting adults, where the conduct is illegal solely due to the parties\u2019 relationship.\u201d Alternatively, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly admitted the constancy of accusation testimony of S.C. and K.J. because P.L. confided in both witnesses only after she had formed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>plan to inform school authorities about the defendant\u2019s misconduct and, therefore, their testimony was akin to \u201cpostcomplaint\u201d testimony. Finally, the defendant claims that the prejudicial effect of the constancy of accusation testimony adduced from all three witnesses outweighed its probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The state responds that, because constancy of accusation testimony is admissible to establish the fact and timing of a sexual assault, and because sexual intercourse between a teacher and a student in these circumstances constitutes a sexual assault in violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (8), the trial court properly permitted S.C., A.D. and K. J. to testify as constancy of accusation witnesses. The state further maintains that, because P.L. had confided in S.C. and K.J. before she filed an official complaint with the police, the trial court properly admitted their testimony. Lastly, the state claims that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the probative value of the constancy of accusation testimony outweighed its prejudicial effect. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude the state from introducing any constancy of accusation testimony because, inter alia, \u201c[t]he testimony of more than one constancy witness [would] be cumulative and unnecessarily prejudicial,\u201d and \u201c[t]he historical rationale and policy reasons for permitting so-called \u2018constancy\u2019 testimony ... to rebut an implication of \u2018recent fabrication\u2019 \u201d are inapplicable to the present case because P.L. had informed most individuals \u201cabout her alleged sexual encounters with the defendant on or about the same day that she made those allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>public at school.\u201d The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">At trial, P.L. testified that she had had sexual intercourse with the defendant on numerous occasions between June 9 and October 24, 2001. She further testified that, during this time period, she had informed three individuals \u2014 S.C., A.D. and K.J. \u2014 about her sexual relationship with the defendant. Although P.L. had confided in A.D. throughout the summer and fall of 2001, she did not confide in K.J. or S.C. until sometime in mid-October after she and N.R. had resolved to confront the defendant and to inform officials at Career School about the defendant\u2019s sexual misconduct. On October 24, 2001, a few days after P.L. had confided in K.J. and S.C., N.R. and P.L. confronted the defendant and reported his sexual misconduct to school officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">At the conclusion of P.L.\u2019s testimony, the state moved, outside the presence of the jury, to introduce constancy of accusation testimony from S.C., A.D. and K.J.

[EJvidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Samuels, </em>273 Conn. 541, 547, 871 A.2d 1005 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Before addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claims, we review the history and purpose of the constancy of accusation doctrine. The constancy of accusation doctrine \u201ctraces its roots to the \u2018fresh complaint\u2019 rule\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 294; \u201c[t]he narrow purpose of [which] was to negate any inference that because the victim had failed to tell anyone that she had been [sexually assaulted], her later assertion of [sexual assault] could not be believed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 296. \u201cBecause juries were allowed \u2014 sometimes even instructed \u2014 to draw negative inferences from the woman\u2019s failure to complain after an assault . . . the doctrine of fresh complaint evolved as a means of counterbalancing these negative inferences. Used in this way, the fresh complaint doctrine allowed the prosecutor to introduce, during the case-in-chief, evidence that the victim had complained soon after the [sexual assault]. Its use thereby forestalled the inference that the victim\u2019s silence was inconsistent with her present formal complaint of [assault]. ... In other words, evidence admitted under this doctrine effectively served as anticipatory rebuttal, in that the doctrine often permitted the prosecutor to bolster the credibility of the victim before her credibility had first been attacked. . . . The fresh complaint doctrine thus constituted a rare exception to the common-law rule that prohibited rehabilitative evidence in the absence of an attack on the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 303, we observed that the state and the victim both have a legitimate interest in \u201cprotect[ing] against the unwarranted, but nonetheless persistent, view that a sexual assault victim who does not report the crime cannot be trusted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>testify trathfully about the incident.\u201d On the other hand, we observed that \u201ca defendant has an interest in not being unreasonably burdened by such accrediting or supporting evidence, which . . . generally is not admissible in the trial of crimes other than sexual assault.\u201d Id., 302. In light of these competing interests, we rejected the then existing rule that a person to whom a sexual assault victim had complained could provide substantive testimony with respect to the incident. See id., 303-304. Instead, we concluded that \u201ca person to whom a sexual assault victim has reported the assault may testify only with respect to the fact and timing of the victim\u2019s complaint; any testimony by the witness regarding the details surrounding the assault must be strictly limited to those necessary to associate the victim\u2019s complaint with the pending charge, including, for example, the time and place of the attack or the identity of the alleged perpetrator. In all other respects, our current rules remain in effect. Thus, such evidence is admissible only to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony and not for substantive purposes. Before the evidence may be admitted, therefore, the victim must first have testified concerning the facts of the sexual assault and the identity of the person or persons to whom the incident was reported. In determining whether to permit such testimony, the trial court must balance the probative value of the evidence against any prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\u201cIn addition, the defendant is entitled to an instruction that any delay by the victim in reporting the incident is a matter for the jury to consider in evaluating the weight of the victim\u2019s testimony.\u201d Id., 304-305; accord Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-11 (c).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>In light of the history and purpose of the constancy of accusation doctrine we further concluded, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Samuels, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 551-52, that statements made by a victim after he or she had filed an official complaint with the police were inadmissible as constancy of accusation evidence. In arriving at this conclusion, we reasoned that \u201c[o]nce a sexual assault victim has reported the crime to the police . . . corroborative testimony by constancy witnesses that is based on post-complaint conversations with the victim, even if relevant, no longer serves the purpose of countering a negative inference as to the victim\u2019s credibility because it is the inconsistency between the victim\u2019s silence following the assault and her subsequent complaint to the police that gives rise to such an inference.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">With this background in mind, we now turn to the merits of the defendant\u2019s claims. The defendant first claims that the constancy of accusation doctrine is inapplicable to the present case because P.L. was over the age of consent and did, in fact, consent to sexual intercourse with the defendant. We reject this claim because, pursuant to \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (8), P.L. legally was incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse with the defendant. Just as a minor under the age of sixteen legally is incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse generally; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1); an elementary or secondary school student legally is incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse with a school employee who works in the school system in which the student is enrolled. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (8); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>25 Conn. App. 243, 252, 594 A.2d 1000 (\u201c[t]he statute proscribing sexual assault in the second degree has its origins in the desire of the state to prohibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>persons from engaging in sexual intercourse with individuals who are deemed legally incapable of consent\u201d), cert. denied, 220 Conn. 911, 597 A.2d 338 (1991). To the extent that the defendant invites this court to draw a distinction between consent-in-fact and consent-in-law for purposes of the admission of constancy of accusation testimony, we decline to do so. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Samuels, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 550 (\u201cthe fact that statutory rape differs from traditional rape because the underage victim may have consented to the act does not alter the requirement that the victim must report to the constancy witness that the act was of a sexual nature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly permitted S.C. and K.J. to testify as constancy of accusation witnesses because P.L. had not confided in K.J. or S.C. until after she and N.R. decided to report the defendant\u2019s sexual misconduct to school authorities. In support of this claim, the defendant relies on <em>Samuels, </em>wherein we concluded that statements made by a victim after he or she had filed an official complaint with the police were inadmissible as constancy of accusation evidence. We determined that such statements do not counter the negative inference concerning the victim\u2019s credibility that may arise due to the victim\u2019s silence following the assault, but prior to her subsequent complaint to the police. Id., 552. In the present case, P.L.\u2019s statements to S.C. and K.J. were made four or five days before P.L. reported the defendant\u2019s sexual misconduct to school authorities and filed an official complaint with the police. These statements therefore countered the negative inference that the jurors might have drawn about P.L.\u2019s credibility based on the inconsistency between P.L.\u2019s silence following the sexual assaults and her subsequent filing of an official complaint with the police. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Samuels </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Lastly, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the probative value of the constancy of accusation testimony outweighed its prejudicial effect. We are not persuaded. Our review of the record reveals that S.C., A.D. and K.J. testified only as to the fact and timing of P.L.\u2019s complaint and the details necessary to associate P.L.\u2019s complaint with the charges against the defendant. Each of the three witnesses testified that P.L. said that she had had sexual intercourse with the defendant more than once at the Fairfield University Library and in the area in which P.L. and the defendant often went jogging.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Moreover, because each witness testified as to separate complaints made by P.L. on separate occasions, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the constancy of accusation evidence was not prejudicially cumulative. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Parris, </em>219 Conn. 283, 294, 592 A.2d 943 (1991) (constancy of accusation testimony of four witnesses not prejudicially cumulative because each witness testified with respect to \u201ca different statement that the victim had made to a different person at a different point in time [and] therefore, the evidence covered new matter by demonstrating, as was its relevant purpose, that the victim previously had reported the incident she described on direct examination in a constant and consistent fashion\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Zoravali, </em>34 Conn. App. 428, 441, 641 A.2d 796 (constancy of accusation testimony of seven witnesses not prejudicially cumulative because \u201call of the testimony pertained to different statements made by the victim to different people at different times\u201d), cert. denied, 230 Conn. 906, 644 A.2d 921 (1994). Finally, the trial court instructed the jury repeatedly as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>limited purpose for which the constancy of accusation evidence could be considered, thereby minimizing any risk of prejudice to the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Parris, </em>supra, 294 (\u201cThe [trial] court minimized any appreciable danger that the jury might treat [the constancy of accusation] testimony as substantive evidence by giving an appropriate instruction as to its limited corroborative use. The jury is presumed, in the absence of a fair indication to the contrary, to have followed the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d); see also footnotes 26, 27 and 28 of this opinion. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the probative value of the constancy of accusation testimony of S.C., A.D. and K.J. outweighed its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\"> The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we subsequently granted the defendant\u2019s motion to transfer the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and ...

The statutes do [however] seek to control a personal relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals.\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>248 Conn. 543, 561-62, 729 A.2d 760 (\u201cconsensual sexual intercourse, by definition, requires at least two actors,\u201d and, accordingly, alleged fundamental right to engage in consensual sexual intercourse must be evaluated in light of relationship between sexual participants), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 967, 120 S.

Ct. 3244, 82 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1984), in which the United States Supreme Court recognized the right of freedom of association as a component of personal liberty guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution. The right of freedom of association affords \u201ccertain kinds of highly personal relationships a substantial measure of sanctuary from unjustified interference by the [sjtate.\u201d Id., 618. Because the defendant has failed to establish that the right of freedom of association includes within its ambit a teacher\u2019s right to have consensual sexual intercourse with a student enrolled in the school system in which the teacher is employed, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Roberts </em>is misplaced. See id., 621-23 (right of freedom of association did not protect United States Jaycees\u2019 exclusion of women from membership); see also <em>Patel </em>v. <em>Searles, </em>305 F.3d 130, 136 (2d Cir. 2002) (right of freedom of association <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>protected plaintiffs familial relationship with wife, children, father and siblings from undue governmental interference), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 907, 123 S.

In <em>FerreU, </em>we concluded that the <em>procedural </em>due process afforded to the defendant in that case violated the minimal requirements of article first, \u00a7 8, because \u201cthe right to consult a lawyer before being interrogated is meaningless if the accused cannot privately and freely discuss the case with that attorney.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Id., 45.

In <em>B. B. </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 659 So. 2d 256, the Florida Supreme Court concluded that the Florida constitution protects the right of freely consenting <em>minors </em>to engage in private noncommercial sexual conduct.

See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b553-6\"> The trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cBefore we hear from the next witness, let me give you an instruction about this evidence that you are about to hear and consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\u201cThis evidence [that is] going to be offered by the state through the next witness concerns an assertion of prior acts of misconduct of the defendant. It is not being admitted to prove the bad character of the defendant or the defendant\u2019s tendency to commit criminal acts. This evidence is being offered solely to attempt to establish a common plan or scheme in the commission of criminal acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">\u201cYou may not consider such evidence as establishing a predisposition on the part of the defendant to <em>commit </em>any of the crimes charged or to demonstrate a criminal propensity.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">\u201cYou may consider such evidence, if you believe it, and further find that it logically, rationally and conclusively supports the issues for which it is being offered by the state, but only as it may bear on the issues of this assertion of a common plan or scheme to sexually abuse high school-aged girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">\u201cOn the other hand, if you do not believe this evidence, or even if you do, if you find that it does not logically or rationally or conclusively support the issues it is being offered [to prove], namely this common plan or scheme, you should not consider this testimony for any purpose whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b553-11\"> The trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cNow, also in this case . . . the state presented evidence as uncharged misconduct, including evidence of other alleged sexual activity between the defendant and the two complainants, [P.L. and N.R.], and a third person, [R.S.]. I instruct you that all of this uncharged misconduct evidence has been admitted only for a limited purpose, that is, to show a common scheme or design by the defendant to have sexual contact with high school-aged girls, and you could consider it only for those purposes. This evidence is not admissible to prove the defendant\u2019s propensity to engage in certain conduct.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\"> The defendant also claims that his relationship with R.S. was distinct from his relationship with N.R. and P.L. because R.S. \u201cwas never one of [his] students.\u201d We reject this claim. Although N.R. was a student in the defendant\u2019s Latin class during the 2000-2001 academic year, P.L. was not. Indeed, P.L. did not become a student of the defendant\u2019s until she enrolled in the Aspirations program in the summer of2001. By the time the Aspirations program began, however, the defendant already had engaged in sexual misconduct with P.L. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s relationship with R.S. was similar to his relationships with N.R. and P.L. because he was a teacher at Career School where all three victims were enrolled in their junior year when the sexual misconduct first began.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b557-8\"> The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly admitted \u201cde facto\u201d constancy of accusation testimony from P.L. in the case of N.R. and, likewise, from N.R. in the case of P.L. Moreover, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly admitted \u201cde facto\u201d constancy of accusation testimony from Gwendolyn Hampton, the assistant principal of Career School, who testified as to the circumstances surrounding N.R. and P.L.\u2019s report to school officials of the defendant\u2019s sexual misconduct. The defendant failed to preserve these claims in the trial court and, therefore, seeks to prevail under <em>State v. Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), or the plain error doctrine. See footnote 9 of this opinion. We recognize that a party may seek to prevail on unpreserved claims under the plain error doctrine; see Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; or, if the claims are constitutional in nature, under <em>Golding, </em>if the party affirmatively requests and adequately briefs his entitlement to such review in his main brief. See <em>Grimm </em>v. <em>Grimm, </em>276 Conn. 377, 393 n.19, 886 A.2d 391 (2005) (plain error doctrine), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1148, 126 S. Ct. 2296, 164 L.

In the present case, however, the defendant failed to brief his entitlement either to <em>Golding </em>review or to plain error review in his main brief. Accordingly, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s claims because they are briefed inadequately. See <em>Grimm </em>v. <em>Grimm, </em>supra, 393-94 n.19 (declining to review claim under plain error doctrine because defendant had not sought plain error review until he filed reply brief); <em>Lebron </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 532 (declining to review constitutional claims under <em>Golding </em>because habeas petitioner had not briefed entitlement to <em>Golding </em>review until he filed reply brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b559-7\"> On December 4, 2003, the trial court held a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion in limine. After entertaining oral arguments from both parties, the trial court stated as follows: \u201cLook, on the present state of the record, this motion in limine to exclude constancy evidence is denied. The court intends to adhere to the limitations of <em>[State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 677 A.2d 917 (1996)], and <em>[State </em>v. <em>Samuels, </em>75 Conn.

And, obviously, as to any piece of evidence, if the court determines that it is cumulative, or if the court determines that its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value under our code of evidence, it is not admissible, so I\u2019m not pre-judging those sorts of issues.

Each of those persons testified as to statements the complainant made to each of them regarding the defendant sexually assaulting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">\u201cThis evidence by each of these witnesses was admitted solely to corroborate or not corroborate the [complainant\u2019s] testimony in court, to be considered only by you in determining the weight and credibility you will accord her testimony given here in this court.
