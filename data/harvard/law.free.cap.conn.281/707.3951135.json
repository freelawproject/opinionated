The defendant claims that the trial court improperly revoked his probation under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s claim is twofold. First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>the defendant contends that the court improperly determined that he had violated the general condition of his probation, namely, that he not violate the laws of the state, by operating a motor vehicle while his operator\u2019s license was under suspension in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-215 (c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because the statute is unconstitutionally vague as it applies to the use of an all-terrain vehicle (ATV). Second, the defendant contends that the special condition of his probation barring him from operating a motor vehicle while his license was under suspension did not adequately apprise him that a motor vehicle included an ATV and, therefore, was unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. On July 27, 2001, the defendant pleaded guilty to operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor or drugs or both, as a third time offender, in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>of General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 14-227a,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and operating a motor vehicle while his license was suspended in violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c). On September 13, 2001, the defendant was sentenced to three years imprisonment, suspended after one year, and three years probation. The terms of the defendant\u2019s probation included a general condition prohibiting him from violating any criminal law of the state and a special condition prohibiting him from operating a motor vehicle while his license was under suspension. The defendant\u2019s license, which had been suspended on several previous occasions, was permanently suspended by the department of motor vehicles on October 17, 2001. On September 11, 2002, after serving one year of his sentence, the defendant was released from prison, and his probation commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">On May 15, 2004, the defendant operated an ATV in the travel lanes of various roads in the towns of Union and Stafford.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A conservation officer with the department of environmental protection stopped the defendant while he was operating his ATV and issued him citations for operating an unregistered ATV in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-380,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and for operating an ATV <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>on a public highway in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-387 (l).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defendant was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his license was under suspension in violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c), and with a violation of his probation under \u00a7 53a-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">On June 14,2005, after a hearing, the trial court determined that the defendant had violated the general terms of his probation when he operated his ATV on a public highway in violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c), which makes it a criminal offense for a person to operate a motor vehicle while his license is under suspension. The court also determined that the defendant had violated the special condition of his probation that he not operate a motor vehicle while his license was under suspension. As a result, the trial court rendered judgment revoking the defendant\u2019s probation and ordering him to serve the remaining two years of his suspended sentence. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court from the trial court\u2019s judgment, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly revoked his probation after finding that he had violated the general condition of his probation that he not violate the laws of the state. Specifically, the defendant claims that \u00a7 14-215 (c), which proscribes the operation of a motor vehicle while a person\u2019s license is suspended, is unconstitutionally vague as it applies to the use of an ATV. The defendant contends that, in view of the inconsistent definitions of the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d within the General Statutes, a person of ordinary intelligence could not reasonably have been expected to know that the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d included an ATV. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">We begin our analysis with the applicable standard of review for a claim of unconstitutional vagueness. At the outset, we note that the defendant concedes that the issues that he raises on appeal are unpreserved but urges that he should prevail under the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. Alternatively, the defendant argues that he should prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Under <em>Golding, </em>\u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., 239-40. In the present case, the record is adequate for review and the claims are of constitutional magnitude. We conclude, however, that the third prong of <em>Golding </em>has not been satisfied because the defendant has failed to establish that the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Turning to the specifics of the defendant\u2019s claim, we note that, although our review of a trial court\u2019s finding that a particular condition of probation was violated would require us to apply a clearly erroneous standard of review, determining whether that condition is unconstitutionally vague presents a question of law over which our review is de novo. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Faraday, </em>268 Conn. 174, 191, 842 A.2d 567 (2004). Our analysis first requires us to restate the common-law rule that everyone is presumed to know the law and that ignorance of the law excuses no one from criminal sanction. See, e.g., <em>Cheek </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 U.S. 192, 199, 111 S. Ct. 604, 112 L. Ed. 2d 617 (1991); <em>Covelli </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>235 Conn. 539, 551 n.21, 668 A.2d 699 (1995), vacated on other grounds sub nom. <em>Covelli </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>518 U.S. 1031, 116 S. Ct. 2577, 135 L. Ed. 2d 1092 (1996). In reviewing a claim that a statute or a condition of probation is unconstitutionally vague, we also must be mindful of the following principles. Our law requires that \u201ca penal statute define [a] criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. . . . [This concept] embodies two central precepts: the right to fair warning of the effect of a governing statute or regulation and the guarantee against standardless law enforcement. . . . [T]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>[most] important aspect of the vagueness doctrine is not actual notice . . . but . . . the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement. . . . Thus, [i]n order to surmount a vagueness challenge, a statute [must] afford a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is permitted or prohibited . . . and must not impermissibly [delegate] basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application. . . . Finally, [i]f the meaning of a statute can be fairly ascertained a statute will not be void for vagueness . . . for [i]n most English words and phrases there lurk uncertainties. . . . [T]he statute must contain some core meaning within which the defendant\u2019s actions clearly fall. . . . References to judicial opinions involving the statute, the common law, legal dictionaries, or treatises may be necessary to ascertain a statute\u2019s meaning to determine if it gives fair warning.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>257 Conn. 544, 551-53, 778 A.2d 847 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1130, 122 S. Ct. 1069, 151 L. Ed. 2d 972 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">\u201cFor statutes that do not implicate the especially sensitive concerns embodied in the first amendment, we determine the constitutionality of a statute under attack for vagueness by considering its applicability to the particular facts at issue.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>215 Conn. 173, 180, 575 A.2d 216 (1990). Furthermore, to prevail on his claim, the defendant \u201cmust demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute, as applied to him, deprived him of adequate notice of what conduct the statute proscribed or that he fell victim to arbitrary and discriminatoiy enforcement.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>62 Conn. App. 665, 675-76, 772 A.2d 657 (2001), citing <em>Sweetman </em>v. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number><em>Elections Enforcement Commission, </em>249 Conn. 296, 322, 732 A.2d 144 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In the present case, the defendant claims that \u00a7 14-215 (c) is unconstitutionally vague because it did not reasonably apprise him that operating an ATV constituted operating a motor vehicle for purposes of the statute. Specifically, the defendant claims that \u00a7 14-215 is vague because the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d would not commonly be understood to encompass an ATV, the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d contained in \u00a7 14-1 excludes vehicles not suitable for operation on a highway, and the various definitions of ATV under the General Statutes indicate that such vehicles are not suitable for highway use. We reject the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">We begin by turning to the relevant statutory provisions to determine whether a person of ordinary intelligence reasonably would have been apprised that a \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 14-215 (c), includes an ATV. Section 14-215 (c) is contained in chapter 248 of the General Statutes, which addresses vehicle highway use. That statute makes it a criminal offense for \u201c [a]ny person\u201d to operate \u201cany motor vehicle during the period such person\u2019s operator\u2019s license or right to operate a motor vehicle in this state is under suspension . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-215 (c). Chapter 248 provides a definition for the term \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d which \u201cincludes <em>all vehicles </em>used on the public highways . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 14-212 (5). \u201cVehicle\u201d is further defined as \u201csynonymous with \u2018motor vehicle\u2019.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-212 (9). Thus, for purposes of \u00a7 14-215 (c), an ATV is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d if it is a \u201cvehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">The conclusion that an ATV is a \u201cvehicle,\u201d and thus a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 14-215 (c), is supported by two definitions of the term ATV contained in other chapters of the General Statutes. General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>\u00a7 14-379 defines an ATV or \u201c[a]ll-terrain vehicle\u201d as \u201ca self-propelled <em>vehicle </em>designed to travel over unimproved terrain and which has been determined by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles to be unsuitable for operation on the public highways . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Similarly, General Statutes \u00a7 23-26a defines an ATV or \u201c[a]ll-terrain vehicle\u201d as a \u201cmotorized <em>vehicle, </em>not suitable for operation on a highway . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) As both definitions define an ATV as a \u201cvehicle,\u201d and because a \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 14-215 (c), \u201cincludes all vehicles used on the public highways\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 14-212 (5); it is clear that an ATV, when used on a public highway, is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 14-215 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The defendant contends that \u00a7 14-215 (c) is unconstitutionally vague when read together with the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d found in General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 because that definition excludes all vehicles \u201cnot suitable for operation on a highway . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (a) (50). This contention is without merit. On its face, it is clear that the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d found in \u00a7 14-1 (a) (50) is applicable only to the provisions in chapter 246 of the General Statutes. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (a) (\u201c[t]erms used in <em>this chapter </em>shall be construed as follows\u201d [emphasis added]). The statute at issue in the present case, \u00a7 14-215 (c), however, is contained in chapter 248 and thus is not implicated by the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d found in \u00a7 14-1 (a) (50). The limitation on the application of \u00a7 14-1 to chapter 246 is underscored by \u00a7 14-212. Section 14-212 defines the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of chapter 248 generally and \u00a7 14-215 (c) specifically but incorporates by reference other definitions contained in \u00a7 14-1 in providing that certain terms enumerated therein \u201cshall be construed as they are defined in section 14-1 . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-212 (1). The term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is not included in the list of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>terms found in \u00a7 14-212 (1) that shall be construed as they are defined in \u00a7 14-1. In fact, as we have noted, \u00a7 14-212 contains its own broad definition of \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d In light of the conspicuous absence of the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d from the list of terms in \u00a7 14-212 (1) that are to be construed as they are defined in \u00a7 14-1, and the broad definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d contained in \u00a7 14-212, which is specifically applicable to \u00a7 14-215 (c), it is clear that the definition of the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in \u00a7 14-1 is not applicable to \u00a7 14-215 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In addition, the purposes of the two chapters in question are very different, thus requiring the need for a broader definition of the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under the chapter concerning vehicle highway use, namely, chapter 248. Chapter 246 requires the registration of a certain class of vehicles that are to be operated within the state. Section 14-1 therefore contains a very limited definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d that excludes most vehicles that are not traditionally operated on a public road. On the other hand, chapter 248 regulates the use of motor vehicles on public highways, and that necessarily requires a definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d that includes all \u201cvehicles.\u201d Therefore, the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in chapter 248, when read in the context of the General Statutes as a whole, not only suggests a broad definition of the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of chapter 248 but also that all \u201cvehicles\u201d in the various chapters of the General Statutes are included within that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">After reviewing the relevant statutory provisions, we conclude that \u00a7 14-215 (c), which makes it an offense for a person to operate a motor vehicle while his license is under suspension, also prohibits a person from operating an ATV on a public highway while his license is under suspension. In other words, \u00a7 14-215 (c) affords a person of ordinary intelligence with fair warning that he is prohibited from operating an ATV on a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>highway while his license is suspended. The statute therefore is not unconstitutionally vague, and, therefore, the defendant cannot prevail on his claim under the third prong of <em>Golding. </em>Accordingly, the trial court did not improperly revoke the defendant\u2019s probation on the ground that he had violated the general condition of his probation that he not violate the laws of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The defendant next claims that the special condition of his probation prohibiting him from operating a motor vehicle while his license was under suspension was unconstitutionally vague because it did not apprise him that it included the operation of an ATV. Specifically, and similarly to his previous argument, the defendant claims that this condition was unconstitutionally vague because a person of ordinary intelligence reasonably would not have known that it applied to the operation of an ATV. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Beyond the statutory definitions of a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d and an ATV that we outlined previously, this claim fails on the basis of our review of the common usage of the terminology in question. In other words, a reasonable inquiry into the definition of the terms in question would have reasonably apprised the defendant that an ATV was included in the special condition of his probation that he refrain from operating a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as \u201can automotive vehicle not operated on rails . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary further defines \u201cautomotive\u201d as something that is \u201ccontaining within itself the means of propulsion: self-propelling ... of, relating to, or concerned with vehicles or machines that propel themselves . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">The defendant concedes that he was operating an ATV within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-380 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>and 14-387 (1). For purposes of these sections, an ATV is defined as \u201ca self-propelled vehicle designed to travel over unimproved terrain . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-379. Furthermore, testimony adduced at the defendant\u2019s probation revocation hearing established that the ATV that the defendant was operating was \u201c[a] three-wheel ATV\u201d and \u201c[a]n all-terrain vehicle, as far as the ATV laws are concerned.\u201d The statutory definition used to describe the ATV that the defendant operated matches the commonly used definition of a \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d Thus, a person of ordinary intelligence reasonably would have been apprised that the special condition of the defendant\u2019s probation clearly prohibited the operation of an ATV on a public highway while his license was suspended. Accordingly, we conclude that the special condition was not unconstitutionally vague and, therefore, that the defendant cannot prevail under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) At any time during the period of probation or conditional discharge, the court or any judge thereof may issue a warrant for the arrest of a defendant for violation of any of the conditions of probation or conditional discharge, or may issue a notice to appear to answer to a charge of such violation, which notice shall be personally served upon the defendant.

The provisions of this section shall not apply (1) to the operation of a snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle on premises owned or leased by the owner of such snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle or (2) to the operation of a snowmobile in any organized contest as long as such snowmobile is operated in the contest area, provided the owner of such snowmobile holds a valid, effective registration awarded by this state or by another state or the United States.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b735-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-387 provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall operate a snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle in the following manner: (1) On any public highway, except such snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle, if operated by a licensed motor vehicle operator, may cross a public highway if the crossing is made at an angle of approximately ninety degrees to the direction of the highway and at a location where no obstruction prevents a quick and safe crossing, the snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle is completely stopped before entering the traveled portion of the highway and the driver yields the right-of-way to motor vehicles using the highway, provided nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit the operation of a snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle on a limited access highway, as defined in subsection (a) of section 13a-l . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b736-8\"> To prevail under the plain error doctrine, the defendant must demonstrate that \u201cthe claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 849, 661 A.2d 539 (1995). This doctrine is not \u201cimplicated unless the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>223 Conn. 535, 551, 613 A.2d 770 (1992). We conclude that the defendant has not met the rigorous standard for prevailing under the plain error doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
