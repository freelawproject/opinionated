The defendant contends that the trial court improperly concluded that the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not bar the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>plaintiffs claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly: (1) applied federal, not state, sovereign immunity law; and (2) rejected the defendant\u2019s position that the state is the real party in interest, despite the plaintiffs allegations naming the defendant in his individual capacity. The plaintiff counters that: (1) state sovereign immunity law does not govern the court\u2019s inquiry when the vindication of a federal right is at issue; and (2) the facts alleged in his complaint are sufficient to defeat the defendant\u2019s sovereign immunity defense. We agree with the plaintiff and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The plaintiff, a former inmate of Northern correctional institution, brought this action in two counts\u2014 the first count against the named defendant, Neftali Rodriguez, and the second count against the defendant. See footnote 1 of this opinion. The complaint stated that the defendant \u201cis sued in his individual capacity.\u201d The plaintiff sought compensatory damages pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>answer, the defendant pleaded, as a special defense, that \u201c[gjiven the facts and holding in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>265 Conn. 301, 308 [828 A.2d 549 (2003)], <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Constantino, </em>168 Conn. 563, 568 [362 A.2d 871] (1975), and <em>Somers </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>143 Conn. 476, 480 [123 A.2d 468] (1956), the facts as alleged by [the] plaintiff against [the] defendant . . . indicate that the state is the real defendant at issue in this case. ... As this matter is against the defendant ... in his official capacity, this action is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff then moved to strike the defendant\u2019s special defenses, and the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and granted the plaintiffs motion to strike the defendant\u2019s special defense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u201cA motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction. . . . [0]ur review of the court\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [determination] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo. . . . Moreover, [t]he doctrine of sovereign immunity implicates subject matter jurisdiction and is therefore a basis for granting a motion to dismiss.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Aiken, </em>278 Conn. 204, 211, 897 A.2d 71 (2006). \u201cAs we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>must in reviewing a motion to dismiss, we take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. Egan, supra, 265 Conn. 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In his complaint, the plaintiff accused the defendant of violating the plaintiffs rights under the eighth<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and fourteenth<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> amendments to the United States constitution, namely, the rights \u201cto be free from cruel and unusual punishment and to be free from arbitrary and callous governmental behavior that shocks the conscience.\u201d In support, he alleged the following facts: On July 11, 2002, Rodriguez, a correction officer at Northern correctional institution, and his subordinates, placed the plaintiff in a small recreational chamber with another inmate, William McClease, and then left the area, \u201cleaving [the] plaintiff and the other inmates without supervision. . . . Shortly thereafter, without provocation . . . McClease violently attacked [the] plaintiff, shattering his eye socket and causing him other serious physical injury, severe shock and mental anguish.\u201d The plaintiff further alleged that \u201c[o]n many occasions prior to July 11, 2002, [the] plaintiff informed . . . Rodriguez in writing that . . . McClease had repeatedly threatened to harm [the] plaintiff.\u201d He also alleged that the plaintiffs injuries \u201cwere caused by the grossly negligent conduct and deliberate indifference of [the] defendant,\u201d namely, by his failure: (1) \u201cto institute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>adequate policies and procedures to protect inmates threatened by other inmates\u201d; (2) \u201cto train Northern [correction] officers to protect inmates threatened by other inmates\u201d; and (3) \u201cto institute adequate policies and procedures to enable inmates to protect themselves from other inmates posing a known risk.\u201d The complaint specifically names the defendant \u201cin his individual capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly concluded that federal sovereign immunity law, rather than state sovereign immunity law, applies to actions under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We conclude, to the contrary, that when sovereign immunity is claimed as a defense to a cause of action pursuant to \u00a7 1983, federal sovereign immunity jurisprudence preempts analysis under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The United States Supreme Court has asserted that \u201c[federal law is enforceable in state courts . . . because the Constitution and laws passed pursuant to it are as much laws in the States as laws passed by the state legislature.\u201d <em>Howlett </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>496 U.S. 356, 367, 110 S. Ct. 2430, 110 L. Ed. 2d 332 (1990). State courts have concurrent jurisdiction over claims brought under \u00a7 1983. Id.; <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Thiboutot, </em>448 U.S. 1, 10-11, 100 S. Ct. 2502, 65 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1980). Nevertheless, \u201c[c]on-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>duct by persons acting under color of state law which is wrongful under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 . . . cannot be immunized by state law. A construction of the federal statute which permitted a state immunity defense to have controlling effect would transmute a basic guarantee into an illusory promise; and the supremacy clause of the Constitution insures that the proper construction may be enforced.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>California, </em>444 U.S. 277, 284 n.8, 100 S. Ct. 553, 62 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1980). \u201cThe elements of, and the defenses to, a federal cause of action are defined by federal law.\u201d <em>Howlett </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>supra, 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We have embraced these principles in our decisions as well. As we said in <em>Lapinski </em>v. <em>Copacino, </em>131 Conn. 119, 128, 38 A.2d 592 (1944), a federal statute, \u201cthough of federal origin, is just as much the law of this state as a statute enacted by our own legislature . ...\u201d In <em>Fetterman v. University of Connecticut, </em>192 Conn. 539, 549, 473 A.2d 1176 (1984), for example, we concluded, pursuant to <em>Patsy </em>v. <em>Board of Regents of the State of Florida, </em>457 U.S. 496, 102 S. Ct. 2557, 73 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1982), that the plaintiff was not required to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to her \u00a7 1983 claim. We refused to construe <em>Patsy </em>as limited to actions brought in federal court because \u201c[t]he incongruous result . . . would be to allow plaintiffs instituting federal court actions to do so without exhausting state administrative remedies, while requiring plaintiffs suing in Connecticut courts to first exhaust such remedies. Since it is clear that claims for liability for deprivation of federal constitutional rights under \u00a7 1983 are claims as to which there is concurrent jurisdiction . . . we think that such a limitation on the court\u2019s holding is inappropriate.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Fetterman </em>v. <em>University of Connecticut, </em>supra, 549. Although ultimately we employed state common-law sovereign immunity in <em>Fetterman, </em>we did so only after first con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>eluding that federal law permitted its application. Id., 551, citing <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Independence, </em>445 U.S. 622, 100 S. Ct. 1398, 63 L. Ed. 2d 673, reh. denied, 446 U.S. 993, 100 S. Ct. 2979, 64 L. Ed. 2d 850 (1980), for the proposition that \u00a7 1983 incorporated common-law sovereign immunity, which was well established at the time of the statute\u2019s enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>supra, 265 Conn. 304-305, 310, we considered whether the defendants could employ a sovereign immunity defense to defeat several state law claims as well as one count brought under \u00a7 1983. As a threshold matter, we examined the complaint to determine whether the plaintiff had brought the action against the individually named defendants in their individual capacities as well as in their official capacities. Id., 307-308. Although the inquiry was relevant to both federal and state sovereign immunity analyses; see, e.g., <em>Hafer v. Melo, 502 </em>U.S. 21, 30-31, 112 S. Ct. 358, 116 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1991); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>261 Conn. 372, 374, 802 A.2d 814 (2002); we dealt with the \u00a7 1983 claim separately and concluded, pursuant to <em>Howlett </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>supra, 496 U.S. 365, and <em>Will </em>v. <em>Michigan Dept. of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 70-71, 109 S. Ct. 2304, 105 L. Ed. 2d 45 (1989), that \u201c[although it would have made sense . . . for the plaintiff to have sued the defendants only in their individual capacities in [the \u00a7 1983 count] . . . he did not do so.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>supra, 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>In ruling on a defendant\u2019s claim of qualified immunity from a \u00a7 1983 claim in <em>Schnabel </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>230 Conn. 735, 742-43, 646 A.2d 152 (1994), we said that such a claim \u201craises a question of federal law . . . and not state law. Therefore, in reviewing these claims of qualified immunity we are bound by federal precedent, and may not expand or contract the contours of the immunity available to government officials.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) We added that, \u201c[i]t would be a bizarre result,\u201d if this court allowed individual state defendants to assert immunity from federal constitutional claims \u201cwhen in another courthouse, a few blocks away, the federal court, being bound by the Second Circuit,\u201d would not. Id., 743 n.4; see also <em>Szewczyk </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>275 Conn. 464, 475 n.11, 881 A.2d 259 (2005); <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Frowein, </em>253 Conn. 312, 341, 752 A.2d 955 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Thus, we conclude that, although the test set forth in <em>Spring </em>and <em>Miller </em>is an appropriate mechanism for our state coruts to determine the capacity in which the named defendants are sued in actions asserting violations of state law, to employ that test to divest state courts of jurisdiction to hear otherwise cognizable \u00a7 1983 claims would be to erect a constitutionally impermissible barrier to the vindication of federal rights. See <em>Howlett </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>supra, 496 U.S. 375. We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s contention that the result of our conclusion is to preclude the defense of sovereign immunity in every action under \u00a7 1983. Sovereign immunity may bar a plaintiffs claim pursuant to \u00a7 1983, but the trial court concluded, and we agree, that federal law must govern that inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Moreover, we disagree with the defendant\u2019s argument that, in <em>Alden </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>527 U.S. 706, 119 S. Ct. 2240, 144 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1999), the United States Supreme Court rejected the limitation of state sovereign immunity analysis to state law claims. In <em>Alden, </em>a group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>of probation officers brought an action in state court against their employer, the state of Maine, alleging that the state had violated the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq., which purportedly authorized private actions against states in state court without regard to consent. Id., 711-12. The petitioners originally brought the action in federal court, which dismissed the action on the ground that Congress could not use its powers under article one of the United States constitution to abrogate a state\u2019s sovereign immunity in federal court. The petitioners then brought an action in state court, which also dismissed the action on sovereign immunity grounds. Id., 712. The United States Supreme Court, in determining \u201cwhether Congress has the power, under Article I, to subject nonconsenting States to private suits in their own courts\u201d; id., 713; considered at length the relationship between the eleventh amendment to the United States constitution and state sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 712-30. The court concluded that \u201cthe sovereign immunity of the States neither derives from, nor is limited by, the terms of the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d Id., 713. Thus, \u201csave where there has been a surrender of [sovereign] immunity [in the constitution]\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 730; Congress may not, \u201c[i]n exercising its Article I powers . . . subject the States to private suits in their own courts . . . Id., 730-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the court, in <em>Alden, </em>did not sanction the application of state law to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>govern the inquiry.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See id., 711-60. Moreover, we do not read the court\u2019s decision to implicate its jurisprudence regarding whether Congress intended to abrogate sovereign immunity when it is otherwise empowered to do so, as it was in enacting \u00a7 1983. See <em>Quern </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 341, 99 S. Ct. 1139, 59 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1979); <em>Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>Bitzer, </em>427 U.S. 445, 456, 96 S. Ct. 2666, 49 L. Ed. 2d 614 (1976). In <em>Alden, </em>as in <em>Howlett </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>supra, 496 U.S. 356, the court simply introduced uniformity in the state and federal courts as to the availability of a sovereign immunity defense. In <em>Howlett, </em>the court held that a sovereign immunity defense that was not available in federal court could not be employed in state court. Id., 383. In <em>Alden, </em>the court achieved uniformity in the other direction, by making available in a state forum a sovereign immunity defense that was already available in federal court. See <em>Alden </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>supra, 527 U.S. 711-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In concluding that Congress did not intend \u00a7 1983 to abrogate sovereign immunity; <em>Quern </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>supra, 440 U.S. 341; and that Congress may never use its article one powers to do so; <em>Alden </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>supra, 527 U.S. 754; the Supreme Court refined the federal doctrine that \u201csovereign immunity [is] a constitutional principle\u201d and that \u201cimmunity from suit is demarcated ... by fundamental postulates implicit in the constitutional design.\u201d Id., 729. The court made no suggestion, however, that state law should define the doctrine\u2019s boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Having determined that federal law governs the defendant\u2019s sovereign immunity defense, we now turn to the defendant\u2019s second claim, namely, that the facts alleged in the plaintiffs complaint are insufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>defeat that defense. We conclude that, under federal law, the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not bar the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Despite the narrow, jurisdictional language of the eleventh amendment; see footnote 10 of this opinion; the United States Supreme Court has interpreted it to embody greater principles of sovereign immunity and to preclude actions against nonconsenting states. See <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe of Idaho, </em>521 U.S. 261, 267-68, 117 S. Ct. 2028, 138 L. Ed. 2d 438 (1997); <em>Hans </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>134 U.S. 1, 16-21, 10 S. Ct. 504, 33 L. Ed. 842 (1890). Moreover, the court has held that the principles of sovereign immunity embodied in the eleventh amendment apply with equal force in both federal and state courts, concluding that \u201cthe States retain immunity from private suit in their own courts, an immunity beyond the congressional power to abrogate by Article I legislation.\u201d <em>Alden </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>supra, 527 U.S. 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Congress, however, did not pass \u00a7 1983 pursuant to its article one power. It was, instead, \u201cone of the means whereby Congress exercised the power vested in it by \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce the provisions of that Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 171, 81 S. Ct. 473, 5 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1961). Section 5 empowers Congress to abrogate state sovereign immunity. According to the Supreme Court, \u201c[w]hen Congress acts pursuant to \u00a7 5, not only is it exercising legislative authority that is plenary within the terms of the constitutional grant, it is exercising that authority under one section of a constitutional Amendment whose other sections by their own terms embody limitations on state authority. <em>We think that Congress may, in determining what is \u2018appropriate legislation\u2019for the purpose of enforcing the provisions </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number><em>of the Fourteenth Amendment, provide for private suits against States or state officials which are constitutionally impermissible in other </em>contexts.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>Bitzer, </em>supra, 427 U.S. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has taken the view that Congress did not intend to defeat traditional notions of sovereign immunity in enacting \u00a7 1983. <em>Quern </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>supra, 440 U.S. 341. Instead, these principles inform the meaning of the term \u201cperson\u201d as used in \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Will </em>v. <em>Michigan Dept. of State Police, </em>supra, 491 U.S. 71 (\u201cneither a State nor its officials acting in their official capacities are \u2018persons\u2019 under \u00a7 1983\u201d). Importantly, however, the court later clarified that \u00a7 1983 does authorize actions against state officers for damages <em>arising from official acts, </em>if they are <em>sued in their individual capacities. Hafer </em>v. <em>Melo, </em>supra, 502 U.S. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">In <em>Hafer, </em>former Pennsylvania state employees brought a \u00a7 1983 claim against the state auditor general for allegedly dismissing the employees because of their political affiliations. Id. The auditor general argued that the claims were barred because she had made the employment decisions in her official capacity. Id. The United States Supreme Court allowed the action. Id., 31. \u201cPersonal-capacity suits . . . seek to impose individual liability upon a government officer for actions taken under color of state law. Thus, [o]n the merits, to establish <em>personal </em>liability in a \u00a7 1983 action, it is enough to show that the official, acting under color of state law, caused the deprivation of a federal right.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 25. In other words, the requirement of action under color of state law means that a \u00a7 1983 defendant\u2019s liability is derived from his authority as an official. See id., 27-28. Thus, \u201cthe phrase \u2018acting in their official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>capacities,\u2019 \u201d the court said, <em>\u201cis best understood as a reference to the capacity in which the state officer is sued, not the capacity in which the officer inflicts the alleged </em>injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Put another way, state officials sued for money damages in their official capacities are not \u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983 because the action against them is one against the office and, thus, no different from an action against the state itself. See <em>Will </em>v. <em>Michigan Dept. of State Police, </em>supra, 491 U.S. 71. State officials are, however, \u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983 and may be held personally liable when sued as individuals for actions taken in their official capacities and, thus, under color of law. See <em>Hafer </em>v. <em>Melo, </em>supra, 502 U.S. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In this case, the plaintiffs complaint is unambiguous. It states that the defendant \u201cis sued in his individual capacity.\u201d Such an articulation of the defendant\u2019s capacity is sufficient to commence a \u00a7 1983 claim against a state officer in his individual capacity. See id., 24; <em>Yorktown Medical Laboratory, Inc. </em>v. <em>Perales, </em>948 F.2d 84, 88-89 (2d Cir. 1991). We therefore conclude that the plaintiffs action is against the defendant in his individual capacity, and that the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not bar the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he real interests served by the Eleventh Amendment are not to be sacrificed to elementary mechanics of captions and pleading\u201d; <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe of Idaho, </em>supra, 521 U.S. 270; see also <em>In re Ayers, </em>123 U.S. 443, 487, 8 S. Ct. 164, 31 L. Ed. 216 (1887) (\u201c \u2018the question whether a suit is within the prohibition of the [Eleventh] Amendment is not always determined by reference to the nominal parties on the record\u2019 \u201d); the defendant argues that the Supreme Court has invalidated the supposition gleaned from <em>Hafer </em>that, in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>\u00a7 1983 action, a plaintiff, to survive a motion to dismiss on the defense of sovereign immunity, need only allege in his complaint that he is suing the defendant in the defendant\u2019s individual capacity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe of Idaho, </em>supra, 521 U.S. 264-65, a federally recognized tribe named the state of Idaho, various state agencies, and state officials in their individual capacities in an action seeking to establish the tribe\u2019s entitlement to the banks, beds and submerged lands of Lake Coeur d\u2019Alene. The case did not involve a \u00a7 1983 claim for damages against an individual defendant. Rather, the court considered whether the tribe\u2019s claim fell within the general rule established in <em>Ex parte Young, </em>209 U.S. 123, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 (1908), that permitted \u201ccertain suits seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against state officers in their individual capacities.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe of Idaho, </em>supra, 269. The court concluded that <em>Ex parte Young </em>did not apply because the declaratory and injunctive relief the tribe sought was the functional equivalent of a quiet title action, \u201cin that substantially all benefits of ownership and control would shift from the State to the Tribe.\u201d Id., 282. The relief sought, namely, \u201ca determination that the lands in question are not even within the regulatory jurisdiction of the State\u201d; id.; was unique and extraordinary, and it could come only from the state. Because \u201c[t]he suit would diminish, even extinguish, the State\u2019s control over a vast reach of lands and waters long deemed by the State to be an integral part of its territoiy\u201d; id.; the court concluded that Ida<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>ho\u2019s \u201csovereign interest . . . would be affected in a degree fully as intrusive as almost any conceivable retroactive levy upon funds in its Treasury.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Id., 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">We understand <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, </em>supra, 521 U.S. 261, to stand for the narrow proposition that, when a plaintiff seeks relief that <em>only </em>the state can provide, he or she may not overcome sovereign immunity simply by suing an individual actor. We find support for our approach in <em>Luder </em>v. <em>Endicott, </em>253 F.3d 1020 (7th Cir. 2001), a case on which the defendant also relies. Although that case, like this one, involved a claim for damages, it was brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq., not \u00a7 1983. Id., 1021. Specifically, prison employees sought damages from the warden and other state officers in their individual capacities for work the employees had been ordered to perform before and after their official shifts. Id., 1022. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit acknowledged that \u201c[t]he general rule is that such suits are not barred . . . because the plaintiff is seeking damages from individuals rather than from the state treasuiy.\u201d Id., 1022-1023. The court concluded, however, that the plaintiffs were really \u201cseeking to accomplish <em>exactly </em>what they would accomplish were they allowed to maintain th[e] suit against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>state ... to force the state to accede to their view of the [Fair Labor Standards] Act and to <em>pay </em>them accordingly.\u201d (Emphasis altered.) Id., 1024. In other words, the relief sought, namely back pay, was relief that <em>only </em>the state could provide.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Other than an agreement by the state to indemnify the defendant, which is irrelevant; see footnote 16 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>this opinion; the defendant offers no reason why the relief sought by the plaintiff could not come exclusively from the defendant. Therefore, the present case implicates none of the concerns articulated in <em>Idaho </em>or <em>Luder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The defendant further argues that the phrase \u201c \u2018sued in his individual capacity\u2019 \u201d does not have \u201ctaiismanic characteristics,\u201d and that the trial court improperly failed to analyze the plaintiffs complaint to determine if, in fact, the state was the real party in interest. Specifically, the defendant insists that the plaintiff has failed to allege facts \u201cto support the conclusion that the employee\u2019s actions were not within his statutory power, or though within his statutory power, the exercise of the employee\u2019s powers were constitutionally void.\u201d In essence, the defendant argues that the plaintiffs action involves behavior that was beyond the defendant\u2019s control and within the exclusive purview of the state\u2014 namely, implementing policies, training and procedures \u2014 and that, therefore, the state is the real party in interest. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In support of his argument, the defendant relies on <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp., </em>337 U.S. 682, 69 S. Ct. 1457, 93 L. Ed. 1628 (1949), in which the United States Supreme Court stated: \u201c[T]he action of an officer of the sovereign (be it holding, taking or otherwise legally affecting the plaintiffs property) can be regarded as so \u2018illegal\u2019 as to permit a suit for a specific relief against the officer as an individual only if it is not within the officer\u2019s statutory powers or, if within those powers, only if the powers, or their exercise in the particular case, are constitutionally void.\u201d Id., 701-702. Because it is limited to actions for specific relief, however, that case is inapposite to the present case. Id. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>fact, the court stated, that \u201c[t]here is ... no jurisdictional difficulty\u201d in a suit against the officer to recover <em>damages </em>for the agent\u2019s personal actions. Id., 687. \u201cThe question becomes difficult . . . when the suit is not one for damages . . . .\u201d Id., 687-88. The case before us involves a claim for damages. Moreover, the plaintiff in <em>Larson </em>did not allege that the defendant had acted unconstitutionally, but rather that a government officer, acting within his authority, had committed a tort. Id., 691-92. In the case before us, the plaintiff brought a cause of action pursuant to \u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> which by its very terms requires the deprivation of a constitutional right.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Indeed, in <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce </em>Corp., supra, 337 U.S. 692-93, the Supreme Court stated that the plaintiff had \u201cconfuse[d] the doctrine of sovereign immunity with the requirement that a plaintiff state a cause of action.\u201d In that case, the plaintiff thought that he had defeated sovereign immunity merely by stating a claim that an agent had acted wrongfully. See id. In the case before us, we believe it is the defendant who confuses the two, apparently assuming that the plaintiffs alleged failure to state a claim concomitantly would impose sovereign immunity as a bar to that claim. These are, however, separate and distinct claims. The defendant has not filed a motion to strike or otherwise challenged the sufficiency of the complaint. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ingly, this argument is best saved for the merits of the plaintiffs case.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">We are also unpersuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that the plaintiff failed to satisfy the pleading requirements of this state. We agree that state procedural requirements, of which fact pleading is one; see Practice Book \u00a7 10-1; generally apply to \u00a7 1983 claims brought in state court. <em>Felder </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>487 U.S. 131, 138, 108 S. Ct. 2302, 101 L. Ed. 2d 123 (1988) (\u201c[n]o one disputes the general and unassailable proposition . . . that States may establish the rules of procedure governing litigation in their own courts\u201d). Because, however, the only issue before us is whether, regardless of its strength, the plaintiffs claim is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity, we are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s assertion that the \u201c[p]laintiffs conclusory allegation concerning inadequate training is not a \u2018fact\u2019 sufficient to establish an individual liability against [the defendant].\u201d Whether the pleaded facts are sufficient to establish liability does not bear upon our analysis of whether, under federal substantive law, the defendant has been sued in his individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-13\"> The plaintiff brought this action against both Myers and the named defendant, Neftali Rodriguez, a correction officer at Northern correctional institution. Because Rodriguez did not appeal from the judgment of the trial court, we refer to Myers as the defendant in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\"> \u201cThe general rule is that the denial of a motion to dismiss is an interlocutory ruling and, therefore, is not a final judgment for purposes of appeal. . . . The denial of a motion to dismiss based on a colorable claim of sovereign immunity, by contrast, is an immediately appealable final judgment because the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>265 Conn. 301, 303 n.2, 828 A.2d 549 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b154-8\"> In its entirety, title 42 of the United States Code, \u00a7 1983, provides: \u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer\u2019s judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.

In order \u201cto determine whether an action is in effect, one against the state and cannot be maintained without its consent,\u201d this court considers whether: \u201c(1) a state official has been sued; (2) the suit concerns some matter in which that official represents the state; (3) the state is the real party against whom relief is sought; and (4) the judgment, though nominally against the official, will operate to control the activities of the state or subject it to liability.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>supra, 308. Because we conclude that federal law governs our inquiry, however, we need not decide whether the result in this case would be different under <em>Spring </em>and its progeny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\"> We recognize that the structure of our analysis in <em>Miller </em>appeared to place our inquiry under federal law within the context of the third prong of the test in <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Constantino, </em>supra, 168 Conn. 568; see footnote 8 of this opinion; namely, whether \u201cthe state is the real party against whom relief is sought . . . <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>supra, 265 Conn. 308; id., 308-11 (concluding that \u201cthe third criterion of <em>Spring </em>is met on all counts of the complaint,\u201d which would, by definition, include the count brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983). Although, in hindsight, our approach was not the most analytically accurate, it was borne of convenience and has no substantive import, especially when there was no conflict between the state and federal law on point. It does not, and it could not, change the fact that <em>Howlett </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>supra, 496 U.S. 356, and <em>Will </em>v. <em>Michigan Dept. of State Police, </em>supra, 491 U.S. 58, rather than <em>Spring, </em>controlled the outcome of the federal claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\"> On its face, the eleventh amendment to the United States constitution applies only to actions in federal court.

In that case, the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the district court, which had ordered state officials to release withheld benefits that were administered in a manner inconsistent with federal regulations. Id., 653, 678. The court further refined this principle when it stated that \u201c[t]he general rule is that a suit is against the sovereign if the judgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with the public administration, or if the effect of the judgment would be to restrain the Government from acting, or to compel it to act.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital </em>v. <em>Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 101 n.11, 104 S.

In other words, as the United States Supreme Court suggested in <em>Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp. </em>v. <em>Feeney, </em>495 U.S. 299, 110 S. Ct. 1868, 109 L. Ed. 2d 264 (1990), the state\u2019s mere exposure to liability does not alone invoke sovereign immunity. In that case, the court noted that it \u201chas not decided which arrangements between a State and a nominal defendant are sufficient to establish that the State is the real party in interest for Eleventh Amendment purposes. . . . Lower courts have uniformly held that States may not cloak their officers with a personal Eleventh Amendment defense by promising, by statute, to indemnify them for damages awards imposed on them for actions taken in the course of their employment. See, e.g., <em>Blaylock </em>v. <em>Schwinden, </em>862 F.2d 1352, 1354, n.1 ([9th Cir.] 1988) (The eleventh amendment prohibits a district court from ordering payment of a judgment from the state treasury. The court may properly order the officials to pay damages under \u00a7 1983, but if the officials desire indemnification under the state statute, they must bring their own action in state court); <em>Duckworth v. Franzen, </em>780 F.2d 645, 650-651 ([7th Cir.] 1985) QT]he purpose of the Eleventh Amendment is only to protect the state against involuntary liability.

Moreover, it would be absurd if all a state had to do to put its employees beyond the reach of [\u00a7] 1983 and thereby make the statute ineffectual except against employees of local governments . . . was to promise to indemnify state employees for any damages awarded in such a suit); <em>Wilson v.
