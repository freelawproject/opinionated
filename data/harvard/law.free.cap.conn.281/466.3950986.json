See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>92 Conn. App. 382, 389, 885 A.2d 761 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The facts and procedural history, as set forth by the Appellate Court, provide as follows. \u201cIn October, 1996, the petitioner was arrested and charged in connection with an arson committed that August.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He initially claimed indigence and requested a public defender. Two public defenders filed appearances on behalf of the petitioner, one in December, 1996, and the second, which was in addition to the first, in October, 1998. On November 12, 1998, the state filed a motion for judicial determination of eligibility for public defender services. The following day, in response to the state\u2019s motion and on the basis of information discovered in conjunction with their preparation to defend the petitioner against incidents of uncharged misconduct the state sought to introduce at trial, the public defenders filed a motion to withdraw, having determined that the petitioner no longer qualified for public defender services.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although jury selection was scheduled to begin at about the time those motions were filed, the petitioner\u2019s public defenders represented that they believed that in the event their motion to withdraw was granted, the court would grant the petitioner a continuance so as to allow him to retain private counsel. On November 16, 1998, the court granted the motion to withdraw. The petitioner did not challenge that ruling and, on December 11, 1998, filed a pro se appearance. The petitioner\u2019s criminal trial began in May, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>\u201cThe petitioner did not obtain his file from his public defenders prior to the commencement of trial. At the habeas trial, the petitioner testified that he had requested his file on numerous occasions, both orally and in writing, from his public defenders. The petitioner, however, was unable to produce any evidence of his requests, and the habeas court found more credible the testimony of one of his public defenders, who testified that no direct request had been made. The public defender testified that she had told the petitioner that his file was available and that, if he had private counsel, the file was in the public defender\u2019s office and the attorney could obtain the file. She farther testified that the petitioner never requested his file from the public defenders, even after he had filed his pro se appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u201cOn May 17, 1999, when the court was handling a variety of pretrial matters in the petitioner\u2019s case, the issue of the petitioner\u2019s witness list arose. The petitioner represented to the court that he did not have a complete list of potential witnesses because his public defenders had compiled that list during their representation of him and he had not obtained that list since the time of their withdrawal. On the following day, the petitioner represented to the court that the public defender\u2019s office was preparing to relinquish his file to him and that he expected to obtain his file that afternoon. He actually obtained the majority of his file at about that time, with several enlarged photographs being delivered during the trial itself.\u201d Id., 385-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In the Appellate Court, the petitioner claimed that the habeas court \u201cimproperly concluded that he was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because of the alleged failure of his public defenders to ensure that he received his file promptly following their withdrawal from his criminal case.\u201d Id., 383. Stressing the fact that the petitioner\u2019s claim was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>that his counsel had failed to release his file to him upon his request, but rather that they had failed to tell him that he could obtain his file, and the fact that his counsel \u201creasonably believed . . . that the petitioner would hire private counsel\u201d; id., 388-89; the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the habeas court. Id., 389. The Appellate Court concluded that counsel\u2019s \u201crepresentation . . . fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance generally provided by lawyers with ordinary skill and training in the criminal law.\u201d Id. This certified appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The petitioner claims in this court that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because the public defenders\u2019 office did not adequately inform him of how he, as a pro se litigant, should go about obtaining his file. After examining the entire record on appeal and considering the briefs and oral arguments of the parties, we have determined that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted, the record having failed to support the new claim made in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-5\"> \u201cFor the underlying factual history of the crimes for which the petitioner was convicted, see <em>State </em>v.
