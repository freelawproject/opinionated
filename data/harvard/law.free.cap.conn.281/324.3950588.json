Ramin, appeals from the judgment of the trial court dissolving her thirty year marriage to the defendant, Kurt P. Ramin. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court: (1) improperly failed to adjust her proportionate share of the defendant\u2019s retirement assets after acknowledging an error in its initial determination of their value; (2) improperly relied on <em>Maguire </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>222 Conn. 32, 608 A.2d 79 (1992), in ordering her to be fully responsible for her own attorney\u2019s fees because she had suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>cient liquid assets; and (3) abused its discretion when it failed: (a) to hold the defendant accountable for his discovery misconduct by awarding the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees or giving her a larger share of the marital assets as an offset; (b) to hold the defendant accountable for an allegedly fraudulent debt of $190,000 on his financial affidavit; and (c) to rule on her motion for contempt and sanctions based on the defendant\u2019s repeated failure to comply with the court\u2019s discovery orders. The plaintiff further contends that, if we conclude that the trial court properly followed existing precedent under <em>Maguire, </em>we should recognize an expansion of <em>Maguire </em>to apply to the facts of the present case. We conclude that the trial court improperly failed to rule on her motion for contempt and sanctions based on the defendant\u2019s repeated failure to comply with the court\u2019s discovery orders. Furthermore, we conclude that the facts of the present case justify an expansion of the <em>Maguire </em>rule. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court with respect to the financial orders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The record reveals the following relevant facts. The parties were married on December 30, 1972.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1997, the parties effectively separated when the defendant was transferred by his employer to London, England, and the plaintiff remained at the marital home in Weston. In September, 1999, the plaintiff commenced this action seeking dissolution of the marriage and other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The trial court concluded that the evidence supported the plaintiffs claim that the defendant \u201cused <em>at least </em>$395,000 in marital assets, including a partial distribution from his capital deposit account ($174,023), a payment of special compensation ($208,725), and a joint income tax refund ($12,736), for the purchase of such things as a BMW automobile, an apartment in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, and to maintain his lifestyle in Europe.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The court also found that the defendant had attempted to \u201ckeep these assets out of reach by placing title in the names of other persons\u201d and that the plaintiff had expended \u201cenormous sums for attorney\u2019s fees, in large part to trace these assets, with limited success.\u201d The court further found that each party had sufficient assets to pay for their respective attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The court ordered the marriage dissolved. In accordance with its findings, the court also made the following financial orders: (1) that commencing September 1, 2003, the defendant make monthly payments to the plaintiff in the amount of $5000, until the death of either party, the remarriage of the plaintiff, or August 31,2007, whichever shall occur sooner; (2) that the defendant convey his interest to the plaintiff, via quitclaim deed, in the jointly owned marital home in Weston; (3) that the defendant convey his interest to the plaintiff, via quitclaim deed, in jointly owned real estate at 750 State Street in Eaton Rapids, Michigan; (4) that the defendant retain his interest in inherited real property in Liebenwaide, Germany; (5) that the defendant retain his interest in an apartment in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany; (6) that each party retain personal property and home furnishings in their respective residences; (7) that each party retain their respective automobiles; (8) that each party retain, except as otherwise set forth in the court\u2019s orders, their respective savings, checking and money market accounts; (9) that the defendant retain his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>shares of The Translation Group, Ltd., stock, moneys held by Martina Meyer, shares of Smith Barney stock held by Theodora Landgren and gold coins from a Mexican directorship; (10) that the plaintiff retain her jewelry and personal effects and her Merrill Lynch investment account; (11) that the defendant\u2019s PricewaterhouseCoopers Keough plan, his PricewaterhouseCoopers 401 (k) plan, his PricewaterhouseCoopers retirement benefits accumulation plan and his PricewaterhouseCoopers qualified XC retirement plan be apportioned between the parties, with the plaintiff receiving 65 percent of each plan and the defendant receiving 35 percent of each plan; (12) that effective September 1, 2003, the defendant pay to the plaintiff 35 percent of the monthly payments he receives under his nonqualified PricewaterhouseCoopers retirement plan; (13) that each party receive 50 percent of the defendant\u2019s PricewaterhouseCoopers nonqualified XC NET P&amp;PA retirement plan and that, in the event that the defendant should predecease the plaintiff, she will receive 100 percent of any portion of the survivor benefit vested and accrued as of the date of the court\u2019s order; (14) that the defendant, beginning December 1, 2007, pay to the plaintiff 35 percent of the gross monthly payment he receives pursuant to an annuity created with the undistributed balance of his deposit capital plan through PricewaterhouseCoopers; (15) that the plaintiff retain her interest in her Louis Dreyfus Holding Company 401 (k) plan, her Louis Dreyfus Holding Company pension plan, and her Merrill Lynch individual retirement account; (16) that the defendant retain his interest in the Emery Industries, Inc., pension plan, the Fidelity Investments individual retirement account, and the Smith Barney individual retirement account; (17) that the parties divide equally the balance of the Scot Equities Furid(s); (18) that the defendant maintain the existing decreasing term life insurance and name the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>plaintiff his beneficiary as long as his alimony obligation exists; and (19) that each party be responsible for their respective attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in connection with this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court. Thereafter, the defendant moved to reargue and the trial court granted the plaintiffs motion for articulation and granted a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to reargue. Following the hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for reargument and clarified its original decision. The plaintiff then filed a separate appeal after the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion to reargue. The Appellate Court subsequently granted the plaintiffs motion to consolidate the two appeals. Thereafter, we transferred the consolidated appeals to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">We first consider the plaintiffs claim that the trial court abused its discretion in declining to rule on her motion for contempt and sanctions, filed in court on August 14, 2002, based on the defendant\u2019s repeated failure to comply with the court\u2019s discovery orders. Because we conclude that the trial court had no discretion to mark the plaintiffs motion \u201coff\u2019 the calendar, we agree with the plaintiff that the court\u2019s action was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. On August 2, 2000, the plaintiff filed her first discovery request for disclosure of facts and production of records. After the defendant failed to comply with her request, the plaintiff filed a motion for contempt. On October 23, 2000, the court ordered the defendant to comply with the discovery request. When the defendant produced, in response to the court\u2019s order, a computer disk that the plaintiff claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>was incomplete and indecipherable, the plaintiff filed a second motion for contempt on January 29, 2001. The parties then entered into a stipulation, which was made an order of the court on March 26, 2001, providing that the defendant would sign, acknowledge and deliver an authorization to release personal information to the plaintiffs attorney. Although the defendant subsequently signed an authorization allowing his employer to release information to the plaintiffs attorney, she was unsuccessful in obtaining information from the employer, and the defendant failed to produce the requested documents and information. Because the defendant persisted in his noncompliance with discovery requests, on July 6, 2001, the plaintiff filed a third motion for contempt, prompting the court to issue an order, dated July 23, 2001, directing the defendant to provide answers to the production requests within thirty days of the court\u2019s order. The court additionally imposed $2500 in sanctions against the defendant for his failure to comply with previous discovery requests and orders. On August 22, 2001, the defendant provided the plaintiff with documents purporting to be complete disclosure. The plaintiff advised the defendant in writing in September, 2001, that the production was incomplete, and on October 18, 2001, the plaintiff provided the defendant with a detailed list of the documents still missing from disclosure and made a formal written demand for the $2500. The plaintiff then filed her fourth motion for contempt on January 7, 2002, which led the court to impose $40,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and sanctions against the defendant. On February 22, 2002, the parties participated in discovery mediation, which resulted in an agreement between the parties for the production of documents by the defendant; that agreement was made an order of the court on the same date. Following the mediation, the defendant produced some documents, but the production was incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Thereafter, on August 14, 2002, the plaintiff filed her fifth motion for contempt. In the motion, the plaintiff detailed the history of her production requests, motions for contempt, resulting court orders, and the defendant\u2019s consistent failure to comply with discovery requests and orders. The motion also identified in great detail the specific items of discovery that the defendant had not yet supplied pursuant to those orders.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ingly, the plaintiff requested that the court order the defendant \u201cto produce all documents within one (1) week of the hearing on this [m]otion or to appear in [c]ourt to show cause why he should not be incarcerated for willful contempt of the [c]ourt\u2019s orders and to pay sanctions to the [p]laintiff and her reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">When the motion came on for hearing before the court on September 9, 2002,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff explained that she had filed the motion because, although the defendant had produced some documents since the mediation that had taken place on February 22, 2002, she had not received the majority of the production that the court had ordered at that time. She also reminded the court that in April, 2002, the court had held a discovery status conference in the matter, during which the defendant had acknowledged that discovery remained incomplete, yet the plaintiff had not since received any further production from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">After hearing the plaintiffs brief presentation of some of the procedural background that had prompted her to file the fifth motion for contempt, the court, noting that the action had been initiated in late September, 1999, stated that it \u201cprobably is the oldest case on my docket,\u201d and that the case had \u201cbeen going on far too long, folks. This case is going to be tried.\u201d When informed that trial dates had been set for December 1, 2 and 3, 2002, and a deposition of the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>been scheduled for October, 2002, the court repeated that \u201cthis has just got to be tried.\u201d When the defendant\u2019s attorney asserted that \u201c[s]everal things have been said in this motion and the characterizations just aren\u2019t correct,\u201d and when the plaintiffs attorney reminded the court that she had not had an opportunity to present her arguments on the motion in a systematic and detailed manner, and further pointed out that the defendant\u2019s attorney was responding to the motion \u201cin a piecemeal fashion,\u201d the court responded: \u201c[T]ime out both of you . . . the way I look at this is I think . . . this has been done to death, and ... I just don\u2019t see how further sanctions are going to help. I don\u2019t see where further orders are going to help. This case needs to be tried. It\u2019s time for this case to be tried. Three years is more than enough to get it all together one way or the other, and if there\u2019s been bad faith . . . I\u2019m sure that will come out at trial. . . . I\u2019m just appalled. September 28, 1999. That\u2019s the return date on this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The plaintiffs attorney then again reminded the court that she still had not received documents and authorizations requested in the August 14,2002 motion, and asked the court: \u201c[W]hy does it then become my burden to say again and again and again we are still waiting for these documents, they haven\u2019t come?\u201d The plaintiffs attorney then attempted to bring to the court\u2019s attention some of the specific items of discovery that the defendant had not produced despite court orders to do so, referring specifically to Citibank Visa statements, American Express statements and a copy of the defendant\u2019s 1999 amended tax return, all of which had been requested but not produced, despite court orders for compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">When the plaintiffs attorney attempted to continue, the court said: \u201cFolks, stop it. . . . [A]re you getting the message from me? Stop it. I really don\u2019t want to hear anymore about this. Three years is enough to get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>this case tried one way or the other. And I have not got the time, I haven\u2019t got the patience to go through line-by-line on a discovery thing that\u2019s been kicking around for three years. I just don\u2019t have it.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u201cI\u2019ve got . . . 200 cases on my docket that are over one year old. I inherited that, and I have not been able to move that log jam in [the] two years that I\u2019ve been sitting here. And I\u2019m looking through this file. This whole thing is all about . . . discovery. That\u2019s what you\u2019ve been fighting. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u201c[T]his case should have been tried two years ago. So try it, folks. Get your depositions done. . . . [Y]ou\u2019re scheduled for trial. Just take your best shot. . . . [T]here\u2019s no such thing as a [100] percent job. There\u2019s just no such thing anymore . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">When the plaintiffs attorney attempted to respond, the court interrupted and said: \u201cI\u2019m sure you have a core of good, vital information that you can work with. . . . It\u2019s time to get this thing done, and ... if I start to have this hearing, I\u2019ll be . . . all morning on this, tomorrow, going through this one line item at a time. . . . We just don\u2019t have the manpower, the resources, to do this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The plaintiffs attorney then stated to the court: \u201cYou\u2019re telling me we have a core of documents, but I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t have one check register from [the defendant]. I don\u2019t know where he writes his check[s]. . . . I don\u2019t have that information.\u201d The court responded: \u201c[T]hen you take his deposition in October and you ask some of those questions, and maybe we can zero in on some of this, but I can\u2019t take a shotgun blunderbuss approach to discovery on a three year old case. It\u2019s got to be tried. . . . I\u2019ve issued the largest sanctions I have issued in my two and a half years on the bench against [the defendant]. All right? So I think it\u2019s time to try this case. That\u2019s the message I have for both of you. Take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>your depositions, see where you go.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If there\u2019s something very, very specific as far as discovery is concerned, I mean specific and vital, major case, following the deposition, then I\u2019ll hear you on it, but . . . we\u2019ll see you guys in December.\u201d The record indicates that the court marked the plaintiffs motion \u201cOFF: 9/9/02.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The abuse of discretion standard applies to a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for contempt. <em>Sablosky </em>v. <em>Sablosky, </em>258 Conn. 713, 721, 784 A.2d 890 (2001). The facts of this case, however, present the question of whether a trial court has the discretion to refuse to <em>consider </em>a party\u2019s motion for contempt. We have already squarely addressed this issue, concluding that, in the absence of \u201can extreme, compelling situation,\u201d a trial court that has jurisdiction over an action lacks authority to refuse to consider a litigant\u2019s motions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number><em>Ahneman </em>v. <em>Ahneman, </em>243 Conn. 471, 482-84, 706 A.2d 960 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In <em>Ahneman, </em>the defendant had filed an appeal from the trial court\u2019s postjudgment order modifying alimony and support. Id., 473. While the appeal was pending, the defendant filed in the trial court a number of motions that concerned both financial and nonfinancial issues. Id., 474. The trial court specifically stated that it would consider the defendant\u2019s motions regarding nonfinancial issues but refused to consider her motions dealing with financial issues. Id., 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">On the ultimate appeal to this court,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we concluded that \u201cthe trial court lacked authority to refuse to consider the defendant\u2019s motions.\u201d Id., 482. In support of our conclusion, we first specifically held that, in accordance with well established jurisprudence in both the family and nonfamily areas, the filing of an appeal did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to consider motions raising postjudgment issues. Id., 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">We then addressed the merits of the trial court\u2019s refusal to consider the defendant\u2019s motions. We stated: \u201cMore fundamentally, basic principles of jurisprudence refute the plaintiff\u2019s proposition that a trial court has discretion, based on notions of judicial efficiency, to decline to exercise its jurisdiction by refusing to consider certain motions. Courts are in the business of ruling on litigants\u2019 contentions, and they generally oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>ate under the rule essential to the efficient administration of justice, that where a court is vested with jurisdiction over the subject-matter . . . and . . . obtains jurisdiction of the person, it becomes its . . . duty to determine every question which may arise in the cause .... This general rule is particularly important in the context of marital dissolution cases because of the likelihood of continuing changes in the parties\u2019 circumstances requiring continuing dispute resolution by the court.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 484. We also explicitly rejected the notion that principles of judicial efficiency could serve as a justification for a trial court to \u201cdecline to exercise its jurisdiction by refusing to consider certain motions.\u201d Id. Accordingly, we remanded the case to the Appellate Court with direction to remand it further to the trial court for prompt resolution of the defendant\u2019s motions. Id., 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">This reasoning of <em>Ahneman </em>applies directly to the present case. In refusing to decide the motion before it by marking it \u201coff,\u201d the trial court abdicated its fundamental obligation to decide all matters properly presented to it. Just as in <em>Ahneman, </em>the court had the case and the plaintiffs motion properly before it. Just as in <em>Ahneman, </em>it was the court\u2019s duty to determine the questions raised by the motion. Indeed, just as in <em>Ahneman, </em>this was a marital dissolution case, and the plaintiff had a compelling need for enforcement of the court\u2019s prior discovery orders in order to prepare and to try her case; this was part of the court\u2019s duty of \u201ccontinuing dispute resolution . . . .\u201d Id., 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">We also recognized, in <em>Ahneman, </em>however, \u201cthat exceptions to the general rule that a trial court must consider and decide on a reasonably prompt basis all motions properly placed before it may exist <em>in an extreme, compelling situation. </em>For example, we do not rule out the possibility that a trial court may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>discretion to refuse to entertain or decide motions in order to prevent harassing or vexatious litigation. See <em>In re Martin-Trigona, </em>737 F.2d 1254 (2d Cir. 1984) (affirming, in substantial part, District Court\u2019s order barring filings by defendant without first obtaining leave of court, vacating order in minor respect, and entering preliminary injunction barring his filings in Court of Appeals without leave of court), aff d on remand, 763 F.2d 140 (2d Cir. 1985) (affirming District Court\u2019s amended order), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1061, 106 S. Ct. 807, 88 L. Ed. 2d 782 (1986), motions denied, 795 F.2d 9 (2d Cir. 1986) (injunction as to filings in Court of Appeals made permanent), modified sub nom. <em>MartinTrigona </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>876 F.2d 307 (2d Cir. 1989) (granting leave to appeal where defendant had standing), motions denied sub nom. <em>In re Martin-Trigona, </em>9 F.3d 226 (2d Cir. 1993) (seeking disclosure of identity of judges ruling on leave to file applications). Likewise, there may be other circumstances in which a trial court properly could refuse to consider certain motions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Ahneman </em>v. <em>Ahneman, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 484-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">There is no claim that the plaintiffs attempt to enforce the court\u2019s prior orders of discovery was harassing or vexatious, nor did the trial court suggest that such a conclusion formed the basis of its decision. The question, therefore, is whether this case presents some \u201cother [extreme and compelling circumstance] in which a trial court properly could refuse to consider\u201d the plaintiffs motion. Id., 485. We conclude that it does not. In order to understand why that is so, it is necessary to review the plaintiffs motion and the court\u2019s response to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">This was a case in which the financial situation of the defendant was extremely complicated. Furthermore, the complications were exacerbated by the following facts: it was the defendant who had sole access <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>to Ms financial information and documents; during the proceedings he lived and was employed in London, wMle the plaintiff remained in Connecticut; one of Ms mistresses, Landgren, was also a business associate to whom he had executed a promissory note in the amount of $450,000, in purported connection with a public offering by her company, The Translation Group, Ltd., of which the defendant claimed to be a part owner; and the plaintiff claimed that the promissory note to Landgren was fraudulent and that certain substantial payments that the defendant had made to Landgren while tMs case was pending, purportedly in payment of that note, were really attempts to defraud the plaintiff of part of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">M addition, it is undisputed that the case was rife with discovery misconduct by the defendant. During the pendente lite process, pursuant to four motions for contempt by the plaintiff, the court had ordered the defendant to make disclosures that he had failed to make, and had severely sanctioned the defendant. In this connection, it is significant that, in the proceedings at issue on September 9, 2002, the plaintiff was not attempting, at a late stage, to obtain additional discovery that she had failed to request earlier; she was attempting merely to secure, prior to the trial, the discovery that the court already had ordered the defendant to supply to her. Thus, she merely was requesting that the court enforce the orders that it earlier and repeatedly had entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">All of these facts made both the plaintiffs need for full discovery and, correspondingly, the defendant\u2019s obligation to supply full and fair disclosure compelling. See <em>Billington </em>v. Billington, 220 Conn. 212, 221, 595 A.2d 1377 (1991). Furthermore, it is clear from the record that the great portion of the delay in the case from the time of its filing in September, 1999, to the hearing in September, 2002, is fairly attributable, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>to the plaintiff, but to the defendant\u2019s repeated failures to comply with the discovery requests of the plaintiff and with the numerous orders of the court mandating such compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">A brief examination of the court\u2019s expressed reasons for refusing to consider the plaintiffs motion reveals that the court did not base its refusal on any extreme and compelling circumstance that would have justified its decision. In summary, the court\u2019s comments reveal the following reasons for not ruling on the plaintiffs motion: (1) because the motion was lengthy and detailed, it would consume too much of the court\u2019s time to consider it, particularly in light of the court\u2019s backlogged docket; (2) the discovery stage of the case already had been pending too long, three years, and, therefore, the case should go to trial without further delay; (3) the plaintiff had enough information to go forward and should take her \u201cbest shot,\u201d because \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as a [100] percent job\u201d; and (4) the imposition of further sanctions on the defendant would not \u201chelp,\u201d that is, they probably would not result in the defendant\u2019s cooperation. None of these reasons proffered by the court in support of its refusal to consider the plaintiffs motion presents an extreme and compelling circumstance that would have justified the court\u2019s refusal to consider the plaintiffs motion, which was properly before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">We explain briefly why each of the court\u2019s proffered reasons for its refusal to entertain the plaintiffs motion does not justify its decision. First, a court may not refuse to consider a motion in one case because such consideration will delay the disposition of other cases filed by other litigants and because the court believes it has neither the time nor the resources to address a lengthy and detailed motion. On the contrary, \u201c[c]ourts are in the business of ruling on litigants\u2019 contentions . . . .\u201d <em>Ahneman </em>v. <em>Ahneman, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 484. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Such a justification for refusing to consider a motion implicitly elevates the other cases on the docket to a status superior to that of the present case, in that their ultimate disposition is deemed by the court to be somehow more important than the consideration of the motion before it. Similarly, it was inappropriate for the court to base its refusal to consider the motion on the fact that the trial judge viewed himself as having \u201cinherited\u201d more than 200 family cases upon his assignment to the Stamford-Norwalk judicial district and that he was frustrated at not having been able \u201cto move that log jam in [the] two years that [he had] been sitting [there].\u201d The court\u2019s desire to clear its docket is simply not a justifiable basis to refuse to consider a motion properly before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Second, under the circumstances of the present case, the imposition of a three year time limit on the discovery process ignores the fact that it was the defendant\u2019s abuse of the discovery process \u2014 the very abuse that was the subject of the motion \u2014 that was responsible for the delay. Such a rule effectively penalizes the innocent party, and rewards the party who has abused the discovery process.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The imposition of a three year limit was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>also arbitrary, based on an unfounded conclusion that, despite the complicated nature of the case and despite the defendant\u2019s discovery misconduct that had produced the delay, three years was either too long or long enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Third, the court\u2019s suggestion that the plaintiff had secured enough discovery ignores the plaintiff s claims to the contrary \u2014 again, the subject of the very motion that the court refused to consider. Moreover, the court\u2019s advice to counsel that she should take her \u201cbest shot,\u201d and that the plaintiff should not expect 100 percent performance is not reconcilable with the ethical duty of zealous representation that counsel owes to a client. We have admonished counsel that they are responsible for \u201cdiligent investigation and preparation\u201d and \u201cfor full and fair disclosure, for a searching dialogue, about all of the facts that materially affect the client\u2019s rights and interests . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Grayson </em>v. <em>Wofsey, Rosen, Kweskin &amp; Kuriansky, </em>231 Conn. 168, 176, 646 A.2d 195 (1994). In fulfilling this responsibility, an attorney must attempt to present her client\u2019s case on a \u201c[100] percent\u201d basis, at least in the sense stated in this context, namely, that an attorney will give the client a \u201c[100] percent\u201d effort on her behalf. An attorney and client may agree between themselves to limit discovery efforts, or other litigation procedures, on a cost benefit basis; but that does not give the court the power to impose such a limit on such a basis. Furthermore, a suggestion that counsel should give less than 100 percent performance places the trial counsel in a marital dissolution case in a very difficult, if not impossible, position. We have held that, in a legal malpractice claim against a marital attorney, the defendant attorney may be held to be negligent for failure properly \u201cto discover and value the [client\u2019s] business interests and related assets . . . .\u201d Id., 181-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Fourth, the court may not refuse even to consider a motion for contempt based on its doubts that the imposition of further sanctions will result in the wrongdoer\u2019s compliance. Such a justification invites parties in a dissolution action to defy court orders and be recalcitrant in their noncompliance because eventually courts will throw up their hands in defeat.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Subsequent proceedings in the present case illustrate precisely how a court\u2019s abdication of its responsibility to oversee the discovery process, when confronted with a consistently noncompliant party, benefits the wrongdoer and encourages him to persist in his noncompliance. Specifically, at the defendant\u2019s subsequent deposition, rather than utilizing that time to question the defendant based on information that he had provided and using that information to develop a trial strategy, the plaintiff was forced to spend her time with the defendant to question him regarding the very same documents the production of which already had been ordered by the court on numerous occasions in response to her multiple motions for contempt. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s conduct during the deposition was defiant, disrespectful and uncooperative. During the course of the deposition, the defendant responded to the plaintiffs requests for already requested documents by claiming that: he had already produced the documents; he believed that his employer, and not he, was responsible for producing requested documents; in his judgment, the plaintiff did not need certain requested information; he had produced the requested documents at the last deposition; and the volume of requested documents was too vast to allow him reasonably to comply with production requests. At other times, the defendant responded to requests for documents by becoming agitated, complaining that the plaintiffs requests were \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201cnuts\u201d and \u201csick.\u201d When the plaintiffs counsel asked the defendant to produce his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>credit cards, he became furious and threw his wallet at her. He repeatedly used obscenities throughout the proceedings, threatened at one point to leave, responded sarcastically to questions, and during one portion of the proceedings, was reading a magazine. The defendant\u2019s behavior during his deposition exemplifies why a trial court should not refuse to sanction a non-compliant party for failure to obey court orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Most importantly, although the defendant had produced some of the requested documents during his deposition, the plaintiff still had not received full production at the time of trial. At the beginning of trial, the plaintiff filed a motion in limine seeking the following relief, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 13-14,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> for the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with discovery orders: (1) the entry of an order that, as to the matters regarding which the plaintiff had sought discovery, and such discovery had been ordered disclosed, but which the defendant nevertheless had failed to disclose, in violation of the court\u2019s orders, the facts be taken as established in accordance with the plaintiffs claims on those matters; and (2) as to those matters, the entry of an order prohibiting the defendant from offering testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>or documents to rebut the plaintiffs claims regarding those matters.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The court declined to grant the plaintiffs motion in its entirety. Instead, the court stated that it would rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>on the motion in limine on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis, as each matter arose during the course of the trial. During the trial, the plaintiff raised the motion in limine twice, once in regard to a transfer of funds to Meyer and once in regard to a transfer of funds to Landgren. The trial court denied, as unnecessary, the requested relief as to the defendant\u2019s transfer of funds in the amount of $194,023 to Meyer,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and granted relief as to the defendant\u2019s transfer of funds in the amount of approximately $177,000 to Landgren.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In the end, then, the plaintiff did receive partial relief for the defendant\u2019s steadfast refusal to comply with the court\u2019s prior orders of production. We cannot say, however, whether the plaintiff would have been successful in discovering further evidence of the defendant\u2019s concealment of assets, a success which in turn could have resulted in a greater disallowance of the defendant\u2019s explanations in response to the plaintiffs claims, and, therefore, in the plaintiffs receiving a larger portion of the marital estate. We cannot answer that question because the court\u2019s refusal to consider the plaintiffs August 14, 2002 motion for contempt permitted the defendant to stonewall the plaintiff up to and including the trial. This dilemma aptly illustrates why as a matter of policy a court should not have discretion, in the absence of extreme and compelling circumstances, to refuse to consider a party\u2019s motion properly before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">We next turn to the remedy for the court\u2019s improper refusal to consider the plaintiffs motion. Because the case already has been decided in the wake of that abuse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>we cannot simply remand it for the court to consider the motion, as we were able to do in <em>Ahneman. </em>Thus, we are required to decide who has the burden of establishing the harm flowing from the trial court\u2019s error, in order to decide whether the court\u2019s error requires a new trial. Although ordinarily the burden to establish harm is borne by the party who claims the error \u2014 in this case, the plaintiff \u2014 we conclude, to the contrary, that under the unique circumstances of this case the defendant should bear the burden of showing no harm to the plaintiff as a result of the trial court\u2019s refusal to consider the plaintiffs motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">First, it would be grossly unfair to the plaintiff to require her to establish precisely how she was harmed in proving her case by not having access to the extensive list of already ordered discovery materials to which she never gained access solely as a result of the court\u2019s refusal to consider her motion. In other words, the court already had ruled that she was entitled to discovery of those materials; see footnote 3 of this opinion; but then improperly refused to enforce its prior orders. She reasonably cannot be expected to establish how she was harmed in proving her case by reference to materials to which she was, by virtue of judicial orders, entitled to see but nonetheless never saw. Indeed, to take but one example, the trial transcript shows that the plaintiff repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, attempted to prove, by reference to various financial records, that the defendant\u2019s $450,000 promissory note to Landgren was fraudulent and that, therefore, the payments that he had made on that note were simply diversions of marital assets. Without the documents that the plaintiff had sought through her motion, it is impossible to determine \u2014 and it would be equally impossible for the plaintiff to establish \u2014 whether the plaintiffs effort would have been successful had the court heard her motion and decided it in her favor. Thus, the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>the beneficiary of the court\u2019s improper refusal to consider the plaintiffs motion. Furthermore, the defendant remained in total control of all of the materials sought by the plaintiff and ordered to be disclosed to her by the court, and, therefore, he reasonably could be expected to be able to establish that the materials would not have helped the plaintiff prove her case. Cf. <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Weinstein, </em>280 Conn. 764, 773, 911 A.2d 1077 (2007) (concluding that party holding investment account bore burden to show that low rate of return on his investments was reasonable, rather than placing burden on other spouse to show that rate was unreasonable). To conclude otherwise would be to encourage the kind of gamesmanship and evasion of discovery that the defendant engaged in here.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Second, placing the burden in this respect on the defendant who failed to comply fully with the court\u2019s orders is consistent with our decision in <em>Billington </em>v. <em>Billington, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 221, in which we articulated the requirement of full and frank mutual disclosure in marital cases. In doing so, we analogized the marital relationship, even in the context of a dissolution case, to \u201cthe special relationship between fiduciary and beneficiary,\u201d insofar as the requirement of disclosure is concerned. Id. Just as the relationship between fiduciary and beneficiary \u201ccompels full disclosure by the fiduciary\u201d; id., citing <em>Pacelli Bros. Transportation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pacelli, </em>189 Conn. 401, 407-409, 456 A.2d 325 (1983); \u201cwe believe that no less disclosure is required of such parties when they come to court seeking to terminate their marriage.\u201d <em>Billington </em>v. <em>Billington, </em>supra, 221. Similarly, just as, once it has been shown that a fiduciary has engaged in self-dealing, he has the burden to establish the fairness of the transaction by clear and convincing evidence; see <em>Cadle Co. </em>v. <em>D\u2019Addario, </em>268 Conn. 441, 457, 844 A.2d 836 (2004); so, as in the present case, when the defendant has breached his fiduciary-like obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>gations of discovery to the plaintiff as ordered by the court, he should bear the burden of establishing that his breach of that obligation did not harm the beneficiary of that obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In the present case, the defendant has not attempted to establish such lack of harm; his sole contention on this claim by the plaintiff is that the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to consider the plaintiffs motion. Because, as we have stated many times, the financial orders in a marital case are like a mosaic; see, e.g., <em>Grimm </em>v. <em>Grimm, </em>276 Conn. 377, 386, 886 A.2d 391 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1148, 126 S. Ct. 2296, 164 L. Ed. 2d 815 (2006); <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>275 Conn. 348, 354, 880 A.2d 872 (2005); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>262 Conn. 299, 307, 811 A.2d 1283 (2003); and because the defendant has not established that the mosaic likely would have been the same despite his failure to disclose as ordered by the court and despite the court\u2019s refusal to consider the plaintiffs motion, the entire mosaic must be refashioned. Accordingly, the judgment must be reversed as to the financial orders and remanded for a new trial on the financial issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Because it is likely to arise on remand, we next address the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly interpreted our decision in <em>Maguire </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 32, to require that the court should not award attorney\u2019s fees when a marital party is financially able to pay them, and the payment of the fees would not undermine the other financial orders, even in a case in which the party seeking attorney\u2019s fees incurred those fees because of the other party\u2019s misconduct. In the alternative, the plaintiff argues, if the trial court correctly applied the existing law under <em>Maguire, </em>we should now recognize an exception to the rule to afford the trial court the discretion to award such fees as part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>of the final financial orders when the innocent party has incurred substantial attorney\u2019s fees because of the other party\u2019s egregious litigation misconduct and the other orders of the court have not already adequately addressed that misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling declining to award attorney\u2019s fees as part of the final financial orders was based on its accurate reading of <em>Maguire. </em>A fair reading of the court\u2019s memorandum of decision establishes that it simply applied <em>Maguire </em>in denying the plaintiffs request for attorney\u2019s fees, which was specifically based on the defendant\u2019s litigation misconduct, because she had ample liquid funds to pay her attorneys.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, the court never exercised any discretion as to whether to make such an award based on the claimed misconduct and on whether that misconduct had already been adequately addressed by its prior orders. We also conclude, however, that <em>Maguire </em>should be expanded to provide a trial court with the discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees to an innocent party who has incurred substantial attorney\u2019s fees due to the egregious litigation misconduct of the other party when the trial court\u2019s other financial orders have not adequately addressed that misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62 governs the award of attorney\u2019s fees in dissolution actions and provides that \u201cthe court may order either spouse ... to pay the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of the other in accordance with their respective financial abilities and the criteria set forth in [General Statutes \u00a7] 46b-82. ...\u201d These criteria <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>include \u201cthe length of the marriage, the causes for the . . . dissolution of the marriage . . . the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate and needs of each of the parties and the award, if any, which the court may make pursuant to [General Statutes \u00a7] 46b-81 . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">We relied on these statutory provisions in <em>Maguire, </em>in concluding that the trial court improperly had ordered the defendant to reimburse the plaintiff for $50,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Maguire </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 45. In our analysis of the statutory language and the relevant case law interpreting the statute, we stated: \u201c[A]mple liquid funds [are] not an absolute litmus test for an award of counsel fees. . . . [T]o award counsel fees to a spouse who had sufficient assets would be justified, if the failure to do so would substantially undermine the other financial awards.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 44. We then determined that the plaintiff had more than $500,000 in liquid assets at her disposal, that the trial court had made no finding that an award of attorney\u2019s fees was necessary to avoid undermining its other financial orders, and that the record did not support such a finding. Id., 44-45. Therefore, we reversed the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff. Id., 45. Thus, the general rule under <em>Maguire </em>is that an award of attorney\u2019s fees in a marital dissolution case is warranted only when at least one of two circumstances is present: (1) one party does not have ample liquid assets to pay for attorney\u2019s fees; or (2) the failure to award attorney\u2019s fees will undermine the court\u2019s other financial orders. See id., 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Under <em>Maguire, </em>in a case such as the present one, in which an innocent party has incurred substantial attorney\u2019s fees as a result of the other party\u2019s litigation misconduct, the innocent party must nevertheless bear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the full brunt of her attorney\u2019s fees, as long as the innocent party has ample liquid funds to pay her attorneys, and as long as the lack of an award of attorney\u2019s fees would not undermine the court\u2019s other financial orders. This result would follow regardless of the seriousness, duration and pervasiveness of the other party\u2019s litigation misconduct, regardless of how high the resultant cost to the innocent party, and regardless of any advantage the wrongdoer may have secured through his litigation misconduct, such as, for example, the successful concealment of a portion of his assets. Significantly, <em>Maguire </em>involved no allegations or findings of litigation misconduct. In that decision, therefore, the court did not consider whether one party\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees resulting from the misconduct of the other party should be recoverable apart from other financial orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">In a subsequent decision that <em>did </em>involve both allegations and findings of litigation misconduct, we implicitly acknowledged that an expansion of <em>Maguire </em>would be appropriate. In <em>Jewett </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>265 Conn. 669, 694, 830 A.2d 193 (2003), we sustained an award of attorney\u2019s fees that was based, in part at least, on the fact that \u201cmuch of the plaintiffs accrued or already paid legal fees have been caused by the defendant\u2019s failure . . . promptly and candidly [to] comply with numerous motions and discovery.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Thus, in <em>Jewett, </em>we implicitly acknowledged that a party\u2019s litigation misconduct can form part of the basis of such an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Our conclusion that a court should have the discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees to a party who incurs those fees largely due to the other party\u2019s egregious litigation misconduct is consistent with the reasoning of our decision in <em>Billington </em>v. <em>Billington, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 212. In that case, we explicitly recognized the requirement of full and frank disclosure between marital litigants. Id., 221. We drew that requirement from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>our understanding of the unique nature of the marital relationship; id. (\u201cCourts simply should not countenance either party to such a unique human relationship dealing with each other at arms\u2019 length. Whatever honesty there may, or should, have been during the marriage should at least be required by the courts at its end.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]); and from the understanding that \u201cthe principle of full and frank disclosure ... is essential to our strong policy that the private settlement of the financial affairs of estranged marital partners is a goal that courts should support rather than undermine.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Thus, in eliminating the requirement of diligence in order to prove fraud, we stated that \u201cthe requirement of diligence in discovering fraud is inconsistent with the requirement of full disclosure because it imposes on the innocent injured party the duty to discover that which the wrongdoer already is legally obligated to disclose.\u201d Id., 220. By recognizing today this limited expansion of <em>Maguire, </em>we are reinforcing the marital partners\u2019 mutual obligation of full and frank disclosure by permitting the trial court an additional remedy for egregious violations of that obligation when those violations have not otherwise been adequately addressed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Public policy and principles of equity further support our expansion of the <em>Maguire </em>rule. Allowing recovery for attorney\u2019s fees incurred due to litigation misconduct will discourage the recalcitrant marital litigant from evading his obligations of full and frank disclosure, and will encourage compliance with those obligations. When a marital litigant who does play by the rules has to expend her own funds to pay her attorneys significant amounts of money to enforce discovery orders against, and uncover assets hidden or transferred by, the other marital litigant who is flouting those rules, and when other orders of the court have not adequately addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>that wrongdoing by one party and harm to the other, it is only fair that the wrongdoer compensate the \u201cinnocent injured party [for having] to discover that which the wrongdoer already [was] legally obligated to disclose.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The present case aptly illustrates the need for expanding <em>Maguire </em>to allow a trial court the discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees to address the litigation misconduct of a marital litigant. The record contains ample evidence of egregious litigation misconduct by the defendant, both before and during the trial, that would form the basis of such an exercise of discretion. The pretrial conduct of the defendant in failing to fulfill his obligations of full and frank disclosure, and of compliance with orders of the court, has been amply discussed in part I of this opinion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Furthermore, in its memorandum of decision, the court specifically addressed additional pretrial litigation misconduct by the defendant, namely, diversion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>of marital assets and concealment thereof from the plaintiff. The court stated that \u201cthe evidence supports [the plaintiffs] claim that the [defendant] used <em>at least </em>$395,000 in marital assets, including a partial distribution from his Capital Deposit Account ($174,023), a payment of Special Compensation ($208,725), and a joint income tax refund ($12,736), for the purchase of such things as a BMW automobile, an apartment in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, and to maintain his lifestyle in Europe. He has tried to keep these assets out of reach by placing title in the names of other persons.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The [plaintiff] has spent enormous sums [of money] for attorney\u2019s fees in large part to trace these assets, with limited success.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s misconduct dining the trial, in its decision the court explicitly noted the defendant\u2019s pattern of deceit and disdain for the legal process. The court stated that the defendant \u201cis a well educated, very intelligent and sophisticated international professional. However, instead of emphasizing these attributes, he has carried the pattern of deceit right into the courtroom, where, with barely concealed disdain for the legal process, he repeatedly feigned misunderstanding of plain English (the lingua franca of international business dealings), engaged in linguistic gymnastics, and had selective lapses of memory. He had to be repeatedly admonished by the court, and accordingly, the court found him to be less than credible in much of his testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In addition, during the trial, the court several times commented on the defendant\u2019s misconduct. For example, at one point the court noted the defendant\u2019s \u201cobstructive, obstreperous behavior\u201d on the witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>stand; at another point the court noted that the defendant was \u201cbound and determined to not listen to the questions. He\u2019s going to tell it his way. He doesn\u2019t care. He doesn\u2019t care what I say, what [his counsel] say[s], what [the plaintiff\u2019s counsel] says. He is going to tell it his way because he knows better than everybody in this courtroom. It\u2019s wearing very, very thin. . . . And every single answer is like pulling teeth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">As we already have noted, in denying the plaintiff\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees based on the defendant\u2019s litigation misconduct, the court correctly interpreted the existing rule under <em>Maguire </em>in concluding that it did not have the discretion to consider such an award. In light of our decision today, however, the court will, on the remand, have such discretion. This does not mean, and we do not say, that the court must award such fees. Nor does it mean that the court may award such fees if it determines that the defendant\u2019s misconduct adequately has been addressed by other orders of the court. It means only that, when a party has engaged in egregious litigation misconduct that has required the other party to expend significant amounts of money for attorney\u2019s fees, and where the court determines, in its discretion, that the misconduct has not been addressed adequately by other orders of the court, the court has discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees to compensate for the harm caused by that misconduct, irrespective of whether the other party has ample liquid assets and of whether the lack of such an award would undermine the court\u2019s other financial orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The defendant and the dissent contend, however, that this expansion of <em>Maguire, </em>namely, allowing a trial court the discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees incurred by one party as a result of the egregious litigation misconduct of the other party when the court\u2019s other financial orders have not adequately addressed that misconduct, amounts to a sanction and violates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>often stated principle that attorney\u2019s fees awards are not to be used to penalize parties. See, e.g., <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>211 Conn. 485, 488, 560 A.2d 396 (1989) (\u201cpunishment of a litigant should play no role in the determination of the issue of awarding attorney\u2019s fees\u201d). We disagree. We repeat that the purpose of the expansion of <em>Maguire </em>is to compensate an innocent party for having had to bear the burden of expenses incurred as a result of the other party\u2019s misconduct. The aim of the expansion is to prevent the innocent party from being unfairly burdened. The fact that the result may also deter the wrongdoer from <em>benefiting </em>from his egregious litigation misconduct does not convert an award under the expansion to a sanction. It simply reallocates the burden for the increased fees to the party responsible for causing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The sole case cited by the defendant in support of his claim that this expansion of <em>Maguire </em>improperly imposes a sanction on parties, <em>Dobozy </em>v. Dobozy, 241 Conn. 490, 697 A.2d 1117 (1997), is distinguishable. In that case, the issue was \u201cthe extent to which . . . \u00a7 46b-62 authorizes a trial court, in a contempt proceeding brought to enforce child care and support orders, to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing parent without first finding the respondent parent in contempt.\u201d Id., 492. In that case, then, there had been no finding by the trial court that one of the parties engaged in litigation misconduct. The court\u2019s inquiry was whether, in the absence of such a conclusion, an award of attorney\u2019s fees would nevertheless be justified. We answered that question in the affirmative. Id., 495. In the present case, by contrast, the litigation misconduct of the defendant was established over and over again, each time the court granted the plaintiffs motions for contempt, and again in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision, which concluded that the defendant\u2019s misconduct permeated the entire case. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>characterization, by both the defendant and the dissent, of the expansion we recognize today as a sanction ignores the fact that, in the absence of the expansion, an innocent party would be forced to bear the financial cost for the defendant\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The judgment is reversed as to the financial orders only and the case is remanded for a new trial on the financial issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">In this opinion NORCOTT, KATZ and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\"> Because we conclude that the trial court improperly failed to rule on the plaintiffs motion for contempt and sanctions based on the defendant\u2019s repeated failure to comply with the court\u2019s discovery orders, and that the rule under <em>Maguire </em>should be expanded to apply to the plaintiff, and accordingly we remand the case for a new trial, it is unnecessary for us to reach the plaintiffs remaining claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b351-7\"> Two children were bom of the marriage, both of whom had reached the age of majority at the time of judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b356-5\"> The following is a summary of what the plaintiff claimed that the defendant had not provided to the plaintiff, despite orders to do so: the defendant\u2019s United Kingdom tax return due April, 2002, and signed copies or supporting documentation for the tax returns that the defendant had supplied; from PriceWaterhouseCoopers, K-l forms for fiscal years ending September 30, 1997, 1998 and 2001, and 1099 forms from fiscal years ending September 30,1997,1998,1999,2000 and 2001; a copy of the defendant\u2019s 1999 amended federal income tax return; Citibank Visa account summaries from 1998 to the present, along with a copy of the defendant\u2019s letter to Citibank requesting the summaries; Citibank United Kingdom banking account statements for five separate accounts for December 17,1997, through December, 1998, and after October 31,2001; statements for the defendant\u2019s Citibank United States accounts from January 1, 1998 through November 16, 1998, and December 14, 2001, to the present; the defendant\u2019s 2001 tax returns or requests for extensions for filing; copies of letters sent to the main branches of three German banks confirming whether the defendant had accounts with any of those banks and the status of any such accounts (the defendant had mailed letters only to local branches and received no responses); year end account statements for the defendant\u2019s Smith Barney accounts for 2000, 2001, and a copy of his then current statement \u2014 the defendant provided only incomplete statements for some of the requested periods; confirmation that the defendant had requested copies of PriceWaterhouseCoopers\u2019 expense reports and reimbursement requests; any documents from the International Accounting Standards Board showing a cumulative year-to-date total of his income for 2001, other than the defendant\u2019s pay stubs and not including his pay stub from January, 2002; documentation regarding any payments made to Theodora Landgren, the defendant\u2019s mistress, arising from The Translation Group, Ltd., stock transactions including loan documentation, repayment of any loan and transactions concerning sale of stock; summary plan descriptions for any retirement plans with PriceWaterhouseCoopers; a copy of the defendant\u2019s credit report; only incomplete portions of <em>some </em>of the requested Merrill Lynch account statements; updated individual retirement account, Keogh 401 (k) and other retirement plans, with the exception of a one page Internet printout showing 401 (k) savings; documents concerning the defendant\u2019s relationship with BTS WordHouse, a Netherlands subsidiary of The Translation Group, Ltd.; statements from various American Express card accounts; documents pertaining to the defendant\u2019s inheritance from his father; the defendant\u2019s foreign sources of income, as well as income or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>honoraria derived from the defendant\u2019s position on the board of directors at various unnamed institutions, or income related to the defendant\u2019s various publications; and lastly, any canceled checks or check registers for the defendant\u2019s bank accounts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b357-9\"> The dissent\u2019s contention that the mere fact that the court held a hearing on the motion means that the court <em>considered </em>the motion is not supported by the record.

First, unlike an evidentiary offer, there is no requirement that a party file a formal \u201cobjection\u201d to a court\u2019s ruling \u2014 or refusal to rule \u2014 on a motion. Second, the entire transcript evidences the numerous ways in which the plaintiff attempted to persuade the court to rule on the motion in her favor. For example, after the court stated that the case \u201chas just got to be tried,\u201d the plaintiff pointed out to the court that she had \u201cnot had an opportunity to go through the motion and argue the motion line-by-line.\u201d Later in the hearing, the plaintiff attempted to explain to the court the extent of the defendant\u2019s continued noncompliance in the face of repeated discovery requests made by the plaintiff seeking court-ordered production from the defendant. Referring to the burden placed on her in making those repeated requests, the plaintiff asked the court, \u201c[W]hy does it then become my burden to say again and again and again we are still waiting for these documents, they haven\u2019t come.\u201d In response to the court\u2019s assertion that she had a \u201ccore of good, vital information that you can work with,\u201d the plaintiff responded: \u201cYou\u2019re telling me we have a core of documents, but I don\u2019t.\u201d In response to this final attempt to persuade the court to hear her motion, the court instructed the plaintiff to take the defendant\u2019s deposition, and to come to the court to be heard further if she had something \u201cspecific and vital, mqjor case . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\"> The defendant had appealed to the Appellate Court from the trial court\u2019s refusal to consider her financial motions.

That\u2019s the message I have for both of you.\u201d The court also imposed a much more demanding standard for the plaintiff to meet after the deposition, instructing the plaintiff that the court would hear her then, but only if \u201cthere\u2019s something <em>very, very specific </em>as far as the discovery is concerned, I mean <em>specific and vital, major case </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The dissent\u2019s characterization of the trial court\u2019s decision as the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of denying the plaintiffs motion without prejudice ignores the fact that the court set a much higher standard for the plaintiff to meet before the court would address the defendant\u2019s discovery misconduct. After the defendant had complied only partially at his deposition, therefore, the plaintiff filed her motion in limine at the beginning of trial in an attempt to meet that higher standard. The dissent also contends that the plaintiff in effect waived any procedural defect by agreeing, at the beginning of the trial, to the trial court\u2019s suggested procedure on her motion in limine. This contention wholly ignores the procedural context at that point, because it ignores the significance of the fact that the plaintiff was compelled to seek relief at the very outset of trial, rather than prior to it \u2014 namely, that the delay in the availability of relief for the defendant\u2019s discovery abuse changed the very nature of the relief that she was able to request from the court. It would have been, as a practical matter, impossible for the plaintiff to renew her motion for contempt at that time, particularly given that the trial court had set a higher standard for her to meet in seeking further relief. At that point, therefore, any renewal of the plaintiffs August 12 motion for contempt would have been pointless, as well as any objection she may have raised regarding the trial court\u2019s decision to refuse to consider that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Moreover, we disagree with the dissent that the plaintiffs failure to renew her request for sanctions following the deposition of the defendant, or to request a new judge at the time of trial, signifies that the plaintiff had not construed the court\u2019s decision to mark off her August 12 motion for contempt as an absolute refusal to consider the motion. On the contrary, the plaintiffs failure simply to renew her request for sanctions following the defendant\u2019s deposition signifies that she did understand the trial court\u2019s refusal to consider the August 12 motion to be absolute, unless she could meet the higher bar. Furthermore, the plaintiff was under no obligation to request that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>case be assigned to a new judge.

The majority concludes, on the basis of <em>Ahneman </em>v. <em>Ahneman, 243 </em>Conn. 471, 706 A.2d 960 (1998), that in marking the motion off the calendar, the trial court refused to decide the issues raised therein and thus abdicated its fundamental obligation to decide all matters properly placed before it. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>The following facts are relevant to a resolution of this issue. The plaintiff filed a motion for contempt and sanctions on August 14, 2002, after the defendant, Kurt P. Ramin, failed to comply with the court\u2019s most recent discovery order. In her motion, the plaintiff asked the court to: (1) hold the defendant in contempt for his noncompliance with discovery; (2) order the defendant to produce all outstanding documents within one week or appear in court to show cause why he should not be incarcerated for wilful contempt; and (3) order the defendant to pay sanctions to the plaintiff and her reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. On September 9, 2002, after hearing argument on the matter, the trial court, clearly exasperated by the parties\u2019 continuing battle over discovery, declared that it was not inclined to decide the motion at that time. The court stated: \u201cTake your depositions, see where you go. <em>If there\u2019s something very, very specific as far as the discovery is concerned, I mean specific and vital, major case, following the deposition, then I\u2019ll hear you on it . . . </em>(Emphasis added.) The plaintiff did not object to the trial court\u2019s decision. Thereafter, the court marked the motion off the calendar, the plaintiff deposed the defendant over the course of five days in October and December, 2002, and the parties proceeded to trial in March, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">At the commencement of the trial, the plaintiff filed a motion in limine requesting that \u201ccertain financial matters regarding which discovery was sought from the [defendant and with regard to which he failed and refused to comply, shall be established for the purposes of the action in accordance with the claims of the [p]laintiff.\u201d The financial matters to which the motion referred included assets that the defendant had identified during his deposition, including funds that he had transferred to his girlfriend in Germany and a $70,000 retirement account that he had maintained in the United Kingdom. The motion also sought to preclude the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>dant, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 13-14, from offering testimony or documents to rebut the plaintiff s claims concerning these and other assets that the defendant had placed outside the marital estate or deliberately had concealed from the plaintiff and the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In explaining her reasons for filing the motion, the plaintiffs counsel observed that, during the September 9 hearing, the court had \u201cgrown quite understandably frustrated with the discovery process and <em>requested that we try and address it all at the time of trial.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) She then described the defendant\u2019s continuing refusal to cooperate during his five day deposition and his noncompliance with her requests for the production of documents. When the court asked the plaintiffs counsel how she wanted the court to deal with the defendant\u2019s ongoing discovery misconduct, she asked that it grant the motion in limine, stating: \u201c[T]hat would seem to me to be the perfectly appropriate resolution.\u201d She also requested attorney\u2019s fees to sanction the defendant for the additional legal expenses incurred to obtain the information he had refused to produce.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The court responded that it would consider specific evidence regarding the dissipated assets on a case-by-case basis as it was introduced at trial, rather than granting the motion in limine at that time. The court also agreed to consider the plaintiffs request for attorney\u2019s fees to sanction the defendant for his noncompliance with discovery. The plaintiffs counsel expressed satisfaction with the court\u2019s response and declared that she was prepared to try the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Thereafter, the plaintiff requested on two separate occasions that sanctions be imposed against the defendant. On the first occasion, the defendant testified on direct examination that he had transferred approximately $194,000 out of the marital estate to his German girlfriend, Martina Meyer, without the plaintiffs consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>following commencement of the dissolution proceedings. In denying the plaintiffs motion, the court explained that the defendant had stated that he did not intend to introduce any additional evidence contradicting his former testimony on the matter, and, consequently, improper removal of the assets in question was an \u201cuncontroverted\u201d fact that the court would take into account when making an equitable distribution of the marital estate at the conclusion of the trial. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">On the second occasion, the court granted the plaintiffs motion for sanctions with respect to the defendant\u2019s proposed testimony on cross-examination regarding his removal of an additional $177,248 out of the marital estate without the plaintiffs knowledge or consent. The court explained: \u201cI\u2019m specifically tying [this decision] into the original motion in limine and I\u2019m specifically tying it into [the defendant\u2019s] responses and his behavior and what this court deems to be a calculated . . . effort to obstruct the discovery process and to move this case forward.\u201d In its subsequent memorandum of decision, the court also explained that it had considered the defendant\u2019s noncompliance with discovery when it formulated the financial orders distributing the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 11-13 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Unless otherwise provided in these rules or ordered by the judicial authority ... all motions and objections to requests when practicable . . . must be placed on the short calendar list. . . . [A]ny motion in a case on trial, or assigned for trial, may be disposed of by the judicial authority <em>at its discretion </em>.... (c) If a motion has gone off the short calendar without being adjudicated any party may claim the motion for adjudication. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, the issue before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>this court is whether the trial court abused its discretion when it marked the plaintiffs motion off the calendar.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u201cAs with any discretionary action of the trial court, appellate review requires every reasonable presumption in favor of the action, and <em>the ultimate issue for us is whether the trial court could have reasonably concluded as it did. </em>... In reviewing a claim that the court has abused this discretion, great weight is due to the action of the trial court and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness ....</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u201cAt the same time . . . [discretion imports something more than leeway in decision-making. ... It means a legal discretion, to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice. . . . [T]he court\u2019s discretion should be exercised mindful of the policy preference to bring about a trial on the merits of a dispute whenever possible and to secure for the litigant his day in court. . . . The design of the rules of practice is both to facilitate business and to advance justice; they will be interpreted liberally in any case where it shall be manifest that a strict adherence to them will work surprise or injustice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>. . . Rules are a means to justice, and not an end in themselves . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Millbrook Owners Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamilton Standard, </em>257 Conn. 1, 15-16, 776 A.2d 1115 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The trial court in the present case did not refuse to consider the plaintiffs motion for contempt and sanctions, but, rather, conducted a hearing on September 9, 2002, for that very purpose. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court chose, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion pursuant to our rules of practice; see Practice Book \u00a7 11-13; to mark the motion off the calendar. The court advised the plaintiff that it would hear the parties further with respect to any \u201cspecific and vital\u201d discovery information that the plaintiff failed to obtain when she deposed the defendant the following month. As a result, the trial court\u2019s decision was the functional equivalent of denying the plaintiffs motion without prejudice because the court, having concluded that the motion should not be decided at that time, effectively \u201c[left] the matter open for further presentation and consideration in the same or another proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Varanelli </em>v. <em>Luddy, </em>130 Conn. 74, 80, 32 A.2d 61 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">It is the duty of the reviewing court to make every reasonable presumption in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.

I would therefore conclude, mindful that the rules of practice are designed to facilitate business and advance justice, that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>court properly and reasonably exercised its discretion by deferring to rule on the motion for contempt and sanctions until after the plaintiff had made one final attempt to obtain discovery during the defendant\u2019s deposition. Significantly, the plaintiff did not object to the trial court\u2019s decision when it was rendered or at any time thereafter. Moreover, after the defendant produced some of the requested documents during the deposition, the plaintiff chose not to seek further argument on the contempt motion, as she could have done, but instead filed a motion in limine requesting that the court impose sanctions at trial for the defendant\u2019s remaining discovery misconduct. At the hearing on that motion, the plaintiff indicated that the reason she had not resurrected her prior motion was because the trial court had <em>\u201crequested that we try and address [the remaining discovery </em>issues] <em>at the time of trial,\u201d </em>which she later described as a <em>\u201cperfectly appropriate resolution\u201d </em>of the matter. (Emphasis added.) Furthermore, the plaintiff received the relief she sought in her motion in limine on the only two occasions when she objected to the defendant\u2019s actual or proposed testimony regarding the allegedly dissipated assets.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result, the plaintiff achieved her objective of ensuring that the court accept her version of events as true on both occasions. Notably, the plaintiff did not merely acquiesce in the solution devised by the court to address the defendant\u2019s discovery abuse, but participated in crafting it when she filed the motion in limine at the commencement of the trial. Accordingly, I would conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion when it deferred consideration of the plaintiffs motion until after the defendant\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>To the extent that the majority construes the trial court\u2019s failure to render a formal ruling on the motion as an absolute refusal to consider the issues raised therein, I submit that the plaintiff herself would not have agreed with this conclusion. If she had believed that the court\u2019s decision amounted to an absolute refusal, she could have claimed the motion or sought its reassignment to another judge pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 11-13 and 11-19.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, her subsequent remarks at the hearing on the motion in limine indicate that she was satisfied with the trial court\u2019s decision to defer a ruling on the motion and to address all remaining discovery issues at trial. The majority\u2019s failure to view as significant the fact that the plaintiff did not renew her request for sanctions following the defendant\u2019s deposition, claim her motion, or seek reassignment of the motion to another judge, suggests an unwillingness to hold the plaintiff and her attorney accountable for their decisions regarding how to deal with the defendant\u2019s discovery misconduct prior to and during the trial. I believe that micromanaging the trial court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>matters of discovery, as the majority appears to do here, <em>especially </em>in emotionally tense family disputes, is dangerous and unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The majority maintains that our decision in <em>Ahneman </em>compels a different result. I emphatically disagree on the ground that <em>Ahneman </em>is factually distinguishable. In that case, the defendant filed several postjudgment motions concerning financial and nonfinancial matters. <em>Ahneman </em>v. <em>Ahneman, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 474. At short calendar, the trial court rendered an oral decision declining to consider the motions. Id., 475. Thereafter, the defendant moved for reconsideration and reargument. Id., 475-76. Following reargument, the court announced that it would consider the motions concerning nonfinancial matters, but would not consider the motions regarding financial matters. Id., 476. The court explained: \u201cAs far as the money issues are concerned, it was my opinion that that was the law of the case that was established by the contested hearing we had over the modification and the contempt. That ruling, I think, would cover these other money issues. ... I will not hear anything on monetary aspects because I think the law of the case was established as a result of the earlier hearing. It\u2019s now on appeal. The nonmonetary aspects I will set down for a hearing . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 476-77 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">On appeal to this court, we initially determined that we had jurisdiction to review the defendant\u2019s claim because the trial court\u2019s \u201cdecision not to consider the defendant\u2019s motions\u201d was the functional equivalent of a final judgment. Id., 480. We stated that, \u201c[1] ike a formal denial, the effect of the court\u2019s decision refusing to consider the defendant\u2019s motions during the pendency of the appeal was to foreclose the possibility of relief from the court on those issues, unless and until the resolution of the appeal required further proceedings. Indeed, the refusal to consider a motion is more deserv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>ing of appellate review than a formal denial, because the defendant not only has been denied relief; she has been denied the opportunity even to persuade the trial court that she is entitled to that relief. Moreover . . . there is an unacceptable possibility that any harm suffered as a result of the court\u2019s refusal to consider the motion will never be remediable.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">We then considered whether the trial court had discretion to refuse to consider the motions and concluded that it did not. We stated that, \u201cwhere a court is vested with jurisdiction over the subject-matter . . . and . . . obtains jurisdiction of the person, it becomes its . . . duty to determine every question which may arise in the cause .... [A] trial court must consider and decide on a reasonably prompt basis all motions properly placed before it [except] in an extreme, compelling situation,\u201d such as \u201cto prevent harassing or vexatious litigation\u201d or in \u201cother [undefined] circumstances . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 484-85. We ultimately determined that no extenuating circumstances existed in <em>Ahneman </em>that would have justified the trial court\u2019s refusal to consider the disputed motions. Id., 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The present case is distinguishable from <em>Ahneman </em>because the trial court\u2019s decision to mark the motion off the short calendar was <em>not </em>a final judgment that foreclosed the possibility of relief or that denied the plaintiff an opportunity to persuade the court that she was entitled to such relief. Unlike in <em>Ahneman, </em>the court in the present case exercised its jurisdiction when it conducted a hearing on the merits of the plaintiffs motion, listened to the parties\u2019 arguments and advised the plaintiff at the conclusion of the hearing that she could seek future relief if the defendant did not comply with her requests for discovery during his deposition. When the defendant persisted in his misconduct by failing to cooperate fully at his deposition, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>filed a motion in limine at the start of the trial requesting an order that certain disputed financial matters be established in accordance with her claims and that the defendant be precluded from presenting contradictory evidence. Furthermore, the plaintiff ultimately obtained the relief she requested. Accordingly, the facts in <em>Ahneman, </em>in which the court did <em>not </em>exercise its jurisdiction because the issues raised in the defendant\u2019s motion had been raised in her pending appeal and would be decided by the reviewing court, are completely different from the facts in the present case. The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Ahneman </em>as a basis <em>for </em>reversal is, therefore, misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the burden of establishing harm should be shifted from the plaintiff to the defendant \u201cunder the unique circumstances of this case . . . .\u201d See <em>Bovat </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>258 Conn. 574, 594, 783 A.2d 1001 (2001) (\u201c[i]n order to establish reversible error, the defendant must prove both an abuse of discretion and a harm that resulted from such abuse\u201d). According to the majority, the circumstances in this case are \u201cunique\u201d because of the defendant\u2019s offensive behavior during his deposition. He was disrespectful and defiant, threw his wallet at the plaintiffs counsel when she asked him to produce his credit cards, repeatedly used obscenities and read a magazine during the proceeding. I would submit, however, that the defendant\u2019s behavior at the deposition was irrelevant to the issue of harm because it occurred <em>after </em>the trial court\u2019s consideration of the motion for contempt and sanctions, and, consequently, had no connection to the court\u2019s prior action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the defendant\u2019s bad behavior during the deposition had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>connection to his noncompliance with discovery. In other words, although I agree with the majority that the defendant acted in a provocative and aggressive manner during his deposition, any harm that may have been caused by his failure to comply with discovery would have occurred even if he had not behaved offensively. I therefore disagree that the \u201cunique\u201d circumstances in this case warrant shifting the burden to prove harm from the plaintiff to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The majority provides two additional reasons for imposing such a requirement. The first is that it would be unfair to ask the plaintiff to demonstrate how she was harmed when she did not have access to important discovery materials, not identified by the majority, as a result of the court\u2019s decision to mark her motion \u201coff.\u201d As previously discussed, however, the plaintiff had very specific reasons for seeking certain documents and was quite capable of explaining why the lack of that information would prevent her from making a more persuasive case against the defendant. In addition, the court did <em>not </em>rule that the plaintiff could not seek future relief as to the discovery materials described in her motion, such as the documents cited by the majority pertaining to the defendant\u2019s $450,000 promissory note to Theodora Landgren. Indeed, such materials were <em>exactly </em>the type of information to which the court referred when it said that it would be willing to entertain a future hearing on the motion. Moreover, it was the plaintiff who decided not to seek another hearing on the motion following the defendant\u2019s deposition, despite the invitation from the court, and it was the plaintiff who stated at trial that the sanctions she sought, and ultimately obtained, against the defendant constituted a \u201cperfectly appropriate resolution\u201d of the parties continuing discovery dispute. In sum, the majority\u2019s conclusion that our long held standard for proving harm should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>altered <em>in this one particular instance </em>is simply unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The majority also justifies placing the burden to prove a lack of harm on the defendant by explaining that it is consistent with our reasoning in <em>Billington </em>v. <em>Billington, </em>220 Conn. 212, 221, 595 A.2d 1377 (1991). I disagree. The majority states that <em>Billington </em>applies because, in that case, \u201cwe analogized the marital relationship, even in the context of a dissolution case, to the special relationship between fiduciary and beneficiary, insofar as the requirement of disclosure is concerned.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The majority then declares: \u201c[Jjust as, once it has been shown that a fiduciary has engaged in self-dealing, he has the burden to establish the fairness of the transaction by clear and convincing evidence; see <em>Cadle Co. </em>v. <em>D\u2019Addario, </em>268 Conn. 441, 457, 844 A.2d 836 (2004); so, as in the present case, when the defendant has breached his fiduciary-like obligations of discovery to the plaintiff as ordered by the court, he should bear the burden of establishing that his breach of that obligation did not harm the beneficiary of that obligation.\u201d This argument can only be described as specious.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The quoted passage from <em>Billington </em>declares: \u201cWe have recognized ... in the context of an action based upon fraud, that the special relationship between fiduciary and beneficiary compels full disclosure..... <em>Although marital parties are not necessarily in the relationship of fiduciary to beneficiary, we believe that no less disclosure is required </em>of such parties when they come to court seeking to terminate their marriage. \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Billington </em>v. <em>Billington, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 221. The point made in the foregoing passage is that the parties in a dissolution proceeding are in a relationship similar to, although not the same as, that of a fiduciary and beneficiary and, accordingly, they are obligated to make \u201cfull disclosure\u201d of their assets, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>nothing more. For the majority to rely on <em>Billington </em>as support for shifting the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant for noncompliance with discovery requires a leap in logic that finds no support whatsoever in that case. In fact, the majority cites <em>no </em>marital dissolution case in which this court considered a discovery claim and suggested that the burden of proof should be shifted to the noncomplying party to prove a lack of harm. For all of the foregoing reasons, I am compelled to disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court\u2019s decision to mark the plaintiffs motion \u201coff\u2019 the calendar requires reversal of the financial orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The majority next concludes that the rule articulated in <em>Maguire </em>should be expanded to grant the trial court discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees as part of the financial orders when a party has incurred substantial legal expenses because of the other party\u2019s litigation misconduct and \u201cthe other orders of the court have not already adequately addressed that misconduct.\u201d I disagree with this holding because it is inconsistent with the governing statutes, fails to recognize the numerous remedial provisions in our rules of practice that permit an award of attorney\u2019s fees as a sanction for discovery misconduct, and misapplies our well established case law on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The underlying premise of the majority\u2019s holding is that other means may be inadequate to compensate a party for the legal expenses incurred because of the other party\u2019s discovery misconduct, even when the financial orders leave the \u201cinnocent\u201d party with sufficient liquid assets to pay such expenses without disturbing the trial court\u2019s other financial orders. The majority inexplicably fails, however, to examine the rules of practice specifically designed to compensate an \u201cinnocent\u201d party when the other party abuses the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>discovery process. For example, the abusing party may be subject to sanctions, discovery orders compensating the \u201cinnocent\u201d party for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and orders that facts regarding the discovery sought will be taken as established in accordance with the claim of the party seeking discovery. Similarly, parties who conceal or dissipate assets may be subject to financial orders that take the alleged misconduct into account. The majority ignores the fact that the trial court in the present case employed <em>all four techniques </em>to discipline the defendant for his bad behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 13-14 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) If any party has failed to answer interrogatories or to answer them fairly, or has intentionally answered them falsely or in a manner calculated to mislead, or has failed to respond to requests for production ... or has failed to comply with a discovery order made pursuant to Section 13-13, or has failed to comply with the provisions of Section 13-15, or has failed to appear and testify at a deposition duly noticed pursuant to this chapter, or has failed otherwise substantially to comply with any other discovery order made pursuant to Sections 13-6 through 13-11, the judicial authority may, on motion, make such order as the ends of justice require, (b) Such orders may include the following: (1) The entry of a nonsuit or default against the party failing to comply; (2) <em>The award to the discovering party of the costs of the motion, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee-, </em>(3) The entry of an order that the matters regarding which the discovery was sought or other designated facts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the action in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order; (4) The entry of an order prohibiting the party who has failed to comply from introducing designated matters in evidence; (5) If the party failing to comply is the plaintiff, the entry of a judgment of dismissal. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>majority fails to address why this comprehensive array of techniques is insufficient to address adequately noncompliance with discovery orders by a party who has incurred substantial legal expenses as a result of the other party\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u201c[A] court may, either under its inherent power to impose sanctions in order to compel observance of its rules and orders, or under the provisions of \u00a7 13-14, impose sanctions . . . .\u201d <em>Millbrook Owners Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamilton Standard, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 14. In the present case, the court imposed $42,500 in attorney\u2019s fees and sanctions on the defendant for his lack of cooperation during discoveiy, describing them as \u201cthe largest sanctions I have issued in my two and a half years on the bench . . . .\u201d <em>The plaintiff did not appeal from those orders or claim that they were insufficient compensation </em>for the additional time and effort expended by her attorneys to obtain the information she was seeking.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The court also granted the plaintiffs motion in limine, thereby accepting as an established fact for purposes of the action that the defendant improperly had transferred approximately $177,000 out of the marital estate to his girlfriend in Germany. Furthermore, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c) directs the court to \u201cconsider the . . . liabilities and needs of each of the parties\u201d in fixing the nature and value of the property to be assigned. Among the liabilities and needs of the plaintiff were the extraordinary legal expenses she incurred during discovery to unearth marital assets that the defendant had refused to disclose. Although the trial court was not required to make a finding on this issue; see <em>Weiman </em>v. <em>Weiman, </em>188 Conn. 232, 234, 449 A.2d 151 (1982); the record establishes that it considered the defendant\u2019s misconduct as well as the plaintiffs depletion of her inheritance to discover the concealed assets when it fashioned its financial orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>In its memorandum of decision, the court noted that the defendant had used <em>\u201cat least </em>$395,000 in marital assets\u201d for his own benefit and that the plaintiff had \u201cspent enormous sums for attorney\u2019s fees, in large part to trace these assets, with limited success.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The court also stated that, in dividing the parties\u2019 property, it would be \u201cequitable and appropriate\u201d to take into account the defendant\u2019s unauthorized disposition of $382,725 of the marital assets by giving the plaintiff a share of other assets as an offset. Finally, the court acknowledged in its articulation that, in formulating its financial orders, it had considered evidence introduced by the plaintiff at trial that the defendant had engaged in a \u201c \u2018pattern of deceit.\u2019 \u201d Thus, the court considered the evidence introduced by the plaintiff that the defendant allegedly had dissipated or wrongfully concealed marital assets that, from the trial court\u2019s opinion and articulation, amounted to more than $900,000, and were distributed by the court so that the plaintiff received approximately 58.5 percent of the parties\u2019 total financial assets and the defendant received approximately 41.5 percent. Accordingly, there is no need to expand the rule in <em>Maguire </em>because, as the present case amply demonstrates, the court has other methods at its disposal to compensate the \u201cinnocent\u201d party.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In addition, the statutory scheme does not permit an expansion of <em>Maguire </em>in the manner suggested by the majority. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62 governs the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees in a dissolution proceeding and provides in relevant part: \u201c[T]he court may order either spouse ... to pay the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of the other <em>in accordance with their respective financial abilities </em>and the criteria set forth in [General Statutes \u00a7] 46b-82.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The criteria set forth in \u00a7 46b-82 (a) are \u201cthe length of the marriage, the causes for the annulment, dissolution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the marriage or legal separation, the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate and needs of each of the parties and the award, if any, which the court may make pursuant to [\u00a7] 46b-81 . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When a party has sufficient liquid assets to pay his or her own attorney\u2019s fees without undermining the other financial orders, the court has considered that party financially able to pay their own expenses. When a party does <em>not </em>have sufficient liquid assets to pay their own legal expenses without undermining the other financial orders, the court has not hesitated to award attorney\u2019s fees to compensate the \u201cinnocent\u201d party for the other party\u2019s misconduct. See <em>Jewett </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>265 Conn. 669, 694, 830 A.2d 193 (2003) (trial court properly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiff where defendant\u2019s failure to comply with discovery caused plaintiff to incur substantial legal fees and plaintiff was awarded primarily nonliquid assets); <em>Bee </em>v. <em>Bee, </em>79 Conn. App. 783, 791-92, 831 A.2d 833 (trial court properly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiff where defendant dissipated plaintiffs substantial liquid assets and failure to award fees would have undermined orders seeking to achieve equal distribution of marital property), cert. denied, 266 Conn. 932, 837 A.2d 805 (2003). In fact, we have recognized in these circumstances that \u201cthe length of the proceedings and the time expended by counsel\u201d are relevant considerations when determining the amount of such an award; <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>189 Conn. 129, 142-43 n.16, 454 A.2d 1282 (1983); as are \u201cthe nature, complexity and scope of the litigation . . . .\u201d Id., 143. In <em>Jewett </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>Jewett, </em>supra, 694, we specifically recognized that \u201cmuch of the plaintiffs accrued or already paid legal fees have been caused by the defendant\u2019s failure . . . promptly and candidly [to] comply with numerous motions and discovery.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The majority takes the court\u2019s remarks in <em>Jewett </em>out of context, however, and does not explain that the court awarded attorney\u2019s fees because the defendant had converted most of his assets to cash, whereas the plaintiff, having been awarded primarily nonliquid assets, did not have sufficient liquid assets to pay her own attorney\u2019s fees without upsetting the balance achieved by the court\u2019s other financial orders. Id. An award of attorney\u2019s fees, therefore, was consistent with the provision in the statutory scheme that permits a court to order either spouse \u201cto pay the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of the other <em>in accordance with their respective financial abilities . . </em>. .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62. When, on the other hand, the parties have sufficient liquid assets to pay their own attorney\u2019s fees without disturbing the balance created by the other financial orders, each party must be deemed financially capable of paying his or her own legal expenses and an award of attorney\u2019s fees to punish the offending party is unwarranted under the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Indeed, an award of attorney\u2019s fees to an \u201cinnocent\u201d party, as suggested by the majority, would be inconsistent with the original justification for permitting such an award. In <em>Steinmann </em>v. <em>Steinmann, </em>121 Conn. 498, 505, 186 A. 501 (1936), we stated that the purpose of awarding attorney\u2019s fees was to ensure that the wife would \u201cnot be deprived of her rights because she lacks funds which may be supplied from property in which as a wife she has a real interest but which is usually within the control of the husband. <em>If however, she possesses property of her own sufficient to pay the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>expenses of the suit and available for that use, she is not ordinarily entitled to an allowance.'\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) An award of attorney\u2019s fees in these circumstances would border on punishment, and we have declared, unequivocally, that <em>\u201c\\p]unishment of a litigant should play no role in the determination of the issue of awarding attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>211 Conn. 485, 488, 560 A.2d 396 (1989); see also <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>84 Conn. App. 311, 324-25, 853 A.2d 588 (2004) (court abused discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to defendant because award not based on financial abilities of parties and served to punish plaintiff for chronic interference with defendant\u2019s and grandparents\u2019 visitation and for disrespect of trial court\u2019s orders throughout postjudgment proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The majority\u2019s insistence that an award of attorney\u2019s fees to compensate the \u201cinnocent\u201d party for the other party\u2019s discovery misconduct is not punishment and does not amount to a sanction, but merely prevents the \u201cinnocent\u201d party from being \u201cunfairly burdened,\u201d cannot sugarcoat or change the fact that an award of this nature is punitive in effect. The plaintiff herself described it as such at the hearing on her motion in limine, when she explained to the court: \u201cI am going to ask the court for two sanctions, and one of them is going to come as part of our proposed orders. And that\u2019s that the defendant pay dollar for dollar [the plaintiffs] fees because had he not acted in as obstreperous a fashion as he had, this case would have been over and this case would have been done for far less attorney time, effort, and waste of [the plaintiffs] money.\u201d The majority\u2019s attempt to portray an award of attorney\u2019s fees for discovery misconduct by the other party as less than punitive is simply disingenuous.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>In sum, I believe that there is no need to expand the rule articulated in <em>Maguire </em>because the rules of practice provide the court with many other tools to compensate the \u201cinnocent\u201d party for the financial burden incurred as a result of the other party\u2019s misconduct. I agree with the majority that the conduct of the defendant in the present case was abhorrent and that his abusive behavior required the court to take appropriate action. I part company with the maj ority, however, when they suggest that our existing rules are inadequate and that the court failed or refused to employ them when it had the opportunity and obligation to do so. I would argue, to the contrary, that any suggestion that the court did <em>not </em>sanction the defendant for his discovery misconduct during the proceedings or account for his misconduct when fashioning its financial orders finds no support in the record. I would thus conclude that the trial court is not permitted by statute to make an award of attorney\u2019s fees in its financial orders to punish a noncomplying party, that existing remedies are adequate to address significant discovery abuse and that parties subject to such abuse have a responsibility to exercise their right to obtain relief pursuant to those remedies, as the plaintiff did when she sought and received both monetary and nonmonetary sanctions against the defendant and obtained financial orders that took his discovery misconduct into account. For all of these reasons, I disagree with the majority that the rule in <em>Maguire </em>should be expanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\"> I disagree with the majority that the issue in this case is not whether the trial court abused its discretion, but \u201cwhether a trial court has the discretion to refuse to consider a party\u2019s motion for contempt.\u201d In <em>Ahneman </em>v. <em>Ahneman, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 484-85, we declared that the trial court is duty bound to consider all matters brought before it <em>except </em>in \u201cextreme, compelling situation[s],\u201d or \u201cother circumstances . . . .\u201d Consequently, a trial court must exercise its discretion in determining whether the circumstances in any given case fall within one of the identified exceptions. See id. (court has <em>\u201cdiscretion </em>to refuse to entertain or decide motions in order to prevent harassing or vexatious litigation ... [or in] other circumstances\u201d [citations omitted; emphasis added]). In reformulating the issue in the manner described, the majority avoids direct consideration of the question raised by the plaintiff on appeal, namely, whether the trial court abused its discretion when it marked the motion \u201coff,\u201d and fails to apply the proper legal principles in its subsequent analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\"> Although the court stated that it would be open to hearing further argument only with respect to \u201cspecific and vital\u201d information that the defendant failed to produce at his deposition, the court in fact granted the plaintiff discretion to request a hearing as to any or all of the discovery materials she sought in her motion, as long as she deemed them \u201cvital\u201d to her case. The ruling thus did not limit the plaintiffs ability to seek further discovery with respect to any of the materials identified in her motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b389-5\"> The court denied the plaintiffs first request for sanctions as unnecessary because the defendant did not intend to contradict the damaging testimony. Consequently, the court stated that it would accept the evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s transfer of assets out of the marital estate as an <em>\u201cuncontroverted\" </em>fact. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b390-5\"><em> </em>Practice Book \u00a7 11-19 provides: \u201c(a) Any judge of the superior court and any judge trial referee to whom a short calendar matter has been submitted for decision, with or without oral argument, shall issue a decision on such matter not later than 120 days from the date of such submission, unless such time limit is waived by the parties. In the event that the judge or referee conducts a hearing on the matter and/or the parties file briefs concerning it, the date of submission for purposes of this section shall be the date the matter is heard or the date the last brief ordered by the court is filed, whichever occurs later. If a decision is not rendered within this period the matter may be claimed in accordance with subsection (b) for assignment to another judge or referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u201c(b) A party seeking to invoke the provisions of this section shall not later than fourteen days after the expiration of the 120 day period file with the clerk a motion for reassignment of the undecided short calendar matter which shall set forth the date of submission of the short calendar matter, the name of the judge or referee to whom it was submitted, that a timely decision on the matter has not been rendered, and whether or not oral argument is requested or testimony is required. The failure of a party to file a timely motion for reassignment shall be deemed a waiver by that party of the 120 day time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b393-6\"> This contrasts with the plaintiffs subsequent motion in limine, which she filed in response to the court\u2019s prior declaration that it would consider all remaining \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201cvital\u201d discovery issues following the defendant\u2019s deposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b400-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn fixing the nature and value of the property, if any, to be assigned, the court . . . shall consider the length of the marriage, the causes for the annulment, dissolution of the marriage or legal separation, the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b402-6\"> Because I view such an award as punitive, I also note that it makes no sense to award attorney\u2019s fees in the manner suggested if one of the purposes is to deter future misconduct, because the consequences suffered by the offending party, if any, are not imposed until long after the egregious behavior has occurred. Also militating against an award of attorney\u2019s fees at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>end of the trial to sanction the offending party is that the presiding judge may not have been present when the misconduct occurred, and thus would have no firsthand knowledge of its effect upon the proceedings. Consequently, the court might reject a legitimate request for attorney\u2019s fees or reduce the size of such an award to the \u201cinnocent\u201d party. Finally, simple logic suggests that sanctions like those provided in \u00a7 13-14 of our rules of practice, because they are imposed close in time to the alleged misconduct, are far more likely to have a deterrent effect upon the transgressor and promote appropriate conduct by the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
