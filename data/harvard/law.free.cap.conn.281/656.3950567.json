Pasquariello,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals from the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board (board) reversing the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the seventh district (commissioner), who had concluded that the named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>defendant, Stop and Shop Companies, Inc.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> could not reduce the plaintiffs total disability benefits by the amount of his social security old age insurance benefits (social security benefits), as provided under General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 31-307 (e).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff contends that, contrary to the board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 31-307 (e), the legislature did not intend for the social security offset to apply to workers who had returned to the workforce after retiring and drawing social security benefits, and that to interpret the statute otherwise would violate the plaintiffs right to equal protection under the federal and state constitutions. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. On June 13, 1994, the plaintiff commenced part-time employment with the defendant. Prior to commencing this employment, the plaintiff had begun to receive social security benefits, and he continued to receive these benefits while working for the defendant. On April 26, 1997, the plaintiff sustained a work-related compensable injury to his right knee and back that caused him to be totally disabled. At that time, he was seventy-three years old. The defendant paid for the plaintiffs medical treatment, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 31-294d, but did not pay the plaintiff any total incapacity benefits. The defendant contended that no such benefits were owed to the plaintiff because it was entitled, under \u00a7 31-307 (e), to reduce the plaintiffs total disability benefits by the amount of the plaintiffs social security benefits, which apparently were equivalent to, or in excess of, the plaintiffs disability benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The plaintiff filed a claim for total disability benefits, and the commissioner issued an award in favor of the plaintiff, concluding that the legislature did not intend for the social security offset to apply to persons who already had begun to receive social security benefits prior to their employment. The defendant then appealed from the commissioner\u2019s decision to the board, and the board reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision. It concluded that the text of \u00a7 31-307 (e) reflected no basis for distinguishing application of the offset depending on whether the receipt of social security benefits predated the employment. The board noted the plaintiffs contention that \u00a7 31-307 (e) would be unconstitutional if construed to permit the offset to apply under these facts, but recognized that, as an administrative agency, it lacked jurisdiction to reach the constitutional question.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the board sustained the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>appeal and reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The plaintiff first claims that the board interpreted \u00a7 31-307 (e) in a manner that is inconsistent with the purpose of the statute and irrational. The plaintiff asserts that the board\u2019s construction is inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s intent to reduce disability benefits for persons who have retired from the workforce because, in his case, he had returned to the workforce after retiring and receiving social security benefits. Accordingly, he contends that the legislature intended for the offset to apply only to those persons who received social security benefits after they had commenced their employment and had become totally disabled. The plaintiff further claims that the legislature intended to prevent \u201cdouble-dipping,\u201d specifically, the payment of two benefits that both are intended as wage replacements \u2014 social security benefits and disability benefits. He contends that, because he already had been drawing social security benefits before his employment with the defendant, once he commenced that employment, he had two sources of income and therefore would not be double-dipping by drawing both benefits. The plaintiff also claims that interpreting the offset to apply in the present case would violate the equal protection clause under the state and federal constitutions. We reject both the plaintiffs statutory and constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Before turning to the plaintiffs claims, we briefly summarize our decision in <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>263 Conn. 328, 819 A.2d 803 (2003), wherein this court inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>preted the provision at issue in the present case, and which bears on both of the plaintiffs claims. In <em>Rayhall, </em>the plaintiff suffered a work-related injury for which he initially had received partial incapacity benefits,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, pursuant to an agreement with his employer, elected to file early, at age sixty-two, for social security benefits. Id., 333. The plaintiffs condition thereafter deteriorated, he began to receive total incapacity benefits and his employer claimed that it was entitled to apply the social security offset against those incapacity benefits. Id., 333-35. On appeal to this court, the plaintiff claimed that \u00a7 31-307 (e) violated equal protection because the social security offset applied against total incapacity benefits, but not against partial incapacity benefits. Id., 341. We concluded that the statute should be examined under rational basis review; id., 345; and that it did not violate equal protection under that standard because, although there was no specific evidence of a legislative intent with respect to the offset, we could conceive of a rational basis for applying the offset only to total incapacity benefits. Id., 346-52. We first noted that \u00a7 31-307 (e) was enacted as part of a comprehensive scheme to reform the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act; see Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228, \u00a7 16; with the principal goal of cutting employers\u2019 costs in maintaining the workers\u2019 compensation system. <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>supra, 346. We concluded that it was rational for the legislature to apply the offset only to total incapacity benefits because those benefits were of unlimited duration, whereas partial incapacity benefits were available for a limited duration. Id., 350-51. We further concluded that, although incapacity benefits are intended to compensate workers for wage loss resulting from their injuries; id., 349; the legislature rationally could decide to reduce wage replacement benefits for workers who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>have retired from the workforce. Id., 351. We then reasoned that, \u201c[bjecause total disability benefits are of potentially unlimited duration, the legislature rationally could have determined that receipt of old age social security benefits establishes a presumption of retirement. With respect to partial incapacity, by contrast, the presumption of retirement is rebutted by the worker\u2019s actual employment . . . .\u201d Id., 351-52. Nonetheless, \u201c[w]e recognize[d] that the offset does not provide a precise fit so that it applies only to those workers who, irrespective of their injury, would have retired upon eligibility for social security retirement benefits. Under rational basis review of a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute, however, we need not find such a precise fit. . . . [A] statute must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 352. With this background in mind, we turn to the plaintiffs claims in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">\u201cEstablished wisdom counsels us to exercise self-restraint so as to eschew unnecessary determinations of constitutional questions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemon, </em>248 Conn. 652, 663 n.15, 731 A.2d 271 (1999). Accordingly, we first consider the statutory question, that is, whether the legislature intended for the social security offset in \u00a7 31-307 (e) to apply to all persons entitled to receive social security benefits concurrently with total incapacity benefits irrespective of when they became entitled to the social security benefits, as the board concluded, or whether the legislature intended for the offset to apply only to those persons who became entitled to social security benefits <em>after </em>they had commenced their employment and then became totally disabled, as the plaintiff contends. As this appeal involves our review of an administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>agency\u2019s decision construing a statute, we begin with certain well established principles that guide our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">\u201cWe have recognized that [a]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts. . . . Cases that present pure questions of law, however, invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . We have determined, therefore, that the traditional deference accorded to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statutory term is unwarranted when the construction of a statute . . . has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny [or to] ... a governmental agency\u2019s time-tested interpretation . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sikand </em>v. <em>Wilson-Coker, </em>276 Conn. 618, 626, 888 A.2d 74 (2006). Although this court previously examined \u00a7 31-307 (e) in <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>supra, 263 Conn. 328, we did not consider the legal issue presently before us, and the board does not contend that it has applied a time-tested interpretation. Accordingly, we do not defer to the board\u2019s construction and exercise plenary review in accordance with our well established rules of statutory construction. <em>Sikand </em>v. <em>Wilson-Coker, </em>supra, 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>279 Conn. 207, 212, 901 A.2d 673 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">We begin with the text of \u00a7 31-307 (e), which provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any provision of the general statutes to the contrary, compensation paid to an employee for an employee\u2019s total incapacity shall be reduced while the employee is entitled to receive old age insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>benefits pursuant to the federal Social Security Act. The amount of each reduced workers\u2019 compensation payment shall equal the excess, if any, of the workers\u2019 compensation payment over the old age insurance benefits.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 31-307 (e). The dispositive phrase appears to be <em>\u201cwhile </em>the employee is entitled to receive [social security] benefits . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 31-307 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">In the absence of any statutory definition, we construe the term \u201cwhile\u201d in accordance with \u201cthe commonly approved usage of the language . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). \u201cWhile\u201d is defined to mean \u201cduring the time that . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. Thus, the statute prescribes that social security benefits shall be deducted from total disability payments during the time that the employee is entitled to receive social security benefits. This phrase is broad and without limitation. Accordingly, the offset appears to apply whenever an employee concurrently is entitled to total disability and social security benefits. Had it intended otherwise, the legislature could have provided a specific exception to the offset for workers who became entitled to social security benefits before they became eligible for total incapacity benefits. At the very least, the legislature could have used language suggesting that the offset would apply only to social security entitlements accruing after employment had commenced, such as \u201cupon the employee becoming entitled to,\u201d or \u201conce the employee becomes entitled to,\u201d social security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">To construe the statute to apply whenever the two benefits exist concurrently does not appear on its face to be irrational or to yield absurd results. This construction treats employees similarly situated in the same manner \u2014 all employees who are entitled to social security benefits while they are receiving total disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>benefits will have their disability benefits reduced in an amount proportionate to the social security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">We recognize, however, that, despite its equal <em>application, </em>the offset may have a different <em>effect </em>on some workers. Workers like the plaintiff, who received social security benefits before becoming totally disabled, necessarily will receive a lesser percentage of their predisability income after they become disabled than workers who become disabled and thereafter are entitled to receive social security benefits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Workers similarly situated to the plaintiff also would receive less workers\u2019 compensation benefits than a similarly disabled worker who was not yet eligible for social security and subject to the concomitant offset. Although the offset does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>affect payment of medical expenses; see General Statutes \u00a7 31-294d; or specific indemnity awards;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> see General Statutes \u00a7 31-308 (b) and (d); it reduces or, as in the present case, may eliminate altogether total incapacity (wage replacement) benefits. Thus, we recognize that uniform application of the offset may create unfair results for some persons, specifically those older workers who, after becoming entitled to social security benefits, return to work because those benefits alone are not enough to sustain them.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">We note, however, that, although some unfairness may result from applying the offset to workers like the plaintiff, his construction of the statute would result in a far greater inequity to other workers. Under the plaintiffs construction, workers like himself would be entitled to draw <em>full </em>income from both social security and disability benefits, whereas other workers who first became disabled and then later became eligible for social security would have their disability benefits reduced by the amount of their social security. Because total disability benefits are of an unlimited duration; see General Statutes \u00a7 31-307 (a); and the offset applies for this same unlimited period, this imbalance would continue ad infinitum.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Nonetheless, the plaintiff underscores the fact that, in <em>Rayhall, </em>we concluded that the offset rationally was limited to the totally disabled because the legislature reasonably could have presumed that the receipt of social security benefits established a presumption of retirement and, therefore, absence of need for the replacement of wages afforded by the total incapacity benefits, a presumption that does not hold true in his case. We implicitly rejected this contention, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>in <em>Rayhall. </em>As we noted previously in this opinion, we determined that \u00a7 31-307 (e) was rational despite the fact that \u201cthe offset does not provide a precise fit so that it applies only to those workers who, irrespective of their injury, would have retired upon eligibility for social security retirement benefits. . . . [S]o long as the line drawn by the [s]tate is rationally supportable, the courts will not interpose their judgment as to the appropriate stopping point. . . . We cannot say that the line drawn in the present case is not rationally supportable.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>supra, 263 Conn. 352-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We are mindful that it is not an uncommon problem, unfortunately, for older persons to need to supplement their social security benefits to maintain a reasonable standard of living. \u201c[I]t is neither unusual nor extraordinary for elderly persons to be financially vulnerable. The Social Security Administration reports that Social Security benefits, which are paid to [nine] out of every [ten] Americans [sixty-five] and older, represent the major source of income for the elderly. Over [one half] of those married and almost [three fourths] of unmarried retired persons receive 50 [percent] or more of their income from Social Security with the average monthly benefit at approximately $l,000.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rajwani, </em>United States Court of Appeals, Docket No. 05-10648 (5th Cir. January 16, 2007), citing Social Security Administration, Press Office, Fact Sheet (July 20, 2006), available at http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/factsheets/ basicfact-altpdf.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Indeed, the legislative history of No. 06-84, \u00a7 1, of the 2006 Public Acts, prospectively repealing the offset <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>provision; see footnote 3 of this opinion; reveals that the legislature repealed \u00a7 31-307 (e) because it recognized the limited financial resources available to older workers and the inequities affecting <em>all </em>older workers as a result of application of the offset. See 49 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 2006 Sess., pp. 2617-22; 49 H.R. Proc., Pt. 16, 2006 Sess., pp. 5137-41, remarks by Representative Kevin Ryan; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Public Employees, Pt. 1, 2006 Sess., pp. 275-77, written statement by Howard B. Schiller of the Connecticut Trial Lawyers Association, Workers\u2019 Compensation Section. Nothing in this legislative history, however, suggests that the legislature believed that the offset had not applied to retired seniors returning to work; see <em>Celentano </em>v. <em>Oaks Condominium Assn., </em>265 Conn. 579, 597, 830 A.2d 164 (2003) (subsequent legislative action may throw light on legislative intent of earlier related act); <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 541, 494 A.2d 555 (1985) (same); indeed, there is evidence to the contrary. See 49 S. Proc., supra, p. 2622, remarks of Senator Andrew W. Roraback; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, p. 249, written statement by Lori Pelletier of the Connecticut AFL-CIO. Accordingly, there is no evidence, textual or extra-textual, that suggests that the legislature intended to exclude from application of the social security offset in \u00a7 31-307 (e) those older workers who become eligible for social security, retire and then return to the workforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">As we previously have noted on many occasions, \u201cthe primary responsibility for formulating public policy resides in the legislature\u201d; <em>Thibodeau </em>v. <em>Design Group One Architects, LLC, </em>260 Conn. 691, 715, 802 A.2d 731 (2002); and, within constitutional limits, we are constrained to recognize the balance that the legislature has struck in the workers\u2019 compensation scheme between the competing needs of employees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>employers. See id.; <em>Common Fund </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>228 Conn. 375, 380, 636 A.2d 795 (1994). Thus, given the prospective application of the repeal of \u00a7 31-307 (e), we are constrained to apply the statute in the present case as the legislature intended unless it has run afoul of constitutional restraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">We therefore turn to the plaintiffs claim that construing the offset in \u00a7 31-307 (e) to apply to persons who have returned to the workforce after retiring and drawing social security benefits would violate his constitutional right to equal protection. The plaintiff first contends that this provision discriminates amongst the totally disabled, a protected class under the Connecticut constitution,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and, therefore, the statute must be reviewed, and cannot survive, under strict scrutiny. The plaintiff next contends that, even if the statute is not subject to strict scrutiny, it fails rational basis review and therefore would be unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of both the state and federal constitutions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We conclude that \u00a7 31-307 (e) does not violate equal protection by applying the offset to per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>sons who retire, receive social security and then return to the workforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">\u201cIn order to analyze the plaintiffs claim, we first must determine the standard by which the statute\u2019s constitutional validity will be determined \u2014 in other words, the level of scrutiny required. . . . This court has held, in accordance with the federal constitutional framework of analysis, that in areas of social and economic policy that neither proceed along suspect lines nor infringe fundamental constitutional rights, the [ejqual [protection [cjlause is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification, see <em>United States Railroad Retirement [Board] </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>449 U.S. 166, 174, 179 [101 S. Ct. 453, 66 L. Ed. 2d 368] (1980), the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the governmental decisionmaker, see <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </em>449 U.S. 456, 464 [101 S. Ct. 715, 66 L. Ed. 2d 659] (1981), and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational, see <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em>473 U.S. [432, 446, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985)]. ... If, however, state action invidiously discriminates against a suspect class or affects a fundamental right, the action passes constitutional muster . . . only if it survives strict scrutiny. <em>Daly </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>225 Conn. 499, 513, 624 A.2d 876 (1993). Under that heightened standard, the state must demonstrate that the challenged statute is necessary to the achievement of a compelling state interest.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>supra, 263 Conn. 342-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Turning to the plaintiffs claim, we recognized in <em>Ray-hall </em>that, although the federal constitution does not recognize disability as a suspect class, the Connecticut constitution has designated disability as a suspect class. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Id., 343; see footnote 12 of this opinion. We also recognized that equal protection challenges are predicated on invidious discrimination, not just simply different treatment. <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>supra, 263 Conn. 343-45. \u201c[W]henthe state discriminates against the disabled, or a class of the disabled, in favor of the able-bodied, invidious discrimination is presumed and strict scrutiny is applied. <em>Daly </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 513-14. On the other hand, when the state discriminates amongst members of the protected class, invidious discrimination cannot necessarily be presumed.\u201d <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>supra, 344. Given the nature and purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, we concluded that, even though the offset discriminated amongst the disabled because it applied to one subset of the disabled, the totally disabled, but not to another subset, the partially disabled, there was no invidious discrimination. Id., 344-45. Accordingly, we applied rational basis review to the statute and concluded that it was constitutional. Id., 345-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">By contrast to the claim in <em>Rayhall, </em>it is clear that \u00a7 31-307 (e) does not discriminate amongst the totally disabled, as the plaintiff claims. The offset applies to all persons who are totally disabled and concurrently eligible for social security. That difference is not one based on disability; it is one based on age. Entitlement to social security commences at age sixty-two or older. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402 (a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, the only reason the offset disparately impacts the plaintiff in certain ways <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>is because he is older than other workers who were not yet entitled to social security when they became disabled.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Disparate impact, however, is only a starting point in analyzing an equal protection claim. <em>Collier </em>v. <em>Barnhart, </em>473 F.3d 444, 448 (2d Cir. 2007); <em>Kilcullen </em>v. <em>New York Dept. of Transportation, </em>33 F. Sup. 2d 133, 140 (N.D.N.Y. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Age is not a suspect class under either the state or federal constitution. See <em>Massachusetts Board of Retirement </em>v. <em>Murgia, </em>427 U.S. 307, 313-14, 96 S. Ct. 2562, 49 L. Ed. 2d 520 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>McDougal, </em>241 Conn. 502, 517, 699 A.2d 872 (1997). Accordingly, rational basis review applies to claims of discrimination on the basis of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">\u201cIn order for a statute to withstand rational basis review, we consider whether the classification and disparate treatment inherent in a statute bear a rational relationship to a legitimate state end and are based on reasons related to the accomplishment of that goal. <em>Zapata </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>207 Conn. 496, 507, 542 A.2d 700 (1988); <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>200 Conn. 562, 577, 512 A.2d 893 (1986). . . . [U]nder this analysis, the legislature is not required to articulate the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>pose or rationale for its classification. The test ... is whether this court can conceive of a rational basis for sustaining the legislation; we need not have evidence that the legislature actually acted upon that basis.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>supra, 263 Conn. 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The reasons we set forth in <em>Rayhall </em>for our conclusion that \u00a7 31-307 (e) is rationally related to a legitimate purpose similarly apply in the present case. Indeed, the plaintiff in the present case is similarly situated in significant respects to the plaintiff in <em>Rayhall, </em>who also began to receive social security benefits before he became entitled to total disability benefits. In <em>Rayhall, </em>we reasoned that \u00a7 31-307 (e) was enacted as a part of a comprehensive reform to cut the costs of maintaining the workers\u2019 compensation scheme. Id., 346. \u201c[Reducing costs to employers and insurers on the amount of benefits payable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is a legitimate goal. <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Ducci Electrical Contractors, Inc., </em>[248 Conn. 793, 818, 730 A.2d 1149 (1999)].\u201d <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>supra, 263 Conn. 348. A rational way to achieve that goal is to target the one benefit under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act that is of unlimited duration. Id., 351. In some cases, the offset will reduce the amount of incapacity benefits, in others it will negate entirely the benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">As we have noted previously, however, the legislature rationally could have presumed that the receipt of social security benefits gives rise to the presumption of retirement and, hence, a lesser need for the replacement of wages under the workers\u2019 compensation scheme. Id., 351-52. Although this presumption of retirement was not true in the plaintiffs case when the offset <em>first </em>was applied, it likely will come to fruition at some point thereafter because it is unlikely that the plaintiff would have continued to work ad infinitum had he not become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>disabled. In other words, although a given worker may not have planned to retire at the precise point in time when his social security eligibility and disability coincide, at some point thereafter, that worker likely would retire. Although it is unfortunate that application of the offset cannot coincide with the point in time when each worker subjectively intended to retire, we cannot envision a practical method whereby the legislature could have achieved that outcome in every case. Nor is the legislature required to prescribe the most effective method to achieve its intended purpose, in the absence of legislation that implicates a suspect class or fundamental rights. See <em>Daly </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 516 (state action affecting suspect class implicates strict scrutiny and requires proof that state action is \u201csufficiently narrowly tailored to serve the state\u2019s interest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Finally, we reiterate our conclusion in part I of this opinion that a less rational and more unequal result would occur were we to adopt the plaintiffs construction of \u00a7 31-307 (e). The disparate impact of the statute would be far greater on older workers were we to exclude from the offset only those workers who retire from, and then return to, the workforce. Indeed, when viewed from the vantage point of the workers against whom the offset still would apply, the plaintiff is not seeking equal treatment, he is seeking special treatment predicated solely on the fact that his eligibility for social security predated his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">In conclusion, \u201c[t]he equal protection clause does not require absolute equality or precisely equal advantages .... Rather, a state may make classifications when enacting or carrying out legislation, but in order to satisfy the equal protection clause the classifications made must be based on some reasonable ground.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Matos, </em>240 Conn. 743, 760, 694 A.2d 775 (1997); see also <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 90 S. Ct. 1153, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>25 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1970) (\u201c[i]f the classification has some reasonable basis, it does not offend the [constitution simply because the classification is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). The legislature has established a reasonable ground for applying the offset to all persons concurrently receiving social security benefits and total incapacity benefits. Although we may question the fairness of the result in the present case given the overall intent of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u201cequal protection is not a license for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choices.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Federal Communications Commission </em>v. <em>Beach Communications, Inc., </em>508 U.S. 307, 313, 113 S.

We decline to reach this claim for two related reasons. First, we conclude that the specific facts of this case raise a question as to whether the legislature intended for the offset to apply under such facts, and therefore \u00a7 l-2z authorizes us to consider extratextual sources. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>George J., </em>280 Conn. 551, 566, 910 A.2d 931 (2006) (considering legislative history and genealogy of statutory limitations period for sexual offenses against minors to determine whether legislature intended broader meaning of \u201cvictim\u201d to apply under facts of case to include victim\u2019s legal representative); <em>Colangelo </em>v. <em>Heckelman, </em>279 Conn. 177, 184 and nn. 9 and 10, 900 A.2d 1266 (2006) (considering legislative history to determine whether legislature intended to impose special hazard of employment exception, not expressly provided, in exclusion of certain torts from exclusivity provision of Workers\u2019 Compensation Act). Second, given this conclusion, we would be rendering an advisory opinion as to whether \u00a7 l-2z violates the separation of powers doctrine. \u201c[W]e have consistently held that we do not render advisory opinions. . . . [WJhere the question presented is purely academic, we must refuse to entertain the appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Echavarria </em>v. <em>National Grange Mutual Ins. Co., </em>275 Conn. 408, 419, 880 A.2d 882 (2005). Accordingly, we decline to address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b690-6\"> The following hypothetical illustrates this point. A and B are employed at the same job, paying $1000 per month. A, however, is five years older than B and had been receiving $800 per month in social security before starting his employment. Therefore, predisability, A has $1800 in income, and B has $1000 in income. A and B then become totally disabled as the result of work-related injuries, which entitles them to $750 per month in total incapacity benefits in lieu of wages. Thereafter, B also becomes eligible for social security benefits, the same $800 benefit per month that A had been receiving. Both workers would receive, after application of the offset, $800, all from social security (the $750 disability benefit would be reduced to zero because the $800 social security benefit exceeds the disability benefit, leaving only the $800 in social security benefit). Therefore, in terms of pure dollars at a given point in time, the two workers are affected similarly by the offset. The $800 in social security benefits, however, represents 44 percent of A\u2019s predisability income of $1800, but 80 percent of B\u2019s predisability income of $1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Although the exact percentage of A\u2019s predisability income will vary if the income variables are changed, it appears that A always ends up with a significantly lesser percent of predisability income than B. Thus, for example, assume that A and B have the same predisability income of $2000, but A\u2019s income is comprised in equal parts of social security and wages. Upon becoming disabled, each worker is entitled to receive 75 percent of his wages as disability benefits. B then becomes eligible for $1000 in social security benefits, at which point the offset applies to both workers. A would receive $1000 (all from social security), and B would receive $1500 ($500 in disability benefits after application of the offset and $1000 in social security). A\u2019s benefits represent 50 percent of his predisability income, and B\u2019s benefits represent 75 percent of his predisability income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b691-7\"> \u201c[S]pecific indemnity awards . . . compensate the injured employee for the lifetime handicap that results from the permanent loss of, or loss of use of, a scheduled body part.\u201d <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim </em>Co., supra, 263 Conn. 349.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b692-7\"> Congress recognized these realities when it enacted the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act of 2000, which eliminated an earnings offset that had reduced social security benefits for seniors who worked while receiving these benefits.
