On appeal, the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that, based on the facts of this case, \u201cthe driver was not operating the vehicle in an erratic or dangerous manner or otherwise engaged in or about to engage in criminal activity and because there was no report of recent crime in the area, the officer lacked a particularized and objective factual basis to warrant an investigatory stop.
