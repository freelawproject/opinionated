Tarro, Richard M. Tarro and Elegant Living, LLC, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>of commercial premises located in Wethersfield. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had failed to pay the rent pursuant to a written sublease and rental security agreement commencing January 1, 2004. The defendants appealed, arguing, in part, that \u201cthe trial court improperly decided that . . . the landlord, an unregistered foreign corporation, was entitled to pursue its lawsuit in this state because it was not \u2018transacting business\u2019 within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 33-920 (a) . . .\"<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Wagner &amp; Wagner Auto Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tarro, </em>93 Conn.
