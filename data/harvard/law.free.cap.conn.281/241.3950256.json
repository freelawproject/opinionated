The sole issue presented on appeal to this court is whether an inmate has a cognizable liberty interest in his parole eligibility status sufficient to invoke the subject matter jurisdiction of the habeas court. We conclude that our statutory scheme affords no cognizable liberty interest in parole eligibility status. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. The petitioner was convicted of criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-217, as amended by Public Acts 1999, No. 99-212, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> carrying a pistol or revolver without a permit in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 29-35 (a), as amended by Public Acts 1999, No. 99-212, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> sale of narcotics in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-277 (a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and forgery in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-139 (a) (3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The offenses were committed on February 19, 2000, and he was sentenced, on July 13, 2001, to a total effective sentence of fifteen years, execution suspended after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>seven years, and three years of probation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thereafter, the petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging that the respondents improperly had classified him as a violent offender under General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 54-125a (b) (2) and (c), as amended by Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 2001, No. 01-9, \u00a7 74,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>thusrender-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>ing him ineligible for parole until he had served 85 percent of his sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> According to his petition, the board should have classified the petitioner as a nonviolent offender under \u00a7 54-125a (a), which he claims would have required the board to consider his eligibility for parole after he had served 50 percent of his sentence. See footnote 7 of this opinion. In addition, the petitioner claimed that the respondents had violated the ex post facto clause of the federal constitution by classifying him as a violent offender based on robbery convictions from 1991 and 1995, as those convictions predated the enactment of subsection (2) of \u00a7 54-125a (b), prescribing the 85 percent parole eligibility restriction for persons convicted of offenses involving the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force, and subsection (c), requiring the board to enact regulations regarding the classification and release of these violent offenders. See Public Acts 1995, No. 95-255, \u00a7 1 (prescribing effective dates of July 1, 1996, for what is now \u00a7 54-125a [b] [2], and July 1, 1995, for what is now \u00a7 54-125a [c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The respondents claimed that the petitioner accurately had been classified as a violent offender and that the board properly had exercised its statutory discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>lion in so classifying him. The respondents further claimed that the habeas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the petition because the petitioner\u2019s parole eligibility, his demand for a parole hearing and his interest in parole consideration did not implicate a recognized liberty interest sufficient to invoke habeas jurisdiction under the laws of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The habeas court, Fuger, <em>J., </em>agreed with the respondents that it lacked jurisdiction over the habeas petition because, unlike the liberty interest at stake when a petitioner alleges that his detention is illegal, the petitioner in the present case did not have a cognizable liberty interest in his parole eligibility status. Despite its determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, the habeas court discussed the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claims. Although the court recognized that narcotics violations generally are nonviolent offenses, it noted that, in classifying the petitioner under \u00a7 54-125a, the board was not limited to considering only the offenses underlying the sentence the petitioner currently was serving. The court noted that, under \u00a7 54-125a, the board could consider any information it deemed relevant in making this assessment. The habeas court also rejected the claimed ex post facto violation in the application of \u00a7 54-125a (b) (2) on the ground that the offense for which the petitioner had been classified as a violent offender and the attendant imposition of his sentence occurred after the enactment of that provision. Accordingly, the habeas court dismissed the habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Thereafter, the petitioner filed a petition for certification to appeal to the Appellate Court, which the habeas court granted, raising the jurisdiction and ex post facto issues. The Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court, holding that \u201calthough an inmate has no right to parole release, he has a liberty interest in parole eligible status.\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>91 Conn. App. 855, 862, 882 A.2d 1238 (2005). The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>concluded that prior case law implicitly had recognized such a liberty interest. Id., 862-63, citing <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>258 Conn. 804, 818-19, 786 A.2d 1091 (2002). The court reasoned that this conclusion was supported by the statutory scheme because, \u201c[r]ead together, subsections (a) and (b) [of \u00a7 54-125a] clearly vest a liberty interest in parole eligible status to all persons described in subsection (a), subject to the exclusion for the enumerated offenses and the 85 percent limitation embodied in subsection (b).\u201d <em>Baker v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 863-64. In light of the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the habeas court improperly had dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, the court did not reach the petitioner\u2019s ex post facto claim. The Appellate Court thus remanded the case for further proceedings. The certified appeal to this court followed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">We conclude that, contrary to the Appellate Court\u2019s reading of the statutory scheme and case law regarding this issue, the petitioner does not have a cognizable liberty interest in parole eligibility status. Thus, the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the habeas court had jurisdiction to entertain the petitioner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Initially, we set forth the appropriate standard of review. \u201cWe have long held that because [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary. . . . Subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. . . . [A] court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction .... [Wjhere the court rendering the judgment lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter the judgment itself is void. . . . Indeed, [i]t is axiomatic that once the issue of subject matter jurisdiction is raised, it must be immediately acted upon by the court.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ajadi </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>280 Conn. 514, 532-33, 911 A.2d 712 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The Supreme Court of the United States has held that, \u201c[i]t is clear . . . that the essence of habeas corpus is an attack by a person in custody upon the legality of that custody, and that the traditional function of the writ is to secure release from illegal custody.\u201d <em>Preiser </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 484, 93 S. Ct. 1827, 36 L. Ed. 2d 439 (1973), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Heck </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 481-82, 114 S. Ct. 2364, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1994). \u201cThe original view of a habeas corpus attack upon detention under a judicial order was a limited one. The relevant inquiry was confined to determining simply whether or not the committing court had been possessed of jurisdiction. . . . But, over the years, the writ of habeas corpus evolved as a remedy available to effect discharge from any confinement contrary to the [constitution or fundamental law, even though imposed pursuant to conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction. . . . Thus, whether the petitioner\u2019s challenge to his custody is that the statute under which he stands convicted is unconstitutional . . . that he has been imprisoned prior to trial on account of a defective indictment against him . . . that he is unlawfully confined in the wrong institution . . . that he was denied his constitutional rights at trial . . . that he is being unlawfully detained by the [executive or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the military ... or that his parole was unlawfully revoked, causing him to be reincarcerated in prison ... in each case his grievance is that he is being unlawfully subjected to physical restraint, and in each case habeas corpus has been accepted as the specific instrument to obtain release from such confinement.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Preiser </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 485-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The <em>Preiser </em>court went on to explain the expansion of the utilization of habeas corpus to challenge illegal confinement, even when the remedy would not be immediate release. \u201c[R]ecent cases have established that habeas corpus relief is not limited to immediate release from illegal custody, but that the writ is available as well to attack future confinement and obtain future releases. In <em>Peyton </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>391 U.S. 54 [66-67, 88 S. Ct. 1549, 20 L. Ed. 2d 426] (1968), the [c]ourt held that a prisoner may attack on habeas the second of two consecutive sentences while still serving the first. The [c]ourt pointed out that the federal habeas corpus statute does not deny the federal courts power to fashion appropriate relief other than immediate release. Since 1874, the habeas corpus statute has directed the courts to determine the facts and dispose of the case summarily, as law and justice require.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Preiser </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 411 U.S. 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Likewise, this court has expanded the application of habeas corpus, describing it as \u201cavailable as a remedy for a miscarriage of justice or other prejudice. . . .

As this court stated in <em>Bunkley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 444, 460-61, 610 A.2d 598 (1992), the principal purpose of the writ of habeas corpus is to serve as a bulwark against convictions that violate fundamental fairness. ... To mount a successful collateral attack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>on his conviction a prisoner must demonstrate a miscarriage of justice or other prejudice and not merely an error which might entitle him to relief on appeal. . . . [I]n <em>Safford </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>223 Conn. 180, 191 n.13, 612 A.2d 1161 (1992) . . . [this court] recognized that the great writ of liberty is not a remedy for constitutional violations exclusively, albeit most cases in which the remedy has been applied involve issues of fundamental fairness that implicate constitutional rights.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Warden, 223 </em>Conn. 834, 840, 613 A.2d 818 (1992). \u201c[Thus the] writ of habeas corpus, as it is employed in the twentieth century . . . does not focus solely upon a direct attack on the underlying judgment or upon release from confinement. See, e.g., <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>194 Conn. 510, 481 A.2d 1084 (1984) (undue appellate delay); <em>Arey </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>187 Conn. 324, 445 A.2d 916 (1982) (conditions of confinement); <em>Roque </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>181 Conn. 85, 434 A.2d 348 (1980) (first amendment issues); <em>Negron </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>180 Conn. 153, 429 A.2d 841 (1980) (state\u2019s extradition practice); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>163 Conn. 340, 307 A.2d 166 (1972) (custody and visitation disputes).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 841-42. Nonetheless, despite this expansion of the writ beyond its initial objective of securing immediate release from illegal detention, in order to invoke successfully the jurisdiction of the habeas court, a petitioner must allege \u201can interest sufficient to give rise to habeas relief.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In the present case, the petitioner has claimed that, under \u00a7 54425a, he has a statutorily created liberty interest in parole eligibility status after serving one half of his sentence. He further has claimed that \u201c[f]ederal and Connecticut law support the Appellate Court\u2019s use of the term \u2018liberty interest\u2019 to characterize an inmate\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>interest in an accurately calculated parole eligibility date,\u201d and that \u201cparole eligibility is an integral part of the criminal sentence in Connecticut.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The petitioner seeks to invoke habeas jurisdiction based on this alleged liberty interest, in other words, \u201ca liberty interest protected by the [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause of the [fourteenth [a]mendment<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which may not be terminated absent appropriate due process safeguards.\u201d <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>429 U.S. 78, 85-86, 97 S. Ct. 274, 50 L. Ed. 2d 236 (1976). \u201cIn order ... to qualify as a constitutionally protected \u2018liberty,\u2019 [however] the interest must be one that is <em>assured </em>either by statute, judicial decree, or regulation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Wheway v. Warden, </em>215 Conn. 418, 432, 576 A.2d 494 (1990), citing <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 558, 94 S. Ct. 2963, 41 L.

Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The Supreme Court has recognized that, \u201c[t]here is no constitutional or inherent right of a convicted person to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence. ... A state may . . . establish a parole system, but it has no duty to do so.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Greenholtz </em>v. <em>Inmates of the Nebraska Penal &amp; Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 7, 99 S. Ct. 2100, 60 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1979). Accordingly, whether and to what extent a state creates a liberty interest in parole by state statute is entirely at the discretion of the state. Thus, in <em>Greenholtz, </em>the Supreme Court held that mandatory language in Nebraska\u2019s parole statute created an interest in expectancy of release that was entitled to a measure of constitutional protection. Id., 12. The court emphasized the statute\u2019s unique structure and language that created this interest, and noted that, \u201cwhether any other state statute provides a protectible entitlement must be decided on a case-by-case basis.\u201d Id.; see also <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>482 U.S. 369, 378 n.10, 107 S.

We have previously stated that in construing statutes, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Unkelbach </em>v. <em>McNary, </em>244 Conn. 350, 357, 710 A.2d 717 (1998). \u201cIn seeking to determine [the] meaning [of a statute], General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stone-Krete Construction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Eder, </em>280 Conn. 672, 677, 911 A.2d 300 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We begin with the text of \u00a7 54-125a. Subsection (a), which the petitioner claims gives rise to his liberty interest in being considered eligible for parole after serving 50 percent of his sentence, provides in relevant part: \u201cA person convicted of one or more crimes who is incarcerated on or after October 1,1990, who received a definite sentence or aggregate sentence of more than two years, and who has been confined under such sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>tence or sentences for not less than one-half of the aggregate sentence or one-half of the most recent sentence imposed by the court, whichever is greater, <em>may </em>be allowed to go at large on parole <em>in the discretion of the panel of the Board </em>... for the institution in which the person is confined, <em>if </em>(1) it appears from all available information, including any reports from the Commissioner of Correction that the panel may require, that there is reasonable probability that such inmate will live and remain at liberty without violating the law, <em>and </em>(2) such release is not incompatible with the welfare of society. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 54-125a (a), as amended by Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 2001, No. 01-9, \u00a7 74. We see nothing in this text that affirmatively grants <em>any </em>inmate the right to parole eligibility after serving one half of his or her sentence. In contrast, subsection (b) of the statute instructs that an inmate deemed to be a violent offender by the board <em>\u201cshall </em>be ineligible for parole under subsection (a) of this section until such person has served not less than eighty-five per cent of the definite sentence imposed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 54-125a (b) (2), as amended by Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 2001, No. 01-9, \u00a7 74. Thus, the only mandatory language in these provisions is that in subsection <em>(b) preventing </em>the board from considering violent offenders for parole before they have served 85 percent of their sentences. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>171 Conn. 691, 697-98, 372 A.2d 102 (1976) (\u201c[t]he only statutory limits upon the discretion of the board of parole are the requirement that the inmate serve his minimum sentence, that it appear that the inmate will remain at liberty without violating the law, and that the release of the inmate not be incompatible with the welfare of society\u201d). Moreover, the broad, discretionary nature of the board\u2019s authority in classifying offenders is underscored in subsection (c), under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>which the board is instructed expressly that its regulations for determining violent offender status \u201cshall include guidelines and procedures for classifying a person as a violent offender that are not limited to a consideration of the elements of the offense or offenses for which such person was convicted.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 54-125a (c), as amended by Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 2001, No. 01-9, \u00a7 74. Accordingly, we see no indication in \u00a7 54-125a that the legislature intended to assure an inmate\u2019s parole eligibility status upon serving 50 percent of his or her sentence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, numerous Courts of Appeals have concluded that similar permissive language in parole statutes did not give rise to a liberty interest.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">This court has recognized that \u201cin <em>Greenholtz </em>v. <em>Inmates of the Nebraska Penal &amp; Correctional Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>plex, </em>[supra, 442 U.S. 11-12], and <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>[supra, 482 U.S. 377, 381] . . . the United States Supreme Court held that the mandatory language in the parole statutes under review, both of which provided that a prisoner \u2018shall\u2019 be released under certain conditions, gave rise to constitutionally protected liberty interests in parole release.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 816. Section 54-125a, however, contains no such mandatory language. Rather, the decision to grant parole is entirely within the discretion of the board. Indeed, this court squarely has held that, \u201c[t]here is no statutory requirement that the panel [of the board] actually consider the eligibility of any inmate for parole, the statute does not vest an inmate with the right to demand parole, and there is no statutory provision which even permits an inmate to apply for parole. . . . For even if the inmate has complied with the minimum requirements of [the parole statute], the statute does not require the board to determine his eligibility for parole.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 171 Conn. 697-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In addition, the regulations promulgated by the board pursuant to \u00a7 54-125a (c) do not in any way limit its discretion in parole eligibility decisions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>there is mandatory language in the regulations requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>that the board assign each inmate violent or nonviolent offender status, determine an inmate\u2019s earliest parole eligibility date based on that status and notify the inmate of that status, there is no limit on the board\u2019s discretion in making the initial, substantive determination of classification.

Accordingly, the board merely was exercising its discretionary, delegated power in classifying the petitioner in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The petitioner\u2019s claim that parole eligibility is an integral part of a criminal sentence is likewise unavailing. This court has held explicitly that the parole eligibility statute \u201cis not within the terms of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Faria, </em>254 Conn. 613, 627, 758 A.2d 348 (2000). Further undermining the petitioner\u2019s claim is our holding that \u201cdue process does not require a trial court to advise the defendant of his statutory parole ineligibility during a plea canvass. We recognize . . . that statutory parole ineligibility affects the amount of time that the defendant actually will spend in prison, and, unlike parole eligibility, is neither complex nor dependent on the discretion of the parole board. It does not follow, however, that statutory parole ineligibility is covered by the . . . constitutional mandate.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>253 Conn. 497, 512-13, 752 A.2d 49 (2000); accord <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 56, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1985) (\u201c[w]e have never held that the United States [c]onstitution requires the [s]tate to furnish a defendant with information about parole eligibility in order for the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to be voluntary, and indeed such a constitutional requirement would be inconsistent with the current rules of procedure governing the entry of guilty pleas in the federal courts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Finally, we note that our conclusion is in accord with prior decisions by Connecticut courts that have considered \u00a7 54-125a. In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 808, 818-19, this court concluded that the habeas court had jurisdiction to consider the petitioner\u2019s ex post facto challenge to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>board\u2019s parole eligibility calculation for his sentence based on its retroactive application of \u00a7 54-125a (b) (2) and (c). We distinguished the petition in <em>Johnson </em>from that in <em>Vincenzo </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>26 Conn. App. 132, 142, 599 A.2d 31 (1991), wherein the Appellate Court had concluded that the habeas court lacked jurisdiction over a due process challenge to the predecessor to \u00a7 54-125a (then \u00a7 54-125), because the broad discretion vested in the board to determine whether to consider an inmate\u2019s parole suitability under the statute did not give rise to a cognizable liberty interest. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 816-17. This court explained that, \u201c[ujnlike [the petitioner in Vincenzo], however, the petitioner in <em>[Johnson] </em>is claiming a violation of his rights under the ex post facto clause as opposed to the due process clause. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that a law need not impair a vested right to violate the ex post facto prohibition. Evaluating whether a right has vested is important for claims under the . . . [d]ue [pjrocess [clause], which solely protects] pre-existing entitlements.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 817, quoting <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>450 U.S. 24, 29-30, 101 S. Ct. 960, 67 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1981). Thus, because a vested right was not required for the court to consider the petitioner\u2019s ex post facto claim in <em>Johnson, </em>we declined to decide the jurisdictional basis for a due process claim considered by the Appellate Court in <em>Vincenzo. Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 817 n.13. Although <em>Vincenzo </em>addressed the nature of the inmate\u2019s interest in the determination of suitability for parole release at a parole hearing rather than the determination of eligibility for a parole hearing, the Appellate Court\u2019s reasoning in that case as to the parole statute\u2019s grant of broad discretion to the board applies with equal force to the present case. Accordingly, we conclude that parole eligibility under \u00a7 54-125a does not constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>cognizable liberty interest sufficient to invoke habeas jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-9\"> The petitioner, Troy Baker, named the commissioner of correction as the respondent.
