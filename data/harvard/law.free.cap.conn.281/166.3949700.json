The defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) concluded that the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement was unenforceable; (2) presumed that the parties were entitled to an equal distribution of the marital property; (3) included in the defendant\u2019s income $3,846,029 in management fees and $4,922,645 in performance fees associated with the defendant\u2019s interest in certain hedge funds when no such income existed; (4) concluded that the defendant\u2019s testimony lacked credibility; and (5) awarded the plaintiff $125,000 in attorney\u2019s fees even though she received a substantial lump sum property award. We conclude that the prenuptial agreement was enforceable and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The trial court made the following specific findings and conclusions. The plaintiff, a citizen of the United Kingdom with a high school education, began working in London, England, for Bankers Trust as a trader\u2019s assistant and personal aide in 1994. \u201cThe plaintiff worked under the direction of the defendant<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> . . . [and] [t]he parties began dating within one week of the plaintiffs new employment. Six or eight weeks later, the parties became sexually intimate. The plaintiff moved out of her mother\u2019s house two weeks later to live with the defendant in his . . . apartment. . . . The parties maintained their finances separately. The defendant paid the shelter costs but did not provide any cash, credit card or bank account access to the plaintiff. . . . The plaintiff paid her own expenses. Prior to their marriage, the parties never had any conversation about the defendant\u2019s income or assets. The plaintiff never inquired; the defendant never offered any information.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u201cThe parties traveled together to New York City in December, 1994, and stayed at the defendant\u2019s apartment on 65th Street. They traveled to Florida in January, 1995, where the plaintiff met the defendant\u2019s parents. For the next two years, the plaintiff flew with the defendant frequently on his business and personal trips to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>United States. ... In the spring of 1996, the plaintiff accompanied the defendant as he looked for a house to buy in Connecticut. The defendant [subsequently] purchased a house ... [in] Westport ....</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff continued at Bankers Trust uneventfully for three years. As a trader\u2019s assistant, she entered and recorded stock transactions that the traders had done. As a personal aide to the defendant, she booked his travel to Hong Kong and Tokyo, made hotel and dinner reservations, and helped plan his workday. She did not decide upon the defendant\u2019s meetings, but she did organize them. She was responsible for keeping a log as to the defendant\u2019s whereabouts and appointments. She submitted the defendant\u2019s expense account receipts and bills to Bankers Trust. On at least one occasion, the defendant directed the plaintiff to photocopy certain of the defendant\u2019s financial documents for him to give to his accountant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff denies that she made any attempt to peruse the documents to determine their content. She did not know the defendant\u2019s income or his net worth. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u201cIn the summer of 1997, the defendant asked the plaintiff to go to the United States to oversee renovations and furnishing of the Westport house. The plaintiff . . . readily agreed to his request . . . [and] took an unpaid leave of absence from the Bankers Trust job. In October, 1997, the plaintiff received notice that her employment at Bankers Trust was terminated because of the extraordinary length of her leave of absence. She continued to look after the renovations at the Westport house. Because her tourist visa allowed her to stay in the United States only ninety days at a time, the plaintiff traveled home to London every three months for a stay of a week before returning to Westport. ... As in Lon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>don, the plaintiff provided all the domestic services and ran personal errands for the defendant. The defendant paid the mortgage and utility expenses at the Westport house. The plaintiff used her savings to pay all her other living expenses. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u201cIn 1998, the plaintiff discovered that she was entering the [United States] on a tourist visa for the last time. The . . . trip to Westport [in the summer of 1998] would be her last unless her immigration status changed. The parties went together to see an immigration lawyer in August, 1998. The plaintiffs marriage to an American citizen would change her immigration status and allow her to stay in the United States. The defendant proposed marriage to the plaintiff on August 20, 1998. The parties needed to marry by the latter part of November, 1998, in order for the plaintiff to remain legally in the United States. Shortly after proposing marriage, the defendant informed the plaintiff that a premarital agreement would be necessary. The plaintiff was not familiar with the concept of a premarital agreement but expressed a willingness to sign one if that is what the defendant wished. The parties set Friday, November 6, 1998, as the wedding date. The plaintiff arranged for a justice of the peace to preside.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u201cThe plaintiff heard nothing more about the possible premarital agreement until Monday, November 2.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At that time, the defendant informed the plaintiff that the wedding could not take place on November 6 because the premarital agreement was not ready. There was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>discussion between the parties about possible terms of a premarital agreement. The plaintiff contacted the justice of the peace to set a new wedding date of November 13.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u201cBoth parties were in New York City at the defendant\u2019s apartment on Thursday evening, November 5, when the defendant handed . . . the plaintiff a facsimile copy of a draft premarital agreement .... He told her to look it over and get it signed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The record also reveals the following undisputed facts. The draft agreement consisted of nineteen articles. Article one, entitled \u201cAcknowledgment of Present Situation: Changes in Circumstances,\u201d included the following language: \u201cEach party acknowledges for himself or herself that both parties have substantial assets and that each would be able to adequately support himself or herself.\u201d Articles ten and eleven, entitled \u201cHusband\u2019s Representations\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and \u201cWife\u2019s Represent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>ations,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> respectively, contained nearly identical language describing each party\u2019s assets and liabilities by reference to schedules A and B, and each party\u2019s gross income in 1997, although the spaces provided for the statements of income were not filled in. Articles ten and eleven further provided that each party acknowledged that he or she had examined the assets and liabilities set forth in the schedule of the other party and clearly understood and consented to all of the agreement\u2019s terms. See footnotes 8 and 9 of this opinion. Schedules A and B were attached to the draft agreement but, as in the case of the parties\u2019 incomes, had not yet been filled in.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>The plaintiff read the draft agreement over the weekend of November 7 and 8, and made handwritten notes on seven of its twenty-one pages. The notes suggested that she had read the agreement carefully.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Among the words that she underlined in article six, which concerned waiver and release of her future rights and claims against the defendant,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> were \u201cwaives,\u201d \u201creleases,\u201d \u201crights,\u201d \u201cclaims,\u201d \u201calimony\u201d and \u201cmaintenance . . . .\u201d The plaintiff also completed schedule B, noting that she had no liabilities and that her assets consisted of a \u201cchecking account\u201d valued at $4000, a \u201csavings account\u201d valued at $11,000, \u201cshares\u201d valued at $4000, and an \u201cendowment\u201d valued at $3000, for a total asset value of $22,000. The plaintiff made no notations or marks on the draft agreement indicating that she had any questions or concerns regarding article ten, article eleven or schedule A.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>When the defendant handed the draft agreement to the plaintiff on November 5, he also told her that his sister-in-law, Attorney Kristen A. Friezo, could recommend an attorney with whom the plaintiff might wish to consult. The plaintiff, who was on good terms with Kristen Friezo, made an appointment to go to her New York City law firm on Tuesday, November 10.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Upon the plaintiffs arrival for her appointment, Kristen Friezo introduced her to another associate in the law firm, Attorney Eamonn F. Foley.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Foley first asked the plaintiff to sign a conflict of interest waiver, which she did. The two then met for approximately one-half hour. Because Foley already had a copy of the draft, the plaintiff did not show him her copy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> When Foley asked the plaintiff if she had any questions, she posed the questions that had come to mind during her weekend review of the draft. Foley stated that her points were well taken and that he would look into them. During the consultation, Foley also made notes on his own copy of the draft and asked the plaintiff to provide him with a list of her assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">According to the plaintiff, Foley did not show or discuss with her a facsimile copy of the defendant\u2019s assets and liabilities that the defendant\u2019s attorney had sent to him on Friday, November 6, one day after the defendant presented the draft to the plaintiff and suggested that she seek legal advice. The document listed assets with a total value of $6,576,000. These assets included two mutual fund/money market accounts, 2541 shares of common stock in Softime, Inc., the West-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>port property, a Florida property, an automobile, a motorcycle, a boat, a Merrill Lynch employee stock purchase plan, three Bankers Trust employee plans, three Bankers Trust equity participation plans and some United States savings bonds, all of which were identified by account number, where applicable, and valued individually. The only liability indicated was a tax adjustment on the three Bankers Trust equity participation plans. The list of the defendant\u2019s assets and liabilities faxed to Foley on November 6 ultimately was incorporated, without revision, into schedule A of the final agreement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">In describing her meeting with Foley, the plaintiff testified that Foley did not ask her whether she understood the draft and did not voluntarily explain any portions of the draft that she did not bring up. She admitted, however, that she understood the meaning of a release of rights and claims and that she knew that the purpose of the agreement was to protect the defendant\u2019s assets in the event of a divorce. She also testified that she had not discussed the defendant\u2019s income or assets with Foley at any time during their meeting and that it did not matter to her how much money the defendant made either prior to or following their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The plaintiff did not meet with Foley after November 10, but stated that they most likely had another conversation sometime before she signed the agreement, although she did not recall exactly when.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thereafter, Foley faxed his notes regarding the plaintiffs concerns and her list of assets to the defendant\u2019s attorney. The plaintiff did not discuss the agreement with the defendant during this period because he was out of the country on business between Sunday, November 8, and Wednesday, November 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">On November 12, twenty-four hours before the wedding, the parties met in the offices of the defendant\u2019s attorney and signed the final agreement. The defendant had faxed the agreement in its final form to Foley earlier that day with no schedules attached. The agreement presented to the plaintiff for signature, however, contained all of the financial information absent from the original draft. This included figures indicating the parties\u2019 respective annual incomes and the completed schedules A and B. The plaintiff testified that this was the first time that she had seen a statement of the defendant\u2019s assets and liabilities and a figure representing the defendant\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The trial court determined that the plaintiff had reviewed the final agreement in a separate room for at least twenty minutes prior to its signing, during which time she \u201clooked at\u201d schedule A and the income provisions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The agreement in its final form contained most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>of the changes that she had requested during her meeting with Foley two days earlier.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thereafter, both parties signed and initialed the agreement and the attached schedules A and B. Foley did not charge the plaintiff for his services but, following the parties\u2019 wedding, the defendant directed the plaintiff to send Foley two bottles of wine as a gesture of gratitude, which the plaintiff did. The defendant paid his own attorney $5000.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The parties married on November 13, 1998. On July 2, 2002, the plaintiff filed for dissolution, claiming an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. The plaintiff requested equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 assets pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81, alimony, child support, joint legal custody of the parties\u2019 minor child, physical custody of the minor child and other relief. The defendant filed an answer and a cross complaint, and the trial court heard testimony and received exhibits during a nine day trial in July and August, 2004. Enforceability of the agreement was among the issues to be decided by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In its memorandum of decision dated August 27,2004, the trial court concluded that the parties\u2019 premarital agreement was unenforceable because the plaintiff had met her burden of proving lack of adequate financial disclosure by the defendant and lack of a reasonable opportunity to consult with independent counsel. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>court determined that the plaintiff did not have sufficient time to examine the agreement and did not have actual knowledge regarding the defendant\u2019s income or the value of his assets. The court also concluded that Foley had not represented her interests properly or provided her with adequate assistance in understanding the agreement\u2019s provisions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thereafter, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>relied in part on the net worth of the defendant, as represented in schedule A, in fashioning its financial orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The trial court concluded that the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement was unenforceable because the defendant did not provide the plaintiff with a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d disclosure of the amount, character and value of his property, financial obligations and income, and because the plaintiff was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult with independent counsel. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (3) and (4). In reviewing these conclusions, we first must determine the meaning of \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d disclosure, a matter of statutory interpretation. It is well established that statutory interpretation involves a question of law over which we exercise plenary review. E.g., <em>Parrot </em>v. <em>Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>273 Conn. 12, 18, 866 A.2d 1273 (2005). We then must determine whether the trial court properly concluded that the agreement was unenforceable. This requires application of the legal standards described in the statute, namely, \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d financial disclosure and \u201copportunity to consult with independent counsel,\u201d to the underlying historical facts. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (3) and (4). Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim that the agreement was enforceable is a mixed question of fact and law also subject to our plenary review. See <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correc</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number><em>tion, </em>234 Conn. 139, 152-53, 662 A.2d 718 (1995) (\u201cHistorical facts constitute a recital of external events and the credibility of their narrators. So-called mixed questions of fact and law, which require the application of a legal standard to the historical-fact determinations, are not facts in this sense. . . . [Such questions require] plenary review by this court unfettered by the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]); see also <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>McCue, </em>91 Conn. App. 721, 726, 882 A.2d 143 (claim that prenuptial agreement was unenforceable because both parties failed to disclose income prior to signing presented \u201cmixed question of law and fact [subject] to . . . plenary review\u201d), cert. denied, 276 Conn. 922, 888 A.2d 91 (2005). When legal conclusions of the trial court are challenged on appeal, \u201cwe must decide whether [those] . . . conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 282, 864 A.2d 666 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 848, 126 S. Ct. 102, 163 L. Ed. 2d 116 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u201cFAIR AND REASONABLE\u201d DISCLOSURE<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The principles that govern statutory construction are well established. \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cogan </em>v. <em>Manhattan Auto Financial Corp., </em>276 Conn. 1, 7, 882 A.2d 597 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Prenuptial agreements in Connecticut have been governed since October 1,1995, by the Connecticut Premarital Agreement Act, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36a et seq. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g (a) provides: \u201cA premarital agreement or amendment shall not be enforceable if the party against whom enforcement is sought proves that: (1) Such party did not execute the agreement voluntarily; or (2) [t]he agreement was unconscionable when it was executed or when enforcement is sought; or (3) [b]efore execution of the agreement, such party was not provided a fair and reasonable disclosure of the amount, character and value of property, financial obligations and income of the other party; or (4) [s]uch party was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult with independent counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Although \u00a7 46b-36g does not expressly define \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d financial disclosure, a plain reading of the statute indicates that the term was intended to be understood in the context of the phrase that directly follows, namely, \u201cthe amount, character and value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>property, financial obligations and income of the other party . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (3). Accordingly, \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d disclosure refers to the nature, extent and accuracy of the information to be disclosed, and not to extraneous factors such as the timing of the disclosure.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This conclusion is consistent with the case law of other jurisdictions that have adopted similar requirements. See, e.g., <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>937 S.W.2d 815, 821 (Tenn. 1996) (\u201cfull and fair\u201d financial disclosure refers to requirement that each party reveal extent and nature of assets, liabilities and income to other party prior to execution of agreement). Notably, there is no requirement in the statute that written disclosures be appended to the agreement. In the absence of further guidance as to what constitutes \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d disclosure or how such a disclosure should be made, however, it is necessary to look beyond the statute to extratextual sources, beginning with the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">During the committee hearings that preceded legislative debate on the proposed bill,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Edith F. McClure, an attorney who represented the family law section of the Connecticut Bar Association and who was a member of the committee that drafted the act, explained that the committee had been influenced by three things; see generally Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 7, 1995 Sess., pp. 2237, 2492-93; the first being a 1980 decision of this court, <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>181 Conn. 482, 436 A.2d 8 (1980), in which we addressed whether a prenuptial agreement was enforceable in a dispute involving the disposition of the family residence. Id., 484-85; see Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, p. 2492. McClure noted that, although <em>McHugh </em>was the principal Connecticut decision on pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>nuptial agreements, it was limited in scope and did not address many other important issues, such as \u201cassets . . . and liabilities brought into the marriage . . . .\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, pp. 2492-93. McClure also explained that the committee had relied on the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act (uniform act) in drafting the statute but had departed from certain of the uniform act\u2019s provisions in light of \u201cthe Connecticut experience . . . .\u201d Id., p. 2493. For example, the proposed bill \u201callow[ed] for an individual to contest an agreement if that individual [was] not provided with fair and reasonable financial disclosure and did not waive that right or have independent knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Id. McClure also revealed that the committee had investigated the statutes and judicial decisions of other jurisdictions and that an article by Professor Judith T. Younger; see generally J. Younger, \u201cPerspectives on Antenuptial Agreements,\u201d 40 Rutgers L. Rev. 1059 (1988); had been \u201cparticularly helpful in framing recommendations for changes in the [u]niform [a]ct.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, p. 2493. In her article, Younger conducted an extensive review of existing law and concluded that, \u201c[i]n every case, disclosure should be enough to give each contracting party a clear idea of the other\u2019s property and resources. The best device for proving disclosure is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>attach schedules of assets and income to the agreement itself. A mere recital of disclosure in the agreement does not preclude a showing that there was none in fact.\u201d J. Younger, supra, 1080.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The bill initially required the party against whom enforcement is sought to prove not only that he or she was not provided a \u201cfair and reasonable disclosure of the amount, character and value of property, financial obligations and income of the other party,\u201d but that he or she \u201c[d]id not voluntarily and expressly waive, in writing, any right to disclosure of the property, financial obligations and income of the other party beyond the disclosure provided\u201d and \u201c[d]id not have, or reasonably could not have had, an adequate knowledge of the property, financial obligations and income of the other party, and of the legal rights which that party would relinquish under the agreement . . . .\u201d Substitute House Bill No. 6932, \u00a7 6 (1995 Sess.). An amendment, however, eliminated the second and third requirements. See Substitute House Bill No. 6932, \u00a7 6 (1995 Sess.), as amended by House Amendment Schedule A. The amendment thus made it easier to prove lack of a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d financial disclosure and demonstrated the legislature\u2019s intent that the disclosure requirement focus on the information to be disclosed rather than on the party to whom disclosure is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Although the legislative history is helpful in understanding the drafters\u2019 general intent, it does not provide a definitive answer to the question of what constitutes \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d disclosure. It is therefore necessary to review <em>McHugh,</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the decisions of other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>jurisdictions that have interpreted analogous provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">In <em>McHugh, </em>this court articulated the principle that, because the parties to a prenuptial agreement stand in a relationship of mutual confidence, \u201c[t]he duty of each party to disclose the amount, character, and value of individually owned property, absent the other\u2019s independent knowledge of the same, is an essential prerequisite to a valid antenuptial agreement containing a waiver of property rights. . . . The burden is not on either party to inquire, but on each to inform, for it is only by requiring full disclosure of the amount, character, and value of the parties\u2019 respective assets that courts can ensure intelligent waiver of the statutory rights involved.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 486-87. <em>McHugh </em>thus makes three significant points. First, the purpose of disclosure is to ensure that each party has sufficient knowledge of the other party\u2019s financial circumstances to understand the nature of the legal rights being waived.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See id. In other words, a party cannot know what is being waived unless he or she is privy to all of the relevant facts, in particular, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the financial status of the other party. The term \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d thus refers to the substance of a party\u2019s disclosure rather than to its timing. This principle is consistent with the language of \u00a7 46b-36g, as we previously discussed. Second, financial disclosure in Connecticut must be understood as a burden to inform borne solely by the disclosing party. Id. Accordingly, the court\u2019s examination of whether proper disclosure has been made must focus on the actions of the disclosing party rather than on the party to whom disclosure is made. See id. Third, \u201cfull\u201d financial disclosure is required in a prenuptial agreement only if the party to whom disclosure is made does not have independent knowledge of the other party\u2019s financial circumstances. See id., 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\"><em>McHugh </em>is the only Connecticut case that has examined, even tangentially, the meaning of fair and reasonable disclosure.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We therefore turn to the case law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>other jurisdictions that have enacted similar provisions based on the uniform act. See, e.g., <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>233 Conn. 304, 326, 659 A.2d 1166 (1995) (\u201cwe . . . may find guidance in precedent from other states that have adopted . . . relevant provisions of [a] [u]niform [a]ct\u201d); <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>186 Conn. 404, 408, 441 A.2d 841 (1982) (\u201c[when an] act is a uniform law, decisions from other states are valuable for the interpretation of its provisions\u201d); see also <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Healey Ford-Subaru, Inc., </em>231 Conn. 707, 719-21, 652 A.2d 496 (1995) (considering interpretations of analogous provisions of article nine of Uniform Commercial Code adopted by other states).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Our review of this case law indicates that when a party\u2019s independent knowledge is insufficient and the other party must disclose financial information in a prenuptial agreement, the extent of the required disclosure depends on how the court views the relationship. Courts in the majority of jurisdictions regard the parties as involved in a confidential relationship of mutual trust that demands the exercise of the highest degree of good faith, candor and sincerity in all matters bearing on the proposed agreement. See, e.g., <em>In re Marriage of Drag, </em>326 Ill. App. 3d 1051, 1056, 762 N.E.2d 1111 (2002); <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>384 Md. 537, 556, 570-71, 865 A.2d 563 (2005); <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Lipnick, </em>377 Mass. 666, 670, 389 N.E.2d 385 (1979); <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>Iverson, </em>295 Mont. 511, 517, 985 P.2d 1176 (1999); <em>In re Estate of Hollett, </em>150 N.H. 39, 42-43, 834 A.2d 348 (2003); <em>Tiryakian </em>v. <em>Tiryakian, </em>91 N.C.

Connecticut regards the parties to a prenuptial agreement as involved in a confidential relationship. See <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 486-87. Accordingly, we must apply the more stringent standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">The overwhelming majority of jurisdictions that apply this standard do not require financial disclosure to be exact or precise. See, e.g., <em>Nanini </em>v. <em>Nanini, </em>166 Ariz. 287, 290, 802 P.2d 438 (App. 1990) (applying Illinois law and concluding that \u201cexact dollar value\u201d of parties\u2019 property need not be shown at time of execution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>agreement); <em>In re Estate of Lopata, </em>641 P.2d 952, 955 (Colo. 1982) (\u201cFair disclosure is not synonymous with detailed disclosure such as a financial statement of net worth and income.

Though not required, a fairly simple and effective method of proving disclosure is to attach a net worth schedule of assets, liabilities, and income to the agreement itself.\u201d [Citation omitted.]); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>929 S.W.2d 367, 371 (Tenn.

The disclosure will be deemed adequate if it imparts an accurate understanding of the nature and extent of a person\u2019s property interests.\u201d); <em>Pajak </em>v. Pajak, supra, 182 W. Va. 32 (\u201cfor a pre-nuptial agreement to be valid, it is not necessary that both parties execute a detailed, written financial statement such as is required by a bank before making a loan\u201d). See generally annot., \u201cFailure to Disclose Extent of Value of Property Owned As Ground for Avoiding Premarital Contract,\u201d 3 A.L.R.5th 394, 413-17, \u00a7 2 [a] (1992). We agree with the majority of jurisdictions that a fair and reasonable financial disclosure requires each contracting party to provide the other with a general approximation of their income, assets and liabilities, and that a written schedule appended to the agreement itself, although not absolutely necessary, is the most effective method of satisfying the statutory obligation in most circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In the present case, the defendant\u2019s disclosure was more than adequate to ensure that the plaintiff would be able to make an intelligent waiver of her statutory rights. See <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 486-87. Article ten of the agreement provided that the defendant\u2019s gross income from all sources for 1997, excluding capital gains, was $2,300,000. In addition, schedule A set forth a list of the defendant\u2019s assets and liabilities, most of which were valued individually, for a total net worth of $6,576,000. These assets, as we previously noted, included money market accounts, mutual funds, checking accounts, investments, real and personal property, stocks, various employee and equity participation plans, United States savings bonds, and four fre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>quent flier accounts, all identified by account numbers, where applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Moreover, the plaintiff acknowledged in article eleven of the agreement that she had examined the list of assets and liabilities provided in schedule A and clearly understood and consented to all of the agreement\u2019s terms. See footnote 9 of this opinion. Significantly, the plaintiff did not allege at any time during the proceedings, nor did the court conclude, that the defendant\u2019s disclosure was inaccurate or incomplete. Instead, the court, in effect, validated the defendant\u2019s disclosure by relying in part on the statement of net worth provided in schedule A when calculating its financial orders. Thus, the defendant\u2019s disclosure would have been adequate even under the standard employed in New Jersey, which <em>requires </em>that a written list of assets and income be appended to the prenuptial agreement. See <em>DeLorean </em>v. DeLorean, supra, 211 N.J. Super. 438 (\u201cwe can ascertain with complete certainty whether there was a full and complete disclosure only by requiring a written list of assets and income [to] be attached to the [ante]nuptial agreement\u201d). We therefore conclude that the defendant\u2019s disclosure was \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d because it provided the plaintiff with an accurate representation, in writing, of his income and financial assets at the time the agreement was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The trial court determined that the defendant\u2019s disclosure failed to comply with \u00a7 46b-36g because the plaintiff lacked sufficient financial experience to understand the information disclosed. This conclusion is incompatible with <em>McHugh </em>and the statute\u2019s legislative history. When the burden is on each party to inform, as established in <em>McHugh, </em>the test for adequate disclosure need not take into account or depend on the capacity of the receiving party to understand or digest the information received. To adopt such a test would place an additional burden on each party to assess the intelligence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>financial experience of the other, a subjective determination simply not contemplated in the statute or in the case law of this or other jurisdictions. Accordingly, although the plaintiffs financial inexperience may be relevant in assessing, for example, whether the agreement was substantively fair; see, e.g., <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>347 Ark. 383, 388-89, 64 S.W.3d 746 (2002); unconscionable; see, e.g., <em>Mallen </em>v. <em>Mallen, </em>280 Ga. 43, 47, 622 S.E.2d 812 (2005); or voluntary; see, e.g., <em>DeLorean </em>v. <em>DeLorean, </em>supra, 211 N.J. Super. 436; it is not relevant in determining whether the parties made a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d disclosure of their respective financial circumstances. The subsequent legislative history of the statute, which included the removal of a provision that would have required the party against whom enforcement is sought to prove that he or she did not have adequate knowledge of the other party\u2019s financial status, supports this conclusion. The plaintiffs financial experience, or alleged lack thereof, thus has no bearing on whether the defendant made a fair and reasonable disclosure of his financial circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">VOLUNTARY EXECUTION OF THE AGREEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The trial court further concluded that the defendant had failed to comply with the disclosure requirement because the plaintiff had insufficient time to review the final agreement and the disclosures contained therein. We treat this issue separately because such a conclusion is lacking in legal support and reflects a misunderstanding of the law. It is well established that the amount of time available to review a prenuptial agreement is relevant in assessing whether the agreement was voluntary or signed under duress, but not in determining whether the patties made a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d disclosure of their financial circumstances. See, e.g., 41 Am. Jur. 2d 102, Husband and Wife \u00a7 101 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>(2005) (\u201c[c]ourts have . . . recognized that under the heightened scrutiny afforded to prenuptial agreements, <em>the timing of the agreement is of paramount importance in assessing whether it was </em>voluntary\u201d [emphasis added]); 2 A. Lindey &amp; L. Parley, Separation Agreements and Antenuptial Contracts (2d Ed. 2006) \u00a7 110.65 [2], p. 110-54 (\u201c[t]he most common circumstances raised as creating the duress [are] where the party attacking the agreement was given it to sign just before the wedding\u201d); see also <em>In re Marriage of Bonds, </em>supra, 24 Cal. 4th 32 (agreement voluntary despite temporal proximity of wedding and execution of agreement); <em>Hjortaas </em>v. <em>McCabe, </em>656 So. 2d 168, 170 (Fla. App.) (timing indicated signing of agreement not voluntary and product of duress), review denied, 662 So. 2d 342 (Fla. 1995); <em>In re Marriage of Maifield, </em>No. 03-0326, 2004 WL 61108, *2 (Iowa App. January 14, 2004) (agreement not voluntary when presented to wife on eve of wedding); <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Landry, </em>96 N.C. App. 516, 528-29, 386 S.E.2d 610 (1989) (brevity of time to consider agreement, by itself, was insufficient to establish duress), review denied, 326 N.C. 482, 392 S.E.2d 90 (1990). The Connecticut legislature, like many other jurisdictions, expressly adopted this principle when it included an entirely separate provision in the statute providing that an agreement shall not be enforceable if the party against whom enforcement is sought establishes that he or she did not execute the agreement voluntarily. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (1). If the legislature had intended that the timing of a party\u2019s disclosure be considered in determining whether that disclosure was fair and reasonable, there would have been no reason to make involuntary execution of the agreement a separate and distinct ground for invalidation. Consequently, whether the plaintiff had sufficient time to review and evaluate the defendant\u2019s financial disclosure reveals nothing about whether the disclosure was fair and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>We nevertheless consider the disclosure\u2019s timing because the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision reasonably can be construed as concluding that the agreement was unenforceable because it was not executed by the plaintiff knowingly and voluntarily. We begin with the decision of the trial court. In reaching its conclusion, the court found that \u201cthe plaintiff did not have any financial disclosure prior to the meeting in the offices of the defendant\u2019s attorneys when she executed the premarital agreement.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The trial court disregarded a crucial piece of evidence in the record pertaining to this issue, namely, the copy of schedule A listing the defendant\u2019s assets and liabilities that was faxed to Foley by the defendant\u2019s attorney six days before the agreement was executed. Although there is no evidence in the record as to why Foley did not show this information to the plaintiff during their meeting on November 10, the same trial judge observed in <em>Dornemann </em>v. <em>Dornemann, </em>48 Conn. Sup. 502, 850 A.2d 273 (2004), with respect to a claim alleging insufficient financial disclosure, that \u201c[t]he knowledge and admissions of an attorney are imputed to his client\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 511, quoting <em>Lafayette Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>177 Conn. 137, 140, 411 A.2d 937 (1979); and, therefore, the plaintiff in that case, who had not seen the relevant financial documents, possessed \u201cthe imputed knowledge of her attorney as to the defendant\u2019s finances . . . .\u201d <em>Dornemann </em>v. <em>Dornemann, </em>supra, 511; see also <em>Lebowitz </em>v. <em>McPike, </em>157 Conn. 235, 242, 253 A.2d 1 (1968); <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>70 Conn. 274, 282, 39 A. 182 (1898). Consequently, in the present case, as in <em>Dornemann, </em>the plaintiff possessed the imputed knowledge of her attorney regarding the contents of schedule A before she executed the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">There appear to be only two reasons why the trial court did not make a factual finding regarding Foley\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>prior knowledge of schedule A, these being the court\u2019s expressed conviction that Foley was \u201cincredibly incompetent in his representation of the plaintiff or he was not, in fact, representing her at all.\u201d We believe that the latter is the more likely explanation because incompetence is an insufficient reason to avoid imputing knowledge to the plaintiff, who could have sought appropriate legal redress by filing a malpractice claim against Foley but did not do so. Moreover, various statements in the trial court\u2019s opinion suggest that the court regarded Foley\u2019s conduct as rising to the level of fraud. At different times in its analysis, the court stated that (1) the plaintiff \u201cdid not know that she was being set up,\u201d (2) the attorneys at Foley\u2019s law firm had \u201ca clear conflict of interest\u201d in their representation of the plaintiff, even though the plaintiff executed documents waiving any conflict of interest, (3) the plaintiff \u201cdid not have the sophistication to realize what was going on,\u201d and (4) \u201cthe most telling indication of Foley\u2019s true loyalties and obligations in connection with his lack of advice to the plaintiff was his failure to secure any retainer agreement, exact a consultation fee or tender any bill for services.\u201d The court\u2019s conclusions regarding fraud, however, are not supported by facts that meet the clear and convincing standard of proof required in cases involving charges of fraud and ethical violations by attorneys. E.g., <em>Black </em>v. <em>Goodwin, Loomis &amp; Britton, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 144, 163, 681 A.2d 293 (1996) (\u201cthe appropriate standard of proof for the party who seeks to prevail in a civil fraud action is clear and convincing evidence\u201d); <em>Weiss </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>227 Conn. 802, 812, 633 A.2d 282 (1993) (\u201cin a grievance proceeding, the standard of proof applicable in determining whether an attorney has violated the Code of Professional Responsibility is clear- and convincing evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">To the extent that the court\u2019s determination of misconduct represents a finding that <em>the defendant </em>perpe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>trated a fraud on the plaintiff, that finding clearly was improper. Because the plaintiff did not plead a defense of fraud in response to the defendant\u2019s cross petition to enforce the prenuptial agreement, she would not be entitled to a judgment premised on that defense <em>even if </em>the evidence had supported such a defense, which clearly it did not. See, e.g., <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Namerow, </em>257 Conn. 812, 825, 778 A.2d 168 (2001) (fraud is affirmative defense that must be pleaded); <em>DeLucia </em>v. <em>Valente, </em>83 Conn. 107, 109, 75 A. 150 (1910) (\u201c[t]he fact that the court heard evidence upon the question of fraud, considered it, and made a finding in relation to this subject, did not give the appellant the right to rely upon the special defense which had not been pleaded\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Insofar as the trial court found that <em>Foley </em>had perpetrated a fraud on the plaintiff, that finding, too, lacks evidentiary support. Indeed, there was no evidence presented at trial to indicate that Foley <em>knew </em>the defendant, or even that he had conspired with him, or with anyone else, for that matter, to perpetrate a fraud on the plaintiff. Nor was there any evidence that Kristen Friezo discussed the prenuptial agreement with Foley or attempted to influence him in any way on behalf of the defendant. The only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence is that Foley agreed to represent the plaintiff as a professional courtesy to his colleague, Kristen Friezo, who, apparently, thought that she was doing a favor for the plaintiff.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The trial court\u2019s principal factual findings on the issue of fraud were that Foley worked in the same law firm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>as Kristen Friezo, did not explain to the plaintiff terminology or provisions in the draft that she herself did not bring to his attention, did not ask the plaintiff if she understood specific provisions in the draft, did not meet with or talk to the plaintiff after their meeting on November 10, did not review with the plaintiff the final revisions to the draft or the defendant\u2019s financial disclosure and did not secure a retainer agreement, obtain a consultation fee or tender a bill for his services. Although most of these findings might suggest incompetence, which would support a claim of malpractice, none suggests fraud. In addition, the trial court\u2019s finding that Foley did not talk to the plaintiff after their meeting is not supported by the plaintiffs own testimony, in which she stated that she probably had spoken to Foley after their meeting and before she signed the agreement but could not recall when. Finally, insofar as the court may have relied on nonpayment for services as a reason to find that Foley was disloyal to the plaintiff, there is no evidence in the record even remotely suggesting that Foley rendered his services to the plaintiff because he was working secretly for the defendant and intended to subvert her case. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s omission of a finding that Foley had knowledge of schedule A when he met with the plaintiff, apparently on the ground that he had engaged in fraud even though the record lacks clear and convincing evidence of fraud, severely undermines its subsequent conclusion that the plaintiff did not have sufficient time in which to review the agreement and the information contained therein regarding the defendant\u2019s financial circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Even if Foley\u2019s knowledge of schedule A is not imputed to the plaintiff, the record establishes, unequivocally, that the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the defendant\u2019s financial circumstances when she signed the agreement. The plaintiff conceded that she had \u201clooked at\u201d the entire document, including schedule A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>and the income provisions, prior to its execution. In addition, the trial court noted the defendant\u2019s testimony that his attorney had telephoned Foley while the parties were meeting to sign the agreement and that Foley had acknowledged receipt of the final draft and approved of the plaintiffs execution thereof. To the extent that the plaintiff may not have read the financial disclosure provisions <em>carefully, </em>perhaps it was because, by her own admission, <em>she had no interest </em>in discussing financial matters with the defendant during the time that they lived together prior to the marriage and <em>it did not matter to her how much money the defendant had </em>at the time they were married. Moreover, the plaintiff testified that, during the meeting she attended to sign the final agreement, she was in a hurry to get to a hair appointment. That being the case, her claim that she did not have sufficient time to review the defendant\u2019s financial disclosure lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff had insufficient time to digest and understand the disclosure on the day she signed the agreement is also unsupportable because it is the party\u2019s responsibility to delay the signing of an agreement that is not understood. See, e.g., <em>Simeone </em>v. <em>Simeone, </em>supra, 525 Pa. 400 (\u201c[c]ontracting parties are normally bound by their agreements, without regard to whether the terms thereof were read and fully understood and irrespective of whether the agreements embodied reasonable or good bargains\u201d); <em>Standard Venetian Blind Co. </em>v. <em>American Empire Ins. Co., </em>503 Pa. 300, 305, 469 A.2d 563 (1983) (failure to read contract does not warrant \u201cavoidance, modification or nullification\u201d of its provisions). In the present case, the plaintiff had the opportunity to read the agreement carefully and has not claimed duress. In fact, the trial court specifically observed that there was \u201cno sign\u201d of duress.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> If the plaintiff felt she did not have sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>time to understand the agreement\u2019s terms, she could have rescheduled the wedding, which did not involve extensive planning, for a later date. A formal wedding ceremony to which families and friends would be invited was scheduled for the following July. The only other persons expected to attend the November ceremony were the justice of the peace and his wife, and the plaintiff testified that the wedding could have been rescheduled for any date prior to the end of November without jeopardizing her immigration status. The date had been postponed at least once before, and another delay would not have resulted in embarrassment or humiliation. Thus, the plaintiff could have declined to sign the agreement and requested additional time to review it. The plaintiff should not now be allowed to claim that the agreement is unenforceable and take advantage of her failure to seek a delay in its signing when she easily could have obtained the additional time she claims was needed to review the income and disclosure provisions. For all of the foregoing reasons, we cannot subscribe to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff had insufficient time to review the defendant\u2019s financial disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Insofar as the trial court concludes that the plaintiff lacked the financial experience necessary to understand the agreement and thus did not sign it knowingly; see, e.g., <em>In re Marriage of Gonzalez, </em>561 N.W.2d 94, 97 (Iowa App. 1997) (prenuptial agreement invalid for lack of knowing and voluntary waiver because wife did not understand agreement); we also disagree. The notion that the plaintiff was financially unsophisticated merely because she possessed no more than a high school education, was not familiar with Connecticut law on marriage and divorce and did not discuss financial issues with the defendant prior to their marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>is unsupported by the record. The fact that the plaintiff did not have a college degree conveys nothing about her ability to understand the agreement. The record indicates that, during her employment as a trader\u2019s assistant with Bankers Trust, the plaintiffs work provided her with extensive exposure to financial matters, including entering and recording stock transactions on a daily basis, submitting the defendant\u2019s expense account, receipts and bills to the company and photocopying some of his personal financial records to give to his accountant.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The record also indicates that the plaintiff demonstrated excellent judgment in conducting her personal financial affairs. She saved significant portions of her salary and was responsible for all of her own expenses, excluding housing and utilities, while living with the defendant. She had established separate savings and checking accounts, owned 580 shares of stock, invested $3000 in an endowment policy and had incurred no debt. Her total net worth was $22,000 at the time of the marriage. It is therefore clear that the plaintiff knew how to save, invest and manage her own money.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Additionally, we do not believe that parties require a detailed understanding of Connecticut law on marriage and divorce to validly waive their statutory rights in a prenuptial agreement, nor is it necessary to have a college degree in order to understand the concept of net worth. In the present case, the plaintiff herself applied the practical financial skills that she had acquired as a working woman when she filled out schedule B, apparently without assistance. The plaintiff thus knew exactly what the schedules were intended to describe and was aware that the defendant would be completing schedule A in similar fashion. Moreover, the plaintiff testified that she understood the meaning of a \u201crelease\u201d of rights and claims and that she knew that the purpose of the agreement was to protect the defendant\u2019s assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>in the event of a divorce. She had reviewed the draft given to her by the defendant and made notes and marks on seven of its pages, thus indicating that she had read the document carefully and understood the marked provisions well enough to ask her attorney about specific items several days later, including the underlined language in article six regarding the release and waiver of her rights and claims to alimony and maintenance. Furthermore, she had the advice of counsel and used her meeting with Foley to seek answers to her questions. Foley, in turn, passed her comments on to the defendant\u2019s attorney and obtained most of the revisions she had requested. It simply defies reason to conclude that the plaintiff was so lacking in financial experience that she did not understand the rights she was waiving or the defendant\u2019s financial disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">At least one jurisdiction has explicitly noted that the time has come for paternalistic presumptions and protections to be discarded. See <em>Simeone </em>v. <em>Simeone, </em>supra, 525 Pa. 399 (presumption that women not knowledgeable enough to understand nature of contracts they enter is no longer valid). The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania stated more than one decade ago that \u201c[sjociety has advanced ... to the point where women are no longer regarded as the \u2018weaker\u2019 party in marriage, or in society generally. Indeed, the stereotype that women serve as homemakers while men work as breadwinners is no longer viable. Quite often today both spouses are income earners. Nor is there viability in the presumption that women are uninformed, uneducated, and readily subject to unfair advantage in marital agreements. Indeed, women nowadays quite often have substantial education, financial awareness, income, and assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u201cAccordingly . . . [paternalistic presumptions and protections that arose to shelter women from the inferiorities and incapacities which they were perceived as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>having in earlier times have, appropriately, been discarded. ... It would be inconsistent, therefore, to perpetuate the standards governing prenuptial agreements that . . . [reflect] a paternalistic approach that is now insupportable.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In the present case, the trial court ignores facts in the record that portray the plaintiff, a woman who supported herself for several years by working in a business involving sophisticated financial transactions, as knowledgeable, experienced and even savvy in practical financial matters, and thus able to understand, interpret and ask intelligent questions about the prenuptial agreement if she had so desired. In fact, her written notations on the draft agreement indicate that she had a sharp and inquiring mind. Accordingly, in considering the record in its totality, we conclude that it does not support the conclusion that the plaintiff was so lacking in financial experience or sophistication that she did not execute the agreement knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">INDEPENDENT COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The trial court concluded that the plaintiff was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult with independent counsel as required by \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (4). The court based this conclusion on findings that the plaintiff had been \u201cset up\u201d and that her \u201cexecution of documents waiving any claim to [a] conflict of interest [did] not alter the fact that the attorneys of [Kristen Friezo\u2019s law firm] did have a clear conflict of interest.\u201d The trial court further found that \u201cFoley was either incredibly incompetent in his representation of the plaintiff or he was not, in fact, representing her at all.\u201d The court added that \u201c[t]he plaintiff did not have the sophistication to realize what was going on\u201d and that \u201cthe most telling indication of Foley\u2019s true loyalties and obligations in connection with his lack of advice to the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>tiff was his failure to secure any retainer agreement, exact a consultation fee, or tender any bill for services.\u201d The court thus concluded that the plaintiff \u201cdid not have the benefit of independent legal counsel nor a reasonable opportunity to secure such representation.\u201d We disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusions because they are premised on a misunderstanding of the statutory requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (4) specifically provides that the party against whom enforcement of the prenuptial agreement is sought must prove that \u201c[s]uch party was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult with independent counsel.\u201d The operative terms for the purpose of this analysis are \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d and \u201cindependent counsel.\u201d Although this court has not yet had occasion to construe \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (4), appellate courts that have interpreted identical statutory language invariably have held, consistent with the plain statutory wording, that a \u201creasonable opportunity to consult with independent counsel\u201d means simply that the party against whom enforcement is sought must have had sufficient time before the marriage to consult with an attorney other than the attorney representing the party\u2019s future spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">With respect to whether the plaintiff had a \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d to consult with legal counsel, there is no requirement that a party actually seek or obtain the advice of counsel, only that he or she be afforded a <em>reasonable opportunity </em>to do so. See, e.g., <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>supra, 384 Md. 578 (upholding prenuptial agreement when wife had several days to review agreement and, therefore, sufficient time to consult counsel had she been so inclined); id. (\u201c[i]t was enough for [the husband] to demonstrate that [the wife] had the opportunity to seek counsel and that she was not discouraged to do so\u201d); <em>Black </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>48 Va. App. 113, 141, 628 S.E.2d 546 (2006) (\u201cthe fact that [the wife] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>may have failed to seek independent legal advice does not negate her opportunity to do so\u201d); <em>Pajak </em>v. <em>Pajak, </em>supra, 182 W. Va. 32-33 (\u201calthough advice of independent counsel at the time parties enter into a pre-nuptial agreement helps demonstrate that there has been no fraud, duress or misrepresentation, and that the agreement was entered into knowledgeably and voluntarily, such independent advice of counsel is not a prerequisite to enforceability when the terms of the agreement are understandable to a reasonably intelligent adult and both parties have had the <em>opportunity </em>to consult with independent counsel\u201d [emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted]). In the present case, not only did the plaintiff have a reasonable opportunity to consult with legal counsel, she did, in fact, do so. The defendant did not surprise the plaintiff with a prenuptial agreement the day before the wedding, thus precluding her, for all practical purposes, from obtaining the advice of counsel but, rather, informed the plaintiff that he wanted her to sign an agreement shortly after he proposed marriage on August 20, 1998, more than two months in advance of the anticipated ceremony. Moreover, the plaintiff subsequently contacted Kristen Friezo, who introduced her to Foley. We therefore conclude that the plaintiff had a \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d to consult with independent counsel as that term is used in \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">With respect to whether Foley was in fact \u201cindependent\u201d of the defendant, there is absolutely nothing in the record, other than the trial court\u2019s conclusory allegations of fraudulent misconduct; see part III of this opinion; to suggest that Foley was not independent. The fact that Foley\u2019s colleague, Kristen Friezo, was the defendant\u2019s sister-in-law is insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Foley was not independent from the defendant within the meaning of \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (4). Rule 1.8 (i) of the Rules of Professional Conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>provides that \u201c[a] lawyer related to another lawyer as parent, child, sibling or spouse shall not represent a client in a representation directly adverse to a person who the lawyer knows is represented by the other lawyer except upon consent by the client after consultation regarding the relationship.\u201d Moreover, the commentary to rule 1.8 (i) expressly provides that the disqualification identified therein \u201cis personal and is not imputed to members of firms with whom the lawyers are associated.\u201d Rules of Professional Conduct 1.8 (i), commentary. Thus, under our rules governing the conduct of attorneys, Foley was not barred from representing the plaintiff. Moreover, even if he were prohibited from representing her, the trial court failed to explain why the waiver that the plaintiff signed was ineffective, and the record is devoid of facts to support a finding that the plaintiffs waiver, even if necessary, was invalid. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision to invalidate the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement under \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (3) and (4) cannot stand, and that the agreement must be enforced and the assets distributed according to its terms.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In this opinion SULLIVAN, C.

It took that long to initial and sign original documents. She says that there was no time to review the premarital agreement or the financial pages now attached to it. Foley was not present. The defendant asserts that the parties were at [the law offices] for more than [one] hour. The plaintiff was in a room by herself reviewing the premarital agreement for twenty minutes before the signing took place. [The defendant] says that his attorney telephoned Foley while the parties were there. Foley acknowledged receipt of the final draft and approved of the plaintiffs proceeding with the signing. It does not matter which party has the better recollection of the occasion. Whether the parties were at [the law offices] for one hour, or twice that time, the plaintiff did not have an adequate opportunity to review the premarital agreement, much less understand its changes or digest the lists of assets attached to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff had no experience with attorneys except the parties\u2019 consultation with the immigration lawyer in August [1998]. She did not know that she was being set up. The premarital agreement in its final form was revised on several of the pages where the plaintiff had raised questions to Foley. It was also revised in one way that the plaintiff had not suggested \u2014 the addition of language [providing that] the plaintiff waived any claim of conflict of interest occasioned by the employment of Kristen Friezo\u2019s law firm. The plaintiffs execution of documents waiving any claim to conflict of interest does not alter the fact that the attorneys of [Kristen Friezo\u2019s law firm] did have a clear conflict of interest. Foley was either incredibly incompetent in his representation of the plaintiff or he was not, in fact, representing her at all. The plaintiff did not have the sophistication to realize what was going on. Perhaps, the most telling indication of Foley\u2019s true loyalties and obligations <em>in </em>connection with his lack of advice to the plaintiff was his failure to secure any retainer agreement, exact a consultation fee, or tender any bill for services. After the parties married, the defendant told the plaintiff to deliver two bottles of wine to [Foley] to thank Foley for his help. The plaintiff followed the defendant\u2019s instructions.

Despite the cohabitation of the parties for more than four years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>prior to the marriage, the parties kept their finances completely separated. They did not talk of money issues.

Nevertheless, the decision is helpful in inteipretmg the statute because the financial disclosure requirements described in <em>McHugh </em>and the statute are, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>for all practical purposes, the same. Moreover, as McClure herself explained to the legislature, the proposed statute was intended to clarify <em>McHugh, </em>not to supplant the legal principles espoused therein. See Conn.

In <em>Wilkes </em>v. <em>Wilkes, </em>55 Conn. App. 313, 738 A.2d 758 (1999), in which the plaintiff, Beverly Wilkes, claimed that the parties\u2019 \u201cmid-nuptial agreement\u201d was invalid because the defendant, Lawrence Wilkes, had not made a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d disclosure of his assets under \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (3); (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 319; the Appellate Court concluded that there was no merit to her claim because she had examined the defendant\u2019s financial records at his office, the defendant had given her copies of all documents and records that she had requested, the parties themselves had represented in the agreement that both fully and completely had disclosed their income, assets and liabilities to the other party, and the statute did not require formal financial affidavits. Id., 319-20. The plaintiff thus had independent knowledge of the defendant\u2019s financial circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Thereafter, in <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>McCue, </em>supra, 91 Conn. App. 721, the Appellate Court considered whether the failure of the parties to include their incomes in a prenuptial agreement signed prior to the enactment of \u00a7 46b-36g rendered the agreement invalid and concluded that it did not. See id., 726. The court observed that the plaintiff, Renee Winchester, possessed independent knowledge of the financial circumstances of the defendant, Robert McCue, when the agreement was executed \u201cso as to intelligently waive her right to any income, real or personal property and any claim to alimony.\u201d Id., 727.

I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court improperly determined that the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement (agreement) was unenforceable.

I do so because, if enforceable, the agreement would have controlled the financial disposition of the case. Under the agreement, the recovery of the plaintiff, Victoria Wood Friezo, would have been limited to $400,000, plus the use of a residence for herself and the parties\u2019 child.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court found, however, that the plaintiff had not been afforded fair and reasonable financial disclosure prior to executing the agreement. The trial court further found that the plaintiffs attorney, Eamonn Foley, had acted under a \u201cclear conflict of interest\u201d and had failed to offer independent advice. Accordingly, it concluded that the agreement was unenforceable pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (3) and (4). As I outline in the discussion that follows, I disagree with the standard of review that the majority applies to this claim. I further conclude that the trial court properly determined that the agreement was unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Generally, \u201c[a]n antenuptial agreement is a type of contract and must, therefore, comply with ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>principles of contract law.\u201d <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>181 Conn. 482, 486, 436 A.2d 8 (1980).

Section 46b-36g (a) lists four bases for finding a prenuptial agreement to be unenforceable: (1) voluntariness; (2) unconscionability; (3) failure to provide a fair and reasonable disclosure of property, financial obligations and income; and (4) lack of reasonable opportunity to consult with independent counsel. In \u00a7 46b-36g (c), the legislature provides, in accordance with our jurisprudence, that \u201c[a]n issue of unconscionability of a premarital agreement shall be decided by the court as a matter of law.\u201d The statute is, however, silent with regards to the other three circumstances in which a prenuptial agreement shall not be enforced. By negative implication, this silence indicates that the legislature intended that inquiries under the other provisions of the statute be decided as factual rather than legal questions, which also would be consistent with our case law in effect when the statute was enacted. See <em>Williams Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>232 Conn. 559, 580, 657 A.2d 212 (1995) (citing cases from variety of contexts since 1980 wherein \u201c[w]e have consistently held that reasonableness is a question of fact for the trier to determine based on all of the circumstances\u201d); see also, e.g., <em>Alvarez </em>v. <em>New Haven Register, Inc., </em>249 Conn. 709, 722, 735 A.2d 306 (1999) (\u201c[t]he legislature is presumed to be aware of this court\u2019s decisions\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kyles, </em>169 Conn. 438, 442, 363 A.2d 97 (1975) (\u201cit must be presumed that the legislature was aware of prior judicial decisions\u201d). There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>fore, in reviewing whether the trial court properly determined that the plaintiff was not (1) \u201cprovided a fair and reasonable disclosure of the amount, character and value of property, financial obligations and income of the other party\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (3); and (2) \u201cafforded a reasonable opportunity to consult with independent counsel\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (4); this court is reviewing questions of fact and must apply the clearly erroneous standard.

M. Loew\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Surabian, </em>146 Conn. 608, 612, 153 A.2d 463 (1959) (\u201c \u2018[Reasonable\u2019 is a relative term which varies in the context in which it is used, and its meaning may be affected by the facts of the particular controversy\u201d). In this particular context, we have noted that, \u201c[u]nder ordinary circumstances, parties to an ante-nuptial agreement do not deal at arm\u2019s length; they stand in a relationship of mutual confidence that calls for the exercise of good faith, candor and sincerity in all matters bearing upon the agreement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>supra, 181 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>487; cf. <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Weinstein, </em>275 Conn. 671, 686, 882 A.2d 53 (2005) (describing long-standing policy of requiring detailed financial disclosure to trial court in dissolution of marriage cases). Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s assessment of the fairness and reasonableness of the disclosure necessarily incorporated an evaluation of the statutory criteria in light of all the relevant circumstances, including: (1) the level of the plaintiffs financial sophistication; (2) the complexity of the disclosed information; and (3) the time that the plaintiff had to consider the disclosed information. I now consider the defendant\u2019s disclosure of the three statutorily mandated types of information, namely, his: \u201c[1] property, [2] financial obligations and [3] income . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The financial disclosure document attached to the agreement lists several assets that purportedly comprised the defendant\u2019s property. It does so, however, in cursory terms that fail to describe the nature of the property in any way whatsoever. As the trial court noted, the disclosure document simply lists thirty-one ambiguously labeled assets, giving no indication of how they were valued or, in some cases, what they truly are. For example, the disclosure document, which indicates the value of the defendant\u2019s holdings in \u201cESTIMATED VALUE (000\u2019s),\u201d lists, inter alia, the following assets of the defendant: \u201cOmstein Leyton Reality, Inc. Real Estate Venture,\u201d to which is assigned a value of \u201c85,\u201d and \u201cRosehill Capital Management Rosehill Japan Fund L.P.,\u201d to which is assigned a value of \u201c350.\u201d Similarly, under the broad category of \u201cBankers Trust Co. Employee Plans,\u201d the defendant\u2019s disclosure document fists three assets totaling \u201c430\u201d without explaining what those assets, which are labeled \u201cBT Partnershare Account,\u201d \u201cBT Coinvestment Plan\u201d and \u201cBT Partnership Equity Plan,\u201d actually constitute. The disclosure document is similarly vague with regard to the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>liabilities. Indeed, the only liability listed by the defendant was \u201cLess Tax (40%)\u201d in the amount of \u201c578\u201d under the heading \u201cBT Equity Participation Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Furthermore, although the final agreement signed by the plaintiff listed the defendant\u2019s income for the year 1997 as $2,300,000, the draft agreement and the defendant\u2019s financial disclosure document that had been received by the plaintiffs attorney on November 6,1998, did not contain <em>any </em>statement regarding the defendant\u2019s income. Additionally, the income stated on the final agreement was not itemized, and provided the plaintiff with no way of assessing its source or consistency. To the extent that the agreement can be construed as having disclosed the defendant\u2019s income, it did so only twenty-four hours before the wedding took place, leaving the plaintiff little time to evaluate that disclosure or take any other action to protect her interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Additionally, the trial court made significant findings regarding the plaintiffs financial inexperience.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>cally, the trial court found that the plaintiff possessed only a high school education, \u201chad no knowledge of Connecticut marriage and divorce laws, inheritance rights, spousal share upon death, forms of joint or sole real property ownership, qualified domestic relations orders, tax-deferred annuities, individual retirement plans, etc.\u201d The trial court further found that the parties \u201ckept their finances completely separated, \u201d and \u201cdid not talk of money issues.\u201d I acknowledge that the plaintiff is charged with knowledge of the financial information sent to her attorney on November 6,1998. See <em>Lafayette Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>177 Conn. 137, 140, 411 A.2d 937 (1979) (\u201c[t]he knowledge and admissions of an attorney are imputed to his client\u201d); see also <em>Dornemann </em>v. <em>Dornemann, </em>48 Conn. Sup. 502, 511, 850 A.2d 273 (1979) (\u201c[t]he actual review of the financial disclosure by each party is not mandated by the statute\u201d). Even if we were to assume, for the sake of argument, its effectiveness with regard to the defendant\u2019s assets and liabilities, the disclosure made on that date did not contain any statement of the defendant\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Furthermore, even if the financial disclosure document the defendant sent to Foley on November 6,1998, had contained this information, it is unlikely that the plaintiff would have been able adequately to evaluate it in the short time provided. Accordingly, given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>trial court\u2019s findings, the scope and timing of the disclosure raise serious doubts that \u201cthe parties were aware of their legal rights and their respective assets and liabilities, and proceeded by the agreement to alter those rights in a fair and voluntary manner.\u201d <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 488. I, therefore, conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding of inadequate disclosure finds evidentiary support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Similarly, with regard to the second aspect of the clearly erroneous test, namely, whether \u201calthough there is evidence to support [the trial court\u2019s finding], the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Carmel Hollow Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 149; I also cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding of unreasonable financial disclosure was clearly erroneous. Indeed, the record does contain <em>some evidence </em>supporting the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff received adequate financial disclosure. Specifically, the total net worth listed on the financial disclosure document attached to the agreement presented a facially accurate portrayal of the defendant\u2019s assets at the time of the marriage, and both it and the agreement were in Foley\u2019s possession four days before the plaintiff consulted him. Additionally, the defendant presented evidence at trial that the plaintiff had worked with the defendant, was familiar with his compensation, had observed his income tax information on several occasions, and oversaw the renovation of his considerable Westport home.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Nevertheless, it is well established that, on appeal, \u201c[w]e cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>275 Conn. 348, 359, 880 A.2d 872 (2005). Consequently, although evidence exists in the record supporting both parties\u2019 positions, <em>considering the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>record in its </em>entirety, I am not left with the definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a mistake in finding that the defendant did not meet the statutory standard of fair and reasonable disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Because a signatory to a prenuptial agreement relinquishes significant legal rights, it is imperative that the \u201cterms and the circumstances surrounding [the agreement\u2019s] execution are such as to demonstrate that the parties were aware of their legal rights and their respective assets and liabilities, and proceeded by the agreement to alter those rights in a fair and voluntary manner.\u201d <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 488. I, therefore, conclude that, under the facts of the present case, in which an unsophisticated plaintiff facing the looming prospect of illegal-alien status was presented with an ambiguous financial disclosure document shortly before her wedding, the trial court\u2019s finding of unreasonable financial disclosure was not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court, therefore, correctly determined that the agreement was unenforceable under \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (3). Accordingly, I now turn to the defendant\u2019s remaining claims, only one of which requires any consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Because I would conclude that the agreement is unenforceable, I must consider the merits of the defendant\u2019s second claim with respect to the trial court\u2019s orders regarding the distribution of marital property. Specifically, the defendant contends, despite the statutory criteria governing the distribution of marital property; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that the trial court improperly began its analysis with a presumption that all property obtained during the marriage should be divided equally between the spouses. The trial court described the defendant\u2019s assets as follows: \u201cThe defendant owns a 40 percent capital interest in [Lydian Capital Advisors, LLC (LCA)]. The nonmarketable equity value of his interest is $1,187,967. . . . [LCA\u2019s] income from operations has grown exponentially in each year of operation and continues to grow as the amount of assets under management has grown. In the year 2000, the income was negative at ($194,638). In 2001, the income was $77,664; in 2002, $400,069; in 2003, $5,951,763. The defendant\u2019s income interest is 64.62 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u201c[LCA] is the general partner of [Lydian Asset Management, L.P. (LAM)] and has a 14.32 percent capital ownership interest in [LAM]. The defendant has a direct 64.04 percent capital ownership interest in [LAM]. . . . [T]he defendant\u2019s current capital ownership interest in [LAM] is $1,684,584. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\u201cIn addition to his capital ownership interest in [LAM], the defendant has deferred performance fees for the years 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003. The amount deferred in 2000, was $4,200,000; in 2001, $10,475,721; in 2002, $3,739,537; and in 2003, $5,023,107. The deferred compensation investments have increased in value to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>a present total of $38,668,639. The investments are on a ten year deferral schedule. . . . After application of a price/net asset discount of 7 percent and a further application of a discount of 35 percent for lack of marketability, the gross value today of the defendant\u2019s deferred compensation is $23,375,192. . . . [The defendant\u2019s interest has] a current after-tax value of $13,370,610. The defendant\u2019s capital ownership interest and deferred compensation moneys at [LAM] are together worth $15,055,194 today in after-tax dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u201cThe defendant [also] owns 75 percent of [Frisa I, LLC (Frisa)]. The sole asset of [Frisa] is commercial property in Westport, Connecticut. The fair market value of the property is $3,800,000. With a mortgage of $3,312,920, the net value is $487,080. [Frisa] also has cash on hand of $166,035 and miscellaneous small assets and debts. . . . [T]he defendant\u2019s current equity value in [Frisa] is $397,835.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The trial court concluded its findings regarding the defendant\u2019s assets, stating: \u201cThe defendant owned assets valued at $6,576,000 at the outset of the marriage. Although certain stock options and equity participation assets totaling almost one million dollars were sacrificed when the defendant left employment at Bankers Trust [International PLC], a portion of the defendant\u2019s lump sum separation package in 1999, recognized the loss of those benefits. The current after-tax value of the defendant\u2019s interest in the three hedge fund entities totals $17,137,613. The value of the real property at 9 Brookside Drive, Westport, Connecticut is $3,500,000. The apartment at 315 East 68th Street in New York City is worth $800,000. The condominium unit in Fort Lauderdale, Florida has a net equity of $100,000. Bank accounts total $40,164. Cars, motorcycles, the yacht and a snowmobile are valued at $88,041. Securities and bonds are worth $1,145,560. The defendant has 401(k) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>accounts of $385,859. The total is $22,700,624. He also has accumulated frequent flier mileage, furnishings in his real properties, and jewelry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The trial court continued, stating: \u201cThe court has considered all the criteria of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-56, 46b-56c, 46b-62, 46b-81, 46b-82 and 46b-84 in light of the evidence presented. Each of these parties performed the role that each contracted to perform in this marital partnership. If each party fulfilled his or her part of the bargain, the contribution of each party should be worth one half of the paid compensation received during the marriage. This is so even though no wages were paid for the plaintiffs services. <em>Beginning with the premise that the worth of the contribution of eachparty in a marriage of equals is of equal dollar value, </em>the criteria of the General Statutes must be applied. The defendant in this case enjoys substantial advantages over the plaintiff in the areas of occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability and opportunity for future acquisition of capital assets and income. The length of the marriage is relatively short. It is appropriate to preserve for the defendant the advantage in assets that he held over the plaintiff at the outset of the marriage.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Additionally, at the conclusion of the trial, the court engaged in the following colloquy with defense counsel: \u201c[The Court]: . . . Isn\u2019t it all relative? I mean, let\u2019s say that, during the marriage, all that they saved was forty thousand dollars and it was all in his IRA. Wouldn\u2019t she be entitled to twenty thousand of it?</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: No. It\u2019s not a community property state, Your Honor. This is equitable distribution. The court has to consider all\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\u201c[The Court]: And a contract, which is essentially a fifty-fifty deal. Marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, not in this state, Your Honor, in all due respect. It is not a contract fifty-fifty. It is not \u2014 you don\u2019t divide the assets fifty-fifty. This is not community property.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u201c[The Court]: It\u2019s not community property, but why don\u2019t we start with that as a marriage between equals and a contractual arrangement in which they have their different roles that they each perform?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I think that\u2019s the legislature to make that finding. That is not the law. Equitable distribution is not the same as community property. In a short-term marriage\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u201c[The Court]: I agree, but what makes for equitable distribution? You\u2019re saying that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: The statute criteria [\u00a7] 46b-81. [A litigant in another dissolution of marriage case] came before this court \u2014 before Judge Tierney \u2014 on a thirty-two year marriage and demonstrated that she was there from age twenty-two \u2014 whatever it was, Your Honor\u2014 helping support her husband when he had nothing to the point where he was at [General Electric Corporation] and, out of a hundred million dollars, she got twenty million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">\u201c[The Court]: Possibly a travesty. You\u2019re dealing with a different judge. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">\u201c[The Court]: And you have to convince me that the work that \u2014 in this case for example \u2014 the wife has done in the household is worth less than half of the assets, and I haven\u2019t heard that argument \u2014 I mean, I haven\u2019t heard anything convincing as to why her efforts \u2014 you said, that isn\u2019t worth so many millions, and I\u2019m not sure I heard why.\u201d On the basis of the foregoing findings, the trial court ordered that the defendant pay the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>tiff the previously mentioned $8,220,000 property award.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">I note that \u201c[o]ur standard of review in domestic relations cases is a very narrow one,\u201d and, generally, \u201c[w]e will not reverse a trial court\u2019s rulings with regard to custody and financial orders unless the court incorrectly applied the law or could not reasonably have concluded as it did.\u201d <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>207 Conn. 217, 225, 541 A.2d 1201 (1988). Nevertheless, \u201c[although it is well established that trial courts have broad equitable remedial powers regarding marital dissolutions ... it is equally well settled that [c]ourts have no inherent power to transfer property from one spouse to another; instead, that power must rest upon an enabling statute. . . . Thus, the court\u2019s authority to transfer property appurtenant to a dissolution proceeding requires an interpretation of the relevant statutes. Statutory construction, in turn, presents a question of law over which our review is plenary.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>249 Conn. 265, 272, 752 A.2d 1023 (1999). Accordingly, because the trial court\u2019s judgment was predicated upon its construction of \u00a7 46b-81 as incorporating a presumption of equal distribution, I review that aspect of the trial court\u2019s order de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The distribution of marital property is governed by \u00a7 46b-81, which provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) At the time of entering a decree . . . dissolving a marriage . . . the Superior Court may assign to either the hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>band or wife all or any part of the estate of the other. . . . (c) In fixing the nature and value of the property, if any, to be assigned, the court, after hearing the witnesses, if any, of each party . . . shall consider the length of the marriage, the causes for the . . . dissolution of the marriage . . . the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income. The court shall also consider the contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition, preservation or appreciation in value of their respective estates.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Furthermore, although this court has not previously had occasion to discuss the present issue, the Appellate Court addressed it comprehensively in <em>Wendt </em>v. <em>Wendt, </em>59 Conn. App. 656, 680-88, 757 A.2d 1225, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 918, 763 A.2d 1044 (2000). Notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s negative characterization of <em>Wendt, </em>which constituted binding precedent on it, I find the Appellate Court\u2019s reasoning therein highly persuasive. In <em>Wendt, </em>the Appellate Court stated: \u201cIt is well settled that a statute must be applied as its words direct. . . . [Section] 46b-81 (c) directs the court to consider numerous separately listed criteria. No language of presumption is contained in the statute. Indeed, \u00a7 46b-81 (a) permits the farthest reaches from an equal division as is possible, allowing the court to assign to either the husband or wife all or any part of the estate of the other. . . . The claimed equal division presumption is not part of the statutory criteria. On the basis of the plain language of \u00a7 46b-81, there is no presumption in Connecticut that marital property should be divided equally prior to applying the statutory criteria.\u201d (Cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>tion omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 682. The court in <em>Wendt </em>continued, stating: \u201cAllowing the plaintiffs argument to persuade us would be, in effect, to write a community property law by judicial fiat. ... In sum, in the absence of specific statutory language, there is no presumption of an equal property distribution in Connecticut. The legislative intent is to be found, not in what the legislature intended to say, but in the meaning of what it did say. . . . We must construe a statute without reference to whether we feel that it might be improved by adding to it or interpreting it differently. ... It is our duty to apply the law, not to make it.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 683. Furthermore, in addition to the Appellate Court\u2019s comprehensive language based analysis, I note that no support for the trial court\u2019s presumption of equal distribution exists in the statute\u2019s voluminous legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The plaintiff agrees that there is no presumption, under \u00a7 46b-81, that marital property should be divided equally. She contends, nonetheless, that the trial court did not apply such a presumption, but merely divided the property fifty-fifty after applying the statutory criteria. In the alternative, the plaintiff argues that the trial court\u2019s conclusion constituted harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In light of the trial court\u2019s oral statements and memorandum of decision, however, the plaintiffs first contention is untenable. Moreover, the plaintiff does not ask this court to disavow <em>Wendt, </em>and I would apply the Appellate Court\u2019s persuasive reasoning in <em>Wendt </em>as the governing law in the present case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Additionally, the plaintiffs alternative argument, that the trial court\u2019s improper presumption was harmless, also lacks merit. In a civil case, an error is harmful if it likely affected the outcome at trial. <em>Pagano </em>v. <em>Ippoliti, </em>245 Conn. 640, 651, 716 A.2d 848 (1998). The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision and dialogue with defense counsel indicate that the court considered the presumption significant and based its decision, at least in part, on the defendant\u2019s inability to rebut the presumption. Under the circumstances, \u201c[w]e cannot say, with any certainty, whether the trial court would have ruled the way that it did in the absence of such [a presumption] . . . .\u201d <em>In re Samantha C., </em>268 Conn. 614, 675, 847 A.2d 883 (2004) (trial court\u2019s improper drawing of adverse inference for failure to testify in termination of parental rights case was not harmless error). Furthermore, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>axiomatic that \u201c[t]he issues involving financial orders are entirely interwoven. The rendering of a judgment in a complicated dissolution case is a carefully crafted mosaic, each element of which may be dependent on the other.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 354. I, therefore, conclude that the trial court\u2019s use of an improper presumption when distributing the marital property affected the outcome at trial and, accordingly, was not harmless error.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion in this case. For all of the foregoing reasons, I would, therefore, reverse the judgment as to the financial orders only and remand the case for a new hearing on the remaining issues according to law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-7\"> The agreement provided that, in the event the marriage ended in divorce, in addition to providing a residence for the plaintiff and the parlies\u2019 child, the defendant would pay to the plaintiff an amount corresponding to the length of the period in which the parties lived together as husband and wife, set forth as follows: \u201cIf the [pjeriod is less than 2 full years, the sum of <em>$150,000 </em>...

If the [pjeriod is 10 years or more, the sum shall be $1,000,000, plus $200,000 for each two full years in excess of 10 years, not to exceed the sum of $3,000,000 for 30 full years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\"> The majority opinion provides only the text of \u00a7 46b-36g (a). See parts III and IV of the majority opinion. I believe that the remainder of \u00a7 46b-36g, particularly subsection (c), sheds light on the appropriate standard of review. The full text of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g provides: \u201c(a) A premarital agreement or amendment shall not be enforceable if the party against whom enforcement is sought proves that:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u201c(1) Such party did not execute the agreement voluntarily; or</p>\n<p id=\"Ajh\">\u201c(2) The agreement was unconscionable when it was executed or when enforcement is sought; or</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">\u201c(3) Before execution of the agreement, such party was not provided a fair and reasonable disclosure of the amount, character and value of property, financial obligations and income of the other party; or</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">\u201c(4) Such party was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult with independent counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">\u201c(b) If aprovision of apremarital agreement modifies or eliminates spousal support and such modification or elimination causes one party to the agreement to be eligible for support under a program of public assistance at the time of separation or marital dissolution, a court, notwithstanding the terms of the agreement, may require the other party to provide support to the extent necessary to avoid such eligibility-</p>\n<p id=\"AcT\">\u201c(c) An issue of unconscionability of a premarital agreement shall be decided by the court as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b234-6\"> The majority opinion provides only the text of subsection (a) of \u00a7 6 of the uniform act. See footnote 22 of the majority opinion. I believe that the remainder of the section, and particularly subsection (c), is relevant to determining the applicable standard of review. Section 6 of the uniform act provides: \u201c(a) A premarital agreement is not enforceable if the party against whom enforcement is sought proves that:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u201c(1) that party did not execute the agreement voluntarily; or</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">\u201c(2) the agreement was unconscionable when it was executed and, before execution of the agreement, that party:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\u201c(i) was not provided a fair and reasonable disclosure of the property or financial obligations of the other party;</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">\u201c(ii) did not voluntarily and expressly waive, in writing, any right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>disclosure of the property or financial obligations of the other party beyond the disclosure provided; and</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u201c(iii) did not have, or reasonably could not have had, an adequate knowledge of the property or financial obligations of the other party.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u201c(b) If aprovision of apremarital agreement modifies or eliminates spousal support and that modification or elimination causes one party to the agreement to be eligible for support under a program of public assistance at the time of separation or marital dissolution, a court, notwithstanding the terms of the agreement, may require the other party to provide support to the extent necessary to avoid that eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">\u201c(c) An issue of unconscionability of a premarital agreement shall be decided by the court as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b236-6\"> I note that the genealogy and history of \u00a7 46b-36g illustrate the importance the legislature assigned to the disclosure of pertinent financial information. In its original proposed form, \u00a7 46b-36g provided in relevant part: \u201cA premarital agreement or amendment shall not be enforceable if the party against whom enforcement is sought proves that . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u201c(3) Before execution of the agreement, such party: (A) Was not provided a fair and reasonable disclosure of the amount, character, and value of property, financial obligations and income of the other party; <em>and </em>(B) Did not voluntarily and expressly waive, in writing, any right to disclosure of the property, financial obligations and income of the other party beyond the disclosure provided; <em>and </em>(C) Did not have, or reasonably could not have had, an adequate knowledge of the property, financial obligations and income of the other party, and of the legal rights which that party would relinquish under the agreement . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Substitute House Bill No. 6932, \u00a7 6 (a) (3). Clearly, the conjunctive test set forth in the original version of \u00a7 46b-36g required that a divorcing spouse prove two elements in addition to unfair or unreasonable financial disclosure, namely, both lack of a written waiver of financial disclosure, which the prudent drafter always would include in the agreement, and lack of actual knowledge of the other spouse\u2019s finances. The statute as enacted, which requires only that a spouse demonstrate that he or she was not provided fair and reasonable financial disclosure, is not nearly so onerous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\"> The majority acknowledges the lack of definition in this context, and then proceeds directly to the case law of sister jurisdictions that have enacted similar provisions based on the uniform act. Although ordinarily it may be proper to turn to such decisions; see <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>186 Conn. 404, 408, 441 A.2d 841 (1982) (\u201c[when an] act is a uniform law, decisions from other states are valuable for the interpretation of its provisions\u201d); I do not find it proper in this instance, wherein our legislature has adopted a modified version of the uniform act.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">I acknowledge that, when analyzing claims of unfair financial disclosure, sister state courts often have confined their inquiry to whether the information disclosed was accurate, rather than the circumstances under which it was made available. See, e.g., <em>In re Estate of Lopata, </em>641 P.2d 952, 955 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>(Colo. 1982) (\u201c[f]air disclosure contemplates that each spouse should be given information, of a general and approximate nature, concerning the net worth of the other\u201d); <em>Darr </em>v. <em>Darr, </em>950 S.W.2d 867, 870-71 (Mo. App. 1997) (analyzing mathematical accuracy of disclosure); <em>In re Estate of Hartman, </em>399 Pa. Super. 386, 390-91, 582 A.2d 648 (1990) (fair and reasonable disclosure provision refers to accurate portrayal of net worth and information on applicable statutory rights). This distinction, however, largely appears to have been necessitated by the structure of the uniform act, \u00a7 6 (a), which, unlike \u00a7 46b-36g, explicitly requires thataparty demonstrate both unconscionability <em>and </em>unreasonable financial disclosure. Compare footnote 2 of this opinion with footnote 3 of this opinion. Accordingly, the bulk of the factors that I otherwise would consider as part of an inquiry into the reasonableness of financial disclosure must, necessarily, be considered by other jurisdictions in the evaluation of unconscionability. I conclude to the contrary that, as I have explained, our statute, by separately mandating fair and reasonable disclosure of financial information, requires a much more fact sensitive inquiry, going beyond the facial accuracy of the disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b239-6\"> As the majority indicates in part IV of its opinion, the trial court was not entirely clear in its reasons for invalidating the agreement. Although the trial court specifically quoted from the language of subdivisions (3) and (4) of \u00a7 46b-36g (a), it also stated that the plaintiff did not \u201cknowingly\u201d waive her rights based on the \u201ctiming of the [defendant\u2019s] disclosure\u201d of his finances. I agree that this language suggests that the trial court also considered the voluntariness of the plaintiffs signature on the agreement in holding it to be unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court improperly considered the timing of the signing of the agreement when it performed an analysis under \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (3). The majority states that \u201c[i]t is well established that the amount of time available to review a prenuptial agreement is relevant in assessing whether the agreement was voluntary, or signed under duress, but not in determining whether the parties made a \u2018fair and reasonable\u2019 disclosure of their financial circumstances.\u201d Although \u00a7 46b-36g (a) lists four reasons for invalidating a premarital agreement, I decline to read the subdivisions of the statute as mutually exclusive, in the sense that facts relevant to one inquiry cannot also be relevant to the others. Rather, I note that in many situations, the subdivisions of \u00a7 46b-36g (a) may overlap, so that facts relevant to one will also be relevant to others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\"> I agree with the majority\u2019s statement that \u201cthe time has come for paternalistic presumptions and protections to be discarded.\u201d Indeed, the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>financial status before she married the defendant shows an admirable ability to manage her own finances. My review of this case, however, is under the clearly erroneous standard, and the trial court\u2019s factual findings specifically consider the disparity in business knowledge between the two parties. Because the trial court had the opportunity directly to assess and to judge the credibility of the witnesses in this case, I am. bound by its factual findings in my review. See, e.g., <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>275 Conn. 348, 359, 880 A.2d 872 (2005) (\u201c[I]t is axiomatic that [t]he trial court\u2019s [factual] findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. ... We cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b242-8\"> I need not address the question of whether the plaintiff was afforded an adequate opportunity to consult with independent counsel pursuant to \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (4) because my agreement with the trial court\u2019s determination that the plaintiff did not receive fair and reasonable financial disclosure by itself renders the agreement unenforceable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b243-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) At the time of entering a decree annulling or dissolving a marriage or for legal separation pursuant to a complaint under section 46b-45, the Superior Court may assign to either the husband or wife all or any part of the estate of the other. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\u201c(c) In fixing the nature and value of the property, if any, to be assigned, the court . . . shall consider the length of the marriage, the causes for the annulment, dissolution of the marriage or legal separation, the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income. The court shall also consider the contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition, preservation or appreciation in value of their respective estates.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\"> As the defendant indicates in his brief, the trial court\u2019s award reflects its presumption of a fifty-fifty distribution of marital property.

The trial court then \u201cpreserve[d] for the defendant the advantage in assets that he held over the plaintiff at the outset of the marriage, \u201d and, apparently, divided the remaining $16,124,624 worth of marital property approximately in half to arrive at its award of $8,220,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b248-6\"> \u201cThis approach to property division is commonly referred to as an \u2018all-property\u2019 equitable distribution scheme.\u201d <em>Krafick </em>v. <em>Krafick, </em>234 Conn. 783, 792, 663 A.2d 365 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\"> I note also that <em>Wendt </em>is consistent with the rule in other equitable distribution jurisdictions. See, e.g., <em>Toth v. Toth, </em>190 Ariz. 218, 221, 946 P.2d 900 (1997) (\u201cthe legislature\u2019s intent that the division be equitable, not equal, is clearly evidenced by the legislative history of the dissolution statute\u201d); <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Burwell, </em>700 A.2d 219, 223 (D.C. App. 1997) (\u201c[t]he divorce law contains no presumption in favor of an equal distribution of property; instead, it requires the court to divide the marital property \u2018in a manner that is equitable, just and reasonable\u2019 \u201d); <em>Gussin </em>v. <em>Gussin, </em>73 Haw. 470, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>479, 836 P.2d 484 (1992) (\u201c[t]here is ... no fixed rule for determining the amount of property to be awarded each spouse in a divorce action other than as set forth in [the Hawaii statute]\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Luedke </em>v. <em>Luedke, </em>487 N.E.2d 133, 134 (Ind. 1985) (\u201cto require ... a rebuttable presumption of a \u2018fifty-fifty\u2019 split and require any variance to be supported by particular findings of fact, is to put an artificial structure on the fact-finding process which may very well impinge the trial judge\u2019s ability to openly weigh all the facts and circumstances, giving equal regard to all of them\u201d); <em>Patricia B. </em>v. <em>Steven B., </em>186 App. Div. 2d 609, 611, 588 N.Y.S.2d 874 (1992) (\u201cthere is no basis in law for beginning an analysis concerning a business or a professional practice with a presumption that the parties must divide such an asset on an equal basis subject to modification after due consideration of the factors enumerated in [the New York statute]\u201d); <em>Fratangelo </em>v. <em>Fratangelo, </em>360 Pa. Super. 487, 502, 520 A.2d 1195 (1987) (Disapproving of fifty-fifty presumption and stating: \u201cThe starting point is unequivocally the consideration of all relevant [statutory] factors. This requires compilation, computation, weighing and balancing considerations, and then applying the sound discretion of the court to achieve economic justice.\u201d); <em>Shackelford </em>v. <em>Shackelford, </em>39 Va.
