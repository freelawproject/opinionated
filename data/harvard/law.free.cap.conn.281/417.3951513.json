App. 39, 45-46, 879 A.2d 911 (2005). We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The record reveals the following stipulated facts and procedural history. On or about June 5, 2002, the plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant, a Connecticut corporation and licensed dealer of motor vehicles, to purchase a 2001 Chrysler 300M. The contract included a \u201c \u2018dealer conveyance fee\u2019 \u201d of $299, which was disclosed on the purchase order. That pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>chase order also disclosed, in ten point bold type, that \u201c \u2018THE DEALER CONVEYANCE \u201cFEE\u201d IS NOT PAYABLE TO THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiff signed the purchase order, and the defendant accepted it, thus completing the sale and transfer of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff, a resident of Connecticut who has proposed to represent the class of persons who had purchased motor vehicles from the defendant, brought this class action. He claims that the defendant\u2019s $299 conveyance fee violated \u00a7 14-62 because it exceeded the reasonable costs for processing all documentation and performing costs related to closing the sales of motor vehicles. The plaintiff also claims that this breach of \u00a7 14-62 was a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., and seeks compensatory and punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">After the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to strike, the parties jointly requested that the trial court reserve the underlying question of law involved herein for the advice of the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-235 and Practice Book \u00a7 73-1. Thereafter, the trial court granted the parties\u2019 request, and sought advice from the Appellate Court on the issue of whether \u201c\u00a7 14-62 of the General Statutes regulate[s] the amount that a motor vehicle dealer may charge as a dealer conveyance fee, such that a court may determine that the statute is violated if the amount charged is not reasonable in light of the dealer\u2019s reasonable costs for processing all documentation and performing services related to the closing of the sale of the vehicle?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The Appellate Court answered the reserved question in the negative. See <em>Small </em>v. <em>Going Forward, Inc., </em>supra, 91 Conn. App. 46. The Appellate Court concluded that \u00a7 14-62 (a) is plain and unambiguous, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>\u201c [cheating an obligation for dealers to disclose certain information in both the order and the invoice is [its] unmistakable and primary purpose . . . .\u201d Id., 44. The Appellate Court concluded that the use of the word \u201creasonable\u201d in the statute does not substantively limit the amount that a dealer can charge as a conveyance fee, because it is a definition that, \u201c[r]ead in context . . . relates only to the dealer\u2019s duty to disclose the fee. This definitional language defines the terms used in the primary, or substantive, parts of the statute. There is no indication that it gives rise to a separate obligation.\u201d Id., 45; see also id., 46 (\u201c[i]t appears that, here, the definition of fees, as the \u2018reasonable costs\u2019 related to the closing of the sale, is meant to explain what information must be disclosed\u201d). This certified appeal followed. See footnote 2 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>State, </em>278 Conn. 77, 82, 896 A.2d 747 (2006). \u201cThe test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alexson </em>v. <em>Foss, </em>276 Conn. 599, 605, 887 A.2d 872 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">We begin with the determination that our inquiry in the present case may be informed by extratextual sources because the thoughtful arguments of the parties and the amicus curiae, the state of Connecticut, demonstrate that the relevant statutory language is subject to more than one \u201creasonable interpretation.\u201d The plaintiff, supported by the amicus, contends that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that \u00a7 14-62 merely imposes a disclosure obligation and is not a substantive limitation on the amount that a car dealership may charge as a conveyance fee. Specifically, the plaintiff emphasizes that the Appellate Court\u2019s reading of the statute renders meaningless the word \u201creasonable\u201d in the definition of conveyance fees in subsection (a) (9) of \u00a7 14-62, and also is inconsistent with subsection (c) of \u00a7 14-62, which requires dealerships to reduce conveyance fees by a \u201cproportional amount\u201d when their customers register their cars for themselves. The plaintiff and the amicus also contend that the Appellate Court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 14-62 raises the specter of dealerships luring customers with the promise of low prices, and then subjecting them to inflated conveyance fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In response, the defendant contends that \u00a7 14-62 is plainly and unambiguously<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a disclosure statute, and not a substantive limitation on conveyance fees. The defendant relies on the statute\u2019s title, and the definitional, rather than regulatory, nature of the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>language at issue. The defendant also disagrees with the plaintiffs reading of \u00a7 14-62 (c), and claims that, if the legislature had intended to regulate conveyance fees, it would have used specific mandatory language doing so. Finally, the defendant notes that customers wishing to avoid high conveyance fees are free to take their business to other dealerships, or to reduce those fees by handling the registration paperwork by themselves. We agree with the defendant that \u00a7 14-62 does not impose a reasonable cost limitation on the amount that an automobile dealer may charge as a conveyance fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We begin with the relevant statutory language. Section 14-62 (a), the subsection specifically at issue in this appeal, requires that each motor vehicle \u201csale shall be evidenced by an order properly signed by both the buyer and seller, a copy of which shall be furnished to the buyer when executed, and an invoice upon delivery of the motor vehicle, both of which shall contain the following information: (1) Make of vehicle; (2) year of model, whether sold as new or used, and on invoice the identification number; (3) deposit, and (A) if the deposit is not refundable, the words \u2018No Refund of Deposit\u2019 shall appear at this point, and (B) if the deposit is conditionally refundable, the words \u2018Conditional Refund of Deposit\u2019 shall appear at this point, followed by a statement giving the conditions for refund, and (C) if the deposit is unconditionally refundable, the words \u2018Unconditional Refund\u2019 shall appear at this point; (4) cash selling price; (5) finance charges, and (A) if these charges do not include insurance, the words \u2018No Insurance\u2019 shall appear at this point, and (B) if these charges include insurance, a statement shall appear at this point giving the exact type of coverage; (6) allowance on motor vehicle traded in, if any, and description of the same; (7) stamped or printed in a size equal to at least ten-point bold type on the face of both order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>and invoice one of the following forms: (A) \u2018This motor vehicle not guaranteed\u2019, or (B) \u2018This motor vehicle is guaranteed\u2019, followed by a statement as to the terms of such guarantee, which statement shall not apply to household furnishings of any trailer; (8) if the motor vehicle is new but has been subject to use by the seller or use in connection with his business as a dealer, the word \u2018demonstrator\u2019 shall be clearly displayed on the face of both order and invoice; (9) <em>any dealer conveyance fee or processing fee and a statement that such fee is not payable to the state of Connecticut printed in at least ten-point bold type on the face of both order and invoice. For the purposes of this subdivision, \u2018dealer conveyance fee\u2019 or \u2018processing fee\u2019 means afee charged by a dealer to recover reasonable costs for processing all documentation and performing services related to the closing of a sale, including, but not limited to, the registration and transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle which is the subject of the sale.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The plaintiffs reading of \u00a7 14-62 (a), namely, that, \u201c[i]f the legislature intended the statute to be strictly one of disclosure, then it would not have been necessary to include the term \u2018reasonable\u2019 within the definition,\u201d has initial appeal in light of the statutory language standing alone and in view of the \u201cbasic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature [does] not intend to enact meaningless provisions. . . . [I]n construing statutes, we presume that there is a purpose behind every sentence, clause, or phrase used in an act and that no part of a statute is superfluous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, </em>278 Conn. 326, 335, 898 A.2d 170 (2006). The plaintiff also notes correctly that \u00a7 14-62 is a consumer protection statute that, like CUTPA, is remedial in nature and is, therefore, liberally construed in favor of those the legislature intended to benefit. See, e.g., <em>Eder </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Wine Merchants of Connecticut, Inc., </em>275 Conn. 363, 379, 880 A.2d 138 (2005). The plaintiffs view is, however, based on a superficial reading of only one subsection of the statute, along with two maxims of statutory construction read in isolation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A closer reading of \u00a7 14-62, related statutes and the legislative history leads us to the conclusion that \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) is a disclosure rule and not a substantive limitation on the amount that dealers may charge as a conveyance fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The primary problem with the plaintiffs reading of \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) is that it is undermined by the language of that clause viewed in the context of the rest of the subsection, as well as the chapter as a whole.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>of the language at issue in its structural context demonstrates that it solely is definitional in nature, rather than regulatory or prohibitory. See <em>Toll Gate Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milk Regulation Board, </em>148 Conn. 341, 346, 170 A.2d 883 (1961) (statutory definition of \u201cskimmed milk\u201d that did not encompass nonskim, but low-fat milk bottled by plaintiff did not preclude sale of plaintiffs milk because that sale would be regulated by other statutory provision actually governing all milk sales);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> see also 1A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (6th Ed. Singer 2002) \u00a7\u00a7 20:2, 20:8 and 20:16 (distinguishing between various functions of component parts of statute, including definitions and standards of conduct). The subject of the mandatory language of \u00a7 14-62 is the content of the purchase order and invoice, as subsection (a) provides that each motor vehicle <em>\u201csale shall be evi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>denced </em>by an order properly signed by both the buyer and seller, a copy of which shall be furnished to the buyer when executed, and an invoice upon delivery of the motor vehicle, both of which <em>shall contain the following information . . </em>. any dealer conveyance fee or processing fee and a statement that such fee is not payable to the state of Connecticut printed in at least ten-point bold type on the face of both order and invoice.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Indeed, a review of other statutes, some of which are cited by the plaintiff in his reply brief, demonstrates that the legislature affirmatively has regulated fees with a reasonableness standard in other contexts, but has done so in the section of the statute actually governing substantive conduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 1-205 (i) (freedom of information commission \u201cshall make available to the public the printed reports of its decisions, opinions and related materials at a <em>reasonable cost </em>not to exceed the actual cost thereof to said commission but not less than twenty-eight dollars per item\u201d [emphasis added]); General Statutes \u00a7 4a-2b (department of administrative services \u201cmay charge the housing authorities a <em>reasonable fee </em>to provide for the administrative costs of the [master property and casualty insurance] program\u201d for government funded housing units [emphasis added]); General Statutes \u00a7 36a-785 (c) (The holder of an installment sales contract \u201cshall within three days of the retaking furnish or mail, by registered or certified mail, to the last known address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>of the buyer a written statement of the unaccelerated sum due under such contract and the actual and <em>reasonable </em>expense of any retaking and storing. For failure to furnish or mail such statement as required by this section, the holder of the contract shall forfeit the right to claim payment for the actual and reasonable expenses of retaking and storage . . . .\u201d [Emphasis added.]); see also General Statutes \u00a7 14-99h (c) (\u201cEach new car dealer, used car dealer or lessor shall charge <em>reasonable rates </em>for etching services and parts marking services rendered within the state pursuant to subsections [a] and [b] of this section and shall file a schedule of such rates with the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles not later than September first in each year. Each such dealer or lessor may from time to time file an amended schedule of such rates with the commissioner. No such dealer or lessor may charge any rate for such etching services or parts marking services which is greater than the rates contained in the most recent schedule filed with the commissioner.\u201d [Emphasis added.]); General Statutes \u00a7 42-423 (e) (\u201c[i]n addition to charges for excess wear and tear under chapter 743k, a consumer lease of a motor vehicle may provide for the imposition of a <em>reasonable charge </em>for excess mileage\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">That \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) is not a substantive limitation on the amount charged is further demonstrated by \u00a7 14-62 (c), which more specifically regulates conveyance fees. Section 14-62 (c) provides: \u201cEach dealer shall provide a written statement to the buyer or prominently display a sign in the area of his place of business in which sales are negotiated which shall specify the amount of any conveyance or processing fee charged by such dealer, the services performed by the dealer for such fee, that such fee is not payable to the state of Connecticut and that the buyer may elect, where appropriate, to submit the documentation required for the registration and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle which is the subject of the sale to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, in which case the dealer shall reduce such fee by a proportional amount. The Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall determine the size, typeface and arrangement of such information.\u201d Subsection (c) of \u00a7 14-62 is telling, because it indicates that the legislature did act affirmatively to regulate <em>some </em>aspects of the conveyance fee, while leaving the precise amount for the dealer to determine, so long as that fee is disclosed properly. Indeed, the directive of \u00a7 14-62 (c) providing that dealers shall reduce conveyance fees by a \u201cproportional amount\u201d for customers who elect to handle their own documentation is phrased in conduct regulating language, unlike the language of \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) relied on by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, the legislature\u2019s directive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>to the commissioner of motor vehicles to determine by regulation the proper size, typeface and arrangement of the disclosure information indicates that it also could have, if it desired, referred the question of any fee amount limitations to the commissioner for regulation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Moreover, General Statutes (Sup. 2006) \u00a7 14-64,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the chapter\u2019s general enforcement provision, provides fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ther indication that the legislature did not view \u00a7 14-62 as imposing a substantive limitation on conveyance fees. Although General Statutes (Sup. 2006) \u00a7 14-64 (1) contains a general catch-all provision allowing the commissioner to sanction a licensee if he or she finds that a licensee has \u201cviolated any provision of any statute or regulation of any state or any federal statute or regulation pertaining to its business as a licensee or has failed to comply with the terms of a final decision and order of any state department or federal agency concerning any such provision,\u201d that section also recites a litany of sanctionable specific actions, none of which include the charging of unreasonable conveyance fees. See footnote 10 of this opinion. Indeed, \u00a7 14-64 specifically mentions \u00a7 14-62, but only in the context of when a dealer \u201chas failed to fully execute or provide the buyer with (A) <em>an order as described in section 14-62, </em>(B) the properly assigned certificate of title, or (C) a temporary transfer or new issue of registration . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Sup. 2006) \u00a7 14-64 (7).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Finally, the only relevant comments in the legislative history provide no indication that the legislature intended \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) to regulate the amount that a dealer could charge as a conveyance fee, but rather, that it viewed the statute as an important disclosure measure designed to inform consumers about the optional nature of such fees.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 14-62 (a) (9) and (c) were enacted in 1998 as \u00a7 18 of No. 98-182 of the 1998 Public Acts. Speaking in support of that portion of the bill that ultimately was enacted as Public Act 98-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>182, Representative Jacqueline M. Coceo described it as \u201cactually a consumer protection piece [that] simply states that car dealers should let those buyers of their vehicles know that the dealer conveyance fee in ten point bold type what that dealer conveyance fee is and that it does [not] need [to] be paid by the purchaser of the vehicle, that they indeed can go to the Department of Motor Vehicle[s], do that paperwork themselves, and not be subject to that fee. And also to note that that money is not collected by the State nor none of it does go to the State.\u201d 41 H.R. Proc., Pt. 13, 1998 Sess., p. 4342. Similarly, Representative Kenneth P. Green commented: \u201cI really like some of the things [in] the bill. I\u2019m really glad that we\u2019re able to now have car dealerships make the public aware of the conveyance. I particularly had an incident where I was told that I had to pay the conveyance fee. I think the bill is in the right direction and that we\u2019re moving to let the public know that that\u2019s an optional fee.\u201d Id., pp. 4376-77. Our conclusion as to the limited scope of \u00a7 14-62, therefore, finds support in the legislative history because \u201c[statements of legislators often provide strong indication of legislative intent.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hatt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>263 Conn. 279, 313, 819 A.2d 260 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7 14-62 (a) imposes a disclosure obligation only, and is not a substantive limitation on the amount that a car dealer may charge as a \u201cconveyance fee.\u201d The Appellate Court, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>properly answered the reserved question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">In this opinion KATZ, PALMER, ZARELLA and SULLIVAN, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-62 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cEach sale shall be evidenced by an order properly signed by both the buyer and seller, a copy of which shall be furnished to the buyer when executed, and an invoice upon delivery of the motor vehicle, both of which shall contain the following information ...

Llewellyn, \u2018Remarks on the Theory of Appellate Decision and the Rules or Canons About How Statutes Are to Be Construed,\u2019 3 Vand. L. Rev. 395,401 (1950). The so-called \u2018canons\u2019 are not that, at least in the sense that any one of them reliably can be determined to apply or not to apply in any given case.

Code Ann., Transportation \u00a7 15-311.1 (b) (1) (Michie 2006) (\u201c[i]f a dealer charges a dealer processing charge, the charge: [i] <em>[s]hall be reasonable-, </em>[ii] [m]ay not exceed $100; and [iii] [s]hall reflect dealer expenses generally incurred for the services identified in subsection [a] [1] of this section\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b453-5\"> In our view, the dissent overemphasizes the import of \u00a7 14-62 (c), which it contends \u201cdemonstrates that the legislature . . . did not believe it was somehow barred from imposing a substantive obligation within a statute that has as its primary purpose requiring disclosure. Put another way, the fact that the dealer is required by the statute to reduce the fee by a proportional amount if the buyer elects to submit the documentation to the commissioner of motor vehicles himself indicates that the legislature did not intend for the primary purpose of \u00a7 14-62, requiring disclosure, to be its exclusive purpose.\u201d Although \u00a7 14-62 in its entirety is a comprehensive statute that has other substantive components beyond disclosure; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 14-62 (b) (\u201c[n]o dealer shall include in the selling price a dealer preparation charge for any item or service for which he is reimbursed by the manufacturer or any item or service not specifically ordered by the buyer and itemized on the invoice\u201d); the relevant language of \u00a7 14-62 (c) requires only that the reduction of the fee upon a buyer\u2019s self-registration reflect the significance of the vehicle registration and transfer of ownership activity to the dealer\u2019s calculation of the fee. Subsection (c) of \u00a7 14-62 cannot be read as a limitation on the outer limits of the fee itself because it does not address the other components of conveyance fees under the expansive definition of such fees under \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9), the statute that is the subject of this appeal. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) (defining such fees as one \u201ccharged by a dealer to recover reasonable costs for processing all documentation and performing services related to the closing of a sale, <em>including, but not limited to, </em>the registration and transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle which is the subject of the sale\u201d [emphasis added]). Thus, contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, subsection (c) of \u00a7 14-62 does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>necessarily indicate that the \u201clegislature intended the fee to reflect the dealer\u2019s cost of performance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\"> We also note that, notwithstanding the legislature\u2019s grant of authority to the commissioner of motor vehicles to \u201cmake, alter or repeal regulations governing the administration of all statutes relating to the license and business of dealers and repairers\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 14-63 (a); a review of the relevant regulations chapter indicates that the commissioner has not enacted procedural or substantive regulations governing the amount of such fees. This absence is even more telling in light of the fact that the commissioner has regulated with great specificity other aspects of the advertising and pricing of new motor vehicles. See, e.g., Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 42-110b-28 (b) (6) C\u201c[i]t shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a new car dealer or used car dealer to advertise the price for the sale of any motor vehicle unless the stated price in such advertisement includes the federal tax, the cost of delivery, dealer preparation and any other charges of any nature, except any state or local tax or registration fees\u201d); id., \u00a7 42-110b-28 (7) C\u201c[i]t shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a new car dealer or used car dealer to advertise in any manner the price which will be paid by such dealer for trade-in vehicles unless the price of the vehicle sold by such dealer to the owner of the trade-in vehicle is within the range of prices at which the dealer usually sells such vehicles and is not increased because of the amount paid for the trade-in vehicle\u201d); id., \u00a7 42-110b-28 (9) (\u201cpit shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a new car dealer or used car dealer to advertise in any manner that a range of prices [such as \u2018up to $500\u2019 or \u2018as much as $500\u2019] will be paid by such dealer for trade-in vehicles unless the advertisement clearly and conspicuously discloses the criteria [such as age, condition or mileage] which the dealer will use to determine the amount to be paid for a particular trade-in vehicle\u201d). This regulatory inaction by the agency charged with enforcing \u00a7 14-62 further supports our determination that the statute does not regulate the amount of conveyance fees charged by car dealerships.

Ct. 2655, 162 L. Ed. 2d 439 (2005). It also refutes the dissent\u2019s somewhat circular reliance on subsection (23) of \u00a7 42-110b-28(b) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which provides: \u201cIt shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a new car dealer or a used car dealer to violate any provision of a federal or state statute or regulation concerning the sale or lease of motor vehicles.\u201d See also General Statutes \u00a7 14-51a (\u201c[t]he commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>may, after notice and hearing, impose a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars on any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of sections 14-54 to 14-67a, inclusive\u201d); General Statutes (Sup. 2006) \u00a7 14-64 (\u201c[t]he commissioner may suspend or revoke the license or licenses of any licensee or impose a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars for each violation on any licensee or both, when, after notice and hearing, the commissioner finds that the licensee [1] has violated any provision of any statute or regulation of any state or any federal statute or regulation pertaining to its business as a licensee\u201d). Although the dissent states that it \u201cknow[s] of no principle that a regulation of general applicability somehow loses its force because it is not specific,\u201d the dissent\u2019s reliance on subsection (23) of \u00a7 42-110b-28 (b) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies is unpersuasive because it assumes the central issue in this case, namely, whether \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) governs the amount that a dealer may charge as a conveyance fee.

The dissent raises a similar concern, noting that \u201c[i]n the context of most car sales, the buyer does not ordinarily become interested in the conveyance fee until he has decided to buy the car,\u201d and that a buyer faced with a deal that includes a reduced vehicle price and an increased conveyance fee is \u201cfaced with walking away from the deal or accepting it, but if the buyer stays, there would be no regulatory or legal sanction on the seller for exacting an unreasonably high conveyance fee that has no real relation to the seller\u2019s actual costs for performing the services necessary to close the sale.\u201d The dissent also contends that our conclusion in the present case creates an \u201cincentive\u201d for both scrupulous and unscrupulous car dealers to engage in price manipulation. In our view, the precise disclosure required by the statute guards against this situation by giving the consumer the information that he or she needs to make an educated decision as to the actual price of the car that he or she has negotiated. Indeed, that the disclosure contained in \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) also requires a statement that the fee \u201cis not payable to the state of Connecticut printed in at least ten-point bold type on the face of both order and invoice\u201d guards against an unscrupulous dealer who might attempt to convince its customers that the fee is a nonnegotiable, state mandated tax. Thus, confronted with such a transaction, the informed consumer may very well choose to exercise his freedom to walk away from what he or she perceives as only an illusorily good deal. Moreover, as the defendant points out, to prevent such price manipulation effectively, the legislature would have needed to regulate other substantive elements of the transaction that also are subject, to disclosure under \u00a7 14-62 (a), such as trade-in allowances. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-62 (a) (6). Such broad economic regulation is more properly the subject of a comprehensive legislative effort, rather than the judicial process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b458-6\"> We disagree with the dissent\u2019s characterization of our analysis as in violation of the lack of \u201cany principle of statutory interpretation that permits us to read out specific legislative language simply because the legislators did not advert to it in their floor debate.\u201d See footnote 3 of the dissent. In our view, the language of \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) is ambiguous with respect to whether it regulates the amount that an automobile dealer may charge as a conveyance fee.

I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that General Statutes \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does not limit the amount that an automobile dealer may charge as a \u201cconveyance fee\u201d to the \u201creasonable costs\u201d of the listed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>services related to the closing of the sale of an automobile. I conclude, consistent with both the language and the evident purpose of the relevant statutory scheme, that a dealer conveyance fee means what \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) says it means, namely, \u201ca fee charged by a dealer to recover reasonable costs\u201d for processing the documentation and performing the other services related to the closing of the sale of the automobile. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The specific language at issue is the entirety of subdivision (9) of subsection (a) of \u00a7 14-62, which provides that each order and invoice for the sale of an automobile \u201cshall contain the following information . . . any dealer conveyance fee or processing fee and a statement that such fee is not payable to the state of Connecticut printed in at least ten-point bold type on the face of both the order and invoice. For purposes of this subdivision [9], \u2018dealer conveyance fee\u2019 or \u2018processing fee\u2019 means <em>afee charged by a dealer to recover reasonable costs </em>for processing all documentation and performing services related to the closing of a sale, including, but not limited to, the registration and transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle which is the subject of the sale.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The majority concludes that \u201c\u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) is a disclosure rule and not a substantive limitation on the amount that dealers may charge as a conveyance fee,\u201d because \u201cthe language at issue in its structural context demonstrates that it solely is definitional in nature, rather than regulatory or prohibitory.\u201d These are false dichotomies. Simply because \u00a7 14-62 embodies disclosure obligations on the seller does not mean that it does not also impose substantive obligations. Simply because the language at issue defines a conveyance fee does not mean that it does not also regulate the amount of the fee. In this regard, it is important to acknowledge, which the majority fails to do, that the entire last sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>fence of \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) \u2014 not just the two words, \u201creasonable costs,\u201d on which the majority focuses\u2014 constitutes the definition of \u201cconveyance fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Indeed, precisely because the language of the last sentence of \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) <em>is </em>definitional, the natural inference is that the legislature intended <em>all </em>of the definition, not just <em>part </em>of it, to have effect, and that it have <em>both </em>a disclosure and regulatory effect in accordance with its language and purpose.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the present <em>case, </em>that inference is supported by the fact that the statute is a consumer protection statute that is remedial in nature, and therefore must be construed in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit, namely, car buyers. Those buyers would be more fully protected by affording the definition its most likely meaning, namely, that not only must the conveyance fee be disclosed, but, as \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) specifically provides, the conveyance fee must reflect the \u201creasonable costs for processing all documentation and performing services related to the closing of a sale, including, but not limited to, the registration and transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle which is the subject of the sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>The majority, however, interprets the last sentence of \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) as if it provided as follows: \u201cFor the purposes of this subdivision, \u2018dealer conveyance fee\u2019 or \u2018processing fee\u2019 means a fee charged by a dealer . . . for processing all documentation and performing services related to the closing of a sale, including, but not limited to, the registration and transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle which is the subject of the sale.\u201d It does not so provide, however. Instead, the last sentence of \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) provides as follows: \u201cFor the purposes of this subdivision, \u2018dealer conveyance fee\u2019 or \u2018processing fee\u2019 means a fee charged by a dealer <em>to recover reasonable costs </em>for processing all documentation and performing services related to the closing of a sale, including, but not limited to, the registration and transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle which is the subject of the sale.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the majority reads the definition as if there were four words \u2014 \u201cto recover reasonable costs\u201d \u2014 that are missing, or do not exist. Unless there is some compelling evidence that the legislature did not intend all of its definition to have effect, there is no justification for refusing to give all of its definition meaning and effect. There is no such evidence here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>We have previously recognized that \u201c[cjourts are bound to accept the legislative definition of terms in a statute.\u201d <em>Toll Gate Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milk Regulation Board, </em>148 Conn. 341, 347, 170 A.2d 883 (1961).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ignoring this rule, the majority has simply read out of the definition the language \u201cto recover reasonable costs\u201d \u2014 essen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>tially rewriting the legislative definition of the term \u201cconveyance fee.\u201d Despite the majority\u2019s conclusion that somehow <em>this </em>language of the single definitional sentence has no meaning or application because it is definitional, but the <em>rest </em>of the same definitional sentence does have meaning or application, I do not understand why that is so. As the majority acknowledges, we ordinarily do not interpret statutes to render statutory language superfluous. I agree with that. The majority explains, however, that the canons of construction are merely guides to interpretation and cannot displace the process of careful and thoughtful interpretation. I also agree with that. But that explanation does not lead to the majority\u2019s conclusion that, when the legislature specifically included in the \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) definition of \u201cconveyance fee\u201d the language \u201cto recover reasonable costs,\u201d it intended that language to have no meaning or application whatsoever. Put another way, the majority\u2019s explanation does not lead to the conclusion that only those four words of the definition of \u201cconveyance fee\u201d have no meaning or application, but the rest of the words of the definition do have meaning and application. Yet that is precisely the effect of the majority\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">That the legislature intended the phrase \u201cto recover reasonable costs\u201d to have meaning is also supported by the language of subsection (c) of \u00a7 14-62, which provides in relevant part: \u201cEach dealer shall provide a written statement to the buyer or prominently display a sign in the area of his place of business in which sales are negotiated which shall specify the amount of any conveyance or processing fee charged by such dealer, <em>the services performed by the dealer for such fee, </em>that such fee is not payable to the state of Connecticut and that the buyer may elect, where appropriate, to submit the documentation required for the registration and transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the subject of the sale to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, <em>in which case the dealer shall reduce such fee by a proportional amount. </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added.) First, the requirement that the dealer reduce the conveyance fee by a proportional amount demonstrates that the legislature, unlike the majority, did not believe it was somehow barred from imposing a substantive obligation within a statute that has as its primary purpose requiring disclosure. Put another way, the fact that the dealer is required by the statute to reduce the fee by a proportional amount if the buyer elects to submit the documentation to the commissioner of motor vehicles himself indicates that the legislature did not intend for the primary purpose of \u00a7 14-62, requiring disclosure, to be its exclusive purpose. Second, the nature of the substantive obligation, that the dealer must reduce the conveyance fee by a proportional amount when the buyer elects to submit to the commissioner of motor vehicles the registration and transfer of ownership documents is consistent with the definition of the conveyance fee as one that reflects the reasonable costs of the dealer because subsection (c) of \u00a7 14-62 requires that the reduction in the fee be <em>proportional </em>to the costs of registration and transfer of ownership documents. This language, especially when read together with the requirement that the dealer must disclose the services performed by the dealer for the conveyance fee, indicates that the legislature intended the fee to reflect the dealer\u2019s cost of performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The majority\u2019s interpretation <em>might </em>make some sense if it could be established that, in the context of the statutory scheme, the inclusion of the four missing words would serve no ascertainable legislative purpose. That, however, is far from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">First, the missing words serve the legislative purpose, not only of disclosure that there is such a thing as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>conveyance fee and its amount, but also the legislative purpose of requiring that the fee be reasonable so as to protect the consumer. In the context of most car sales, the buyer does not ordinarily become interested in the conveyance fee until he has decided to buy the car. With no limitation whatsoever on the amount of the fee, an unscrupulous car dealer can lowball the sales price and then, once the buyer has agreed, highball the conveyance fee to recoup profits in the form of the fee. The buyer then would be faced with walking away from the deal or accepting it, but if the buyer stays, there would no regulatory or legal sanction on the seller for exacting an unreasonably high conveyance fee that has no real relation to the seller\u2019s actual costs for performing the services necessary to close the sale. It takes no flight of imagination to recognize the avoidance of such a scenario as a legitimate legislative purpose of requiring that any conveyance fee be \u201creasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Second, the definition of \u201cconveyance fee\u201d applies, not just to \u00a7 14-62, but also to General Statutes \u00a7 14-62a (a), which governs advertising of prices of car sales.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 14-62a (a) provides that the stated advertised price must include the federal tax, cost of delivery, dealer preparation and other charges, \u201cexcept that such advertisement shall state in at least eight-point bold type that any state or local tax, registration fees <em>or dealer conveyance fee or processing fee, as defined in subsection (a) of section 14-62, </em>is excluded from such stated price.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The legislative importance of this provision is underscored by subsection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>(b) of \u00a7 14-62a, which imposes a fine of not more than $1000, as well as suspension or revocation of license, for any violation of subsection (a) of \u00a7 14-62a.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">It is obvious that the purpose of this statute is to require truth in price advertising for the benefit of the consumer. What the majority opinion fails to grasp is that the limitation of a dealer\u2019s conveyance fee to the amount of the dealer\u2019s reasonable costs in closing the sale of an automobile furthers the primary purpose of the statute by preventing a dealer from misleading consumers regarding the actual \u201cprice\u201d of an automobile by manipulating the conveyance fee to hide profit. In the absence of the limit provided by the legislature in the definition of \u201cconveyance fee,\u201d the protection afforded consumers by \u00a7 14-62 is significantly weakened. Thus, if the conveyance fee is substantively limited to that which is \u201creasonable,\u201d an unscrupulous car dealer could not easily advertise an unreasonably low price \u2014 thereby attracting car buyers to <em>its </em>lot, rather than to the lots of its competitors \u2014 and then, once the deal is made, up the ante with an unregulated and unreasonable conveyance fee. Under the majority\u2019s interpretation, however, the unscrupulous car dealer is given the incentive to do precisely that. In fact, under the majority\u2019s interpretation, by virtue of which a conveyance fee is wholly unregulated, even scrupulous car dealers are given the incentive to lowball their prices and highball their conveyance fees, in order to meet the competition of those unscrupulous dealers who are doing the same. This set of incentives, created by the majority\u2019s interpretation, would wholly undermine the fundamental purpose of the section. We should not read a statute to undermine its evident purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">I would, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court, and remand the case to that court with direction to answer the reserved question, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-62 (a) provides: \u201cEach sale shall be evidenced by an order properly signed by both the buyer and seller, a copy of which shall be furnished to the buyer when executed, and an invoice upon delivery of the motor vehicle, both of which shall contain the following information: (1) Make of vehicle; (2) year of model, whether sold as new or used, and on invoice the identification number; (3) deposit, and (A) if the deposit is not refundable, the words \u2018No Refund of Deposit\u2019 shall appear at this point, and (B) if (he deposit is conditionally refundable, the words \u2018Conditional Refund of Deposit\u2019 shall appear at this point, followed by a statement giving the conditions for refund, and (C) if the deposit is unconditionally refundable, the words \u2018Unconditional Refund\u2019 shall appear at this point; (4) cash selling price; (5) finance charges, and (A) if these charges do not include insurance, the words \u2018No Insurance\u2019 shall appear at this point, and (B) if these charges include insurance, a statement shall appear at this point giving the exact type of coverage; (6) allowance on motor vehicle traded in, if any, and description of the same; (7) stamped or printed in a size equal to at least ten-point bold type on the face of both order and invoice one of the following forms: (A) \u2018This motor vehicle not guaranteed\u2019, or (B) \u2018This motor vehicle is guaranteed\u2019, followed by a statement as to the terms of such guarantee, which statement shall not apply to household furnishings of any trailer; (8) if the motor vehicle is new but has been subject to use by the seller or use in connection with his business as a dealer, the word \u2018demonstrator\u2019 shall be clearly displayed on the face of both order and invoice; (9) any dealer conveyance fee or processing fee and a statement that such fee is not payable to the state of Connecticut printed in at least ten-point bold type on the face of both order and invoice. For the purposes of this subdivision, \u2018dealer conveyance fee\u2019 or \u2018processing fee\u2019 means a fee charged by a dealer to recover reasonable costs for processing all documentation and performing services related to the closing of a sale, including, but not limited to, the registration and transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle which is the subject of the sale.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\"> I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the fact that the legislature has, in other contexts, elected to regulate fees by incorporating a reasonableness standard in the operative section of the statute means that the legislature intended its definition of a conveyance fee in \u00a7 14-62 (a) (9) as limited to the recovery of the dealer\u2019s reasonable costs to have no meaning. The mere fact that the legislature has not imposed a reasonableness limit on fees in the definitional section in <em>other </em>statutes does not mean that it may never do so, or that it did not intend to do so here. Furthermore, the legislature <em>has </em>in some statutes, incorporated a reasonableness limitation in the definitional, rather than operative, portion of the statute. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 38a-492, which is entitled, \u201cCoverage for accidental ingestion or consumption of controlled drugs. Benefits prescribed,\u201d provides in relevant part: \u201cFor purposes of (Ms section, the term \u2018covered expenses\u2019 means the reasonable charges for treatment deemed necessary under generally accepted medical standards.\u201d If we were to apply the majority\u2019s reasoning in the present case consistently, in interpreting \u00a7 38a-492, we would have to ignore the reasonableness limit incorporated into the definition of \u201ccovered expenses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b462-5\"> In this connection, the majority\u2019s reliance on an absence from the governing regulation of a specific provision dealing with the reasonableness of conveyance fees is unpersuasive. That regulation, \u00a7 42-110b-28 (b) (23) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]t shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a new car dealer or a used car dealer to violate <em>any provision of a . . . state statute . . . concerning the sale or lease of motor vehicles.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) I know of no principle that a regulation of general applicability somehow loses its force because it is not specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Similarly, the majority\u2019s reliance on the absence from the legislative history of any discussion of the amount or reasonableness of conveyance fees is also unavailing. Simply because the legislators focused in their discussion on the disclosure aspect of the definition cannot mean that they intended specific definitional language in the statute \u2014 \u201cto recover reasonable costs\u201d-\u2014 to disappear. I am unaware of any principle of statutory interpretation that permits us to read out specific legislative language simply because the legislators did not advert to it in their floor debate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b463-5\"> <em>Toll Gate Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milk Regulation Board, </em>supra, 148 Conn. 341, the case upon which the majority relies for the proposition that definitional language may not impose substantive limitations on the terms within a regulatory provision, does not support this conclusion. In that case, the issue before the court was \u201cwhether a duly licensed dealer in, or producer of, milk or milk products can sell, or offer or possess with intent to sell, milk from which sufficient cream has been removed to reduce its butterfat content to less than three and one-quarter per cent but more than one-half of one per cent.\u201d Id., 342. The statutory scheme provided clear guidelines for labeling milk with 0.5 percent or less butterfat. Such milk was defined as \u201cskimmed milk\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 22-127, and was required to be labeled as such in General Statutes \u00a7 22-159. Id., 342-43. The statutory scheme further provided that, unless otherwise labeled, milk sold or offered for sale was to be deemed as milk of \u201cstandard quality,\u201d which was defined as milk that contained 3.25 percent or more of butterfat. General Statutes \u00a7 22-152. Milk containing less than 3.25 percent, but more than 0.5 percent butterfat, was not defined in the statutory scheme. <em>Toll Gate Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milk Regulation Board, </em>supra, 346. The regulatory portion of the statutory scheme was set forth in \u00a7 22-159, which provided in relevant part: \u201c \u2018No person shall sell, or offer or expose for sale, or have in his possession with the intent to mix with other dairy products to be sold, milk from which the cream or any part thereof has been removed, unless the product is plainly labeled. Skimmed milk may be sold in milk bottles or other approved containers if properly marked or tagged as such skimmed milk.\u2019 \u201d Id., 347. In interpreting the regulatory provision of \u00a7 22-159, the court began with the proposition that the regulatory provision \u201cmust be read together with the definition of \u2018skimmed milk\u2019 in \u00a7 22-127.\u201d Id. The court then read the regulatory provision consistently with the statutory definition of \u201c \u2018skimmed milk\u2019 \u201d to conclude that the first and second sentences of \u00a7 22-159 regulated two entirely different categories of milk, the first sentence dealing with \u201cthe general category of milk \u2018from which the cream or any part thereof has been removed,\u2019 \u201d and the second sentence dealing with \u201c \u2018skimmed milk\u2019 \u201d as defined in \u00a7 22-127. Id., 348. Thus, the court applied the regulatory portion of the statute within the context of the definition supplied by the legislature for purposes of that regulatory provision, holding that the defendant milk regulation board improperly concluded that the sale of properly labeled 2 percent milk was barred by the statutory scheme. Id., 348^19. That is precisely the way that the court should read the regulatory provision contained in \u00a7 14-62 (9).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-62a (a) provides: \u201cNo dealer licensed under the provisions of section 14-52 shall advertise the price of any motor vehicle unless the stated price in such advertisement includes the federal tax, the cost of delivery, dealer preparation and any other charges of any nature, except that such advertisement shall state in at least eight-point bold type that any state or local tax, registration fees or dealer conveyance fee or processing fee, as defined in subsection (a) of section 14-62, is excluded from such stated price.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
