App. 729, 745, 875 A.2d 48 (2005). The sole issue in this appeal is whether the Appellate Court properly rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s self-defense instruction as it pertained to the duty to retreat constituted harmful error. Id., 742. We affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment on the alternate ground that the defendant expressly waived this claim at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following facts that the jury reasonably could have found and the relevant procedural history. \u201cOn September 15, 2001, the victim, Felix Gonzales, and Laura Montanez and Raymond Vasquez were fishing at Harbor Drive Park in Stamford. While Gonzales and Vasquez were sitting on a bench, the defendant approached the two men from behind. The defendant grabbed Vasquez around the neck. Gonzales told the defendant to stop choking Vasquez, and a fight ensued. Several witnesses testified that the defendant \u2018danced\u2019 around Gonzales with his fists raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u201cAlthough it is not clear what was said or if there was yelling, the verdict allows us to assume that the jury found that the defendant hit Gonzales first. Gonzales, who fell to the ground after being hit by the defendant, sustained a broken nose, bruising and a lost tooth. The defendant received a cut on his lip. Gonzales was given a summons and was taken to a hospital for treatment. The defendant was arrested at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\u201cThe defendant was charged with assault in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-61 and breach of the peace in violation of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1). After a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of both charges.\u201d Id., 732. The defendant was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment, suspended after time served, followed by two years of probation. Id., 743. The defendant appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court improperly had: (1) instructed the jury on the requirements of self-defense; and (2) remanded the defendant into custody pending sentencing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id., 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>With regard to the issue on appeal before this court, the defendant claimed before the Appellate Court that the trial court improperly had included a duty to retreat within the self-defense instruction because this case did not involve the use of deadly force. Because he failed to preserve this claim at trial by either filing a written request to charge on self-defense or taking an exception to the self-defense instruction given by the court,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the defendant sought review of his claim pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). The Appellate Court concluded that the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim of improper jury instruction was reviewable under <em>Golding, </em>but failed on its merits. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>supra, 89 Conn. App. 740-42. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim, the Appellate Court reasoned that the improper jury instruction was harmless because the jury had chosen between two inconsistent theories of the altercation, \u201ccould have judged the testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses to be more credible,\u201d and \u201cmay not have even needed the self-defense instruction to reach its verdict.\u201d Id., 742. The Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court with regard to the defendant\u2019s last claim and remanded for resentencing, but affirmed the judgment on all other grounds. Id., 745. This certified appeal followed. See footnote 1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The defendant claims on appeal to this court that the trial court improperly instructed the jury by including a duty to retreat exception in its self-defense charge, because pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 53a-19 (b),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a duty to retreat exists only in the context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>of deadly force. The defendant argues that the instruction misled the jury to believe that, even if it had concluded that the defendant was justified in his use of physical force, such action was not legally excusable if it was possible or feasible for the defendant to have escaped from Gonzales. In response, the state argues that the Appellate Court correctly concluded that the impropriety in the jury instruction was harmless error. The state also proffers, as an alternate ground for affirming the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 84-11,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that the defendant cannot prevail under <em>Golding </em>because he waived any challenge to the alleged constitutional violation by informing the trial court that he was satisfied with the self-defense charge. We agree with the state\u2019s alternate ground, and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The record reveals the following additional relevant facts and procedural history. With respect to self-defense, it is undisputed that the trial court instructed the jury properly as to the meaning of self-defense and the burdens on each party with respect to that defense. The court then continued as follows: \u201cNow, the law recognizes an exception to the justification of the use of physical force as self-defense. In subsection (b) of \u00a7 53a-19 of the statutes insofar as it relates to this case provides as follows. A person is not justified in using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>physical force upon another person if he knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating. The law stresses that the defensive measures must never be retaliatory. The force used by a defensive force, not a reprisal or a punishing force. <em>The law also says that if possible or feasible, the person attacked should retreat and get away from that person or place before standing his ground and returning force with force.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u201cSo, if you find the claim of the defendant you must ask yourself did he take necessary defensive measures, the fending off of measures to protect himself. Or did he retreat or give ground or did he take some retaliatory measures or some stronger measures not reasonable in the light of that attack. In essence, how reasonable were the measures that he took.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">After the jury had left the courtroom, the prosecutor requested the court add to the self-defense instruction language indicating that, if the jury found the defendant was the initial aggressor, the defense of self-defense would no longer be available to the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 53a-19 (c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When the court asked defense counsel if he had any objections to that addition to the charge, defense counsel objected, stating twice that the self-defense instruction already had been given as he had requested,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and once that he was \u201csatisfied\u201d with the self-defense instruction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>\u201cUnder <em>[State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40], a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . The first two <em>Golding </em>requirements involve whether the claim is reviewable, and the second two involve whether there was constitutional error requiring a new trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>280 Conn. 69, 89-90, 905 A.2d 1101 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The record in the present case is adequate for our review because it contains the full transcript of the trial proceedings. Further, this court recently has recognized that \u201cit is well established\u201d that a claim of an inadequate jury instruction on self-defense implicates the defendant\u2019s due process rights and, therefore, is of constitutional magnitude. <em>State </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>277 Conn. 735, 749, 894 A.2d 928 (2006); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>231 Conn. 484, 493, 651 A.2d 247 (1994) (\u201c[a]n improper instruction on a defense, like an improper instruction on an element of an offense, is of constitutional dimension\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable under the first two prongs of <em>Golding. </em>Therefore, we address the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim under the third and fourth prongs of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Turning to the third prong of the <em>Golding </em>analysis, we first set forth the applicable principles that guide our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim. \u201cWhere, as here, the challenged juiy instructions involve a constitutional right, the applicable standard of review is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict. ... In evaluating the particular charges at issue, we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is . . . whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury . . . we will not view [the instructions] as improper.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitford, </em>260 Conn. 610, 619-20, 799 A.2d 1034 (2002); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>94 Conn. App. 188, 199, 891 A.2d 974 (\u201cas to unpreserved claims of constitutional error in jury instructions, we have stated that under the third prong of <em>Golding, </em>[a] defendant may prevail . . . only if ... it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 278 Conn. 906, 897 A.2d 100 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u201cA defendant in a criminal prosecution may waive one or more of his or her fundamental rights.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>38 Conn. App. 661, 669, 664 A.2d 773, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 908, 665 A.2d 903 (1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1214, 116 S. Ct. 1837, 134 L. Ed. 2d 940 (1996), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>230 Conn. 385, 392, 645 A.2d 535 (1994). \u201cIn the usual <em>Golding </em>situation, the defendant raises a claim on appeal which, while not preserved at trial, at least was not waived at trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>supra, 667. Although we have not yet reviewed a situation wherein, as here, a defendant requesting <em>Golding </em>review implicitly may have waived a claim as to the propriety of jury instructions at trial, the Appellate Court has done so on several occasions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In each case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the Appellate Court has applied the reasoning of its decision in <em>Cooper </em>to determine whether the defendant\u2019s claim failed the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u201c[In <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 670, the Appellate Court] held that a defendant could not satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding </em>where he had implicitly waived at trial a challenge to the alleged constitutional deprivation that was the basis of his claim on appeal. Therefore, a defendant cannot prevail under <em>Golding </em>on a claim that he implicitly waived at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Arluk, 75 </em>Conn. App. 181, 192, 815 A.2d 694 (2003). In <em>Cooper, </em>the defendant appealed from his conviction, rendered after a jury trial, for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a). <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>supra, 662-63. He appealed based in part on the trial court\u2019s jury instructions, which he claimed improperly had directed the jury to find Interstate 84 to be a \u201cpublic highway,\u201d which was an element of \u00a7 14-227a (a). Id., 663. The Appellate Court determined that the defendant\u2019s claim was reviewable under the first two prongs of <em>Golding, </em>but concluded that, because he had waived his right to have the state prove all elements of his crime, he had failed to demonstrate that the alleged constitutional violation clearly existed or that he clearly was deprived of a fair trial. Id., 664-65. The Appellate Court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>statements made by defense counsel \u201cwere tantamount to a stipulation as to the public highway element, [and] therefore amounted to an implied waiver by the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Id., 669. The court concluded that \u201cwaiver of the right to require the state to prove each element of a crime may be made by counsel and may be inferred from the absence of an objection.\u201d Id., 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The logic of <em>Cooper </em>has been applied by the Appellate Court in several cases involving waiver of claims regarding jury instructions; see footnote 12 of this opinion; one of which is particularly persuasive in the present case. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>96 Conn. App. 533, 557, 901 A.2d 687, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 912, 908 A.2d 540 (2006), the defendant claimed that the trial court improperly had instructed the jury on the elements of alteration of a firearm identification mark or number and the presumptive inference that the jury was permitted to draw. After the court had given its oral instructions to the jury, the prosecutor directed the court\u2019s attention to a discrepancy between the oral charge and the written charge that was to be submitted to the jury on the elements of alteration. Id., 558. The court and both counsel agreed that the written charge was incorrect, and, upon reviewing a corrected version of the written charge, \u201c[b]oth the prosecutor and defense counsel stated that they were \u2018satisfied\u2019 with the correction.\u201d Id. The Appellate Court concluded that the defendant had waived any challenge to the alleged constitutional violation because \u201cthe defendant not only failed to object to the court\u2019s instruction, but also voiced satisfaction with it. . . . To allow the defendant to seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>reversal now that his trial strategy has failed would amount to allowing him to induce potentially harmful error, and then ambush the state with that claim on appeal. ... A review of the record shows that, for these reasons, the defendant cannot satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding, </em>as the constitutional violation did not clearly exist.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In the present case, defense counsel not only failed to object to the instruction as given or to the state\u2019s original request to charge the jury with the duty to retreat, but clearly expressed his satisfaction with that instruction, and in fact subsequently argued that the instruction as given was proper.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Indeed, defense counsel himself addressed the duty to retreat in his own summation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, the defendant accepted the duty to retreat theory presented by the prosecutor, and openly acquiesced at trial, thereby waiving his right to challenge the instruction on appeal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under this factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>situation, we simply cannot conclude that \u201cinjustice [has been] done to either party\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitford, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 620; or that \u201cthe alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Moreover, our decision in the present case, concluding that unpreserved, waived claims, fail under the third prong of <em>Golding, </em>is consistent with our decisions declining to review claims of induced error. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>269 Conn. 97, 106, 848 A.2d 445 (2004), we quoted <em>Cooper </em>in concluding that <em>Golding </em>review is inapplicable to an unpreserved claim of induced error<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> because \u201c[t]o allow [a] defendant to seek reversal now that his trial strategy has failed would amount to allowing him to induce potentially harmful error, and then ambush the state [and the trial court] with that claim on appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The defendant had challenged the charge on self-defense because it instructed the jury only on the use of deadly force, thus removing from the jury any consideration of whether he was justified in using nondeadly force. Id., 103. We held that, because the trial court used the exact language that the defendant had submitted in his request to charge, and because the defendant had taken no exception to the charge prior to or after the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>received its instructions, the defendant had induced the error and, therefore, could not challenge it on appeal. Id., 101-103. Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Gibson, 270 </em>Conn. 55, 68, 850 A.2d 1040 (2004), we refused to review under <em>Golding </em>the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim of impropriety in the trial court\u2019s failure to provide a limiting instruction on the appropriate use of uncharged misconduct evidence because \u201cthe defendant encouraged or prompted the court to refrain from giving such an instruction despite the court\u2019s attempts to elicit from the defendant his permission to do so.\u201d See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>272 Conn. 432, 456, 862 A.2d 817 (2005) (refusing to review for plain error defendant\u2019s claim that trial court improperly departed from statutory procedure for selecting jurors when defense counsel induced procedural departure); <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, 227 </em>Conn. 32, 67, 630 A.2d 990 (1993) (\u201cno review is warranted because [the defendant] induced the error\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the Appellate Court properly determined that the impropriety in the jury instruction did not require reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\"> We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the trial court\u2019s improper instruction on the duty to retreat constituted harmless error?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>275 Conn. 902, 903, 882 A.2d 678 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\"> The Appellate Court reversed in part the judgment of the trial court with respect to the sentencing of the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>89 Conn.

He\u2019s got a duty to retreat. He\u2019s got a duty to leave the scene.\u201d In his rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor also stated that \u201c[h]e has a duty to retreat.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\"> Defense counsel told the jury that \u201cit\u2019s this man, Judge Hickey, who will tell you what the law is, and that\u2019s what you need to follow.
