The plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the legislation, arguing that the smoking ban violates the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The dispositive issues on appeal are: (1) whether this court has subject matter jurisdiction over the present case despite the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to provide the notice mandated by our rules of practice to interested persons in declaratory judgment actions; and (2) whether the smoking ban legislation violates the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection rights. We first conclude that we have subject matter jurisdiction to hear this appeal despite the plaintiffs\u2019 lack of compliance with the notice requirements. We also determine that the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection rights have not been violated. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The procedural history of the present case is undisputed. In July, 2004, the plaintiffs filed the complaint in the present action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that Public Acts 2003, No. 03-45, which amended General Statutes \u00a7 19a-342<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to prohibit smoking in res<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>taurants and caf\u00e9s and other public facilities, but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>in casinos and most private clubs,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> violates the plaintiffs\u2019 right to equal protection under the state and federal constitutions. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The defendants thereafter filed a motion to strike the complaint, arguing that the complaint had failed to set forth allegations sufficient to establish an equal protection violation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court granted the motion to strike on equal protection grounds and, subsequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>rendered judgment in favor of the defendants. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Following oral argument, we ordered the parties, sua sponte, to file supplemental briefs addressing the following questions: \u201cDid the plaintiffs at any time give notice to all interested persons of their request for a declaratory judgment pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-56? If not: (1) are the interests of the other interested persons protected by the defendants and/or their counsel, the [attorney [g]eneral? or (2) does the failure to give such notice deprive this court of subject matter jurisdiction of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal? See <em>Stafford Higgins Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>245 Conn. 551, 577 n.20, 715 A.2d 46 (1998).\u201d The parties thereafter filed supplemental briefs as ordered, both of which acknowledged that notice of the declaratory judgment action was not given to certain interested persons pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-56 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">We first consider whether the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to render judgment in the present case despite the lack of notice to interested persons. Although the issue has not been raised by the parties, \u201ca subject matter jurisdictional defect may not be waived ... [or jurisdiction] conferred by the parties, explicitly or implicitly. . . . [T]he question of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law . . . and, once raised, either by a party or by the court itself, the question must be answered before the court may decide the case. . . . We have long held that because [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number><em>Commissioner of Transportation </em>v. <em>Rocky Mountain, LLC, </em>277 Conn. 696, 703, 894 A.2d 259 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Our rules of practice provide that, in declaratory judgment actions, the plaintiff is required to provide notice to or seek joinder of \u201c[a]ll persons who have an interest in the subject matter of the requested declaratory judgment that is direct, immediate and adverse to the interest of one or more of the plaintiffs or defendants in the action . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 17-56 (b). The plaintiff further is required to append to the complaint \u201ca certificate stating that all such interested persons have been joined as parties to the action or have been given reasonable notice thereof.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 17-56 (b). In the present case, the plaintiffs acknowledge that they provided notice of their request for a declaratory judgment only to the defendants.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They further admit that they failed to append the certificate of notice to their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">This court previously has stated that the failure to provide notice to all interested parties in a declaratory judgment action deprives the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction of the action. See, e.g., <em>McBurney </em>v. <em>Cirillo, </em>276 Conn. 782, 793, 889 A.2d 759 (2006); <em>Napoletano </em>v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 216, 224-25, 680 A.2d 127 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1103, 117 S. Ct. 1106, 137 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1997); <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>176 Conn. 318, 319, 407 A.2d 979 (1978). In recent years, however, the court has been willing to remand such cases to allow the defect to be cured, signaling a shift in the court\u2019s understanding of the nature of the defect. See <em>Serrani </em>v. <em>Board of Ethics, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>225 Conn. 305, 309 n.5, 622 A.2d 1009 (1993) (\u201c[u]nlike other jurisdictional defects implicating the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction,\u201d failure to comply with notice requirement can be cured); <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Raymark Corp., </em>215 Conn. 224, 230, 575 A.2d 693 (1990) (\u201c[t]he conclusion we have reached that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to render its declaratory judgment does not require that the action be dismissed upon remand, because the jurisdictional defect can be cured by further proceedings in the trial court\u201d); cf. <em>Gianetti </em>v. <em>Norwalk Hospital, </em>211 Conn. 51, 56, 557 A.2d 1249 (1989) (because no notice of declaratory judgment action provided to interested persons, reframing questions on appeal to affect only parties). The conclusion that such defects can be remedied on remand implicitly calls into question the jurisdictional nature of the defect because it conflicts with the well established principle that a judgment rendered without subject matter jurisdiction is void. See <em>Commissioner of Transportation </em>v. <em>Rocky Mountain, LLC, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In addition, this court recently has questioned explicitly whether the failure to give notice of a declaratory judgment action is properly a question of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>In Stafford Higgins Industries, Inc. v. Norwalk, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 577 n.20, the court noted that \u201c[r]ecent developments in our subject matter jurisdiction jurisprudence in other areas may cast doubt on the doctrine, however well established, that a failure to give the notice required under Practice Book \u00a7 [17-56 (b)] is a <em>subject matter jurisdictional </em>defect; see, e.g., <em>Russo </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>[184 Conn. 30, 33-35, 441 A.2d 56 (1981)]; as opposed, for example, to a defect more closely resembling the failure to cite in or give notice to a necessary or indispensable party to litigation, which is not subject matter jurisdictional. See <em>Fong </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>212 Conn. 628, 635-36, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>563 A.2d 293 (1989). We have indicated that subject matter jurisdiction is, with certain constitutional exceptions not applicable here, a matter of statute, not judicial rule making. See <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 178, 184, 640 A.2d 601 (1994). General Statutes \u00a7 52-29 (a) gives the Superior Court subject matter jurisdiction to render declaratory judgments, whether or not further relief is or could be claimed. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 52-29 authorizes the judges to make such orders and rules as they may deem necessary or advisable to effectuate subsection (a). Practice Book \u00a7 [17-56 (b)] is an example of such a rule. It may be questionable that the judges may, pursuant to their rule-making authority under subsection (b) of \u00a7 52-29, limit the subject matter jurisdiction created by subsection (a) of \u00a7 52-29. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 51-14 (a) (The judges of the Supreme Court, the judges of the Appellate Court, and the judges of the Superior Court shall adopt and promulgate and may from time to time modify or repeal rules and forms regulating pleading, practice and procedure in judicial proceedings in courts in which they have the constitutional authority to make rules, for the purpose of simplifying proceedings in the courts and of promoting the speedy and efficient determination of litigation upon its merits. . . . Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right nor the jurisdiction of any of the courts. . . .).\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">This questioning by the court of its previous conclusion that the failure to provide notice in a declaratory judgment action is a subject matter jurisdictional defect apparently was recognized by the judges of the Superior Court in 2000, when the Practice Book provisions governing declaratory judgment actions were amended to provide that \u201cno declaratory judgment action shall be defeated by the nonjoinder of parties or the failure to give notice to interested persons.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 17-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>56 (c). The commentary to this section indicates that this new section \u201cis intended to make it clear that defects in joinder and notice are nonjurisdictional.\u201d Practice Book, 2000, \u00a7 17-56, commentary. Although the rules of practice may not expand or contract the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction; see General Statutes \u00a751-14 (a); <em>Stafford Higgins Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 577 n.20; this amendment to the rules of practice seemingly reflected this court\u2019s doubt that the failure to give notice of the declaratory judgment action would implicate the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We now reconsider our prior cases that have concluded that the failure to provide notice to interested persons of a declaratory judgment action deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The Declaratory Judgment Act, codified at General Statutes \u00a7 52-29, was adopted in 1921 to allow our trial courts to provide declaratory relief. <em>Braman </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>98 Conn. 549, 553, 120 A. 150 (1923). Rules of practice enacted shortly thereafter provided that \u201c[t]he Superior Court will not render declaratory judgments . . . unless all persons having an interest in the subject matter of the complaint are parties to the action or have reasonable notice thereof.\u201d Id., 552 n.; see Practice Book, 1922, \u00a7 63 (d) (now \u00a7 17-56 [b]). This court subsequently explained that \u201c[ajnyone with an interest in the subject matter is entitled to reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard, whether he supports the plaintiffs\u2019 or the defendants\u2019 position.\u201d <em>Cavalli </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>174 Conn. 212, 216, 384 A.2d 374 (1978). This court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>indicated a preference for joining interested persons as parties, rather than merely providing them with notice of the action. See, e.g., <em>National Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Toquet, </em>123 Conn. 468, 482-84, 196 A. 344 (1937). Simply notifying an interested person of the pendency of the action does not ensure that the person will be bound by the resulting judgment. In fact, the rules of practice, as amended in 2000, specifically provide that \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided by law, no declaration shall be binding against any persons not joined as parties. If it appears to the court that the rights of nonparties will be prejudiced by its declaration, it shall order entry of judgment in such form as to affect only the parties to the action.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 17-56 (d). Thus, the notice requirement ensures that interested persons are aware of the requested declaratory relief and are able to move to intervene to protect their interests, should they choose to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Like the declaratory judgment notice rule, the purpose of our joinder rules is to ensure that all persons whose interests are implicated directly by an action are able to protect those interests through participation in the action. See <em>Fong </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 637 (indispensable party is entitled to notice and opportunity to be heard to satisfy \u201cfundamental tenets of due process\u201d). As we have recognized, the failure to give notice to or to join an indispensable party does not impact the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. General Statutes \u00a7 52-108; Practice Book \u00a7 9-19; <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Souto, </em>277 Conn. 829, 839, 896 A.2d 90 (2006); <em>Fong </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 635-36. Although the failure to join an indispensable party does not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction, the court nevertheless must consider whether the adjudication of the action in the absence of the party would violate that party\u2019s right to defend its interests and offend fundamental tenets of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>due process. <em>Fong </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">We perceive no valid reason for the inconsistency between the consequences of noncompliance with the declaratory judgment notice rules and the joinder mies. No public policy is served by denying subject matter jurisdiction when an interested person is not notified of a declaratory judgment action, but permitting an action to proceed when an indispensable party is absent. This inconsistency in our case law, combined with the separation of powers concerns expressed by this court in <em>Stafford Higgins Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 577 n.20, leads us to conclude that the failure to notify interested persons in a declaratory judgment action does not implicate the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. This conclusion is in harmony with our more recent cases, in which we have permitted the lack of notice to be cured, a result that is inconsistent with a conclusion that the lack of notice deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction. We therefore now overrule our past precedent in which we concluded that the lack of notice to interested persons of the pendency of a declaratory judgment action deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Having concluded that failure to provide notice, like noncompliance with the joinder mies, is nonjurisdictional, we also conclude that failure to provide notice, like nonjoinder, may implicate due process concerns that would compel a court to require notice or joinder before proceeding with the action. \u201c[A] court may refuse to proceed with litigation if a claim cannot properly be adjudicated without the presence of those indispensable persons whose substantive rights and interests will be necessarily and materially affected by its outcome. . . . Joinder of indispensable parties is mandated because due process principles make it essential that [such parties] be given notice and an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>opportunity to protect [their] interests by making [them] a party to the [action].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hilton </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>233 Conn. 701, 722-23, 661 A.2d 973 (1995). Thus, we now consider whether this action should be remanded for such a purpose, or whether we may proceed with this appeal consistent with the dictates of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">This court\u2019s order requiring supplemental briefs asked the parties to consider whether the interests of other persons are protected by the existing parties. In their brief, the plaintiffs contend that the interests of all other persons are protected by the existing parties, which, the plaintiffs note, includes the amicus curiae American Cancer Society, Inc. The defendants also contend that the parties have represented adequately the interests of others because the issue before the court is purely a legal question, raised on a motion to strike for which no fact-finding is required, and has been thoroughly briefed by the existing parties. Moreover, the defendants claim, this court has recognized that the attorney general adequately represents the interests of potential defendants in an action challenging the constitutionality of state law. See <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>187 Conn. 187, 196, 445 A.2d 579 (1982) (towns properly barred from intervening in action challenging constitutionality of school financing scheme because attorney general defending statute). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">We conclude that the interests of nonparties who may be interested in the present action, including the municipalities that bear responsibility for enforcing the smoking ban statute, have been represented adequately by the current parties. The posture of the action is such that both this court and the trial court have been asked to determine solely a legal question, the constitutionality, on equal protection grounds, of the smoking ban statute. The inquiry does not require any factual determinations. The question has been fully briefed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>argued by the parties, as well as the amicus curiae. We perceive no deficiency in the pursuit of this legal argument that would leave the interests of a potential party, either plaintiff or defendant, unprotected. Moreover, as we have noted previously, a person who is not a party generally will not be bound by a declaratory ruling. Practice Book \u00a7 17-56 (d). Thus, an interested person who is not notified of the action is subject only to the stare decisis impact of the judgment. If the situation of an interested person is quite similar to that of one of the parties, then the stare decisis impact on the interested person may be strong, but, because of the similarity of interests, the existing parties are likely to have represented well the nonparty\u2019s interests. If, on the other hand, the interested person\u2019s circumstances are sufficiently different from those of the parties, the parties\u2019 representation of the nonparty\u2019s interests may have been weak, but the case will have less precedential effect on the interested person and any future action to which that person may be a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Of course, any given action may present circumstances in which this formula does not apply. For example, in <em>Hilton </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 723, in which the plaintiffs challenged a city\u2019s housing policies based on an alleged state constitutional right to shelter, this court concluded that, \u201c[gjiven the importance of the constitutional claims raised and the significant ramifications for the state of a conclusion by this court that the state has an affirmative constitutional duty to provide its citizens with shelter,\u201d the state was \u201can indispensable party that should have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the proceedings at the trial level.\u201d This court nevertheless declined to remand the action because the state had participated in the appeal as an amicus curiae and had been a party in a companion case that was dispositive of the claims in <em>Hilton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>In the present case, we do not perceive circumstances that require the remand of the action in order to allow notice and the possible participation of any absent interested persons. The parties argued their respective legal positions competently and, in particular, those interested in defending the statute\u2019s constitutionality, such as other governmental entities or health advocacy organizations, are represented adequately by the efforts of the attorney general and the amicus curiae, the American Cancer Society, Inc. We perceive no impairment in our ability to consider this purely legal question\u2014 whether the smoking ban violates equal protection principles \u2014 and, therefore, we now proceed to consider the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The specific question before us is whether the trial court properly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to strike based on its conclusion that the legislature\u2019s failure to impose the smoking ban on casinos and private clubs did not result in a violation of the equal protection rights of the plaintiffs, who are owners of restaurants and caf\u00e9s that are subject to the ban. The plaintiffs contend that the legislation violates the mandates of equal protection because it bans smoking in restaurants and caf\u00e9s without banning smoking in casinos and private clubs, and this unequal treatment, the plaintiffs contend, does not bear a rational relationship to a legitimate public interest. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that, although the stated purpose of the ban was to remove secondhand smoke from workplaces, the ban was imposed on certain businesses, and not others, based on the type of liquor permit issued to the business, and this, the plaintiffs argue, bears no relationship to the nature of the workplace conditions. Because casinos and private clubs are not distinguishable from restaurants and caf\u00e9s in terms of their workplace conditions, the plaintiffs assert, the legislature\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>unequal treatment of these establishments violates equal protection principles. The plaintiffs further assert that the legal status of private clubs as \u201cprivate,\u201d as opposed to \u201cpublic,\u201d does not serve as a rational basis for different treatment because, the plaintiffs contend, they are as accessible to the public as are public establishments. The plaintiffs also contest the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the legislature rationally could exempt casinos from the smoking ban because of concerns about the enforceability of the ban at the casinos. The plaintiffs argue that the casinos expressly are subject to state law, and the legislature previously has passed legislation regulating the casinos. Thus, the plaintiffs claim, any concerns about enforceability do not constitute a rational basis for exempting casinos from the smoking ban. Finally, the plaintiffs aver that the state and federal equal protection clauses do not permit the legislature to exempt casinos from the smoking ban because of anticipated difficulty in passing the legislation if casinos were to be included.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The defendants respond that the trial court properly determined that the legislature\u2019s decision to exempt casinos and private clubs from the smoking ban was supported by a rational basis. Specifically, the defendants argue that exempting private clubs from the ban is justified by the fact that such clubs are distinguishable from restaurants and caf\u00e9s because state statutes provide that they are not open to the public and because the members of the club may have joined the club and paid their membership fees with the expectation that they would be able to smoke in the club facility. Moreover, the defendants contend, the exemption for casinos also satisfies rational basis review because the legislature reasonably could have chosen to exempt the casinos due to concern about the state\u2019s ability to enforce the legislation against the Indian tribes that own the casinos or out of sensitivity for the tribes\u2019 sovereign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>status and the tribes\u2019 economic and political relationships with the state, which result in millions of dollars a year in additional revenue for the state. We agree with the defendants and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We first set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cA motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading . . . and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court. As a result, our review of the court\u2019s ruling is plenary. . . . We take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint that has been stricken and we construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency. . . . [I]f facts provable in the complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied. . . . Thus, we assume the truth of both the specific factual allegations and any facts fairly provable thereunder. In doing so, moreover, we read the allegations broadly . . . rather than narrowly.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Greco </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>277 Conn. 337, 347, 890 A.2d 1269 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u201cIt is well established that when a [party\u2019s] claims involve a question of law, we review them de novo.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vakilzaden, </em>272 Conn. 762, 768-69, 865 A.2d 1155 (2005). The plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the smoking ban statute, thus raising a question of law that is subject to plenary review by this court. The plaintiffs specifically allege that the statute violates the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c[I]n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>general, as in any constitutional challenge to the validity of a statutory scheme, the [statutory scheme] is presumed constitutional . . . and [t]he burden is on the [party] attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>268 Conn. 508, 534, 847 A.2d 862, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 969, 125 S. Ct. 424, 160 L. Ed. 2d 340 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u201cWhen a statute is challenged on equal protection grounds . . . the reviewing court must first determine the standard by which the challenged statute\u2019s constitutional validity will be determined. If, in distinguishing between classes, the statute either intrudes on the exercise of a fundamental right or burdens a suspect class of persons, the court will apply a strict scrutiny standard [under which] the state must demonstrate that the challenged statute is necessary to the achievement of a compelling state interest. ... If the statute does not touch upon either a fundamental right or a suspect class, its classification need only be rationally related to some legitimate government purpose in order to withstand an equal protection challenge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>271 Conn. 808, 831, 860 A.2d 715 (2004).

Ed. 2d 211 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">We agree with the defendants that it is possible to conceive of plausible policy reasons for exempting casinos and private clubs from the smoking ban legislation. We consider first private clubs, which hold a legal status that is different from restaurants and caf\u00e9s. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 30-23<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 30-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>23a<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> impose restrictions on private clubs to which res<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>tain-ants and caf\u00e9s are not subject. Section 30-23 (a) limits the consumption of alcohol at clubs to members or their guests and \u00a7 30-23 (b) further requires that the club annually file with the department of consumer protection a list of members, updating the filing within ten days of the election of a new member. Section 30-23a provides that the inviting member must sign and date the club\u2019s guest book after having entered the name and address of the guest, and that this function of listing the guest\u2019s name may not be performed by the permittee or a person employed by the club to serve alcohol. Within the context of these legal restrictions, members of private clubs generally pay a membership fee with the expectation that they will be able to maintain their privacy and establish such conditions for the operation of the club that suit the needs and desires of the majority of the membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The legislature reasonably could have considered that among the conditions over which private club members may expect to exercise control is the regulation of smoking within the club facility. This consideration could have led the legislature to conclude that the imposition of a smoking ban on private clubs would upset unfairly this expectation of club members, as well as the financial investment upon which their expectation is based, and that this deprivation of the members\u2019 settled expectations would constitute an injustice that would outweigh any benefit to be derived from impos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ing the ban on such private facilities.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>legislature need not actually have been motivated by this policy consideration in order for this court to uphold the statute on that basis; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 535; our supposition that the legislature may have been so motivated is supported by the legislature\u2019s decision to exempt from the smoking ban only those private clubs that had obtained their liquor permits prior to the effective date of the legislation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This decision to exempt existing private clubs from the smoking ban, while imposing the ban on new private clubs, is consistent with our conclusion that the legislature reasonably may have been endeavoring to protect the financial investment and settled expectations of members of private clubs. We conclude that this policy consideration constitutes a rational basis for the legislature\u2019s decision to exempt existing private clubs from the smoking ban imposed on restaurants and caf\u00e9s.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>In support of their challenge to the exemption for private clubs, the plaintiffs rely upon two decisions by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>trial courts in other states. First, the plaintiffs cite a decision by a Rhode Island trial court granting a temporary restraining order that prevented, on equal protection grounds, the enforcement of a smoking ban that exempted private clubs. <em>Club 2000, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rhode Island, </em>Superior Court, Docket No. 05-135 (March 31, 2005). Subsequent to the court\u2019s decision, the Rhode <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Island legislature amended the statute to eliminate the exemption. The trial court\u2019s order provides no reasoning for its decision to grant the restraining order and thus is of little persuasive value.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The plaintiffs also rely upon a Maryland decision, <em>Anchor Inn Seafood Restaurant v. Montgomery County Council, </em>Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland, Docket No. 199692 (June 20, 2000), aff'd on other grounds, <em>Montgomery County v. Anchor Inn Seafood Restaurant, </em>374 Md. 327, 822 A.2d 429 (2003), in which the trial court struck down a county ordinance that banned smoking in restaurants and bars, but not in private clubs, as a violation of equal protection.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The trial court in that case was not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that the exemption was justified because private clubs are nonprofit entities, concluding that \u201c[although a non-profit entity may be treated differently for tax purposes, it is subject to the same health and safety regulations.\u201d Id., p. 11. This reasoning is not relevant to our current inquiry because, under Connecticut law, a private club is not necessarily a nonprofit organization, and the smoking ban exemption for private clubs does not distinguish based on the clubs\u2019 status in this regard. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 30-23 (c) and 19a-342 (b) (1) (E). The court in <em>Anchor Inn Seafood, Restaurant </em>does not appear to have considered other differences between private clubs and public facilities, such as the members\u2019 financial investment and concomitant expectations, which we find to constitute sufficient justification for the exemption. For these reasons, we find this case also unpersuasive.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">We consider next whether a rational basis exists for the exemption of casinos from the ban. Like private clubs, casinos also hold a different legal status from restaurants and caf\u00e9s. Connecticut casinos are located on Indian reservations and are operated by the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan tribes pursuant to gaming compacts between the state and the tribes. See 56 Fed. Reg. 24,996 (May 31, 1991); Opinions, Conn. Atty. Gen. No. 98-013 (July 31, 1998); <em>Kizis </em>v. <em>Morse Diesel International, Inc., </em>260 Conn. 46, 54-55, 794 A.2d 498 (2002). The tribes possess sovereignty rights over activities on tribal lands, and the state\u2019s power to regulate such activities is limited by federal law and, in the case of casino operations, the terms of the gaming compacts. See General Statutes \u00a7 47-59a; Opinions, Conn. Atty. Gen., supra, No. 98-013; <em>Kizis </em>v. <em>Morse Diesel International, Inc., </em>supra, 53 (\u201c[t]he exercise of tribal governing power may . . . preempt state law in areas where, absent tribal legislation, state law might otherwise apply\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). The state\u2019s ability to enforce a regulatory law that affects a casino on a reservation may be limited by the terms of the relevant compact or may be preempted by federal law. When considering whether a state law concerning liquor regulation may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>be applied on a reservation, the United States Supreme Court has indicated that it considers whether \u201csuch application would interfere with reservation self-government or would impair a right granted or reserved by federal law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rehner, </em>463 U.S. 713, 718, 103 S. Ct. 3291, 77 L. Ed. 2d 961 (1983). Moreover, the Supreme Court made this determination with due consideration of \u201cthe particular notions of sovereignty that have developed from historical traditions of tribal independence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 719. Thus, limitations on the state\u2019s power to regulate smoking in casinos may arise from multiple sources, namely, the terms of the gaming compact, federal law, or state deference to tribal sovereignty. In contrast, the state is not limited by any of these concerns in its regulation of restaurants and caf\u00e9s.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The plaintiffs contend that the state possesses the power to regulate smoking in the casinos because the gaming compacts do not forbid the exercise of that power and regulation that impacts only the casinos does not implicate tribal sovereignty. The precedent of the United States Supreme Court makes clear, however, that determination of the legislature\u2019s power to impose a particular regulation on a tribal entity requires a balancing of factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Moreover, even if the legislature held such power, it may encounter difficulty in the ability to enforce such aban. The case of <em>Dept. of Taxation &amp; Finance of New York </em>v. <em>Milhelm Attea &amp; Bros., Inc., </em>512 U.S. 61, 114 S. Ct. 2028, 129 L. Ed. 2d 52 (1994), and the proceedings that followed from it, are illustrative. In that case, the United States Supreme Court upheld the power of the state of New York to impose certain regulations on the sale of cigarettes on tribal land. Nevertheless, the state of New York declined to enforce the regulations and eventually repealed them. In an action brought by other tobacco sellers seeking to force New York to enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the regulations, an appeals court determined that the state\u2019s decision not to do so survived rational basis review because \u201cthe statutes cannot effectively be enforced without the cooperation of the Indian tribes.\u201d <em>New York Assn. of Convenience Stores </em>v. <em>Urbach, </em>275 App. Div. 2d 520, 522, 712 N.Y.S.2d 220 (2000). The court specifically noted the legal difficulties faced by the state in its enforcement efforts against the tribes. \u201cBecause of tribal immunity, the retailers cannot be sued for their failure to collect the taxes in question, and [s]tate auditors cannot go on the reservations to examine the retailers\u2019 records. Additionally, the [department of taxation and finance (department)] cannot compel the retailers to attend audits off the reservations or compel production of their books and records for the purpose of assessing taxes. In that regard, representatives of the [department engaged in extensive negotiations with the tribes in an effort to arrive at an acceptable agreement. Those efforts were largely unsuccessful and the vast majority of the Indian retailers refused to register with the [department. In further efforts to enforce the statute, the [s]tate attempted interdiction, i.e., interception of tobacco and motor fuel shipments and seizure of those shipments that were found to be in noncompliance with the [t]ax [l]aw. That strategy resulted in civil unrest, personal injuries and significant interference with public transportation on the [s]tate highways.\u201d Id., 522-23. Although we do not speculate that this state would face such difficulties if it were to attempt to impose and enforce the smoking ban in the casinos, we find the difficulties faced by New York to be illustrative of the way in which tribal sovereignty can complicate state efforts to impose regulation on the tribes, even when the state clearly holds the legal power to do so.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>We conclude that these uncertainties concerning the legislature\u2019s power to regulate, as well as the state\u2019s ability to enforce such a regulation, are sufficient to provide a rational basis for the legislature\u2019s decision to exempt the casinos from the ban. Moreover, we note that the legislature also rationally could have declined to impose the smoking ban on the casinos out of respect for the tribes\u2019 sovereignty or out of sensitivity to the economic and political relationships between the tribes and the state. The tribes hold legal status as sovereign nations, and they are partners in an economic arrangement with the state that provides the state coffers with a significant source of income. The legislature could have concluded, as a matter of public policy, that efforts to protect employees and others from secondhand smoke at the casinos are best pursued through voluntaiy efforts or negotiation and that, as valuable as such protections are, their benefits would be outweighed by the potential damage to the state\u2019s relationship with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the tribes should the state attempt to impose a smoking ban on the casinos without the tribes\u2019 consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Thus, we conclude that the legislature reasonably could have determined that the legal status of the casinos differs significantly from that of restaurants and caf\u00e9s and that this difference provides a rational basis for exempting them from the smoking ban legislation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">We therefore determine that \u00a7 19a-342 withstands the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional challenge on equal protection grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">In this opinion NORCOTT, KATZ and ZARELLA, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-13\"> The four plaintiffs are Diane Batte-Holmgren, Gina MacDonald and John Woermer, each of whom is an owner of a caf\u00e9 operating under a permit issued pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 30-22a, and Irving Nielsen, who is the owner of a restaurant with a permit issued pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 30-22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-6\"> The federal equal protection clause, \u00a7 1, of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, provides in relevant part: \u201cNo State shall make or enforce any law which shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Article first, \u00a7 20, of the constitution of Connecticut provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall be denied the equal protection of the law . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 19a-342 provides: \u201c(a) As used in this section, \u2018smoke\u2019 or \u2018smoking\u2019 means the lighting or carrying of alighted cigarette, cigar, pipe or similar device.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">\u201c(b) (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 31-40q, no person shall smoke: (A) In any building or portion of a building owned and operated or leased and operated by the state or any political subdivision thereof; (B) in any area of a health care institution; (C) in any area of a retail food store; (D) in any restaurant; (E) in any area of an establishment with a permit issued for the sale of alcoholic liquor pursuant to section 30-20a, 30-21, 30-21b, 30-22, 30-22c, 30-28, 30-28a, 30-33a, 30-33b, 30-35a, 30-37a, 30-37e or 30-37f, in any area of an establishment with a permit for the sale of alcoholic liquor pursuant to section 30-23 issued after May 1, 2003, and, on and after April 1, 2004, in any area of an establishment with a permit issued for the sale of alcoholic liquor pursuant to section 30-22a or 30-26 or the bar area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>of a bowling establishment holding a permit pursuant to subsection (a) of section 30-37c; (F) within a school building while school is in session or student activities are being conducted; (G) in any passenger elevator, provided no person shall be arrested for violating this subsection unless there is posted in such elevator a sign which indicates that smoking is prohibited by state law; (H) in any dormitory in any public or private institution of higher education; or (I) on and after April 1, 2004, in any area of a dog race track or a facility equipped with screens for the simulcasting of off-track betting race programs or jai alai games.

Thus, the dissent contends, any attempt by the legislature to protect such an expectation by exempting existing private clubs from the smoking ban would have been the improper product of speculation or unsupported legislative fact-finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">We disagree for two reasons. First, this argument ignores the nature of the source from which such a legislative conclusion flows. Specifically, a conclusion that private club members possess an expectation of privacy and control over their club arises directly from the law that governs such clubs. State law permits private clubs to elect a board of members to direct its affairs and to impose fees or dues to offset its expenses. The law not only assumes, but actually requires, that such clubs remain private, limiting their service of alcohol only to members and their invited guests who must be listed on the club\u2019s guest book by the signing member. Private clubs are further required to maintain and file with the state a current list of members. See footnotes 10 and 11 of this opinion. The statute makes clear that private clubs may not serve the public at large without violating the law. These statutory provisions would allow the legislature reasonably to conclude that members of private clubs epjoy an expectation of privacy and control over the operation of the club as a result of that membership. The statutes themselves justify such a conclusion; no further evidence or legislative fact-finding is necessary. Moreover, whether the legislature actually reached this conclusion is irrelevant to our analysis because rational basis review requires us to uphold the legislation \u201cif there is any <em>reasonably conceivable </em>state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 271 Conn. 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">We also disagree because of the standard of review and burden of proof applicable to such constitutional challenges. The United States Supreme Court has made clear that rational basis review is to be applied broadly, with great deference to legislative authority. \u201cIn the area of economics and social welfare, a [s]tate does not violate the [ejqual [protection [cjlause merely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect. If the classification has some reasonable basis it does not offend the [constitution simply because the classification is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States Railroad Retirement Board </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>449 U.S. 166, 175, 101 S. Ct. 453, 66 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1980). Even if the dissent were justified in complaining that the record does not establish that the smoking ban would impose a greater injury on private club members than on owners of restaurants and caf\u00e9s, equal protection law dictates that \u201c[i]t is not the function of the court to alter a legislative policy merely because it produces unfair results.\u201d <em>Ecker </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>205 Conn. 219, 241, 530 A.2d 1056 (1987); see <em>Federal Communications Commission </em>v. <em>Beach Communica</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number><em>tions, Inc., </em>supra, 508 U.S. 314 (\u201c[t]he [constitution presumes that, absent some reason to infer antipathy, even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process and that judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may think a political branch has acted\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). The applicable standard of review strongly favors constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The burden of proof in constitutional challenges also strongly supports upholding the legislation. As we have stated on numerous occasions, \u201c[t]he party claiming a constitutional violation bears the heavy burden of proving that the challenged policy has no reasonable relationship to <em>any </em>legitimate state purpose . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>264 Conn. 593, 615, 835 A.2d 895 (2003). \u201cLegislation is presumed to be constitutional, and a litigant challenging its validity has the heavy burden to establish its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Stafford Higgins Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 566. In the present case, the plaintiffs have failed to bear the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt the irrationality of a legislative conclusion that members of existing private clubs possess an expectation of control and privacy that justifies exempting such clubs from the smoking ban.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b324-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 19a-342 (b) (1) provides in relevant part that \u201cno person shall smoke ...

Having thus narrowly defined the purpose of the legislation, the dissent casts the exemption for private clubs as lacking a rational relationship to that narrow purpose and, therefore, as a violation of equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">We acknowledge that this court in prior cases has used language indicating that a classification must bear a rational relationship to the \u201cpurpose\u201d or \u201cobject\u201d of the legislation, using these terms in the singular, and thereby perhaps implying that legislation generally possesses a single, identifiable primary purpose, and that a classification is proper only if it serves the legislation\u2019s primary purpose. See, e.g., <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc. v. Stratford, </em>203 Conn. 14, 28-29, 523 A.2d 467 (1987) (\u201cclassifications must be based on natural and substantial differences, germane to the subject and purpose of the legislation\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>200 Conn. 562, 578, 512 A.2d 893 (1986) (classification \u201cmust rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). We note, however, that we often have used language, sometimes in the very same cases, that supports a contrary implication, i.e., that legislation often embodies multiple purposes and that a classification will withstand rational basis review if it bears a rational relationship to <em>any </em>legitimate state end. See, e.g., <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Southington, </em>259 Conn. 783, 795, 792 A.2d 76 (2002) (\u201cclassification and disparate treatment inherent in a statute [must] bear a rational relationship to a legitimate state end and [be] based on reasons related to the accomplishment of that goal\u201d); <em>Zapata </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>207 Conn. 496, 507, 542 A.2d 700 (1988) (same); <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra, 26-27 (same); <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>supra, 577 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">We take this opportunity to disavow any implication arising from past cases that a statutory classification must be rationally related to the statute\u2019s primary purpose in order to survive an equal protection challenge. As the United States Supreme Court has made clear, \u201csocial and economic legislation is valid unless the varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement of <em>any combination of legitimate purposes </em>that [a court] can only conclude that the legislature\u2019s actions were irrational.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hodel </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>452 U.S. 314, 332, 101 S. Ct. 2376, 69 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1981); see also <em>Federal Communications Commission </em>v. <em>Beach Communications, Inc., </em>supra, 508 U.S. 313-14 (under rational basis review, \u201c[w]here there are plausible reasons for [legislature\u2019s] action, our inquiry is at an end\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). A statutory classification will survive rational basis review pursuant to the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions if the purpose of that classification is rationally related to any legitimate public interest, even if that interest does not serve as the primary motivating interest for the legislation in which the classification is found. See <em>Coalition for Equal Rights, Inc. </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>458 F. Sup. 2d 1251, 1260 (D. Colo. 2006) (reviewing United States Supreme Court precedent and concluding that \u201cprevailing authority all supports the basic conclusion that legislatures have broad discretion to make economic and social distinctions in pursuit of valid public policy goals, and courts may strike such legislation only if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the distinctions are irrational and completely unrelated to any conceivable policy goal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The dissent\u2019s focus on a statute\u2019s primary purpose ignores the fact that the legislative process requires lawmakers to consider many public interests as they strive to achieve a particular legislative end. Attempts to balance differing public policies and interests are found throughout our body of statutory law. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 (b) (certain public records exempt from disclosure requirements of Freedom of Information Act); <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Vermilyn Brown, Inc., </em>232 Conn. 780, 789 n.14, 657 A.2d 616 (1995) (five year limitation period of Workers\u2019 Compensation Act reflects balancing of iqjured worker\u2019s interest in compensation and employer\u2019s interest in finite period of exposure to compensation claims); <em>State </em>v. <em>McVeigh, </em>224 Conn. 593, 611, 620 A.2d 133 (1993) (wiretap legislation enacted as necessary tool for law enforcement but narrowly drawn to protect individual liberties). As we recently noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>276 Conn. 633, 686, 888 A.2d 985, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1030, 127 S. Ct. 578, 166 L. Ed. 2d 428 (2006), criminal statutes of limitations represent a balancing of the state\u2019s interest in justice and an individual\u2019s interest in being \u201cfree from the continual threat of prosecution for past misconduct.\u201d (Intemal quotation marks omitted.) We therefore view the legislative product broadly, and deferentially, in undertaking rational basis review.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">This is consistent with our past practice. In <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>supra, 200 Conn. 575, the plaintiffs contended that the product liability statute of limitations, General Statutes \u00a7 52-577a, violated equal protection because employees were barred from suit after ten years and nonemployees were permitted to sue for the useful life of the product. This court upheld the classification, noting that the statute of limitations was enacted in response to manufacturers\u2019 increased difficulty obtaining insurance; id., 578; and that the classifications were a \u201ctrade-off\u2019 that reasonably balanced the individual right to recovery and the manufacturers\u2019 responsibility for their goods. Id., 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Similarly, in <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 29, the court rejected the equal protection claim that a Stratford town ordinance banning ice cream trucks irrationally distinguished between motorized vendors and mobile nonmotorized vendors. This court concluded that the town council reasonably could have determined that \u201cvending from nonmotor vehicles . . . presents less of an overall safety hazard to children than vending from motor vehicles.\u201d Id.; see also <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>169 Conn. 267, 295-98, 363 A.2d 1 (1975) (upholding statutory classification in no-fault motor vehicle insurance act), appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1041, 96 S. Ct. 763, 46 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b327-6\"> The Maryland Court of Appeals subsequently affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision on other grounds, without reaching the equal protection issue. See <em>Montgomery County </em>v. <em>Anchor Inn Seafood </em>Restaurant, supra, 374 Md. 327.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\"> The dissent emphasizes that the trial court in <em>Anchor Inn Seafood Restaurant </em>struck down the classification of public and private establishments because that distinction was not relevant to the public health purpose of the statute. We reject this reasoning of the Maryland trial court because, like the dissent in the present case, the court failed to acknowledge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>legislature\u2019s power to balance competing interests by exempting certain entities from regulatory obligations for reasons unrelated to the statute\u2019s primary objective. Moreover, as we previously have stated, the trial court in <em>Anchor Inn Seafood Restaurant </em>limited its rational basis review to the fact that, under Maryland tax law, private facilities are nonprofit entities and public facilities are operated for profit, finding this difference insufficient to justify exempting the private facilities from the smoking ban. See <em>Anchor Inn Seafood Restaurant </em>v. <em>Montgomery County Council, </em>supra, Circuit Court, Docket No. 199692, p. 11. The court did not consider the difference that we find persuasive, namely, that the statutory provisions governing private clubs have given rise to privacy and investment expectations that the legislature rationally could have sought to protect. Because the court in <em>Anchor Inn Seafood Restaurant </em>failed to consider this difference, which we find significant, the case further fails to influence our reasoning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b330-5\"> The dissent contends that an opinion issued by the attorney general subsequent to the enactment of the legislation makes \u201cperfectly clear\u201d that the state has the power to impose the smoking ban on the casinos. Even if that were true, the degree to which it is clear that a legislature possesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the power to pass legislation does not determine whether the legislature rationally may decline to enact that legislation over fears that its enforcement will be resisted. <em>See New York Assn. of Convenience Stores </em>v. <em>Urbach, </em>supra, 275 App. Div. 2d 521-23 (state\u2019s refusal to enforce regulations survived rational basis review because of enforcement difficulties arising from tribal sovereignty, despite fact that United States Supreme Court unequivocally had held that state possessed authority to enact regulations).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The dissent further claims that, because the tribes have not interfered with the state\u2019s enforcement of liquor and revenue laws pursuant to the gaming compacts, any legislative concern that the tribes would resist enforcement of the smoking ban is irrational.

The legislature rationally could fear that a new category of regulation imposed without negotiation or consent, unlike the gaming compacts, may arouse resentment and, possibly, resistance and legal challenges on the part of the tribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Moreover, the fact that the attorney general may have expressed his opinion that such regulation is lawful does not bind either the legislature or a future court to the same conclusion. <em>Wiseman </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>269 Conn. 802, 825, 850 A.2d 114 (2004) (attorney general opinion, while highly persuasive, not binding on court). Given the sensitive and careful analysis required to determine whether regulation of activities on tribal lands is permissible; see <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rehner, </em>supra, 463 U.S. 718-19; the legislature would have been justified in concluding that the legality of such regulation was not certain, absent a judicial determination of the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b332-10\"> We note that, in the only other case in which, to our knowledge, a court has considered an equal protection challenge to the exemption of casinos from a smoking ban, the court concluded that economic considerations were sufficient to satisfy rational basis review.

It is clear, for example, that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq., attempts to advance the interests of employees in obtaining prompt and fair compensation for their work-related injuries while simultaneously protecting employers by precluding other causes of action against them and limiting the amount of the employee\u2019s recovery.

Ct. 2096, 124 L. Ed. 2d 211 (1993). A statutory provision that exempts a particular class of persons because subjecting it to the statute would not appreciably advance the puipose of the legislation <em>is </em>related to the statutory purpose. The majority has failed, however, to explain how the legislative classification created by P.A. 03-45 advances <em>any </em>purpose <em>of the statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">To the extent that the majority suggests that a statutory classification may pass constitutional muster if it promotes <em>any </em>legitimate state purpose, related to the statute or not, I strongly disagree. Any such conclusion is entirely inconsistent with more than seventy-five years of this court\u2019s precedent and finds no other support in the case law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under such a standard, <em>any </em>legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>tive classification that exempts a particular class of persons from legislation would be constitutional, because the state <em>always </em>has a legitimate interest in relieving its citizens of the costs and burdens of state regulation. Although it is well established that courts must give great deference to legislative classifications, it has never been suggested that we should give <em>absolute </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>deference to the legislature. If, for example, the legislature had determined that, in order to reduce the burdens imposed by P.A. 03-45, caf\u00e9s and restaurants located in towns whose names contain an even number of letters would be exempt from the statute, surely that arbitrary classification could not be saved by the fact that it promoted a legitimate public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">I would conclude that there is no relationship between the classification created by P.A. 03-45 and the purpose of the statute. Indeed, I would conclude that the public interests identified by the majority in support of its conclusion that such a relationship exists,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> namely, protecting the purported privacy interests of private club members and avoiding a confrontation with the Indian tribes, are purely illusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">With respect to the exemption for private clubs, the trial court relied solely on the legislative history of P.A. 03-45 in support of its conclusion that the exemption was constitutional. Representative Art Feltman argued in support of the exemption for private clubs that \u201cwe consider these establishments to be the extension of people\u2019s private homes. They\u2019re membership organizations, people have to pay dues to belong to them, they have fixed memberships, and it\u2019s as if these people were gathering in their living rooms. And so that\u2019s why we consider this part of the private domain, not the public domain. They are not open to the public.\u201d 46 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 2003 Sess., p. 2409. He also indicated that, \u201c[t]he existing [private] clubs are not included in this bill. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>consider them to be part of the private domain and what we\u2019re trying to regulate here is the public domain.\u201d Id., p. 2423. The trial court concluded that this classification was constitutional because \u201c[p]rivate clubs and associations are frequently subject to different laws and legal requirements than public locations. The law recognizes that they can be regulated differently. The legislature\u2019s decision to exempt certain private clubs from the ban is a manifestation of this.\u201d In their brief to this court, the defendants<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> argue that the classification was justified because \u201cmembers may have joined [private clubs] for a fee with the expectation that they could smoke . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In my view, the trial court, the defendants and the majority all have failed to articulate any \u201cground of difference <em>having a fair and substantial relation </em>to the object of [P.A. 03-45] . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>supra, 200 Conn. 578. Instead, they simply have begged the question by assuming that <em>any </em>difference between disparately treated classes justifies the disparate treatment. The defendants concede, and there is no dispute, that \u201cthe intent of [P.A. 03-45] was to protect employees, especially those with little choice as to where they work, from being subjected to [exposure to carcinogenic secondhand smoke] as a condition of their employment.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>1 cannot conceive of any rational relationship between this purpose and providing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>exemption for establishments that puiportedly were founded with the expectation that smoking would continue to be permitted there. There is no evidence in the record that private clubs have fewer employees than the establishments that are subject to the act or that their employees are somehow less susceptible to the ill effects of secondhand smoke than other employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Moreover, there is absolutely no evidence in the record that the members of the private clubs formed or invested in the clubs with the expectation that smoking would be allowed there or, if they did, that any such expectation was reasonable. Representative Feltman stated only that private clubs were exempted because they were not in the \u201cpublic domain,\u201d but were like private \u201cliving rooms.\u201d 46 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 2409. Although I recognize that this court gives deference to legislative fact-finding, I do not believe that we must defer to a finding that is contrary to all common sense and experience. Living rooms in private residences do not by their nature require the presence of full-time employees or have continually changing membership lists, and generally do not welcome a stream of \u201cguests\u201d who are unknown to most, if not all, of the household residents.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For these reasons, private living rooms, unlike private clubs, generally are not subject to workplace safety and other health and employment laws.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There simply is no basis for the conclusion that the members of private clubs had a reasonable expectation that they would be exempt from this particular law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>governing workplace safety, despite the fact that clubs generally are subject to the same laws as other employers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See Anchor Inn Seafood Restaurant </em>v. <em>Montgomery County, </em>Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland, Docket No. 199692 (June 20, 2000) p. 11 (finding no rational basis for exempting clubs from smoking ban when clubs were subject to same health and safety regulations as nonexempt establishments), aff'd on other grounds, <em>Montgomery County </em>v. <em>Anchor Inn Seafood Restaurant, </em>374 Md. 327, 822 A.2d 429 (2003).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>The defendants have cited no authority for the proposition that unfounded expectations of privacy can form a constitutional basis for a legislative classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In any event, even if the members of private clubs have an investment backed expectation that the conditions under which they made their investment would continue, that does not distinguish them from the proprietors of the establishments that are subject to the smoking ban. Again, it is a matter of common sense and experience that many restaurants and caf\u00e9s that are subject to the ban have built up regular clienteles over time, and those clienteles have certain expectations. If their expectations are thwarted by state regulation, the clienteles presumably will move on to unregulated venues where they can pursue their chosen activities unhampered. It is true that the clienteles will not suffer any loss of investment, but only because <em>the proprietors of the regulated establishments will bear the entire loss. </em>Thus, the difference between private clubs and nonexempt restaurants and caf\u00e9s, in this context, is that, in private clubs, the loss of investment backed expectation for each individual member as a result of the smoking ban would be relatively small, but would be bom by a relatively large number of individuals, while, in restaurants and caf\u00e9s owned by a single individual, that single individual will bear the entire loss. It is beyond my comprehension why this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>distinction constitutes a rational basis for exempting private clubs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The defendants argue that \u201cit does not violate equal protection for a legislature to address a problem one step at a time . . . .\u201d See <em>Justiana </em>v. <em>Niagara County Dept. of Health, </em>45 F. Sup. 2d 236, 242 (W.D.N.Y. 1999) (upholding constitutionality of partial smoking ban on ground that \u201ca legislature can address a perceived problem incrementally if in its judgment that is the best way to address the problem\u201d), citing <em>Federal Communications Commission </em>v. <em>Beach Communications, Inc., </em>supra, 508 U.S. 316 (legislature \u201c \u2018may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind\u2019 \u201d). As the defendants conceded at oral argument before this court, however, if a legislative classification is not rationally related to the purpose of the legislation in the first instance, a claim that the legislature has taken an incremental approach to a perceived problem will not save the classification. For example, if it would be unconstitutional for the legislature to address the problem of excessive speed on state highways by setting a speed limit of fifty-five for all vehicles except for sports cars in which the owner had an investment backed expectation in driving at a high rate of speed, the classification would not be saved by a claim that sports cars eventually could be subject to the prohibition. Because I see no rational basis for the exemption to the smoking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ban for private clubs, I would conclude that the state\u2019s \u201cone step at a time\u201d argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that there is a rational basis for exempting casinos from the smoking ban. The majority bases its conclusion on two premises: first, the majority claims that it is unclear whether the legislature has the power to impose the smoking ban on a tribal entity and, second, the majority concludes that \u201ctribal sovereignty can complicate state efforts to impose regulation on the tribes, even when the state clearly holds the legal power to do so.\u201d Neither premise survives scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">On October 1, 2003, the attorney general rendered a written opinion in response to an inquiry by Senator Louis C. DeLuca as to whether P.A. 03-45 applies to the casinos. In that opinion, the attorney general indicated that under \u00a7 14 of the state\u2019s gaming compacts with the Indian tribes, \u201c \u2018[t]ribal ordinances and regulations governing health and safety standards applicable to the gaming facilities shall be no less rigorous than standards generally imposed by the laws and regulations of the [s]tate relating to public facilities with regard to building, sanitary, and health standards and fire safety.\u2019 \u201d The attorney general stated that, although the phrase \u201c \u2018health and safety standards\u2019 \u201d was not specifically defined in the compacts, \u201cby its terms, [it] applies broadly to include all of the [s]tate\u2019s health and safety laws. The smoking ban legislation involves an obvious and important health issue, and therefore, implicates application of [this provision].\u201d The attorney general concluded, however, that, because the legislature had not included the special liquor permits for casinos in the list of permits covered by P.A. 03-45, the state had not banned smoking in the casinos and, accordingly, the compacts did not require the tribes to ban smoking in the casinos.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>It is perfectly clear, therefore, that the legislature has the power to include casinos in the smoking ban.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, I am not persuaded by the defendants\u2019 argument that, because the attorney general did not render this opinion until after P.A. 03-45 had been enacted, the legislature could not have known that it had such power. Even if it were plausible that the legislature was not aware of the legal import of the gaming compacts, the defendants cite no authority for the proposition that the legislature\u2019s claimed ignorance of its own clear legal authority can form a constitutional basis for an otherwise unconstitutional classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Nor am I persuaded that the enforcement of the smoking ban in the casinos would be unduly complicated by the sovereign status of the tribes. The office of legislative research has indicated that, as of August 10, 2001, in order to enforce the provisions of the gaming compacts, the state had stationed at the two casinos thirteen liaison officers from the department of special revenue, nine liquor control agents and twenty-nine state police officers. Office of Legislative Research, Research Report, August 10, 2001, 2001-R-0635, p. 1. The office of legislative research also has indicated that \u201c[t]he state assesses the tribes and the tribes reimburse it for all the direct and indirect costs associated with the casino-related functions the agencies provide.\u201d Id. There is absolutely no evidence in the record that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>tribes ever have interfered with these agents of the state or resisted in any way the enforcement of the provisions of the gaming compacts requiring the casinos to comply with state health and safety laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The fact that other Indian tribes have resisted different, and at least colorably illegal, state regulations governing activities that take place within tribal territories where agents of the state are barred from entering for purposes of law enforcement does not affect my conclusion. See <em>New York Assn. of Convenience Stores </em>v. Urbach, 275 App. Div. 2d 520, 522, 712 N.Y.S.2d 220 (2000) (state\u2019s decision not to enforce regulations governing sale of cigarettes on tribal land had rational basis because tribes refused to cooperate with state and enforcement was impossible without tribes\u2019 cooperation).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The record in the present case provides no support for a conclusion that enforcement of the smoking ban in the casinos would face insuperable, or even mildly challenging, legal or practical barriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The defendants finally argue that \u201cthe relationship between the state and the tribes is complicated by eco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>nomic and political concerns because the casinos contribute millions of dollars a year to the state\u2019s treasury.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> They point out that the plaintiffs argued to the trial court that, \u201c \u2018[h]ad the smoking ban applied equally to bars and restaurants in clubs and casinos, neither the public act nor its sponsors would have survived the political fallout,\u2019 \u201d and contend that, \u201c[although there is no evidence that this concern was in fact the true basis for exempting casinos from the ban, it is clearly a conceivable, rational basis for the exemption.\u201d As I have indicated, far from being a rational basis for a legislative classification, legislative maneuvering to avoid the political fallout of imposing burdensome legislation on a politically powerful group is precisely what the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions were designed to prevent. See <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Connecticut Personnel Appeal Board, </em>supra, 170 Conn. 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In summary, to the extent that the legislative classification created by P.A. 03-45 can be explained at all, it can only be explained, on the one hand, by purely speculative or simply unsupportable legislative fact-finding, or, on the other hand, by entirely improper political considerations. I recognize that \u201c[t]he burden is on the [party] attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>268 Conn. 508, 534, 847 A.2d 862, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 969, 125 S. Ct. 424, 160 L. Ed. 2d 340 (2004). I continue to believe, however, not just <em>any </em>conceivable distinction between disparately treated groups that can be articulated may serve as a constitutional basis for a legislative classification. Rather, the distinction must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>be <em>rationally </em>related to a <em>legitimate </em>government purpose.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>supra, 200 Conn. 577. Sheer speculation and error are not rational, and selective avoidance of political fallout is not a legitimate legislative purpose. I would conclude that the exemption of private clubs and casinos from the scope of P.A. 03-45 violates the equal protections clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-11\"> The plaintiffs, Diane Batte-Holmgren, Gina MacDonald, John Woermer and Irving Nielsen, are owners of businesses affected by legislation banning smoking in restaurants, caf\u00e9s and certain public areas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-12\"> See footnote 3 of the majority opinion for the text of \u00a7 19a-342.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\"> The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, \u00a7 1, provides in relevant part: \u201cNo State shall make or enforce any law which shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Article first, \u00a7 20, of the constitution of Connecticut provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall be denied the equal protection of the law . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b335-6\"> \u201cIt is not every act, legislative in form, that is law.

As I have indicated, I have no quarrel with that conclusion. Those cases also clearly support a conclusion, however, that a statutory classification must be related to <em>some </em>statutory purpose. The issue in <em>Daily </em>was whether employees who were injured by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>a defective product in the course of their employment constitutionally were entitled to the same procedural rights under the product liability statute as nonemployees who were injured by a defective product. <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>supra, 575-76. In determining that a ten year statute of repose should apply to employees, the legislature reasoned, in part, that even after the expiration of the statute of repose, the employees could receive prompt compensation for their injuries under the workers\u2019 compensation act, without any need to prove fault or liability. Id., 579. This court specifically concluded that the classification rested \u201cupon a difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation\u201d; id.; which, presumably, was to provide fair, orderly and efficient procedures for persons who are injured by defective products to obtain compensation for their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">In <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 25-26, this court considered the constitutionality of an ordinance that prohibited vending from motor vehicles, but not from fixed locations or nonmotor vehicles.

This court specifically concluded that \u201cthe challenged classification is rationally related to the purpose of the ordinance\u201d; id., 28; because the town reasonably could have concluded that vending from nonmotor vehicles had \u201cless of an impact on the free flow of traffic and presents less of an overall safety hazard to children than vending from motor vehicles.\u201d Id., 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Hodel </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>452 U.S. 314, 332-33, 101 S.

The United States Supreme Court specifically found in those cases that the challenged statutory classifications were rationally related to the underlying purposes of the statutes.

I would agree that relieving corporate citizens of the burdens of state regulation is a legitimate public purpose. I also cannot disagree with the tautology that exempting private clubs and casinos from P.A. 03-45 relieves them of the burdens imposed by the statute.

That argument is purely conclusory. My very point is that the fact that the members of a private club are statutorily entitled to choose and to limit the club\u2019s membership reasonably cannot give rise to a reasonable expectation that the club will be exempt from any particular law governing workplace health and safety. Indeed, the legislature itself implicitly acknowledged as much when it determined that clubs whose permits were issued after May 1, 2003, would be subject to the smoking ban. I have no doubt that many private club members would prefer that their clubs be exempt from any burdensome state regulation. I fail to see, however, how that bare preference can form a constitutional basis for a legislative classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The majority continues to beg the question when it argues that \u201c \u2018[i]t is not the function of the court to alter a legislative policy merely because it produces unfair results\u2019 <em>Ecker </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 241; immediately after pointing out that \u201c \u2018[i]f the classification <em>has some reasonable basis, </em>it does not offend the [constitution simply because the classification is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>United States Railroad Retirement Board </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>449 U.S. 166, 175, 101 S.

Again, my point is that an entity\u2019s unfounded expectation that it will be exempted from general public laws cannot form a reasonable basis for any legislative classification. The fact that this law is patently unfair to restaurant and caf\u00e9 owners \u2014 a point with which the majority appears to agree \u2014 does not form the sole basis for my argument that it is unconstitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\"> The majority states that the reasoning of the court in <em>Anchor Inn Seafood Restaurant </em>\u201cis not relevant to our current inquiry because, under Connecticut law, a private club is not necessarily a nonprofit organization, and the smoking ban exemption for private clubs does not distinguish based on the clubs\u2019 status in this regard.\u201d As the majority acknowledges, however, in concluding that the exemption of nonprofit clubs from the smoking ban <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>had no rational basis, the Maryland court reasoned that the fact that the clubs were nonprofit did not rationally distinguish them from the nonexempt establishments in this context because <em>nonprofit entities were subject to the same general health and safety regulations as for-profit entities. </em>Similarly, in the present case, the purported privacy expectations of the members of private clubs do not rationally distinguish private clubs from nonexempt establishments when those privacy expectations have not prevented private clubs from being subject to other generally applicable laws governing employment and workplace safety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b343-6\"><em> </em>It does suggest a <em>political </em>motivation for the exemption, however. As long as any individual who wants to smoke while he drinks can find an establishment where he is allowed to do so, the burden imposed by the smoking ban on such individuals will be relatively light. Because there presumably are many more such individuals than there are proprietors of establishments that are subject to the ban, exempting certain establishments allows the legislature to gratify the political proponents of the ban while insulating itself from political backlash from opponents. As I have indicated, a primary purpose of the equal protection clauses is to prevent such politically motivated classifications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b345-6\"> The majority, relying on <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rehner, </em>463 U.S. 713, 718-19, 103 S.

In <em>Rice, </em>however, the question was whether a particular state law unilaterally could be imposed on a tribal entity in light of general principles of tribal sovereignty and immunity. Id., 715. In the present case, the legislature was not confronted with that admittedly thorny issue. Rather, the question of whether it had authority to impose a smoking ban involved the construction of an agreement between the tribal entities and the state that was clear on its face.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b346-7\"> The court in <em>New York Assn. of Convenience Stores </em>stated that \u201c[t]he record here clearly reflects such a state of facts, as it makes plain that the statutes cannot effectively be enforced without the cooperation of the Indian tribes. Because of tribal immunity, the [tribal] retailers cannot be sued for their failure to collect the taxes in question, and [s]tate auditors cannot go on the reservations to examine the retailers\u2019 records.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">\u201cAdditionally, the [department [of taxation and finance (department)] cannot compel the retailers to attend audits off the reservations or compel production of their books and records for the purpose of assessing taxes. In that regard, representatives of the [djepartment engaged in extensive negotiations with the tribes in an effort to arrive at an acceptable agreement. Those efforts were largely unsuccessfiil and the vast majority of the Indian retailers refused to register with the [djepartment. In further efforts to enforce the statute, the [s]tate attempted interdiction, i.e., interception of tobacco and motor fuel shipments and seizure of those shipments that were found to be in noncompliance with the [t]ax [l]aw. That strategy resulted in civil unrest, personal injuries and significant interference with public transportation on the [s]tate highways.\u201d <em>New York Assn. of Convenience Stores </em>v. <em>Urbach, </em>supra, 275 App. Div. 2d 522-23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b347-6\"> The record reflects that, from the 1992-1993 fiscal year through the 2000-2001 fiscal year, the tribes contributed approximately $1.8 billion to the state pursuant to agreements with the state governing revenue from slot machines. Office of Legislative Research, supra, p. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b348-9\"> The majority relies on <em>Coalition for Equal Rights, Inc. </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>458 F. Sup. 2d 1251, 1256 (D. Colo. 2006), in support of its conclusion that P.A. 03-45 is constitutional. In that case, the United States District Court for the District of Colorado concluded that a smoking ban that exempted casinos did not violate the equal protection clause. Id., 1261. In reaching that conclusion, the court expressly rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that a legislative classification must be substantially related to the purpose of the legislation. Id., 1259-60. The court determined that the party challenging the constitutionality of a classification must show that it is \u201cirrational and <em>completely </em>unrelated to <em>any conceivable </em>policy goal.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 1260. As I have indicated, up to now this court consistently, and in my view, correctly, has held that, to pass constitutional muster, legislative classifications must be rationally and substantially related to the purpose of the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">As I have indicated, the legislature may, of course, address the worst aspects of a particular problem first. It is possible, for example, that the legislature could ban smoking in all elementary schools but not in colleges and universities on the ground that exposure to secondhand smoke is more dangerous to children than to adults. There is no suggestion in the present case, however, that the exemption of private clubs and casinos has any such purpose or effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
