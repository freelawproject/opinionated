Bletsch, appeals, following our grant of certification, from the judgment of the Appellate Court affirming the judgments of conviction of three counts of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (l)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and two counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53-21.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Bletsch, 86 Conn. App. 186, 187-88, 860 A.2d 1239 (2004). The defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that: (1) the trial court had not abused its discretion in denying his motion for an exemption from the Connecticut sex offender registry;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>and (2) his conviction in one case for both sexual assault in the second degree and risk of injury to a child for the same act did not constitute a violation of the double jeopardy clause.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that the Appellate Court properly determined that the trial court reasonably had concluded that the defendant was not entitled to an exemption from the sex offender registry. As to the defendant\u2019s second claim on appeal, we conclude that there was no double jeopardy violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The Appellate Court opinion sets forth the following pertinent facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cIn the fall of 1999, the defendant, whose date of birth is October 14, 1981, engaged in sexual encounters with two females who were younger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>than sixteen years of age. At that time, he was more than two years older than those minors. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1). The defendant was subsequently charged in two separate cases, hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Danielson\u2019 and \u2018Norwich\u2019 cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u201cThe Danielson case involved a sexual encounter between the defendant and the first victim<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that occurred on October 4, 1999. The victim was fifteen years old at the time. After speaking to her on the telephone, the defendant arrived at the victim\u2019s home at approximately 1:48 a.m. with a friend, Sean Gauthier. The defendant had been drinking alcohol that evening, and Gauthier stated that the defendant went there for the express purpose of having sexual relations with the victim. After entering her bedroom, the defendant pushed the victim onto the bed and rubbed his penis on her face and tried to make her suck it. The victim refused, and the defendant left.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\u201cThe Norwich case involved two sexual encounters between the defendant and a second victim on November 19 and 27, 1999. The Norwich victim was fourteen years old at the time. During both encounters, the defendant requested that the victim engage in oral sex with him, to which she acquiesced. During the November 27 encounter, the defendant digitally penetrated her vagina with his fingers. The defendant also unsuccessfully attempted to have vaginal intercourse with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">\u201cThe defendant was charged by substitute information in the Norwich case with two counts of sexual assault in the second degree and two counts of risk of injury to a child. After a trial by jury, the defendant was convicted on all counts. Thereafter, in the Danielson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>case, he pleaded guilty, under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to sexual assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u201cAt a sentencing hearing, the court heard testimony from the defendant\u2019s family and friends, and received several letters on his behalf.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court also heard that on September 1, 2000, the defendant had been arrested after he approached an undercover police officer who was posing as a prostitute and solicited a sexual act from her in exchange for $20.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In sentencing the defendant, the court emphasized that the present matter involved three separate incidents of sexual assault and consequently sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of five years imprisonment, execution suspended after eighteen months, with ten years probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>pursuant to twelve specific conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Bletsch, </em>supra, 86 Conn. App. 188-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">At sentencing, the defendant made a motion for an exemption from the Connecticut sex offender registry, claiming that he was entitled to the exemption because he was under nineteen at the time of the offenses, the sexual activities at issue in the charges were consensual in nature and he did not pose a risk to the public. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s request, the trial court reasoned that it was \u201csignificant that the Danielson matter occurred during the same period of time. And perhaps had it been one or the other of these instances, the court might have been more inclined to accept your argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">It is from these judgments that the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court. He first claimed that the trial court had abused its discretion in denying his motion for an exemption from the Connecticut sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>offender registry. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bletsch, </em>supra, 86 Conn. App. 191. Specifically, the defendant claimed that, because he was younger than nineteen years of age at the time of the offenses and because he posed no risk to public safety, the trial court was <em>required </em>to exempt him from the sex offender registry. The Appellate Court noted that this issue was one of first impression, thus requiring it both to construe the exemption under General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 54-251 and to apply that construction to the facts of the case. Id. The Appellate Court determined that the two factors under \u00a7 54-251 were not dispositive, but, rather, were threshold determinations that must be made before the court considers whether an exemption is appropriate. Id., 193. The court further concluded that, even if those two factors were satisfied in a given case, the trial court still retained discretion to determine whether an exemption was warranted. Id. Accordingly, the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s determination of whether to exempt an individual from the registration requirements under \u00a7 54-251 (b) is properly reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. Id., 192. Because the record in the present case supported the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant did indeed pose a risk to public safety, the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court properly had denied the defendant\u2019s exemption request. Id., 193. Specifically, the Appellate Court noted that, despite the defendant\u2019s repeated characterizations of the sexual assaults as \u201cconsensual,\u201d the victim\u2019s statement in the application for the defendant\u2019s arrest warrant in the Danielson case alleged that the defendant had \u201cforced himself\u2019 on her and that the victim had \u201crepeatedly told him to stop and tried pushing him away.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The defendant also claimed that the trial court had violated his rights against double jeopardy in convicting him of both second degree sexual assault and risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>injury to a child in connection with a single offense. Id., 194. The Appellate Court disagreed, concluding that the defendant could not prevail on this unpreserved claim because he could not establish that the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists, as required under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Specifically, the court determined that, because under existing precedent the elements necessary for conviction of risk of injury and sexual assault in the second degree are different, his double jeopardy rights were not violated. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bletsch, </em>supra, 86 Conn. App. 195. This certified appeal followed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The defendant first claims that the Appellate Court should have determined that the trial court had acted improperly when it found that he posed a risk to public safety, and when, accordingly, it improperly determined that he was neither eligible for, nor deserving of, the statutory exemption to the sex offender registration requirement. Specifically, the defendant contends that, under the facts and circumstances properly considered by the trial court at his sentencing, the trial court should have determined that the consensual sexual activity for which he was charged, prosecuted and punished, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\u201cprecisely th[e] type of situation [the legislature had] in mind when it created an exemption from registration, and, [that accordingly], the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for exemption.\u201d In regard to his second claim, the defendant asserts that the Appellate Court applied an improper standard to the double jeopardy issue and that, because it is not possible to have sexual intercourse with a child as proscribed under \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) other than in the manner proscribed under \u00a7 53-21, his double jeopardy rights had indeed been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The state contends in response to the defendant\u2019s first claim that the record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant posed a risk to public safety and that its decision not to exempt him from the sex offender registry was proper. The state contends in response to the defendant\u2019s second claim that, because each statute of which the defendant was convicted contains an essential element that the other does not, his double jeopardy rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">As to its resolution of the defendant\u2019s first claim, we agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 54-251, concluding that the two factors prescribed therein \u2014 the offender was younger than nineteen years of age at the time of the offenses and posed no risk to public safety \u2014 did not <em>require </em>the trial court to exempt the defendant from the sex offender registry, but merely allowed the trial court to consider whether to exempt him from the registry. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bletsch, </em>supra, 86 Conn. App. 193. We further agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court reasonably rejected the defendant\u2019s request for exemption based upon its determination that registration was necessary for public safety purposes. As to the defendant\u2019s second claim on appeal, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The Appellate Court\u2019s determination in this case as to the defendant\u2019s eligibility for exemption from the registry requirement under \u00a7 54-251 depends first on its statutory interpretation and then on its application of that interpretation to the facts of this case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, \u201c[t]he [threshold] issue before this court involves a question of statutory interpretation that . . . requires our plenary review. . . . When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cogan </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Auto Financial Corp., </em>276 Conn. 1, 7, 882 A.2d 597 (2005). Neither party has claimed that the statute is plain and unambiguous as applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>We begin with the statute. General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 54-251 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any person who has been convicted ... of a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor . . . and is released into the community on or after October 1, 1998, shall, within three days following such release . . . register . . . with the Commissioner of Public Safety . . . and shall maintain such registration for ten years . . . . (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the court may exempt any person who has been convicted ... of a violation of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 53a-71 from the registration requirements of this section if the court finds that such person was under nineteen years of age at the time of the offense and that registration is not required for public safety. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Therefore, because \u00a7 54-251 (b) provides that the court may exempt a person convicted under specified circumstances \u201cif\u2019 the court makes certain findings, namely, that the \u201cperson was under nineteen years of age at the time of the offense and that registration is not required for public safety,\u201d like the Appellate Court, we read these two factors as threshold determinations that must be satisfied before the trial court may consider whether to exempt the offender from the sex offender registry. Moreover, we consistently have held that, as opposed to \u201c[definitive words, such as must or shall, [which] ordinarily express legislative mandates of a nondirectory nature\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Lostritto </em>v. <em>Community Action Agency of New Haven, Inc., </em>269 Conn. 10, 20, 848 A.2d 418 (2004); the word \u201cmay\u201d imports permissive conduct and the conferral of discretion. <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 531, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002); <em>Office of Consumer Counsel </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>252 Conn. 115, 122, 742 A.2d 1257 (2000); <em>Seals </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>186 Conn. 337, 345-47, 441 A.2d 604 (1982); see <em>Lesser </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>v. <em>Lesser, </em>134 Conn. 418, 425, 58 A.2d 512 (1948); <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Hollister, </em>131 Conn. 34, 38-39, 37 A.2d 695 (1944). Only when the context of legislation permits such interpretation and if the interpretation is necessary to make a legislative enactment effective to carry out its purposes, should the word \u201cmay\u201d be interpreted as mandatory rather than directory. <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Retirement Board, </em>57 Conn. App. 751, 764, 750 A.2d 1139, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 902, 755 A.2d 217 (2000); see <em>Karp </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>162 Conn. 525, 530, 294 A.2d 633 (1972); <em>State ex rel. Markley </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>130 Conn. 88, 93-94, 32 A.2d 58 (1943); <em>Lake Garda Co. </em>v. <em>LeWitt, </em>126 Conn. 588, 590-91, 13 A.2d 510 (1940). Thus, under the \u201cmay exempt\u201d language in \u00a7 54-251 (b), even when the two enumerated factors are satisfied in a given case, the court still may decline to grant the registry exemption. See 42 H.R. Proc., Pt. 11,1999 Sess., p. 3884, remarks of Representative Michael P. Lawlor (\u201c[i]f the court makes a finding that public safety could still be protected without publicizing the name then [the statute] would give very limited discretion to the judge to waive the public aspect of the Megan\u2019s Law registration\u201d); see also footnote 18 of this opinion setting forth additional legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Having interpreted \u00a7 54-251, before we turn to the application of our interpretation to the facts of this case, we begin with the standard of review. Whether the offender is under the age of nineteen at the time of the offense is an issue of fact that requires little discussion in general, and is not in dispute in this case. Turning next to whether an offender poses a risk to public safety and whether, even if that question is answered in the negative, the trial court, nevertheless, may deny an exemption request, it is apparent that the trial court first must make factual findings and then must exercise its discretion. In other words, if, based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>on the facts and circumstances properly before it,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the trial court finds that the offender was under the age of nineteen at the time of the offense and poses no risk to public safety, it nevertheless retains discretion to determine whether an exemption is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The trial court\u2019s findings of fact are entitled to great deference and will be overturned only upon a showing that they were clearly erroneous. See <em>Napoletano </em>v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 216, 232, 680 A.2d 127 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1103, 117 S. Ct. 1106, 137 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1997). If a trial court properly finds that the defendant meets the age requirement and does not pose a safety risk, it then makes the determination regarding exemption, which will be upset only for a manifest abuse of discretion. \u201cWhen reviewing claims under an abuse of discretion standard, the unquestioned rule is that great weight is due to the action of the trial court and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schilberg Integrated Metals Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>263 Conn. 245, 274, 819 A.2d 773 (2003). \u201cIn determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>244 Conn. 158, 175, 708 A.2d 949 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Therefore, the question we turn to next is whether the trial court reasonably determined that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>did indeed pose a risk to public safety. Before we can answer that inquiry, however, we must address one last standard \u2014 what a trial court properly may consider in making that factual finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Our law in this area is well settled. \u201cA sentencing judge has very broad discretion in imposing any sentence within the statutory limits and in exercising that discretion he may and should consider matters that would not be admissible at trial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sweig, </em>454 F.2d 181, 183-84 (2d Cir. 1972). ... To arrive at a just sentence, a sentencing judge may consider information that would be inadmissible for the purpose of determining guilt; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baylin, </em>696 F.2d 1030, 1039 (3d Cir. 1982); [and] evidence of crimes for which the defendant was indicted but neither tried nor convicted; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bowdach, </em>561 F.2d 1160, 1175 (5th Cir. 1977) .... Generally, due process does not require that information considered by the trial judge prior to sentencing meet the same high procedural standard as evidence introduced at trial. Rather, judges may consider a wide variety of information. . . . <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robelo, </em>596 F.2d 868, 870 (9th Cir. 1979). Consistent with due process the trial court may consider responsible unsworn or out-of-court information relative to the circumstances of the crime and to the convicted person\u2019s life and circumstance. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>358 U.S. 576, 584, 79 S. Ct. 421, 3 L. Ed. 2d 516 (1959). It is a fundamental sentencing principle that a sentencing judge may appropriately conduct an inquiry broad in scope, and largely unlimited either as to the kind of information he may consider or the source from which it may come. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 446, 92 S. Ct. 589, 30 L. Ed. 2d 592 (1972). . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Huey, </em>199 Conn. 121, 126-27, 505 A.2d 1242 (1986).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Eric M., </em>271 Conn. 641, 649-50, 858 A.2d 767 (2004). Finally, although a trial court\u2019s discretion is not com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>pletely unfettered, and information may be considered as a basis for a sentence only if it has some minimal indicium of reliability, we have stated that \u201c[a]s long as the sentencing judge has a reasonable, persuasive basis for relying on the information which he uses to fashion his ultimate sentence, an appellate court should not interfere with his discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Huey, supra, 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The defendant acknowledges this sweeping standard, but claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court reasonably could have relied on facts alleged by the victim in the Danielson case in the arrest warrant as a basis for its finding that the defendant poses a risk to public safety. Specifically, he contends that, because the victim\u2019s statements describing the event, which alleged that the defendant had acted with force and without her consent,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> had not been sworn to, the trial court properly could not rely on them. We disagree. It is well settled that trial judges \u201cmay examine any reliable evidence, including that which was not introduced at trial . . . and may consider a wide range of facts concerning a defendant\u2019s character and his crime.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Williams </em>v. <em>United States, </em>427 A.2d 901, 904 (D.C. App. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1043, 101 S. Ct. 1763, 68 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1981); see also <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>508 A.2d 910, 911 (D.C. App. 1985). This latitude includes considering evidence that would normally be inadmissible at trial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>684 F.2d 141, 152 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Although due process is violated when the sentencing judge relies on \u201cmaterial false assumptions as to any facts relevant to sentencing\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hamid, </em>531 A.2d 628, 644 (D.C. App. 1987), quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>Malcolm, </em>432 F.2d 809, 816 (2d Cir. 1970); that is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In addition to the statement of the victim in the Danielson case, we note the following facts reflected in the record. The defendant initially pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine; see footnote 7 of this opinion; to sexual assault in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-72a (a), which requires proof of compulsion as an essential element.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thereafter, the trial court allowed the defendant to withdraw his plea; see footnote 8 of this opinion; because a conviction under \u00a7 53a-72a requires lifetime sex offender registration, rather than the ten year period imposed under \u00a7 53a-71. The state then filed a substitute information charging the defendant with sexual assault in the second degree, thereby eliminating the issue of compulsion and the lifetime sex offender registration. Nothing about that exchange, however, suggested that the victim\u2019s statement in the arrest warrant affidavit was materially false. Moreover, although the victim in the Danielson case and her family failed to respond to any further contact by the criminal justice system after the victim had given her statement, the trial court was not required to find that these actions indicated that her statement to the police had been untruthful. Accordingly, the trial court reasonably could have considered the victim\u2019s statement of the facts underlying the offense to which the defendant had pleaded in deciding whether to exempt him from the registration requirement under \u00a7 54-251 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Because we conclude that the trial court properly could have factored into its findings evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s use of force against the victim in the Danielson case, we turn to the trial court\u2019s ultimate finding that the defendant poses a risk to public safety. This question distills to the following \u2014 whether based on all the facts and circumstances before it, the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant poses a risk to public safety was clearly erroneous. The defendant contends that, because the principal purpose of Megan\u2019s Law was to promote public safety, and because the exemption was intended to allow trial courts to exempt from registration individuals engaged in consensual sexual activity between teenagers,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> he was not an intended target <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>of the registration requirement. In other words, because he engaged in what he has characterized as \u201csexual experimentation of a sort normal to twenty-first century American teenagers,\u201d the trial court improperly determined that he poses a risk to public safety. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Despite the defendant\u2019s characterization of the events as modem day sexual experimentation, or simply \u201cboorish behavior,\u201d the trial court was not required to adopt the defendant\u2019s portrayal. A review of the record indicates that the trial court reasonably could have found that the defendant\u2019s conduct was not the innocent experimentation between two young persons involved in a relationship that the legislature may have had in mind when it provided the discretionary exemption. See footnote 18 of this opinion. As the Appellate Court stated: \u201cIn both the Norwich and Danielson cases, the defendant and the minor victim hardly knew each other. In both cases, the defendant, without any prior physical contact with either victim, exposed his penis [and attempted to get the victim to perform fellatio]. Furthermore, in the Norwich case, after an unsuccessful attempt at vaginal intercourse with the victim, [because he could not penetrate her] the defendant asked a male friend who was in the room whether he wanted to \u2018break\u2019 the victim, [who was a virgin, and the defendant suggested that they have a \u2018threesome,\u2019 thereby] prompting the victim to leave the room. The court was well within the proper exercise of its discretion to consider that conduct and to deny the request for an exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u201cIn denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a registration exemption, the court found it significant that the sexual assault underlying the Danielson case occurred during the same period of time as the two Norwich assaults. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Having presided over the trial in the Norwich case, the court was familiar with the defendant and the underlying facts of that case. It also heard the underlying facts of the Danielson case and was aware of the defendant\u2019s arrest in connection with solicitation of a prostitute.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Bletsch, </em>supra, 86 Conn. App. 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The trial court recognized that the defendant had matured following his arrest and acknowledged the supportive and affirming testimony by friends and family members. Indeed, those factors were taken into account by the trial court when it rejected the two conditions of probation of no contact with persons under the age of sixteen and no Internet access that had been recommended in the presentence investigation report. Those favorable factors do not, however, compel the conclusion that the trial court\u2019s view of the defendant as someone who poses a threat to public safety was improper.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court reasonably denied the defendant\u2019s motion for an exemption from the Connecticut sex offender registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">We turn next to the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim. The defendant challenges his conviction in the Norwich case with respect to the two counts related to the November 19, 1999 incident, wherein the defendant had the victim perform fellatio on him.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly determined, in reliance on its decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>79 Conn. App. 591, 600-601, 830 A.2d 812, cert. denied, 267 Conn. 901, 838 A.2d 211 (2003), that his conviction for both sexual assault in the second degree and risk of injury to a child did not constitute a violation of the double jeopardy clause. The defendant recognizes that this court previously has determined that second degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a child constitute separate offenses for double jeopardy purposes. See <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>211 Conn. 555, 585, 560 A.2d 426 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>187 Conn. 73, 92, 444 A.2d 896 (1982). He contends, however, that this precedent, on which <em>Ellison </em>relied, no longer is controlling because those decisions predate the legislature\u2019s enactment of subdivision (2) of the risk of injury statute under which he was charged; see Public Acts 1995, No. 95-142; and that this subdivision constitutes a new offense that includes all the essential elements of second degree sexual assault. Thus, he contends that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>conviction of both offenses for the same act constitutes double jeopardy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u201cThe fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: No person shall ... be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb .... The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment is made applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969). Although the Connecticut constitution has no specific double jeopardy provision, we have held that the due process guarantees of [the Connecticut constitution] include protection against double jeopardy. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\u201cWe have recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause consists of several protections: It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 293-94, 864 A.2d 666 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 848, 126 S. Ct. 102, 163 L. Ed. 2d 116 (2005). The last protection is at issue in the present case. \u201c[W]e have applied the <em>Blockburger </em>test to determine whether two statutes criminalize the same offense, thus placing a defendant prosecuted under both statutes in double jeopardy: [W]here the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not. <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932). This test is a technical one and examines only the statutes, charging instruments, and bill of particulars as opposed to the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>presented at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirsch, </em>263 Conn. 390, 420, 820 A.2d 236 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">To convict the defendant of sexual assault in the second degree under \u00a7 53a-71 (a), the state must prove that (1) the defendant engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim, (2) the victim was thirteen years of age or older but under sixteen years of age, and (3) the defendant was more than two years older than the victim. To convict the defendant of risk of injury to a child under \u00a7 53-21 (2), the state must prove that (1) the defendant had contact with the intimate parts of, or subjected to contact with his intimate parts, (2) a child under the age of sixteen years, (3) in a sexually and indecent manner likely to impair the health or morals of such child.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The crux of the defendant\u2019s claim is that, in light of these elements, one cannot engage in sexual intercourse with a child under sixteen, as required for \u00a7 53a-71 (a), without either having contact with her intimate parts or without subjecting the victim to contact with that person\u2019s intimate parts, as required for \u00a7 53-21 (2), and that sexual intercourse with a child under sixteen necessarily will impair the child\u2019s morals. The <em>Blockburger </em>test, however, requires that we look to charging instruments for the facts the state has alleged to satisfy the statutory elements. In the present case, in the substitute information under which the defendant was charged, the state alleged, with respect to the charge of sexual assault in the second degree, that the defendant \u201cdid engage in sexual intercourse with the victim, who was under sixteen years of age and the defendant is more than two years older than the victim. \u201d With respect to the charge of risk of injury to a child, the state alleged that the defendant \u201chad contact with the intimate parts of the victim, a child under the age of sixteen years, in a sexually and indecent manner likely to impair the morals of the victim.\u201d It is possible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>however, to have \u201c \u2018sexual intercourse,\u2019 \u201d as that term is defined under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> without having contact with the victim\u2019s \u201c \u2018intimate parts,\u2019 \u201d as that term is defined under \u00a7 53a-65 (8),<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> if the sexual intercourse involves having the victim perform fellatio. Similarly, it is possible to have contact with the victim\u2019s intimate parts, such as her breasts, without engaging in sexual intercourse. Consequently, it was possible to prove each offense in the manner charged in the substitute information without necessarily proving the other offense.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendant cannot prevail on his double jeopardy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and: (1) Such other person is thirteen years of age or older but under sixteen years of age and the actor is more than two years older than such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">Although changes have been made to other subdivisions of the statute since the time of the offenses in the present case, \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) has remained the same.

Representative Lawlor, the chairman of the judiciary committee, emphasized that the exception provides \u201cvery limited discretion to the judges under very, very limited circumstances.\u201d 42 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 3885; see also id., p. 3884. Lawlor further underscored that the paramount consideration in exercising that discretion \u201cis not in any way a sensitivity to the offender, it\u2019s a sensitivity to the victim. . . . Our hope is that judges will defer to the wishes of the victim and the victim\u2019s family when those are brought to the judge.\u201d Id., p. 3884. Specifically, a concern had come to light through victims and victims\u2019 groups that a victim may be identified through the publication of the name of the offender. Id., pp. 3884-85,3890-91. Although Representatives Lawlor and Denise Merrill both referred to statutory rape as an offense that could present the type of nonviolent offense that might permit a judge to find that a defendant did not pose a risk to public safety; see id., pp. 3884-85, remarks of Representative Lawlor; id., p. 3917, remarks of Representative Merrill; there is no indication that the legislature intended that a trial court must find that every defendant under the age of nineteen who has engaged in consensual sex with an underage victim, irrespective of the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>relationship, the number of offenses or number of victims, does not pose a risk to public safety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b49-7\"> We note that, at his sentencing, when the state related the events regarding the Norwich and Danielson cases as well as the solicitation of a prostitute on which the Appellate Court had relied, the defendant objected only to the state\u2019s recitation of a conversation the state had had with the Norwich victim regarding harassment she had experienced at school. The defendant related a different version of the events pertaining to the victim in the Danielson case, but did not expressly claim that the trial court\u2019s reliance on the statement in the arrest warrant would be improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b49-8\"> Nor do we agree with the defendant\u2019s claim that, because registration would be counterproductive to his rehabilitation \u2014 a \u201csecondary purpose\u201d of Megan\u2019s Law \u2014 as it may impair his future employment and social opportunities, the trial court should have granted the exemption, reserving registration for those more dangerous. Although such a consideration may be relevant when a trial court exercises its discretion <em>after </em>it has found that a defendant poses no safety risk, that consideration is not part of the threshold determination prior to the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion. The legislature chose to provide <em>only two </em>factors as threshold determinations that must be satisfied before the trial court may consider whether to exempt the offender from the sex offender registry. We are limited by that designation.

Rev. 593, 602-603 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b50-9\"> The defendant makes clear in his brief to this court that he is not raising a double jeopardy claim as to his conviction in the Norwich case related to the November 27,1999 incident, involving fellatio and digital penetration of the victim\u2019s vagina; nor does he challenge his conviction in the Danielson case, which involved a conviction for only one offense, second degree sexual assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b53-14\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2) provides: \u201c \u2018Sexual intercourse\u2019 means vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio or cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex. Its meaning is limited to persons not married to each other. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse or fellatio and does not require emission of semen. Penetration may be committed by an object manipulated by the actor into the genital or anal opening of the victim\u2019s body.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b53-15\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (8) provides: \u201c \u2018Intimate parts\u2019 means the genital area, groin, anus, inner thighs, buttocks or breasts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b53-16\"> We note that, although the allegation in the substitute information as to the risk of injury count charged the defendant with having contact with <em>the victim\u2019s intimate parts, </em>the evidence adduced at trial, which may not be considered for <em>Blockburger </em>purposes; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirsch, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 420; demonstrated that the November 19, 1999 incident involved only one act, to wit: the victim performing fellatio <em>on the defendant.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
