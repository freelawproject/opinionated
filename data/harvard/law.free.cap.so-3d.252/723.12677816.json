Immediately prior to the enactment of chapter 2014-220, section 775.082(1) provided that the only sentences available for a capital felony were death or life. \u00a7 775.082, Fla. Stat. (2013). Section 775.082(2) dealt with the death penalty.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8986891\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/921/587/#p591\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Then, section 775.082(3) listed the penalties associated with lesser felony offenses, beginning with life felonies and ending with third-degree felonies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8986891\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/921/587/#p591\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For example, section 775.082(3)(c) simply provided that a person convicted of a second-degree felony could be punished \"by a term of imprisonment not exceeding 15 years.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8986891\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/921/587/#p591\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With the enactment of chapter 2014-220, the Legislature amended section 775.082(1) to provide new sentencing options for juveniles convicted of capital offenses. For example, a new subsection (1)(b)1 now provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A person who actually killed, intended to kill, or attempted to kill the victim and who is convicted under s. 782.04 [the homicide statute] of a capital felony, or an offense that was reclassified as a capital felony, which was committed before the person attained 18 years of age shall be punished by a term of imprisonment for life if, after a sentencing hearing conducted by the court in accordance with s. 921.1401, the court finds that life imprisonment is an appropriate sentence. If the court finds that life imprisonment is not an appropriate sentence, such person shall be punished by a term of imprisonment of at least 40 years. A person sentenced pursuant to this subparagraph [for a capital felony] is entitled to a review of his or her sentence in accordance with s. 921.1402(2)(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00a7 775.082(1)(b) 1., Fla. Stat. (2015). Section 921.1402(2)(a) then provides in pertinent part that \"[a] juvenile\n   <em>\n    sentenced under s. 775.082(1)(b) 1.\n   </em>\n   [for a capital felony] is entitled to review of\n   <em>\n    his or her sentence\n   </em>\n   after 25 years.\" \u00a7 921.1402(2)(a), Fla. Stat. (2015) (emphasis added). The only sentence referenced as eligible for review in this subsection is the sentence \"under s. 775.082(1)(b) 1.,\" which is the sentence on the capital felony for a person who \"actually killed, intended to kill, or attempted to kill the victim.\" \u00a7 775.082(1)(b) 1., Fla. Stat. (2015). This formula continues in similar fashion for the other enumerated serious\n   felonies: other homicide offenses and any nonhomicide offense classified as a \"life felony\" or as a \"first-degree felony punishable by life\" (commonly referenced by trial courts and in sentencing documents as an \"F1-PBL\"). \u00a7 921.1402(2)(b)-(d), Fla. Stat. (2015). Chapter 2014-220 did not add any special juvenile sentencing provisions for lower-level offenses. For example, section 775.082 still simply provides that a felony of the second degree is to be punished \"by a term of imprisonment not exceeding 15 years.\" \u00a7 775.082(3)(d), Fla. Stat. (2017). And, no review mechanism is provided for first-degree felonies (except for F1-PBLs), second-degree felonies, or third-degree felonies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The new juvenile sentencing provisions seem complex because the sentencing rules for life felonies and F1-PBLs are complex. Life felonies committed before October 1, 1983, are punishable \"by a term of imprisonment for life or a term of at least 30 years.\" \u00a7 775.082(3)(a) 1., Fla. Stat. (2017). Life felonies committed on or after October 1, 1983, but before July 1, 1995, are punishable \"by a term of imprisonment for life or by a term of imprisonment not exceeding 40 years.\" \u00a7 775.082(3)(a) 2., Fla. Stat. (2017). Life felonies committed on or after July 1, 1995, are generally punishable \"by a term of imprisonment for life or by imprisonment for a term of years not exceeding life imprisonment.\" \u00a7 775.082(3)(a) 3., Fla. Stat. (2017). However, there are additional sentencing rules for some life felonies committed after September 1, 2005, and July 1, 2008. \u00a7 775.082(3)(a) 4., Fla. Stat. (2017). F1-PBLs are punishable \"by imprisonment for a term of years not exceeding life imprisonment.\" \u00a7 775.082(3)(b) 1., Fla. Stat. (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The new juvenile sentencing rules for life felonies and F1-PBLs are categorized based upon whether the underlying offense is a homicide offense or nonhomicide offense and the length of sentence imposed. For example, a juvenile sentenced for a nonhomicide life felony to a term-of-years sentence of more than 20 years is entitled to review of that sentence after 20 years and, for longer sentences, is entitled to a second review 10 years after the initial review. \u00a7\u00a7 775.082(3)(c), 921.1402(2)(d), Fla. Stat. (2015). As seen in these examples, and in the text itself, the review provisions added by the Legislature are clearly and unequivocally linked to those offenses specified in chapter 2014-220. Although a review mechanism is provided for some term-of-years sentences, this is only because life felonies and F1-PBLs can be punished by a term-of-years sentence, and because a juvenile can now be sentenced to a term-of-years sentence for a capital offense. \u00a7\u00a7 775.082(1)(b), 775.082(3)(a) 5., 775.082(3)(b)2., 775.082(3)(c)., Fla. Stat. (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural History of the Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Kenneth Purdy was convicted in 1997 of first-degree murder (a capital felony), armed robbery (an F1-PBL), and armed carjacking (an F1-PBL). He was sentenced to life without parole for the murder (the only sentence available at the time) and to 112.7 months (approximately 9.4 years) for the armed robbery and armed carjacking convictions, to run concurrently with one another but consecutive to the life sentence. Purdy was 17 at the time he committed the offenses. Purdy's convictions and sentences became final in 1998.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 2015, Purdy filed a motion pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.800, arguing that his life sentence violated\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . Purdy did not seek relief on the sentences imposed consecutively to the life sentence. The trial court granted the relief requested and resentenced Purdy to 40 years for the murder conviction pursuant to chapter 2014-220, in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Horsley\n   </em>\n   , with no change to the 112.7-month sentences. Consistent with sections 921.1402(2) and (4), Florida Statutes (2015), the trial court later conducted the required review and determined that Purdy was \"rehabilitated and that it reasonably believed [Purdy] to be fit to reenter society.\"\n   <em>\n    Purdy\n   </em>\n   , --- So.3d at ----, 42 Fla. L. Weekly at D272. Based upon this determination, the judge reduced the 40-year sentence to 20 years, 6 months and 13 days-the amount of time already served on that sentence-followed by 10 years of probation. Determining that the statute did not authorize review of the other sentences, Purdy was returned to prison to begin serving the 112.7-month sentences. Because probation is tolled during incarceration,\n   <em>\n    Evans v. Singletary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11540112\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/737/505/#p508\">\n    737 So.2d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 508 (Fla. 1999), Purdy will begin serving the probationary term now associated with the murder conviction after serving the 112.7-month sentences, unless further relief is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On appeal, the Fifth District reversed and remanded for the trial court to conduct another review hearing, holding that a trial court is required to review a juvenile offender's aggregate sentence at a sentence review hearing in order to determine whether to modify the sentence based on maturity and rehabilitation.\n   <em>\n    Purdy\n   </em>\n   , --- So.3d at ----, 42 Fla. L. Weekly at D273. The textual basis for this holding is unclear. The Fifth District also certified the question as one of great public importance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11540112\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/737/505/#p508\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----, at D967.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because the plain language of section 921.1402, Florida Statutes, only provides for review of the sentence imposed for Purdy's murder conviction pursuant to the new provisions added by chapter 2014-220 as sections 775.082(1)(b) and 921.1402(2)-and because no other provision authorizes resentencing on consecutive sentences-the trial court was correct in determining that the statute does not provide any basis for resentencing for the 112.7-month sentences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7613488\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/450/217/#p219\">\n    450 So.2d at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although section 921.1402(2)(d) authorizes review of sentences for nonhomicide F1-PBLs imposed pursuant to section 775.082(3)(c), Purdy never sought relief from the sentences imposed for his armed robbery and armed carjacking convictions, the consequence being that he was not resentenced pursuant to chapter 2014-220 on those convictions. Even if Purdy had been resentenced pursuant to section 775.082(3)(c) for the additional convictions, the 112.7-month sentences would not qualify for review because the plain language of section 921.1402(2)(d) only provides for review if the juvenile is sentenced \"to a term of 20 years or more under s. 775.082(3)(c) [on the nonhomicide F1-PBL]\" and Purdy was sentenced to less than 10 years on each F1-PBL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On appeal, we have been presented with arguments pointing to several gaps and anomalies in the statutory scheme enacted to address the Eighth Amendment issues associated with juvenile sentencing. First, by limiting the review provisions to sentences imposed on crimes that carry a potential life sentence, chapter 2014-220 failed to address all potential Eighth Amendment violations.\n   <em>\n    Henry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6846719\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/675/#p680\">\n    175 So.3d at 679-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (unanimously holding that stacked consecutive term-of-years sentences that in combination exceed the life expectancy of a juvenile nonhomicide offender and do not provide a review mechanism violate the Eighth Amendment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Second, because the statute limits the review provisions and does not deal with the overall sentence, there will be other cases, like this one, where the sentencing court is required to consider whether the\n   offender \"is rehabilitated and is reasonably believed to be fit to reenter society\" even though the offender will continue to be incarcerated irrespective of the outcome of the hearing. Amicus points out that the continued incarceration of an offender on offenses arising from a single criminal episode under these circumstances-long after a judicial determination that the juvenile offender is rehabilitated-may raise additional Eighth Amendment issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Third, by limiting the review provisions to certain serious offenses, the Legislature has placed juveniles convicted of serious violent felonies in a better position than juveniles who commit less serious nonviolent offenses. For example, section 775.082(1)(b) provides that a juvenile convicted of homicide (a capital offense) but who did not \"actually kill, intend to kill, or attempt to kill the victim\" is entitled to review of his or her sentence-and potential release from prison-after 15 years. \u00a7 775.082(1)(b). By contrast, a juvenile convicted of one count of sale or delivery of a controlled substance within 1000 feet of a school commits a first-degree felony and can be sentenced to 30 years in prison with no review and no opportunity for early release. \u00a7\u00a7 893.13(1)(c)1., 775.082(3)(b)1., Fla. Stat. (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   But the existence of these limitations in the coverage of section 921.1402 provides no basis for a judicial expansion of the statute that ignores the unambiguous statutory provisions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nevertheless, this Court determined that Henry's consecutive sentences for multiple offenses were unconstitutional because the\n   <em>\n    aggregate\n   </em>\n   sentence failed to link a meaningful opportunity for release to demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 679-80. The Court's remedy would be meaningless if it did not apply to each link in the chain creating that constitutional infirmity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In 1995, at the age of seventeen, Purdy committed several crimes during the course of one criminal episode. Consequently, Purdy's entire sentence-life in prison without the possibility of parole plus 9.4 years-arose from the same criminal episode. Thus, when the trial court deemed Purdy to be \"rehabilitated\" and \"fit to reenter society\" this determination was not the byproduct of the trial court's consideration of only the offense of first-degree murder, but rather, the trial court's consideration of all of the crimes which Purdy committed that day. Accordingly, I would conclude, as this Court has done previously, that section 775.082(1)(b) afforded the trial court the authority to review and modify Purdy's aggregate prison sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   It is an anomaly that Kenneth Purdy, who has proven to the courts of this State that he has moved past his previous crimes and is ready to be a contributing member of society, must continue to be imprisoned. That anomaly is unconstitutional. I would, instead, read the applicable statutes as the Fifth District Court of Appeal did-to require the trial court to review and allow it to modify a juvenile offender's aggregate\n   sentence for multiple convictions arising out of the same criminal episode. I would thus answer the certified question in the affirmative and approve the result reached by the Fifth District. But, since the plurality decision does not reach that result, I urge the Legislature to review the unconstitutional incongruities demonstrated by this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   LABARGA, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
