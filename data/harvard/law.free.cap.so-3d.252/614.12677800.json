The motion for rehearing is granted. The previous opinion of this Court is withdrawn, and this opinion is substituted in its place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Graham Read Irby, by and through his mother, Karen Collins, filed a wrongful-death suit against the psychiatrist who treated his father, Stuart M. Irby (Irby), prior to Irby's death by suicide. The suit alleged the psychiatrist's intentional and negligent acts created an irresistible impulse in Irby to commit suicide. The circuit court dismissed the action, finding that the claims of intentional acts were barred by the one-year statute of limitations for intentional torts and that Irby's suicide was a superseding event that barred any negligence claims. On appeal, Collins originally argued that despite allegations of intentional acts, the complaint was based in negligence, for which a two-year statute of limitations applied, and the negligence action was not barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Five days prior to this Court's original decision, the Mississippi Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Pioneer Community Hospital of Newton v. Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12361301\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/214/259/\">\n    214 So.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2017), in which it held that the minor's saving statute, Mississippi Code Annotated section 15-1-59 (Rev. 2012), applies to wrongful-death actions where a qualified person is available to file suit during the limitations period, but does not do so. On rehearing, Collins argues that under\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   , the minor's savings statute applied and prevented the dismissal of the complaint, as Graham is a minor, and no qualified person brought suit during the limitations period. We agree with Collins's argument on rehearing that the savings statute applies. Thus, we reverse and remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings. However, the remand proceedings shall be limited to Collins's intentional-tort claim. We find, as we did in our original decision, that the trial court correctly dismissed Collins's negligence cause of action, as there is no basis for a negligence action for wrongful death by suicide. Thus, it is unnecessary for the\n   trial court to revisit the negligence issue on remand. Therefore, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4. Prior to his death, Irby sought psychiatric treatment from Dr. Sudhakar Madakasira, a physician specializing in psychiatry. Dr. Madakasira treated Irby for various conditions, including bipolar disorder, anger management, and alcohol abuse. On February 11, 2009, Irby and his wife, Karen Irby, now Karen Collins, were involved in a car accident. Irby suffered a severe, traumatic frontal-lobe brain injury. He continued to see Dr. Madakasira for the brain injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5. Due to that injury, Irby was deemed incapable of conducting his own business affairs, and coconservators were appointed by the Hinds County Chancery Court, First Judicial District. The conservators petitioned the chancery court for authority to file a divorce complaint on Irby's behalf against Collins. The petition was granted. In support of the divorce complaint, the conservators attached an affidavit executed by Dr. Madakasira on October 28, 2011, while Irby was under his care. The affidavit stated that Irby had told Dr. Madakasira that he was unsure if he wanted a divorce from Collins. However, Dr. Madakasira swore in his affidavit that due to the brain injury, Irby was not capable of making a decision in his or Graham's best interest regarding the divorce. Dr. Madakasira opined that a divorce was in Irby's best interest and that it would be detrimental to Irby's health to remain married to Collins. Dr. Madakasira testified consistently at the divorce hearing. Although Irby testified he did not want a divorce, the divorce was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. On January 17, 2012, Irby told Collins over the phone that he was forced into the divorce and had no reason to live. Irby committed suicide at his home later that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. On December 16, 2013, Collins sent Dr. Madakasira and his employer, Psycamore LLC, a notice of intent to commence a medical-malpractice action based on wrongful death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-1-36\">\n    Miss.

On March 17, 2014, Collins filed her complaint in Hinds County Circuit Court, First Judicial District. The complaint alleged that Dr. Madakasira and Psycamore, through the doctrine of respondeat superior, negligently caused Irby's death by suicide. It was later determined that the proper venue was Rankin County, and an agreed order was entered transferring the case to Rankin County Circuit Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. After the case was transferred, Collins was granted leave to file an amended complaint. The amended complaint alleged negligence and added a claim for \"intentional acts.\" The amended portion of the complaint alleged that \"[a]s a direct and proximate result of the intentional acts of Dr. Madakasira in assisting the conservators in the prosecution of the divorce action and the granting of a divorce by the Chancery Court[,] Stuart M. Irby developed an irresistible impulse to commit suicide[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9. Dr. Madakasira moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that the one-year statute of limitations for intentional torts barred the action and that any negligence claims were barred for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. After a hearing, the circuit court granted the motion to dismiss. Collins's motion for reconsideration was denied. On appeal, Collins argued that the two-year statute of limitations for professional negligence applies and that the case should be reversed\n   and remanded for discovery and further proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On rehearing, Collins further argues that the statute of limitations was tolled by the minor's savings clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10. We review de novo a trial court's decision to grant a motion to dismiss under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    Stockstill v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9095442\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/854/1017/#p1019\">\n    854 So.2d 1017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1019-20 (\u00b6 4) (Miss. 2003). When considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, \"the allegations in the complaint must be taken as true, and the motion should not be granted unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff will be unable to prove any set of facts in support of her claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Stockstill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9095442\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/854/1017/#p1019\">\n    854 So.2d at 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Whether the minor's savings clause tolled the statute of limitations.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11. The circuit court found that the one-year statute of limitations for intentional torts applied, barring the claim. It further dismissed Collins's negligence claim, finding that while within the two-year statute of limitations for negligence, a negligence cause of action cannot be sustained for a claim for wrongful death by suicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12. On rehearing, Collins asserts for the first time that the statute of limitations was tolled by the minor's saving statute, thus making the complaint timely under both the one- and two-year statutes of limitations. Collins's argument is based on the Mississippi Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12361301\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/214/259/\">\n    214 So.3d at 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which handed down on March 23, 2017, five days prior to our original decision affirming the circuit court's dismissal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13.\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   changed the law regarding the application of the minor's savings statute, section 15-1-59, to wrongful-death actions. Prior to\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   , the binding case on this issue was\n   <em>\n    Curry v.

The supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   held that\n   <em>\n    Curry\n   </em>\n   went too far in finding \"that the\n   <em>\n    mere existence\n   </em>\n   of someone qualified to bring a wrongful-death suit ... precluded the application of the [minor's savings] statute[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   , 214 So.3d at 261 (\u00b6 3) (emphasis in original). The supreme court found instead that \"only when someone who is qualified to bring a wrongful-death suit\n   <em>\n    actually files a wrongful-death suit\n   </em>\n   on the minor beneficiaries' behalf will the minors savings clause not apply, because, once the suit is filed, the running of the statute of limitations is immaterial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Importantly, the wrongful-death statute states that \"there shall be but one (1) suit for the same death[,] which shall ensue for the benefit of all parties concerned, but the determination of such suit shall not bar another action unless it be decided on its merits.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-7-13\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-7-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14. Collins asserts on rehearing that she did not argue tolling before the trial court or in her initial brief on appeal because, at that time,\n   <em>\n    Curry\n   </em>\n   was still in effect, and qualified persons existed who could have brought suit during the statute of limitations. Collins is not qualified to recover under the wrongful-death statute, since she and Irby were divorced at the time of his death.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-7-13\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Wrongful-death beneficiaries-a more limited class than one qualified to bring suit under the wrongful-death statute-include: \"the widow, husband, child, father, mother, sister or brother of the deceased or unborn quick child[.]\"). Collins states that Irby was survived by two adult children, who were qualified under the statute to bring suit. Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Curry\n   </em>\n   , the limitations period in the wrongful-death statute was not tolled by the minor's saving statute because qualified persons existed. Collins now argues that since the supreme court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   overruled\n   <em>\n    Curry\n   </em>\n   's holding, the statute of limitations under the minor's savings clause as to Graham was tolled, making the suit timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15. In\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   , the minor beneficiaries (the decedent's children) had an aunt who was qualified under the wrongful-death statute as the decedent's sister to file a wrongful-death suit, but she did not file one.\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   , 214 So.3d at 261 (\u00b6 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The aunt petitioned for guardianship of the children, specifically requesting authorization to file a wrongful-death claim or make a settlement for damages on their behalf.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 262 (\u00b6 7). The chancellor granted the petition and entered an order of guardianship as to the older child.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 8). A notice-of-claim letter was sent to the treating hospital and physician, but a suit was not pursued.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 261 (\u00b6 6). Later, the guardianship action was dismissed as to the older child because the aunt never filed an oath or letters of guardianship.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 262 (\u00b6 8). An order of guardianship was never entered for the younger child, and this action was dismissed as well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16. Shortly after turning twenty-one, the older child filed a wrongful-death suit on behalf of all wrongful-death beneficiaries against the hospital and physician.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 9). The hospital and physician argued the statute of limitations had run because the aunt could have filed suit during the limitations period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 264 (\u00b6 22). The supreme court found that the minor's saving statute tolled the statute of limitations because the aunt \"had been neither appointed guardian nor authorized by the\n   chancery court to bring an action on [the children's] behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 266 (\u00b6\u00b6 29-31).

The supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   cited\n   <em>\n    U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v.

Because the legal right to file suit lay with the conservator, Mississippi Code Annotated section 15-1-53 (Rev. 2012) precluded tolling. Section 15-1-53 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   When the legal title to property or a right in action is in an executor, administrator, guardian, or other trustee, the time during which any statute of limitations runs against such trustee shall be computed against the person beneficially interested in such property or right in action, although such person may be under disability and within the saving of any statute of limitations; and may be availed of in any suit or actions by such person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18. \"[U]nder [ section] 15-1-53, if a person who is subject to infancy or unsoundness of mind does in fact\n   <em>\n    have a guardian or conservator appointed for them\n   </em>\n   , then the action may be brought in the name of that guardian or conservator, without the consideration of any savings clause.\"\n   <em>\n    Melson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9515432\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/809/647/#p653\">\n    809 So.2d at 653-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 27) (emphasis added). In holding the savings statute inapplicable in\n   <em>\n    Melson\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court reasoned that \"[w]here a guardian or conservator has been\n   <em>\n    court\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    appointed\n   </em>\n   for a ward, there is no logical or equitable reason to prevent the running of the statute of limitations inasmuch as that guardian or conservator is fully authorized to employ attorneys and bring actions on their behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9515432\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/809/647/#p653\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9515432\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/809/647/#p653\">\n    at 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 27) (emphasis added) (citing\n   <em>\n    McCain v.

Applying this holding in\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court held that because \"no oath had been filed\" by the aunt \"and no letters of guardianship had been entered\" on behalf of the oldest of the minor children, the child \"did not 'in fact have a guardian appointed for her' who had the legal authority to bring a suit on her behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   , 214 So.3d at 266 (\u00b6 30) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Melson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9515432\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/809/647/#p653\">\n    809 So.2d at 653-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 27) ). Thus, because there was no one with a legal duty to bring suit on the minors' behalf, the savings statute tolled the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9515432\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/809/647/#p653\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 20. There is no indication here that Collins had a legal duty to file suit on Graham's behalf. Collins did not appear as Graham's court-appointed guardian. Rather, she appeared as his mother and next friend. As Graham's mother, Collins had\n   <em>\n    standing\n   </em>\n   to file suit on his behalf. However, our decision hinges on whether Collins's status as his mother and next friend bestowed on her the\n   <em>\n    duty\n   </em>\n   to file suit within the statute of limitations. Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) defines \"next friend\" as \"[s]omeone who appears in a lawsuit to act for the benefit of an incompetent or minor plaintiff, but who is not a party to the lawsuit and is not appointed as a guardian.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 21.

The supreme court, also citing\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   , found that while suicide generally breaks the causal nexus between the defendant's actions and the suicide death in a medical-negligence case, this rule does not apply when the facility had the duty to safeguard a decedent/patient who was in its \"custody and control\" and the facility had \"the ability to control the patient's conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201323581\">\n    2018 WL 1323581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 35.

While the amended complaint here alleged that Dr. Madakasira knew that Irby had threatened suicide in the past and that his suicide was foreseeable, there was no allegation that Irby was under Dr. Madakasira's custody or control or that he had recently been under any doctor's or facility's custody or control and negligently discharged, as\n   <em>\n    Singing River\n   </em>\n   requires.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201323581\">\n    2018 WL 1323581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\u00b6 19) (citing\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n    150 So.3d at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 6) (holding that no medical-negligence cause of action existed for the decedent's suicide death where the decedent was discharged from the hospital six days prior to his death) ). Rather, Irby was simply receiving treatment from Dr. Madakasira as his\n   psychiatrist. Thus, the dissent's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Singing River\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. We do note, however, that the supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Singing River\n   </em>\n   reaffirmed that \"the general rule that suicide is 'an independent, intervening and superseding event' that breaks the causal nexus between the defendant's wrongful act and the death\" and that this principle \"extends to medical-malpractice claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201323581\">\n    2018 WL 1323581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (\u00b6 13). That is, in a medical-negligence action for a suicide death, unless an exception to the general rule is found, the third element of negligence-causation-cannot be sustained.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201323581\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The dissent cites no exception to the general rule. On remand, Collins can assert the allegations in the amended complaint that raise an intentional-tort cause of action; but there is no basis in our law for a negligence cause of action, since no exception to the intentional-act pleading requirement has been alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 37. We also disagree with the dissent's statement that our decision effectively holds \"that intentional conduct cannot serve as the basis for a medical-malpractice action.\" The dissent asserts that this decision departs from our holding in\n   <em>\n    Chitty v. Terracina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7060323\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/16/774/\">\n    16 So.3d 774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. Ct. App. 2009). In\n   <em>\n    Chitty\n   </em>\n   , we held that whether a doctor's \"alleged actions were intentional, or merely negligent, is not determinative\" of whether a claim falls under the medical-malpractice statute; rather, \"the main issue\" is \"whether the tort arises out of the course of medical, surgical or other professional services.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7060323\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/16/774/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7060323\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/16/774/\">\n    at 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 12). We do not stray from that decision. We acknowledge that the plain language of our medical-malpractice statute encompasses all applicable torts against physicians; it is not limited to the tort of negligence. The statute specifically states that \"\n   <em>\n    no claim in tort\n   </em>\n   may be brought against a licensed physician ... [for] wrongful death arising out of the course of medical, surgical or other professional services[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-1-36\">\n    Miss.

Taking the allegations in the complaint as true, Collins's medical-negligence allegations do not state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Suicide is an independent, intervening, and superseding event that breaks the nexus between any alleged wrongful act of Dr. Madakasira and Irby's death. Without this nexus, a causal connection for a medical-negligence action cannot be formed, and the claims cannot be sustained. The trial court correctly dismissed the negligence allegations in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

To comply with\n   <em>\n    Truddle's\n   </em>\n   intentional-act pleading requirement, Collins moved for, and was granted, leave to amend the complaint. The pertinent section of the amended complaint reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    INTENTIONAL ACTS OF DEFENDANT\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   15. Dr. Madakasira knowingly engaged in a course of conduct with the conservators of Stuart M. Irby to have a divorce granted to Irby by the action prosecuted by the conservators even though Stuart Irby expressed his opposition to the divorce. By advising with the conservators in the divorce action, which resulted in a divorce being granted, Dr. Madakasira stepped outside of the psychiatrist-patient relationship and created a conflict of interest with his patient, Stuart Irby. As Irby's attending psychiatrist for several years, Dr. Madakasira knew that Stuart Irby was mentally and emotionally fragile and that he had threat[en]ed to commit suicide in the past. However, notwithstanding his personal knowledge of lrby's mental condition[,] Dr. Madakasira intentionally participated with the conservators to secure a divorce for Stuart Irby from his wife, [Collins,] and took an active part in the chancery court proceedings which resulted in the divorce being granted against Stuart Irby's will.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   16. As a direct and proximate result of the intentional acts of Dr. Madakasira in assisting the conservators in the prosecution of the divorce action and the granting of a divorce by the Chancery Court[,] Stuart M. Irby developed an irresistible impulse to commit suicide and on January 17, 2012[,] he committed suicide.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   17. The intentional conduct of Dr. Madakasira, as aforesaid, created an irresistible impulse in Stuart Irby to commit suicide so that he took his own life. Based upon the negligence and intentional acts of the defendants it was foreseeable that Stuart M. Irby would commit suicide.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   18. Madakasira's intentional conduct, as aforesaid, was the proximate cause or a proximate contributing cause of the irresistible impulse suffered by Stuart M. Irby to commit suicide and rendered him unable to discern the nature or consequences of suicide which was the proximate cause or was a proximate contributing cause of Stuart Irby's wrongful death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 40. The trial court found the allegations in the amended complaint sounded in intentional tort, and thus were barred by the one-year statute of limitations. In her original brief on appeal, Collins vehemently argued that all claims in the complaint were negligence-based, as any intentional-tort claims were barred by the one-year statute of limitations. On the contrary, on rehearing, we are only looking at the intentional-act allegations, which were required to be pled under\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   , to determine if the amended complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 41. While we have found the statute of limitations was tolled as to either claim, the distinction between the claims is important, as we must determine whether Collins's complaint states a claim for which relief can be granted on remand.

Collins's amended complaint alleges the following intentional acts: \"Dr. Madakasira intentionally participated with the conservators to secure a divorce for ... Irby from his wife, [Collins,] and took an active part in the chancery court proceedings which resulted in the divorce being granted against ... Irby's will,\" and this \"intentional conduct ... created an irresistible impulse in ... Irby to commit suicide.\" The first sentence of the punitive-damages section of the complaint states, \"Dr. Madakasira[ ] willfully, deliberately[,] and intentionally participated in the divorce proceedings against the will and wishes of ...

A medical-malpractice claim must \"aris[e] out of the course of medical, surgical[,] or other professional services[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-1-36\">\n    Miss.

Looking at the substance of the amended complaint, we find the alleged intentional acts lie in intentional tort.

As the statute of limitations is no longer at issue due to the minor's saving statute, we\n   find the intentional act allegations in the complaint may be viable, even though those acts arise in a medical context.

As such, the supreme court stated the defendants had \"assumed a duty toward [the decedent] to exercise reasonable care to safeguard him from the known danger he presented to himself, and to exercise such reasonable care for his safety as his mental condition required.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201323581\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The supreme court went on to find that under the facts of the case \"plaintiffs did present a claim of medical negligence regarding the death of [the decedent]\" and that \"the medical negligence claim was not subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201323581\">\n    2018 WL 1323581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (\u00b6 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 59. Similarly, here, Collins's amended complaint asserted a negligence claim that Dr. Madakasira, as Irby's treating psychiatrist, knew of Irby's mental condition including suicidal ideations, and also knew that Irby did not desire the divorce from Collins. The complaint further alleges that\n   in light of this knowledge, Dr. Madakasira breached the minimum standards of care by failing to properly monitor Irby's mental health; executing an affidavit in the divorce proceeding while serving as Irby's treating physician and psychiatrist that it would be in Irby's best interest to have a divorce granted-which was in direct conflict with Irby's desire and testimony; and by failing to prescribe an appropriate treatment for Irby to prevent his suicide. Finally, the negligence claim concludes that as a \"direct and proximate cause, or a contributing cause, of the breach of the minimum standard of care by [Dr. Madakasira] ... Irby committed suicide.\" The facts alleged in the amended complaint state that Irby told his wife Collins in a telephone conversation that he was forced into the divorce which he did not want and that he had no reason to live. A short time later Irby was found dead in his residence, having committed suicide. I do not consider the merits of the complaint and also recognize that negligence is an issue for the fact finder. However, taking the allegations of the amended complaint as true, Collins's amended complaint stated a negligence claim for Irby's death by suicide which, in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Singing River\n   </em>\n   , was not subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). Accordingly, I would reverse the trial court's dismissal of Collins's negligence claim and remand for further proceedings. Therefore, with respect to this issue, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Irresistible-Impulse Doctrine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 60. In addition to Collins's negligence claim, which the trial court erroneously dismissed for failure to state a claim, Collins's amended complaint asserted an intentional-act claim via the irresistible-impulse doctrine. The majority finds that Collins's claim under the irresistible-impulse doctrine, which was otherwise precluded by the statute of limitations governing torts, is saved by the minor's savings statute. Additionally, the majority states that on remand, Collins's wrongful-death claim under the irresistible-impulse doctrine is simply an intentional tort and not one for medical malpractice. However, in\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court addressed the irresistible-impulse doctrine as it applies to medical-malpractice claims arising from an individual's suicide.\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n    150 So.3d at 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 17). The claim does not cease to be one for medical malpractice simply because the irresistible-impulse doctrine requires the claimant to plead and prove an intentional act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 61. Again, a medical malpractice claim is one for \"injuries or wrongful death arising out of the course of medical, surgical or other professional services ... [,]\" notwithstanding whether the act is negligent or intentional.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-1-36\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is exactly the claim Collins's makes-that Irby's wrongful death arose out of the course of medical, professional services, rendered by Dr. Madakasira-under the irresistible-impulse doctrine. Thus, because this claim is a medical-malpractice claim, the minor's savings statute is not necessary to preserve it, as it was already timely filed under the applicable statute of limitations governing medical-malpractice cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 62. Under Mississippi law, the irresistible-impulse doctrine is the exception to the general rule that a third party cannot be held liable for a decedent's suicide.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-1-36\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to the irresistible-impulse doctrine, a decedent's suicide is actionable against a third-party defendant as a wrongful-death claim \"only if the suicide was proximately caused by the intentional act of the defendant, creating an irresistible impulse in the decedent to take his or her own life.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-1-36\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-1-36\">\n    at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 11) (citing\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The supreme court noted that a third party cannot be held liable for a decedent's suicide except under the irresistible-impulse doctrine, and that \"this principle extends to medical-malpractice claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9811696\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/214/579/#p586\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 18). The majority opinion acknowledges that the\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   case is one of medical malpractice. Yet the majority goes on to find that the medical-malpractice claim in the instant case is an intentional-tort claim and thus subject to a one-year statute of limitations. Mississippi law is clear that a two-year statute of limitations applies to medical-malpractice claims.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Johnson ex rel. Shaw v.

After explicitly stating the issue was \"whether ... Mississippi law bars medical-negligence actions arising from an individual's suicide,\" the\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   court went on to discuss the irresistible-impulse doctrine's application to medical-malpractice cases. The\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   court noted that the \"crux of [the plaintiff's] argument ... is that [the decedent's] suicide was the result of medical malpractice, i.e., negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n    150 So.3d at 696-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 15). The court stated that in medical-malpractice claims, the burden is upon the plaintiff to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   prove (1) the existence of a duty by the defendant to conform to a specific standard of conduct for the protection of others against an unreasonable risk of injury; (2) a failure to conform to the required standard; and (3) an injury to the plaintiff proximately caused by the breach of such a duty by the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n    at 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 16). The court explained that nothing in our caselaw has abolished the rule that suicide constitutes an \"independent, intervening and superseding event that severs the causal nexus between any wrongful action on the part of the defendant,\"\n   <em>\n    except for\n   </em>\n   the irresistible-impulse doctrine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 17) (\"Nothing ...\n   <em>\n    save\n   </em>\n   the irresistible-impulse doctrine ....\" (emphasis added) ). The court reasoned that the irresistible-impulse doctrine imposes a higher degree of responsibility because of the nature of the act, and stated: \"this principle extends to\n   <em>\n    medical-malpractice\n   </em>\n   claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6\u00b6 17-18) (emphasis added). Accordingly, the supreme court held that \"[i]n such a case,\"-being one for medical malpractice-\"the plaintiff must show that the defendant committed an intentional act that led to an irresistible impulse to commit suicide in order to prevail.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 19). The majority, however, conflates\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   's requirement that the claimant plead an intentional act or intentional conduct with a claim for merely an intentional tort and removes it from the scope of the medical-malpractice statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 65. In the instant case, Collins amended the complaint in order to comply with the legal standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   -specifically, the pleading requirements. Again,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   to recover against a third party for a decedent's suicide, ... a plaintiff must\n   <em>\n    plead\n   </em>\n   and prove: (1) the decedent was under an irresistible impulse rendering him or her unable to discern the nature or consequences of suicide, and (2) the irresistible impulse was proximately caused by the defendant's\n   <em>\n    intentional conduct\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n    at 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 12) (emphasis added). As such, Collins's amended complaint alleged that Dr. Madakasira's intentional conduct of engaging with Irby's conservators, executing an affidavit, and testifying in court\n   proceedings to obtain a divorce against Irby's wishes created an irresistible impulse in Irby to commit suicide and thus constituted medical malpractice.\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   does not require the claimant to plead and prove that the defendant intended the decedent to commit suicide. Rather,\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   requires that the claimant plead and prove the intentional conduct the defendant engaged in that created the irresistible impulse in the decedent to commit suicide-thereby committing medical-malpractice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 66. The supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   unequivocally stated that the irresistible-impulse doctrine's heightened pleading requirements apply to medical-malpractice claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n    at 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 17-18).\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   did not bar medical-malpractice actions arising from an individual's suicide, nor did it characterize the action as simply an intentional tort. Rather, the court repeatedly discussed the irresistible-impulse doctrine in the context of medical-malpractice claims and found that it did in fact apply in medical-malpractice claims: \"[T]his principle extends to medical-malpractice claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 18). As such, Collins's intentional-act claim is a medical-malpractice claim-to which the statute of limitations that governs medical-malpractice claims applies: two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 67. In\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   , the trial court granted summary judgment for the defendants due to the plaintiff's failure to \"plead[ ] ... [or] create a genuine issue of material fact as to any wrongful act committed by the defendant that caused [the decedent] to commit suicide.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n    at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 8). That is not the case here. Collins's amended complaint pled with specificity the alleged intentional acts of Dr. Madakasira that allegedly created an irresistible impulse in Irby to commit suicide-a claim that\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   characterizes as one of medical malpractice. Whether there is truth or merit to Collins's claim is not before this Court. Rather, the issue is whether the claim falls under a one-year statute of limitations or a two-year statute of limitations. Because the supreme court has very clearly categorized the claim as one for medical malpractice, it is equally clear that the statute of limitations governing medical-malpractice claims applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 68. Again, our law is clear that a two-year statute of limitations applies to medical-malpractice claims. Section 15-1-36(2) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   For any claim accruing on or after July 1, 1998, and except as otherwise provided in this section, no claim in tort may be brought against a licensed physician, osteopath, dentist, hospital, institution for the aged or infirm, nurse, pharmacist, podiatrist, optometrist[,] or chiropractor for injuries or wrongful death arising out of the course of medical, surgical[,] or other professional services unless it is filed within two (2) years from the date the alleged act, omission or neglect shall or with reasonable diligence might have been first known or discovered, and ... in no event more than seven (7) years after the alleged act, omission or neglect occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b6 69. In determining whether the two-year medical-malpractice statute of limitations applies, this Court has previously stated: \"the main issue [is] whether the tort arises out of the course of medical, surgical[,] or other professional services.\"\n   <em>\n    Chitty v. Terracina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7060323\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/16/774/\">\n    16 So.3d 774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 779 (\u00b6 12) (Miss. Ct. App. 2009). Here, it is clear that the conduct of Dr. Madakasira-which Collins alleged created the irresistible impulse in Irby to commit suicide and served as the basis for the tort claim-arose out of the course of professional psychiatric care rendered by Dr. Madakasira. Dr. Madakasira, in the course and scope of care as Irby's psychiatrist, met with Irby's conservators, executed an affidavit,\n   and testified in court proceedings regarding Irby's best interests in terms of his mental health. In\n   <em>\n    Chitty\n   </em>\n   , this Court further stated that where the tort claim arises out of the course of medical, surgical, or other professional services, \"whether [the medical provider's] alleged actions were intentional, or merely negligent, is not determinative.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7060323\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/16/774/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The majority now departs from that reasoning, finding that intentional conduct cannot serve as the basis for a medical-malpractice action. Moreover, in doing so, the majority departs from the supreme court's explicit and repetitive characterization of the action in the instant case as one for medical malpractice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 70. Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   characterizes the cause of action as simply an intentional tort or removes the action from the medical-malpractice statute and its governing statute of limitations. The majority erroneously interprets\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   as characterizing a claim against a physician for a patient's suicide as nothing more than an intentional tort. Rather,\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   consistently characterizes the action as one for medical malpractice-to which a two-year statute of limitations applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 71. The majority states that, \"If Irby's death had not been the result of suicide, we would agree with the dissent that the medical-negligence action could be sustained.\" Citing\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   , the majority reasons this is because \"suicide constitutes 'an independent, intervening[,] and superseding event that severs the causal nexus between any wrongful action' \" of Dr. Madakasira and Irby's death. This reasoning, however, conveniently omits the supreme court's qualifier to the foregoing statement, and thus patently ignores the supreme court's exception to this rule: the irresistible-impulse doctrine. \"Nothing in Mississippi caselaw,\n   <em>\n    save the irresistible-impulse doctrine\n   </em>\n   , abrogates the general rule that suicide constitutes 'an independent, intervening and superseding event that severs the causal nexus between any wrongful action on the part of the defendant.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7060323\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/16/774/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). \"[T]he irresistible-impulse doctrine applie[s] as\n   <em>\n    an exception\n   </em>\n   to the general rule regarding suicide ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7060323\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/16/774/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). It is an exception that applies to the instant medical-malpractice case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 72. The majority states that Collins's \"suicide action must be based on an intentional tort\" and thus, her \"negligence claims do not state a cause of action for which relief can be granted and were correctly dismissed.\" Again, as discussed, the supreme court rejected this argument in\n   <em>\n    Singing River\n   </em>\n   . Both Collins's negligence claim and intentional-act claim are medical-malpractice claims. As such, it is unnecessary to apply the savings statute in the instant case, as both claims were already timely under the medical-malpractice statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 73. While I do not consider the merits of Collins's complaint, I do find that both Collins's claims-in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Singing River\n   </em>\n   -were for medical malpractice. As such, I believe Collins's medical-malpractice claims were subject to a two-year statute of limitations. Therefore, I would also reverse and remand for this reason, notwithstanding the majority's application of the minor's saving statute. For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   IRVING, P.J., CARLTON AND WESTBROOKS, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
