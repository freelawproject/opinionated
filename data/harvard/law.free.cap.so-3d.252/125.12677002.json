Robertsdale, Summerdale, and BCSS asserted (1) that the 2002 amendment was invalid because other public-water systems were adequate to provide water services to the portion of ECBC's service area that was added pursuant to that amendment ('the ECBC 2002 expanded service area') and (2) that the 2008 amendment was invalid because other public-sewer systems were adequate to provide sewer services in ECBC's service area....

In\n   <em>\n    Weinrib\n   </em>\n   , this court noted: \"[A]lthough courts generally do lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary actions of county commissioners, [that legal premise was] inapplicable [when it was alleged that the statute at issue entitled the plaintiff to certain claimed commissions] and that the County had no discretion to withhold those commissions....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7047932\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/36/508/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 511 n. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Similarly, in the present case, as in\n   <em>\n    Weinrib\n   </em>\n   , Robertsdale, Summerdale, and BCSS have argued that, because the facts set forth in ECBC's applications were not true, the county commission lacked the discretion to approve the applications. Therefore, if the statute at issue in this case is mandatory and not discretionary, the trial court's and this court's review of the county commission's decisions are not limited under the holdings of\n   <em>\n    Bentley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ECO Preservation Services\n   </em>\n   . We note that Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 11-88-5(d), clearly states that \"[i]f the [commission] finds and determines that the statements in [the application for an amendment] are not true, [the commission]\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   deny the application.\" (Emphasis added.) \"[G]enerally the word 'shall' in a statute is used in a mandatory sense[;] ... 'shall' may be construed as permissive where from the circumstances\n   it is obvious that the Legislature intended it so or where the validity of the statute is placed in jeopardy.\"\n   <em>\n    Prince v. Hunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9577842\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/388/546/#p548\">\n    388 So.2d 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 548 (Ala.1980).\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prince\n   </em>\n   with\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Mobile Cty.

In the present case, neither of the two exceptions to the general construction of the word \"shall\" is applicable. The first sentence of \u00a7 11-88-5(a) specifically states that a \"certificate of incorporation of any authority incorporated under the provisions of this article may ... be amended\n   <em>\n    in the manner provided in this section\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Therefore, it appears that the legislature intended that the county commission could not approve an amendment to ECBC's certificate of incorporation if all the requirements in \u00a7 11-88-5 were not fulfilled. Furthermore, there is no indication that the validity of \u00a7 11-88-5 is in jeopardy. Accordingly, we conclude that the county commission's actions in approving the 2002 amendment and the 2008 amendment were not based on an act of discretion; instead, the county commission had no choice but to deny the applications if the facts in the applications were not true. Because the county commission's actions were not discretionary, we conclude that ECBC's arguments-that the 2002 amendment and the 2008 amendment are not subject to judicial review unless those actions were the result of \"fraud, corruption, or unfair dealings\" and that, if the amendments are subject to judicial review, the county commission's actions are presumed to be valid unless they were arbitrary and capricious-are without merit. The trial court's and this court's review of the county commission's actions are not contingent upon a showing of \"fraud, corruption, or unfair dealings\" and are not subject to the limited \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   ECBC also argues that Summerdale and Robertsdale are estopped from challenging the validity of the 2002 amendment. \" '[A]lthough the doctrine of estoppel is rarely applied against a municipal corporation, it may be applied in a proper case when justice and fair play demand it and where there has been a misrepresentation or concealment of material fact.' \"\n   <em>\n    Peterson v.

In\n   <em>\n    City of Foley\n   </em>\n   , our supreme court held that the City of Foley was estopped from enforcing a zoning ordinance against the property owners when the property owners had stated in their response to interrogatories that they had \"informed the City's building inspector of their plan ... and that he expressed no objection to their plan\" and the City presented no evidence to refute that statement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11847876\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/709/471/#p474\">\n    709 So.2d at 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the present case, Summerdale's mayor testified that representatives from ECBC had falsely represented that if Summerdale ever annexed portions of the ECBC 2002 expanded service area into the municipality, Summerdale would have the option to purchase ECBC's system or to lay water lines parallel to ECBC's lines. Robertsdale's mayor testified that ECBC's engineer had told him that ECBC was considering laying water lines east of Robertsdale but that he had never been informed of any specific plans. We conclude that the present case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    City of Foley\n   </em>\n   because, in the present case, the evidence indicates that Robertsdale was not informed of ECBC's specific plans with regard to the 2002 amendment and also that ECBC's representative actually misrepresented the facts regarding\n   the application to Summerdale.

According to Robertsdale, Summerdale, and BCSS, there were public water systems and public sewer systems that were capable of providing services in the 2002 ECBC expanded service area and that were \"adequate\" for the purposes of \u00a7 11-88-5, despite the fact that Robertsdale and Summerdale had chosen not to offer services in that entire area. Specifically, we note that it was undisputed that Robertsdale had water lines that were located in the ECBC 2002 expanded service area before the 2002 amendment. In fact, Robertsdale had had over 12 customers in one section of the ECBC 2002 expanded service area since 1994 or 1995, over 6 customers in another section since before\n   1994, approximately 10 customers in another section, and over 20 customers in yet another section. The evidence further indicated that, \" '[p]rior to the 2002 expansion request by ECBC, ... Robertsdale['s water system] was ready and adequate to provide water service to the [ECBC 2002 expanded service area]' \" and that, before the 2008 amendment, Robertsdale's \" 'sewer capacity and service capability ... was ready and adequate to provide sewer service to the area encompassed by ECBC.' \"\n   <em>\n    East Central Baldwin Cty.

Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12678013\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/252/98/\">\n    252 So.3d at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   ECBC's position, however, is that, because Robertsdale and Summerdale were not, in fact, providing water and sewer services in that area, those services were not \"adequate\" for purposes of \u00a7 11-88-5. The evidence indicated that Robertsdale and Summerdale had not provided water services to the entire ECBC 2002 expanded service area because it was not economically feasible and that Robertsdale had not provided sewer services there for the same reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We note that the placement of the term \"adequate\" immediately following \"public water system\" and \"public sewer system,\" respectively, indicates that the term is being used to describe the systems, not the decision of the municipality on whether to provide the service. Furthermore, as noted in \u00a7 11-88-2, the provisions in the article of which \u00a7 11-88-5 is a part were intended to aid the state; therefore, we should construe the term \"adequate\" from the perspective of the government. From the perspective of the governments involved in this case, they were not in need of aid to provide water or sewer services because Robertsdale's and Summerdale's water systems and Robertsdale's and BCSS's sewer systems were capable of providing those respective services to the ECBC 2002 expanded service area. Moreover, we note that Robertsdale was already providing water services in a portion of the ECBC 2002 expanded service area, and Robertsdale's existing sewer-treatment plant was located within that area. The purpose of the statute at issue in this case-to aid the government in providing services-would not be advanced and, as is evinced by what happened in this case, would actually thwart the government's ability to provide services if we were to adopt ECBC's construction of the term \"adequate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we construe the meaning of the term \"adequate\" as used \u00a7 11-88-5 to be \"capable of providing services,\" as argued by Robertsdale, Summerdale, and BCSS. Because, in the present case, ECBC's 2002 application represented that there was \"no public water system\n   <em>\n    adequate\n   </em>\n   to serve any new territory in which it is proposed that the authority will render water service,\" and because that representation has been proven to be false, we conclude that the 2002 amendment was due to be set aside. Similarly, because, in the present case, ECBC's 2008 application represented that there\n   was \"no public sewer system\n   <em>\n    adequate\n   </em>\n   to serve any new territory in which it is proposed that the authority will render sewer service,\" and because that representation has been proven to be false, we conclude that the 2008 amendment was due to be set aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Having rejected all of ECBC's arguments on appeal, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   THOMPSON, P.J., and PITTMAN, THOMAS, and DONALDSON, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    In this opinion, we use the same defined terms and designations we used in\n    <em>\n     East Central Baldwin County Water, Sewer &amp; Fire Protection Authority\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    See this court's opinion in\n    <em>\n     East Central Baldwin County Water, Sewer &amp; Fire Protection Authority\n    </em>\n    , 252 So.3d at ----, for a more detailed recitation of the procedural history of this case at the time that opinion was issued.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    For a more detailed recitation of the facts in this case, see this court's opinion in\n    <em>\n     East Central Baldwin County Water, Sewer &amp; Fire Protection Authority\n    </em>\n    , 252 So.3d at ----.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
