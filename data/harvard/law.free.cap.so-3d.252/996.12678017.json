Originally, on December 4, 2012, twelve principals (appellants plus Gloria Willis and Diane Nowik), filed a Petition for Damages and Declarative and Injunctive Relief against the School Board, alleging that their contracts of employment were breached by the School Board when they were removed from their principal positions following the 2011-12 school year, following a finding by the Superintendent that they were \"incompetent\" and/or \"inefficient,\" as per La. R.S. 17:444(B). Another principal, Lisa Kendrick,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   was added as a plaintiff in an Amended Petition filed on December 12, 2013. Ten of the principals are before this Court in the instant appeal; three principals' cases were not decided in the partial final judgment on appeal and thus their claims remain pending in the district court proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Eight of the appellants were removed as principals following the expiration of their contracts at the end of the 2011-12 school year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two of the appellants were removed as principals also at the end of the 2011-12 school year, but during the unexpired terms of their contracts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In their petition as amended, appellants alleged that Dr. James Meza, the Superintendent of Schools for Jefferson Parish, and the School Board, in adopting an initial policy on March 11, 2010 and a revised policy on October 5, 2011 regarding the use of the principals' \"targeted growth scores\" to determine competency, improperly and impermissibly unilaterally changed or modified their existing contracts, holding them accountable for matters that were not a part of their existing contracts (specifically, the \"achievement\n   of\" their respective schools' growth target scores, rather than the \"facilitation of\" their respective schools' achievement of their growth target scores, as found in the policy in effect when their contracts were confected), applied those changes retroactively, and used those changes as a basis to find them incompetent and/or inefficient and to demote them from their positions as principal. Appellants also alleged that they were not given the required 120-days' notice prior to being demoted. Appellants also sought injunctive relief, seeking to enjoin the School Board from \"maintaining its policy and/or practice of arbitrarily and capriciously terminating and/or demoting them in violation of state law and/or [the School Board's] own policies.\" Appellants also sought reinstatement to their positions of principal and damages. In lieu of reinstatement, appellants sought front pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In response, the School Board argued that it has always had the power to remove or demote principals for incompetence and/or inefficiency, terms that are used but not defined in either the contracts at issue or La. R.S. 17:444(B), and that the School Board's decisions to uphold the Superintendent's decisions not to renew appellants' contracts (or respectively remove two of them from their positions mid-contract) complied with all legal and statutory requirements, including notice and due process. The School Board argued that nothing in appellants' contracts suggested that the failure to meet their respective schools' growth target scores could not be considered when determining whether the respective principal was incompetent and/or inefficient and thus had met that criteria for removal. It further argued that the 120-days' notice requirement in La. R.S. 17:444(B)(4)(c)(i) does not apply when the principal is removed from her position for cause under La. R.S. l7:444(B)(4)(c)(iii) in the middle of the contract term, but rather only applied when an expiring contract would not be renewed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   All ten appellants received \"charge letters\" from the Superintendent notifying them of their impending removal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of the ten appellants who are a part of this appeal, six appellants ultimately had a hearing before the School Board regarding the charges of incompetency and/or inefficiency forming the basis for their contracts' non-renewals or their terminations mid-contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the remaining four appellants all elected to retire at the end of the 2011-12 school year in lieu of being removed and reassigned to another position, they were not offered hearings before the School Board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Superintendent supported his decisions to remove the principals with the introduction of the relevant School Board policies, the principals' respective schools' report cards from the prior 3-4 years, which included whether the principals' respective schools had met their growth targets or had shown progress, and other documentary evidence, as well as testimony from the School System's chief human capital officer and the principals' network executive directors. Appellants' counsel appeared at the hearings, but waived appellants' appearances, called no witnesses, and offered no evidence to refute the School Board's evidence supporting the Superintendent's determinations\n   that the principals were incompetent and/or inefficient as per La. R.S. 17:444(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the hearings before the School Board resulted in the confirmation of the Superintendent's decisions to remove appellants from their respective positions as principal, appellants filed suit in the district court as noted above. Following a hearing held on April 12, 2016, the trial court in a judgment signed on June 13, 2016 held that the adoption and revision of the policy in question by the School Board during the contract periods in question and the resultant use of State targeted growth scores to determine incompetence and/or inefficiency did not violate the applicable statute ( La. R.S. 17:444(B) ), or the principals' contracts. The trial court implicitly rejected appellants' retroactivity arguments. The June 13, 2016 judgment was amended on July 25, 2016 to provide that the School was not authorized to remove the eight principals who were removed at the expiration of their contract terms without providing them with 120-days' notice prior to the terminations of their contracts, and that the two principals who were terminated during the terms of their contracts were entitled to a fair hearing and reasonable notice prior to the terminations of their contracts. The subsequent partial final judgment of August 21, 2017 under review herein awarded the eight appellants whose contracts were not renewed 120 days of pay in lieu of proper notice. The judgment also awarded the two appellants who were removed during the terms of their contracts lost wages from the date of their removals (June 30, 2012) through the dates of their respective hearings before the School Board. The trial court also held that appellants' contracts (those whose contracts were not renewed) did not reconduct for another two-year term, thus denying appellants' request for reinstatement and full back pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, appellants argue that the trial court erred in three respects. First, they argue that the trial court erred in finding that the School Board could unilaterally modify the existing contracts between the School Board and appellants by incorporating the use of State targeted growth scores into their existing contracts. Second, they argue that the trial court erred in holding that the modified contracts could be applied retroactively to hold appellants accountable for the performance of duties and responsibilities that were not part of their existing contracts. Third, appellants argue that the trial court erred in finding that their employment contracts reconducted for a period of only 120 days, rather than the entire contract period of two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Spears v.

Appellants argue that they had legitimate, binding contracts with the School Board, setting forth \"in great detail\" the duties and responsibilities of principals, and as such, the School Board was prevented from unilaterally modifying the contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In response, the School Board argues that its adoption of the initial policy in 2010 and the revised policy in 2011 did not serve to alter the principals' contracts in any way. The School Board argues that all of the principals' contracts specifically authorize the removal of a principal who is found to be incompetent, a term that is not defined by the contracts or the relevant statute where it appears ( La. R.S. 17:444(B)(4)(c)(iii) ). The School Board further argues that nothing in the principals' contracts prohibited the School Board from using the State targeted growth scores to find the principals incompetent based upon their failure to meet their State targeted growth scores.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As this case hinges partly on the interpretation of the principals' contracts, it is useful at this juncture to consider the law on contract interpretation. The interpretation of a contract is the determination of the common intent of the parties. La. C.C. art. 2045. For purposes of interpreting a contract, a contract is \"ambiguous\" when it lacks a provision bearing on the issue, its written terms are susceptible to more than one interpretation, there is uncertainty as to its provisions, or the parties' intent cannot be ascertained from the language used.\n   <em>\n    Lomark, Inc. v.

The ten appellants each entered into their original contracts on various dates, some prior to the passage of the 2010 initial policy at issue, and at least three who signed contracts in 2010 after the effective date of the 2010 initial\n   policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each year, every school operated by the School Board receives a School Performance Score (\"SPS\"), which is based 90 per cent on student achievement on State standardized tests. The State Department of Education also sets a performance goal for each school based on its SPS, which is called an SPS growth target. The SPS and SPS growth targets have been determined by the State Department of Education and considered by the School Board for many years prior to the adoption of the initial policy in 2010, as revised in 2011, and principals always received notice of their SPS growth targets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Appellants' contracts that were introduced into the record form two groups.

The appointee may be placed in other positions of equal standing and salary or, if given an unsatisfactory evaluation, upon recommendation of the Superintendent to the Board, may be subject to demotion at the termination of the appointee's contract term. Demotion may be recommended by the Superintendent to the Board during the contract term if the superintendent believes that the appointee is incompetent or inefficient or has failed to fulfill the terms and performance objectives of her (his) contract and sufficient evidence exists to do so, after hearing before the Board.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (C) In addition to those duties of employment set forth above, Appointee also acknowledges that, as a condition of continued employment under this contract, he/she must fully, efficiently, and timely achieve the specific performance objectives of this position as indicated on Jefferson Parish Schools Goals and Objectives Specification Form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As such, we see that the contracts themselves, both before and after 2010, do not set forth \"in great detail\" the principals' duties and responsibilities regarding performance, as claimed by appellants, but rather refer to documents outside of the contracts, such as the job title description and a goals and objectives specification form. Importantly, however, each contract in evidence specifically states in Section IV(A) that the principal \"shall comply with all policies, rules, and regulations adopted by the School Board,\" and without regard to when such are adopted by the School Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As represented in the record, school growth targets have been made integral to a principal's performance duties since at least 2005.

The contracts are unambiguous. The express language in all of the contracts states that \"the Appointee shall comply with all policies, rules, and regulations adopted by the School Board.\" The contracts specifically incorporate all School Board policies. The contracts are not changed, therefore, because the School Board adopted the initial policy in 2010 regarding the use of SPS growth targets to evaluate a principal's competency. Certainly, as to appellants Duhon, Gassen, and Waddell's 2010 contracts, the 2010 policy's directive is specifically contained in their contracts, and therefore, as to them, there can be no credible argument made that they are not so bound.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The ability to formulate policies such as the ones in question undoubtedly serves the School Board's duty to prioritize student achievement by providing for the reconstitution of schools that are failing or have not met their growth targets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is nothing in the principals' contracts that limits the School Board's powers to form specific policies to those ends, or limits the\n   immediate application of new policies that are established during any appointee's contract period. This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Retroactive application of policy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Appellants next argue that the trial court's application of the policy to their schools' performances in the school years prior to its passage in 2010 (as far back as the 2008-09 school year) is a violation of law. Appellants argue that the general rule against retroactive application of legislative enactments is clear, and that the same rules that apply to legislative bodies apply to school boards, the latter being \"agenc[ies] of the state of Louisiana.\" Appellants supply no legal authority for their position, however. Appellants cite to La. R.S. 17:81(C), entitled \"General powers of local public school boards,\" which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   C. Each city or parish school board is authorized to make such rules and regulations for its own government, not inconsistent with law or with the regulations of the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, as it may deem proper.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   This section, however, does not, as appellants claim, address the school board's policy-making function, nor does it equate policy-making to the legislative process, or policies to legislation. Appellants cite\n   <em>\n    Rousselle v. Plaquemines Par. Sch. Bd.\n   </em>\n   , 93-1916 (La. 2/28/94),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7474143\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/633/1235/#p1238\">\n    633 So.2d 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1238, in support of their position; however,\n   <em>\n    Rousselle\n   </em>\n   considered the retroactivity of an amendment to a statute, La. R.S. 17:444(B)(4)(c)(iv), not the retroactivity of a policy enacted by a school board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Like the trial court, this Court need not reach the issue under the facts of this case of whether the 2010 initial policy was applied retroactively,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , using growth target data from the school years prior to its establishment in 2010. The 2010 policy provides for discretionary reconstitution in the event a school did not meet its growth target once. The evidence in this record, which was uncontroverted, shows that each appellant failed to meet their growth target for the 2010-11 school year, as well as were projected to miss their growth target again in the 2011-12 school year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, each appellant was subject to demotion based entirely on their data from the school years subsequent to the School Board's establishment of the 2010 policy. This Court further notes that the 2010 contracts of appellants Duhon, Gassen, and Waddell explicitly included the 2010 policy, in Section IV(B), as noted above. Accordingly, this assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Required notice of non-renewal/removal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Appellants finally argue that the failure to give them 120-days' notice of their contracts' non-renewal had the legal effect of reconducting their entire contract term; thus, they should have received new two-year contracts or payment for the same. The trial court disagreed, finding instead that the contracts reconducted for only 120 days, and awarded eight appellants\n   damages in the amount of 120-days' salary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Each contract at issue contained the following provision in Section VII, entitled \"Issuance of New Contract, Non-Renewal or Termination at Expiration of Term,\" to-wit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (B) If the School Board decides not to renew this contract, it shall give the Appointee written notice thereof not less than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the expiration date of this contract,\n   <em>\n    provided, however, that failure to give Appointee written notice at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the expiration date of this contract shall not operate to renew this contract and appointment for an equivalent term, but shall only cause such contract and appointment to be extended on a day-by-day basis until one hundred twenty (120) days have passed since such notice was given.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   This provision is unambiguous. The trial court followed this provision exactly as written, awarding the eight appellants whose contracts were not renewed (appellants Daniilidis, Duhon, Flattmann, Gassen, Gauthreaux, Plaisance, Varisco, and Waddell) 120-days' pay due to them for not having received the contractually required notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Appellants argue, however, that this contractual provision differs from La. R.S. 17:444(B)(4)(c)(i), quoted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , which must control. However, La. R.S. 17:444(B)(4)(c)(i) is silent on the issue of reconduction. Thus, it does not require, as appellants claim, a reconduction of the contract if an appointee does not receive the 120-days' notice of non-renewal. Instead, La. R.S. 17:444(B)(4)(c)(v), quoted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , requires that the removed principal be returned to his former status as a teacher, if the appointee had previously acquired permanent status as a teacher. The evidence in the record, summarized by a table entered into evidence, shows that each appellant who did not retire at the end of the 2011-12 school year was employed elsewhere by the School System at the time of the proceedings in the district court. Thus, it appears that every demoted principal who did not retire was in fact subsequently employed in the School System in accordance with La. R.S. 17:444(B)(4)(c)(v).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Appellants also argue that in\n   <em>\n    Wright v. Caldwell Parish Sch. Bd.\n   </em>\n   , 98-1225 (La. 3/2/99),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11615071\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/733/1174/\">\n    733 So.2d 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Supreme Court found that the obligation to renew a contract when the appointee was not given the statutory 120-days' notice of non-renewal applied only to \"subsequent\" contracts and not the non-renewal of an initial contract. However, that Court did not consider the exact legal question before this Court, given that the tenure status of the principal/teacher in\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   was unknown. Thus, we find that case distinguishable and not controlling under the present facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The two remaining appellants who were removed during the term of their contracts (appellants Hindman and Noel) received lost wages from the date of their removal on June 30, 2012 until the dates of their hearings before the School Board. Like the other eight appellants, the two appellants who were removed from their positions as principal during the term of their contracts\n   are not entitled to reconduction of their contracts. They are governed by La. R.S. 17:444(B)(4)(c)(iii), quoted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , which only requires that a principal receive written charges and a fair hearing before the School Board before being removed from their positions. Accordingly, we find no merit to appellants' argument that they were entitled to reconduction of their contracts. This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment under review is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     AFFIRMED\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    This is the parties' second appeal.

However, the failure to achieve a specific growth score could not serve as cause for removal of Plaintiffs based upon an alleged failure to fulfill the terms and performance objectives of Plaintiffs' contracts because the contracts did not require attainment of a specific growth target, but only required Plaintiffs to facilitate a school's growth target or show progress in reaching that target.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    This statement recognizes, correctly, that a principal may be removed for 1) incompetency, 2) inefficiency, or 3) failure to fulfill the terms and performance objectives of her contract. We find that it is not prohibited by statute or the contracts that the same facts could be used to support these alternative bases for removal. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    , for example,\n    <em>\n     Irchirl v. Natchitoches Parish School Board\n    </em>\n    , 12-488 (La.

However, based upon our holding that appellants were contractually bound under Section IV of their contracts to all School Board policies regardless of whether said policies were established before or during their contractual terms, we disagree with the trial court's statement that the attainment of specific growth targets was not specifically required by the terms of their contracts. However, this disagreement is not determinative to our ruling, as we affirm the finding that failure to meet the SPS growth targets could be used by the Superintendent and the School Board to determine competency.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    This Court takes note of La.
