Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeal is vacated and set aside, and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Hughes, J., would deny the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   GENOVESE, J., would deny.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
