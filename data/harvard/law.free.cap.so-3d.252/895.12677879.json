Defendant, charged with second degree kidnapping, was found guilty of simple kidnapping. This court determined in\n   <em>\n    State v. Price\n   </em>\n   , 17-K-0520 (La. 6/27/18),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12674806\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/250/230/\">\n    250 So.3d 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that guilty of simple kidnapping is not responsive to a charge of second degree kidnapping. In addition, the return of a nonresponsive verdict constitutes an error patent reviewable even in the absence of a defense objection. La.C.Cr.P. 920 ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Mayeux\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7598868\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/498/701/#p703\">\n    498 So.2d 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 703 (La. 1986) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore, we grant the application to remand to the court of appeal to reconsider its affirmance of defendant's conviction in light of\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   , because the jury's return of the non-responsive verdict was an implicit acquittal of the crime charged,\n   we remanded to enter a post-verdict judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
