Whether to grant an evidentiary hearing before ruling on a post-conviction motion is not a ministerial duty. Rather, a trial court's \"decision of whether to grant an evidentiary hearing on a [post-conviction] motion is ultimately based on the written materials before the court, and the ruling of the postconviction trial court on that issue is tantamount to a pure question of law subject to\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12365741,12365735\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/220/1133/\">\n    220 So.3d 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1142 (Fla. 2017) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Troy v.

Thus, the fact that the trial court ruled on Watts' motion for postconviction relief without an evidentiary hearing is not the proper subject of a petition for mandamus. Further, Watts had an adequate remedy of which he has availed himself in seeking review of the trial court's summary denial by way of a direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petition denied.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
