(\"Brock\"), on the issue of whether Mrs. Lyle suffered an occupational disease within the meaning of the Louisiana Workers' Compensation Act (\"LWCA\"). For the following reasons, we affirm the ruling of the workers' compensation judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mrs. Lyle began her employment with Brock in the payroll division in March of 2013. Her office was located in a trailer on the premises of the Valero plant in Norco. Mrs. Lyle claimed that from the beginning of her employment, she observed mold throughout the trailer on air vents, window sills, ceiling tiles, and baseboards, and that over time, the amount of mold increased. According to Mrs. Lyle, she began experiencing symptoms in the spring and summer of 2015, which included fatigue, phlegm in her chest and throat, burning, watery eyes, and sores in her nose. Throughout the year, her symptoms worsened, and on December 31, 2015, she suffered a nosebleed in front of her safety manager, which prompted a medical evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After testing confirmed the presence of mold and fungal spores in the offices, the trailer, in which Mrs. Lyle worked, was replaced in January of 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, Mrs. Lyle's headaches and nosebleeds stopped, but she continued to experience fatigue, phlegm in her chest and throat, and burning eyes. According to Mrs. Lyle, by April of 2016, her symptoms progressed, and she started experiencing pain in various parts of her body, increased fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive problems. In light of the progression of her symptoms, Mrs. Lyle resigned from her employment with Brock on June 19, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By August of 2016, Mrs. Lyle began experiencing abdominal bloating, numbness and tightness in her abdomen, swelling under her arms, and the feeling of having lumps under her skin. In addition, her breathing difficulties, upper back pain, and fatigue were all getting worse. In October\n   of 2016, Mrs. Lyle went to the St. Tammany Parish Hospital emergency room two times due to her worsening symptoms. After a battery of tests, Mrs. Lyle was diagnosed with sarcoidosis 2 of her lungs and lymph nodes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 15, 2016, Mrs. Lyle filed a disputed claim for compensation with the Office of Workers' Compensation, alleging an occupational disease and seeking wage and medical benefits, choice of physician, and penalties and attorney's fees. Brock filed an answer to her claim on December 7, 2016, and requested a preliminary determination hearing in accordance with La. R.S. 23:1201.1. After a hearing, the workers' compensation judge determined that \"Mrs. Lyle's claim for Workers' Compensation benefits is denied.\" In its decision rendered on June 23, 2017, the workers' compensation court expressed that under the particular facts of this case, the issue of mold exposure and the consequential issue of a clerical worker contracting sarcoidosis due to mold exposure at the office do not fall under the LWCA and further that neither the mold exposure nor developing sarcoidosis qualifies as an accident or an occupational disease under the LWCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 25, 2017, Brock filed a motion for summary judgment alleging that there is no genuine issue of material fact \"that this claim is not compensable because the claimant cannot establish the existence of an occupational disease as required by the Act,\" and thus, Brock is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In its memorandum in support of its motion, Brock specifically argued that sarcoidosis is not an enumerated disease under the act and no evidence has been presented to show that sarcoidosis was due to causes and conditions characteristic of and peculiar to the particular trade, occupation, process, or employment in which Mrs. Lyle was employed. Mrs. Lyle thereafter filed an opposition to the motion for summary judgment, asserting that summary judgment is precluded because there remains a critical question of fact to be decided, that being whether Mrs. Lyle's sarcoidosis was caused by her employment at Brock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the September 15, 2017 hearing on the motion for summary judgment, the parties submitted all the exhibits that were previously presented during the preliminary determination hearing, which included, among other items, Mrs. Lyle's medical records and the deposition testimony of Dr. Lesley Saketkoo, Mrs. Lyle's treating physician, and Dr. Brobson Lutz, an expert retained by Brock to evaluate the case. After considering the arguments of counsel and the exhibits introduced, the workers' compensation judge granted Brock's motion for summary judgment and dismissed her claim with prejudice on the basis that Mrs. Lyle's sarcoidosis did not satisfy the definition of \"occupational disease\" under the LWCA. The workers' compensation judge subsequently issued written reasons, in which she explained her ruling as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Louisiana Revised Statute \u00a7 23:1031.1(B) provides that \"[a]n occupational disease means only that disease or illness which is due to causes and conditions characteristic of and peculiar to the particular trade, occupation, process, or employment in which the employee is exposed to such disease.\" In interpreting La. R.S. \u00a7 23:1031.1(B), the Fourth Circuit has determined that injuries and illnesses resulting from mold exposure in a clerical job do not constitute\n   an actionable Worker's Compensation claim as they do not present an \"occupational disease\" as defined in the Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruffin v.

The burden of proof is on the party moving for summary judgment. However, if the mover will not bear the burden of proof at trial on the issue that is before the court on the motion for summary judgment, the mover is not required to negate all essential elements of the adverse party's claim, action, or defense, but rather to point out to the court the absence of factual support for one or more elements essential to the adverse party's claim, action, or defense. The burden then shifts to the adverse party to produce factual support sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact or that the mover is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

In that case, state employees filed a tort suit against their employer, the Department of Social Services and the Division of Administration, alleging that they suffered injuries and illnesses due to their exposure to mold and/or contaminants in and around their workplace. In response, the employer asserted the affirmative defense that the employees were prohibited from pursuing a tort claim under the provisions of the LWCA. The employees thereafter filed a motion for partial summary judgment to determine the viability of the employer's workers' compensation affirmative defense. The trial court granted the employees' motion for partial summary judgment finding that exposure to mold and mold spores did not fall under the exclusive remedy provision of the LWCA. The employer thereafter appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Fourth Circuit affirmed the ruling of the trial court, finding that the employees' claims against their state employer for exposure to mold in the workplace fell outside the scope of the LWCA because those claims did not fall under the accident or occupational disease classification of the compensation scheme. In discussing whether exposure to mold and mold spores constituted an occupational disease within the meaning of the LWCA, the appellate court stated, \"the test is whether exposure to mold and mold spores are 'conditions characteristic of and peculiar to the particular trade, occupation, process, or employment in which the employee is exposed to such disease.' \" Applying this test, the appellate court concluded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Injuries and illnesses resulting from mold exposure in a clerical job do not fall under the definition of La. R.S. 23:1031.1. The plaintiffs were hired as clerical staff. Contrary to defendant's assertions, we can find no basis in the statutory language or reasonable explanation as to why exposure to mold and mold spores could be considered 'characteristic of and peculiar to' clerical work. Thus, as the trial court found, plaintiffs do not fall into the second classification of those entitled to receive coverage that would bar delictual actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Ruffin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8343266\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/946/695/#p699\">\n    946 So.2d at 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Relying on its decision in\n   <em>\n    Ruffin,\n   </em>\n   the Fourth circuit, in\n   <em>\n    Watters v.

While enlarging workers' compensation coverage to cases of occupational disease, La. R.S. 23:1031.1 retains the requirement that an employee establish that the disease arises from his work,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , from \"causes and conditions\n   <em>\n    characteristic of and peculiar to the particular trade\n   </em>\n   , occupation, process, or employment\" in which the employee worked.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11742372\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/636/1194/#p1197\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Emphasis added\n   </em>\n   ).

On appeal, Mrs. Lyle insists that the analysis previously utilized by the courts, which focused on the employee's work-related duties, has been replaced with an analysis that focuses on causation. She specifically contends that the workers' compensation judge in this case committed legal error by relying on the two Fourth Circuit cases previously mentioned,\n   <em>\n    Ruffin\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Watters\n   </em>\n   , which were implicitly overruled by the Louisiana Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Arrant v. Graphic Packaging International, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Ms. Lyle contends that under the Supreme Court's recent pronouncement in\n   <em>\n    Arrant\n   </em>\n   , causation is the central determinant of whether a particular claimant's illness is a compensable occupational disease, and that the workers' compensation judge erred in not reaching the issue of causation when ruling on Brock's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Arrant\n   </em>\n   , the Louisiana Supreme Court was presented with the\n   <em>\n    res nova\n   </em>\n   issue of \"whether gradual noise induced hearing loss caused by occupational exposure to hazardous noise levels is a personal injury by accident or an occupational disease, or both, under the Louisiana Workers' Compensation Act (hereinafter \"LWCA\"), thereby entitling the defendant employer to immunity from suits in tort under the exclusivity provisions of the LWCA.\" In\n   <em>\n    Arrant\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff employees sought damages from their employer claiming that they suffered hearing losses as a result of their exposure to a hazardous level of noise during their employment at a paper mill, box plant, and carton plant. After considering the history and purpose of the LWCA, the Louisiana Supreme Court concluded that the noise-induced hearing loss fell squarely within the parameters of the LWCA, either as an accident or an occupational disease, and thus the employer was entitled to immunity from suits in tort under the LWCA. In finding that the plaintiffs' gradual noise-induced hearing loss was a result of their exposure to hazardous levels of noise in the course and scope of their employment and thus constituted an occupational disease within the meaning of the LWCA, the Louisiana Supreme Court stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Furthermore, as the statute directs, we must look to whether plaintiffs' disease or illness \"is due to causes and\n   conditions characteristic of and peculiar to the particular trade, occupation, process, or employment in which the employee is exposed.\" La.Rev.Stat. 23:1031.1(B). The legislature deliberately chose very broad and expansive words to determine whether a disease or illness is a compensable \"occupational disease\" under the Act. By definition, \"[a]n occupational disease means only that disease or illness which is due to causes and conditions characteristic of and peculiar to the particular trade, occupation, process, or employment in which the employee is exposed to such disease.\" La. R.S. 23:1031.1(B). In other words, an occupational disease is one in which there is a demonstrated causal link between the particular disease or illness and the occupation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Regan, supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Viewed in this light, it is clear that NIHL meets the statutory definition of an \"occupational disease\" under the Act. The court of appeal correctly found that a causal link between plaintiffs' hearing losses and their work-related duties was established by a reasonable probability by the plaintiffs' own testimony and that of their experts. As the trial court found, and the record evidence supports, the \"occupational disease\" was contracted during the course of employment and was the result of the nature of the employment. There is no requirement in the statute, as the plaintiffs suggest, that the nature of the disease or injury be unique to the particular trade or industry. Here, hazardous levels of industrial noise, which caused the plaintiffs' hearing loss, was a condition very characteristic of and peculiar to the particular employment of working in a paper mill or box plant, which the evidence demonstrated involves machinery and processes producing high levels of industrial noise. Additionally, as the court of appeal noted, expert testimony in the form of certified reports, depositions or direct examination in open court supported a finding that the hearing loss was an occupational disease caused by exposure to high levels of industrial noise at the facility. Thus, the court of appeal correctly concluded the evidence established the plaintiffs' hearing loss \"is due to causes and conditions characteristic of and peculiar to\" plaintiffs' particular trade, occupation, process or employment with the defendants.\n   <em>\n    Arrant v.

R.S. 23:1031.1 that was previously favored by the courts. We have thoroughly reviewed\n   <em>\n    Arrant\n   </em>\n   and can find no language that supports Mrs. Lyle's interpretation. While acknowledging that there is no requirement in the statute that the nature of the disease or injury be unique to the particular trade or industry, the Louisiana Supreme Court did not abolish the requirement of a causal link between the employee's illness and work-related duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As noted by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Mulder\n   </em>\n   , \"[w]hile enlarging workers' compensation coverage to cases of occupational disease, La. R.S. 23:1031.1 retains the requirement that an employee establish that the disease arises from his work,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , from 'causes and conditions\n   <em>\n    characteristic of and peculiar to the particular trade\n   </em>\n   , occupation, process, or employment' in which the employee worked.\"\n   <em>\n    Mulder\n   </em>\n   , 169 So.3d at 611. (emphasis in original)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Based on our review of the definition of \"occupational disease\" as set forth in the LWCA and the jurisprudence discussing that provision, including the\n   <em>\n    Arrant\n   </em>\n   case so heavily relied upon by Mrs. Lyle, as well as the evidence submitted at the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, we find no error in the ruling of the workers' compensation judge. We particularly note the deposition testimony of Mrs. Lyle's treating physician, Dr. Saketkoo, that sarcoidosis has nothing to do with a job classification. In her deposition, Dr. Saketkoo testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q. ... You understood that this woman had a very similar job to data processor; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A. This is not about her job. It's not about what she did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q. Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A. This is about the environment that she did her job in, okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Q. So the fact of what type of job she had or what her job classification was had nothing to do with her coming down with sarcoidosis ? It was the fact that where she was had this mold? Is that what you're saying?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A. High levels of mold, yeah ... And fungus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Dr. Saketkoo further stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A. Well, again, I'm going to say this. It's not about the work she did. It's not about the fact that she worked in payroll. It's not about the fact that she was a typist. It's not about the fact that she dealt with data. It's about the thing that we all know is antigenic and the causation of sarcoid and the proliferation of sarcoid and causing it to do damage in the body and that's the culprit of fungus and mold that she was doing her job in, not to do with the fact that she was -- her fingers were hitting the keyboard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q. Have you ever had occasion to treat anybody else with sarcoidosis who did data entry or typing or accounting, stuff like that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A. Oh, yeah. Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Q. And that would be because those people were likewise in an environment that had some of mold or what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   A. It could have been, you know, or it could have been we just don't know what the antigen for that person was because there was no clear evidence of exposure, you know, and sometimes we just don't look close to be quite honest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Q. So the fact that there were doing the data entry or doing the typing or doing the accounting, that wasn't the trigger, if you will --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Q. -- for them having sarcoidosis ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   A. Not, not by any stretch of my imagination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In addition, Dr. Lutz similarly stated that sarcoidosis is not characteristic of and peculiar to the particular trade, occupation,\n   or employment in which Mrs. Lyle was engaged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Given this evidence, we conclude that there is no genuine issue of material fact that Mrs. Lyle's sarcoidosis did not arise from causes and conditions characteristic of and peculiar to her employment as a clerical worker, and therefore, her illness does not fit within the definition of occupational disease within the meaning of the LWCA. Given this determination, Brock is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Accordingly, for the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the workers' compensation judge which granted Brock's motion for summary judgment and dismissed Mrs. Lyle's workers' compensation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     AFFIRMED\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Brock retained the services of a mold testing company, which performed testing of the offices in October of 2015 and January of 2016.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    In her brief, Mrs. Lyle asserts that a recent ruling by the Third Circuit in\n    <em>\n     Duplechin v.

It appears that the\n    <em>\n     Duplechin\n    </em>\n    court focused on causation because that was the primary focus of the workers' compensation ruling. After referencing the Louisiana Supreme Court's explanation of an occupational disease in\n    <em>\n     Arrant\n    </em>\n    , the\n    <em>\n     Duplechin\n    </em>\n    court stated: \"Notwithstanding any arguments regarding a link between the disease and the occupation that could exist in this case, the issue of causation of the claimant's alleged disability was the primary focus of the workers' compensation ruling.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12662178\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/237/1196/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12662178\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/237/1196/\">\n     at 1199\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
