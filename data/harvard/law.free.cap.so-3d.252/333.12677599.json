On July 10, 2014, the State charged Martin by Amended Information with one count of Sale of Cocaine within 1,000 feet of a Public Park or a Publicly Owned Recreational Facility and one count of Unlawful Use of a Two-Way Communication Device. Martin proceeded to trial and was found guilty as charged. This Court subsequently affirmed Martin's convictions and sentences.\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

On June 29, 2017, the State filed a response to Martin's post-conviction motion but did not attach any exhibits refuting Martin's claims. The trial court issued an order denying Martin's post-conviction motion on October 15, 2017 and attached a map depicting the location of the offense as well as an excerpt from the trial transcript concerning law enforcement testimony on the location of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Martin filed a timely Notice of Appeal and this Court ordered the State to respond. The State conceded in its response that the trial court erred by summarily denying Martin's Rule 3.850 motion because the two exhibits attached to the denial order do not conclusively refute Martin's ineffective assistance of counsel claims. As such, the State requests that this Court reverse and remand with instructions for the trial court to either attach portions of the record that conclusively refute Martin's claims or hold an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on the record before us, we reverse and remand for the trial court to either grant an evidentiary hearing or attach portions of the record that conclusively refute Martin's claims for ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Debose v.
