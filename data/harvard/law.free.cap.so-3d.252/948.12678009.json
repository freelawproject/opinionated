Rodgers, whose criminal history includes a sexual battery conviction, claims DPSC is improperly characterizing him as a sex offender and deeming him ineligible for work release pursuant to a DPSC regulation providing sex offenders are unsuitable for work release.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A commissioner of the district court\n   reasoned work release is a privilege, not a constitutional right or liberty interest, and a determination of work release eligibility lies exclusively within the discretion of DPSC. Therefore, the commissioner recommended Rodgers' suit be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 15:1178, 15:1188, and 15:1177A(9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Courts may intervene and reverse or modify DPSC's decisions in disciplinary cases only where the inmate's substantial rights have been prejudiced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 15:1177A(9);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 15:1178B and 1188A. Louisiana Revised Statute 15:1111, governing the work release program, pertinently provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   B.\n   <strong>\n    The department\n   </strong>\n   shall establish rules for the administration of the work release program and\n   <strong>\n    shall determine those inmates who may participate in the release program.\n   </strong>\n   Any inmate sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor\n   <strong>\n    shall be eligible\n   </strong>\n   at any time during his sentence to participate in the work release program, subject to the provisions of this Part. If any inmate violates the conditions prescribed by the department, his work release privileges may be withdrawn. Failure to report to or return from the planned employment shall be considered an escape under the provisions of R.S. 14:110. The department may approve as work release privileges, placement in universities, colleges, technical, vocational or trade schools, or in sheltered workshops or in training programs designed to improve the skills and abilities of the inmate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   * * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1.(1) Any inmate who has been convicted of forcible or second degree rape ( R.S. 14:42.1 ), aggravated arson ( R.S. 14:51 ), armed robbery ( R.S. 14:64 ), attempted murder ( R.S. 14:27 and 29), or attempted armed robbery ( R.S. 14:27 and 64),\n   <strong>\n    shall be eligible\n   </strong>\n   to participate in a work release program during the last six months of his term. Any person sentenced as a habitual offender pursuant to R.S. 15:529.1\n   <strong>\n    shall be eligible\n   </strong>\n   to participate in a work release program during the last year of his term if the offender has obtained a low-risk level designation determined by a validated risk assessment instrument approved by the secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section and unless the inmate is eligible at an earlier date, those inmates who have served a minimum of fifteen years in the custody of the department for those crimes enumerated in this Section\n   <strong>\n    shall be eligible\n   </strong>\n   to participate in a work release program during the last twelve months of their terms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (2) Any inmate convicted of producing, manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing or possession with intent to produce, manufacture, distribute, or dispense a controlled dangerous substance classified in R.S. 40:964\n   <strong>\n    shall be eligible\n   </strong>\n   to participate in the work release program if the inmate is otherwise in compliance with the standards for work release. [Emphasis added.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although Section 15:1111 contains certain inmate\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     eligibility\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   requirements,\n   inmate\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     participation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   is specifically reserved to the discretion of DPSC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Welch v.

The district court's judgment dismissing, without prejudice and without service, Rodgers' petition for judicial review is affirmed.
