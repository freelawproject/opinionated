Belsome\n   The defendant, Andrew Hunter, Jr., challenges his convictions and sentences for the rape of a seven year old female.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Facts\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The facts giving rise to the defendant's indictment and conviction occurred in the early morning hours of October 17, 2014, at the victim's home on Franklin Avenue in New Orleans. A man with shoulder-length dreadlocks, later identified as the twenty-three year old defendant, entered the home, where he woke seven-year-old A.S. and told her to get up and lock the back door. When A.S. got up, she went to the bathroom, where the defendant pulled her clothes down and raped her. After the defendant lured A.S. to the laundry room, he sexually assaulted her again, put a gun to her face, and tied her up. The defendant then told A.S. to count to fifty and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.S.'s mother reported that she got up at 5:00 a.m. to lock the door after her brother, Donald Smith, left for work, and then went into her daughter's room to get her ready for school, but A.S. was not in bed. A.S.'s mother began looking for her and eventually went into the laundry room, where she found her partially nude and bound, gagged, and blindfolded under a pile of clothes. A.S.'s mother called 911 and A.S. was transported to Children's Hospital, where Dr. Neha Mehta performed a sexual assault examination and the Children's Advocacy Center's (\"CAC\") interviewer, Dan Dooley, conducted a forensic interview. Dr. Mehta later informed Detective Jounay Ross that A.S. tested positive for chlamydia; this information prompted Det. Ross to contact A.S.'s mother, who said she was previously infected with chlamydia by a male friend, the defendant. A.S.'s mother later provided Det. Ross with an address where she could locate him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Det. Ross visited the address and spoke with the defendant, who matched A.S.'s description. The defendant was aware of A.S.'s rape and agreed to provide a DNA sample. Louisiana State Police Crime Lab analyst Elizabeth Hamilton analyzed the defendant's DNA sample and it matched the DNA collected from A.S.'s sexual assault kit. The Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office contacted Det. Ross and informed her. Det. Ross obtained an arrest warrant for the defendant and later found him hiding in the attic of his mother's house in Hammond, Louisiana, where he was arrested on December 22, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Procedural History\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant was charged by bill of indictment with two counts of first-degree rape, in violation of La. R.S. 14:42 ; one count of aggravated burglary, in violation of La. R.S. 14:60 ; one count of aggravated kidnapping, in violation of La. R.S. 14:44 ; and one count of sexual battery of a victim under thirteen years of age, in violation of La. R.S. 14:43.1(C)(2). The charge of aggravated kidnapping was subsequently amended to second-degree kidnapping in\n   violation of La. R.S. 14:44.1. The defendant appeared before the trial court and pled not guilty to the charges. Additionally, the defendant filed several pre-trial motions, including a motion to suppress evidence, which was ultimately denied. The matter proceeded to trial on August 9, 2017, and a jury found the defendant guilty on all charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence for each count of first-degree rape. Further, the defendant was sentenced to forty years without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence for the charges of aggravated burglary and second-degree kidnapping, and fifty years without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence for the charge of sexual battery of a person under thirteen years of age. The defendant neither objected nor filed a motion to reconsider sentence; rather, he filed a motion to appeal, which the trial court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Errors Patent\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A review of the record for errors patent reveals one. The defendant was convicted of aggravated burglary in violation of La. R.S. 14:60 and sentenced to forty years at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, in excess of the maximum of thirty years currently authorized by statute. Accordingly, we must vacate the defendant's sentence as to that charge and remand the matter to the trial court for resentencing of the aggravated burglary conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      <em>\n       Assignments of Error\n      </em>\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    On appeal, the defendant asserts three assignments of error:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n    1. The State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of second-degree kidnapping in violation of La. R.S. 14:44.1.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n    2. The trial court erred in denying the defendant his due process right to a fair trial which constitutes reversible error.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    3. The trial court erred in imposing excessive sentences upon the defendant which constitutes an abuse of discretion.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      <em>\n       Sufficiency of the Evidence (Second -Degree Kidnapping)\n      </em>\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    In his first assignment of error, the defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for second-degree kidnapping. In evaluating whether evidence is constitutionally sufficient to support a conviction, an appellate court must determine whether, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n    <em>\n     Jackson v. Virginia\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/#p319\">\n     443 U.S. 307\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 319,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/#p319\">\n     99 S.Ct. 2781\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/#p319\">\n     61 L.Ed.2d 560\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1979). This Court, in\n    <em>\n     State v. Gibson\n    </em>\n    , 15-1390, p.5 (La.

C. Cr. P. art. 821(B), which provides that \"a post-verdict judgment of acquittal shall be granted only if the court finds that the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the state, does not reasonably permit a finding of guilty.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    However, a reviewing court is not permitted to consider just the evidence most favorable to the prosecution, but must consider the record as a whole.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6786030,6785958\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/692/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    If rational triers of fact could disagree as to the interpretation of the evidence, the rational trier's view of all the evidence most favorable to the prosecution should be adopted.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6786030,6785958\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/692/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Additionally, \"a factfinder's credibility decision should not be disturbed unless it is clearly contrary to the evidence.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6786030,6785958\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/692/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    La. R.S. 14:44.1 provides, in pertinent part:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    A. Second degree kidnapping is the doing of any of the acts listed in Subsection B wherein the victim is:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    (1) Used as a shield or hostage;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    (2) Used to facilitate the commission of a felony or the flight after an attempt to commit or the commission of a felony;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    (3) Physically injured or sexually abused;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    (4) Imprisoned or kidnapped for seventy-two or more hours, except as provided in R.S. 14:45(A)(4) or (5) ; or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    (5) Imprisoned or kidnapped when the offender is armed with a dangerous weapon or leads the victim to reasonably believe he is armed with a dangerous weapon.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    B. For purposes of this Section, kidnapping is:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    (1) The forcible seizing and carrying of any person from one place to another; or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    (2) The enticing or persuading of any person to go from one place to another; or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    (3) The imprisoning or forcible secreting of any person.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The defendant's primary contention is that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a kidnapping occurred. The defendant contends that he never carried \"any person from one place to another\" as required by La. R.S. 14:44.1(B)(1). However, only one of the three enumerated acts in La. R.S. 14:44.1 must have occurred to satisfy the statute's requirements. As we did in\n    <em>\n     State v. Gibson\n    </em>\n    , we find that the defendant's actions clearly satisfy La. R.S. 14:44.1(B)(3) - namely, that he \"imprisoned or forcibly secreted\" A.S. 15-1390, p. 7,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6786030,6785958\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/692/\">\n     197 So.3d at 698\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This court in\n    <em>\n     State v. Williams\n    </em>\n    , 2002-0260 (La. App. 4 Cir. 3/12/03),\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9334645\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/842/1143/\">\n     842 So.2d 1143\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , found that moving of victim within their home satisfied this very element.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Here, the record shows that the defendant bound, gagged, and blindfolded A.S. before hiding her under a pile of clothes in the laundry room. These actions are clearly sufficient to show that defendant \"imprisoned or forcibly secreted\" her. For these reasons, we find that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of second-degree kidnapping.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      <em>\n       Denial of Due Process Rights\n      </em>\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    In his second assignment of error, the defendant sets forth several arguments revolving around the central assertion that he was denied his due process right to a fair trial. We address each argument individually below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      <em>\n       Prejudicial Comments and Bias by the Court\n      </em>\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The defendant asserts that the trial court made disparaging remarks to defense counsel that prejudiced the jury against the defendant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Article I, Section 16 of the Louisiana Constitution grants the defendant the right \"to an impartial jury and a fair trial.\" La. Const. art. I, \u00a7 16. During a jury trial, the judge must act as a neutral administrator of the law.\n    <em>\n     State v. Diggins\n    </em>\n    , 12-0015, p. 13 (La. App. 4 Cir. 10/23/13),\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7002412\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/126/770/#p784\">\n     126 So.3d 770\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 784. In discharging this duty, the judge must refrain from commenting upon the facts of the case in the presence of the jury, either by commenting on evidence or testimony or by giving an opinion as to what has been presented, proved, or not proved. La. C.Cr.P. art. 772. If, during trial, a defendant believes that the trial court commented improperly on the evidence, or made prejudicial comments in the presence of the jury, then defendant should object or move for a mistrial. La. C.Cr.P. arts. 770, 775. A motion for mistrial\n    or a contemporaneous objection to the alleged prejudicial comments or judicial bias preserves the issue for review on appeal. La. C.Cr.P. art. 841.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Because an appellate court reviews claims of prejudicial comments and bias using a harmless error analysis, the relevant inquiry is whether the guilty verdict actually rendered in this trial was surely unattributable to the error.\n    <em>\n     Diggins\n    </em>\n    , 12-0015, p.14,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7002412\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/126/770/#p784\">\n     126 So.3d at 784\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Moreover, the cumulative effect of harmless errors does not warrant the reversal of a conviction or sentence.\n    <em>\n     State v. Smith\n    </em>\n    , 11-0091, p.21 (La. App. 4 Cir. 7/11/12),\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7006769\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/96/678/#p691\">\n     96 So.3d 678\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 691. In order to constitute reversible error, the judge's improper comments must be such as to have influenced the jury and contributed to the verdict, thereby denying the defendant a fair trial.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7006769\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/96/678/#p691\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Defendant cites several instances of alleged prejudicial comments or disparaging remarks by the trial court towards defense counsel, as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n    1. As counsel was presenting his request for an attachment, the Court said, \"Okay, this is ridiculous. First of all, let me say this: you go from A to Z, right. So why don't you start at A? If you're asking me to issue a subpoena to the gentleman at his employment - and if you know the address - that's all you have to do. And you know you haven't even completed your sentence ...\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n    2. After more argument about the witness, \"[Defense Counsel], have a seat, sir. You are about two seconds away from me holding you in contempt again. Right. Let me be honest with you. So I'm not going to play this game with you in this trial today. So I am putting you on notice that you need to conduct yourself professionally and ethically throughout this trial. Now, I will attempt not to embarrass you in front of this jury. I will ask that you not embarrass yourself. But, [Defense Counsel], I'm telling you - and I'm putting you on notice right now - that I'm not going to deal with this.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n    3. During cross-examination of A.S.'s mother, the following exchange occurred:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n    Court: You have to let her finish answering the question. You're cutting her off. This is my last time instructing you of this, [Defense Counsel].\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n    [Defense Counsel]: What's the instruction?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n    Court: That you have to let her finish answering the question. She can't ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n    [Defense Counsel]: I agree.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    4. During cross-examination of Det. Ross, the following exchange occurred:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    Court: All right. Hold on one second. So you need to ask a question, 'cause those are statements. So I'm going to need you to direct a question to the witness.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n    [Defense Counsel]: Sure. I consider her an adverse witness and I'm cross-examining her.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n    Court: She's not been determined to be adverse. So you need to ask a question.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    [Defense Counsel]: Can I ask her leading questions, as a direct cross-examination?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n    Court: No. You have to ask her a question, [Defense Counsel]. And then I'll take it question by question. If they have an objection, then I'll rule on it. But right now you're making statements. So I need you to ask a question.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n    [Defense Counsel]: Ok.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n    5. After discussion about service on a witness, the following exchange occurred:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    Court: Let me just say a few things, [Defense Counsel]. Number one - and I want to be clear - because you're not a competent attorney. But I do want to be clear that you're speaking in circles. And some of the things you're saying don't really make much sense. Ok.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n    [Defense Counsel]: I'm sorry.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n    Court: [Defense Counsel], you're very disingenuous. And it is ridiculous that you would stand -\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n    [Defense Counsel]: Now...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n    Court: before this Court and not -\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    [Defense Counsel]: May I finish?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n    Court: - be truthful.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    6. Next instance:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    Court: And it is not the first time. It is not the second time.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    [Defense Counsel]: Oh no. No, ma'am.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n    Court: And I take extreme offense -\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n    [Defense Counsel]: Me, too.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n    Court: a - to the way you practice law, to your unprofessionalism. Let me tell you -\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The trial court has a duty to maintain control over the questioning of witnesses and presentation of evidence to the jury. In addressing similar comments made by the trial court in\n    <em>\n     State v. Jones\n    </em>\n    , this Court noted,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n    A trial judge has the responsibility to exercise control over the nature of the questions posed by counsel to ensure fairness and judicial economy. An unavoidable risk of this duty is that in the heat of a trial, adverse rulings may incorrectly appear to reflect the judge's opinion of a party, witness or theory of the case. Experienced trial lawyers aware of this risk weigh seriously these concerns in phrasing questions to a witness. Thus, the risk exerts a moderating influence on the excesses of advocacy.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    <em>\n     State v. Jones\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7506791\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/593/802/#p804\">\n     593 So.2d 802\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 804 (La. App. 4th Cir. 1992).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    , the defendant complained of the trial court's comment that defense counsel's questioning of a witness was \"out of line.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    at 803. Similarly, in this case, the bulk of defense counsel's complaints reference the trial court's comments that defense counsel was unprofessional. In this case, as in\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    , we find that these comments do not evince impartiality or bias. \"The challenged remark of the trial judge, whether inappropriate or not, does not rise to the level of a prejudicial error which requires reversal. Standing alone, the remark does not evidence the judge's abandonment of neutrality which is required to constitute prejudicial error.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    at 804.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Upon our review of the cited comments and remarks together with the overwhelming evidence, we find no merit to the defendant's argument that the trial court's comments prejudiced the jury and contributed to the verdict.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The defendant further asserts that the trial court displayed bias toward A.S. when she was allowed to walk into court and take a piece of candy from the minute clerk's desk similar to\n    <em>\n     State v. Cook\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7604723\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/485/606/\">\n     485 So.2d 606\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (La. App. 4 Cir. 1986). In\n    <em>\n     Cook\n    </em>\n    , this Court held that the trial judge's decision to reward the child witness with candy in the presence of the jury could be viewed by the jury as an indirect comment on this witness' veracity, which amounted to reversible error.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    at 609. However, the facts here are distinguishable. In the case\n    <em>\n     sub judice\n    </em>\n    , the State had A.S. briefly appear in court to show her availability to testify. Before leaving, A.S. took candy from the minute clerk's desk on her own initiative, without prompting or comment\n    by the trial judge.

The court denied the second motion for instanter subpoena for several reasons, including defense counsel's failure to exercise due diligence, noting the trial was continued no less than fifteen times before the current setting; the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office advised that they would not be able to serve the witness there; and counsel had not moved to appoint a special process server for that subpoena. Defense counsel's request to proffer was also denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    More importantly, the defendant made no showing that Mr. Rue's testimony would be either favorable or result in a different outcome, let alone both.
