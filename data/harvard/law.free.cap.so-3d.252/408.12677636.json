The pick-up order was entered upon the Motion for Order of Commitment to Take Respondent/Father into Custody and for Writ of Bodily Attachment filed by the Mandel Law Group on July 31, 2018. This motion was accompanied by an affidavit from attorney, Roberta G. Mandel, Esq., attesting that Baratta had failed to comply with the trial court's July 25, 2016 order to pay approximately $21,000 in attorney's fees to the Mandel Law Group, P.A. The Mandel Law Group formerly represented the Petitioner/Mother Tatiana Costa-Martinez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We reverse the pick-up order because, upon the filing of the motion for order of commitment and accompanying affidavit, no show cause order was issued and because there was no compliance with Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.840, applicable to indirect criminal contempt proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maher v.
