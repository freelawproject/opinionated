Frankie Terrell Jones was indicted for one count of first degree murder of Billy Ray Covington and one count of felon in possession of a firearm. A Calhoun County jury found Jones guilty on both counts, and the trial court sentenced him as a habitual offender under Mississippi Code Section 99-19-81 to life for the murder conviction and ten years for the felon in possession of a firearm conviction, with the sentences to be served concurrently. Jones appeals. Discerning no reversible error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On July 10, 2015, Jones invited Ashley Hobson and her roommate Hannah Walls to his camper trailer in Pittsboro, Mississippi. Jones, who was Hobson's drug dealer, told her he would give her and Walls some drugs and he planned to get more. That evening, Hobson and Walls went to Jones's trailer and spent the evening drinking and getting high. For entertainment, Jones and Walls fired gunshots outside the trailer. Hobson described the gun as black and explained it was not a revolver. Hobson and Walls spent the night at Jones's trailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. The next morning, Jones awoke Walls and asked her to take him to Mantee, Mississippi. Walls refused and went back to sleep. Jones then awoke Hobson and asked her to take him to Mantee to get some drugs. Hobson responded that she would if Jones provided gas and allowed her to use the drugs. Hobson told Jones that she had to go to her house to pay rent to her landlord. Jones and Hobson then left in her Nissan Xterra SUV and went to her house, which is near Buck's One Stop, a gas station in Calhoun City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Meanwhile that same morning, Marion Armstrong was driving into Calhoun City and saw Covington. Covington flagged down Armstrong and asked him for a ride. Armstrong complied and dropped off Covington at a church near Buck's. Covington was seen on video surveillance walking across Buck's parking lot at 9:54 a.m. Covington was wearing a white shirt, red tennis shoes, and a ball cap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Around the same time, Jones and Hobson approached Buck's and Jones spotted Covington. Jones asked Hobson to stop and told her that he owed Covington \"some dope.\" Jones asked Covington if he wanted to ride with them to get some drugs. Covington agreed and got in the back seat. They left and proceeded to County Road 308. While driving, Jones and Covington got into an argument about the drugs that Jones owed Covington. The argument escalated. Jones leaned over the front seat and hit Covington. Hobson told them, \"If ya'll are going to fight, get out[.]\" Hobson then pulled over on County Road\n   308. Jones and Covington exited the SUV and fought in the road and on the roadside. During the fight, Covington got on top of Jones, and Hobson told Covington to get off him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Covington got up and began to walk away. The pair continued arguing. Jones became angry and loudly told Covington, \"I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you.\" Hobson told Jones, \"Come on, let's go.\" Hobson, who had remained in the driver's seat the entire time, then heard a gunshot. Hobson saw that Jones had shot Covington in the back of the head as he was walking away. At trial, Hobson testified that she saw Jones shoot Covington in the back of the head and identified Jones as the shooter in the courtroom. After Jones had shot Covington, she saw Covington's \"knees buckle and him fixing to hit the ground.\" Hobson then heard at least four more gunshots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Hobson then told Jones to get in the SUV because the police were coming. Jones did so and they went to Hobson's house. Jones told Hobson, \"if you be quiet, everything will be okay\" and \"[y]ou won't end up like Billy Ray [Covington].\" After paying Hobson's rent to her landlord, they went to a store and then to Mantee. There, they bought some drugs and then stopped at a liquor store. After buying liquor, Jones and Hobson returned to Jones's trailer. Hobson dropped off Jones and picked up Walls. Hobson and Walls left and went to Grenada to get manicures, to shop, and to get some money from Hobson's child's father. Afterward, they returned to their house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. When Hobson and Walls arrived at their house, Jones was there. Hobson removed everything from her SUV that could implicate her in Covington's murder, including clothes and CDs. Hobson burned the items she had removed from her SUV in a burn pile in her yard because she was concerned that Covington might have touched something. After burning everything, Hobson left to go to her \"sugar daddy's house.\" On the way, Hobson stopped at a car wash and cleaned the inside of her SUV because she was scared the police might find out what had happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Earlier that same morning, on July 11, 2015, two individuals, who were riding all-terrain vehicles on County Road 308, discovered a body in the ditch alongside the road. The individuals called an emergency medical responder with the local fire department to report the body. The emergency medical responder then called 911 at 10:36 a.m. to report the body. At 10:38 a.m., dispatch for the Calhoun County Sheriff's Office advised Chief Deputy and Investigator Dean Poyner that a body had been found in a ditch on County Road 308.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. Chief Deputy Poyner arrived to the scene and immediately recognized the body as Covington, whom he had known for years. Covington was found dead and lying face down in the ditch, wearing the same clothes and cap that had been depicted in the Buck's surveillance video. Chief Deputy Poyner observed several gun casings around Covington. Covington had seven gunshot wounds, including gunshots to his head, neck, torso, back, and extremities. An autopsy on Covington revealed that the cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds, and the manner of death was homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. Cory Burrow, an investigator with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, assisted in the investigation. Investigator Burrow learned that around 10:25 a.m., a witness on County Road 308 had heard approximately six gunshots. Law enforcement developed Jones as a possible suspect. On the day of the murder, Jones voluntarily went to the sheriff's office at approximately 7:00 p.m. and submitted to an interview. Chief Deputy Poynor observed\n   that Jones's left eye was \"really bad red.\" Investigator Burrow also observed that Jones's eye was bruised and bloodshot, which appeared to be a result of a fight. Jones waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights and told law enforcement officers that he had been with Hobson earlier that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. Law enforcement conducted a series of interviews with Jones over the course of several days. During the investigation, Jones admitted to officers that he owned a .40 caliber pistol. Jones called his mother and informed her where the pistol was located. Chief Deputy Poyner then retrieved the pistol from Jones's mother. Chief Deputy Poynor showed the pistol to Jones. Jones identified the pistol and claimed ownership of it. Because Jones had a prior felony conviction, officers charged Jones with felon in possession of a firearm. Chief Deputy Poynor had the pistol tested, but it did not match the casings found at the crime scene, and it was determined that it was not the murder weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13. During the investigation, officers also learned that Jones and Covington had been in an argument days prior to the murder. Jones informed officers he and Covington were friends, but there had been a bad drug deal between them and he had tried to make it right by giving Covington some better drugs. Jones admitted that he had purchased a .40 caliber gun on Friday, the day before the murder. Jones also admitted he owned another small handgun, but he did not know where it was located. Jones told officers that he had been with Hobson and Walls doing drugs in the hours prior to Covington's death. Jones also said that, on the morning of Covington's death, he and Hobson had gone to Mantee in Hobson's SUV to buy more drugs. Jones, however, denied killing Covington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14. Hobson gave law enforcement two conflicting written statements. The first statement did not implicate Jones in Covington's murder. The second did implicate Jones in Covington's murder. Hobson explained that she had decided to provide more information in her second statement because her conscience was bothering her. Hobson also explained that she was scared of Jones, who could \"be a little crazy.\" During the investigation, Chief Deputy Poynor went to Hobson's residence and observed a burn pile beside her house. Hobson was arrested for having been an accessory after the fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15. Jones was indicted for the first degree murder of Covington as well as felon in possession of a firearm. The jury found Jones guilty on both counts. The trial court found that Jones was a habitual offender under Mississippi Code Section 99-19-81 (Rev. 2015). The trial court sentenced Jones as a habitual offender to life for first degree murder and ten years for felon in possession of a firearm. Jones appeals, raising the following three issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   I. Whether the trial court erred when it did not sustain Jones's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   challenge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   II. Whether the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   III. Whether Jones was denied effective assistance of counsel because no cautionary jury instruction regarding accomplice testimony was submitted to the trial court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Whether the trial court erred when it did not sustain Jones's\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    challenge.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16. The State used its first three peremptory strikes against Juror 5, Shauntika\n   McKinney; Juror 7, Rochelle Glaspie; and Juror 8, Stormy Cruthirds, effectively excluding three out of four potential African-American jurors. The State used its next two strikes against Juror 12, a Middle-Eastern male named Abdulrahman Alamry, and Juror 13, Amanda Burnett, a white female.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17. After the State tendered twelve jurors to the defense, counsel for the defense objected, stating, \"Your Honor, at this time I would like to make a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge. We've got five black folks in there, and four of those were struck.\" The trial court asked defense counsel to make a record. Defense counsel pointed out that the State's first strikes were against Jurors 5, 7, and 8, and that each of them was African American. Defense counsel mistakenly believed the State's fourth peremptory strike was used against an African-American male, Juror 12, Alamry. However, the clerk and sheriff corrected Jones's counsel, pointing out that Alamry was actually from Yemen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18. The trial court, recognizing that the State had struck three out of four potential African-American jurors, requested race neutral reasons for the strikes. The trial court asked if there was any dispute about the numbers. The State responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   You know, I don't dispute it. I didn't come in here knowing what their races are with the exception of juror number 5 and juror number 8. I knew that those were African-American individuals just from recollection. I will say that I don't believe a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   pattern has been established, but I do have race neutral reasons for each one of them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 19. The trial court then heard the State's reasons for striking the potential jurors. The State explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   According to law enforcement, we have prosecuted many McKinneys, known to be bootleggers; and we asked the question. They didn't respond. Juror number 7, Glaspie, is a common name. We've prosecuted many of those family members. We asked the question. He did not respond. On juror number 8, this is more of his attitude as a juror. When we came in, his body language and the way he communicated, his personality, he had his arms crossed looking at me shaking his head, no; and I just don't feel comfortable allowing a juror with that kind of body language to serve on one of my juries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20. In response, defense counsel stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Your Honor, it could be just like the Jones[es] and Jones[es]. I don't know if these folks were related. They were asked the question, and they didn't respond. If he wanted to ask them directly, he could have called on that juror number and specifically asked them during the voir dire, and he failed to do that. There was no response on anything from any of these; and three out of four blacks were challenged, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 21. The trial court initially did not recall Juror 8 but then agreed with the State's characterization, stating \"I don't know if it was so much contempt for the prosecutor, but the whole process. He was not happy to be here and didn't mind people knowing about it, anyway.\" The trial court found that a pattern had been shown but that the State had offered race neutral reasons for striking Jurors 5, 7, and 8. The trial court continued: \"At this time I'm going to allow the State's ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 22. The next day, the trial court returned to the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   issue, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Yesterday in jury selection there was a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge made to the State's jury selection process. At that time I think the record will show that three-wasn't\n   very deep into the jury selection process; and the State had used three of its challenges to challenge African-American jurors. At that time I found that there was a prima facie case of discrimination, or I don't know the proper word. I had asked the State to provide race neutral reasons for that selection. They did provide race neutral reasons, which I found was acceptable. To make the record complete I want it to show the final makeup of jurors: 14 members, 12 regular jurors and 2 alternates. There are fourteen members on the jury panel, 3 of which are obviously African-American; and I believe my records indicate that of the 14 potential strikes that the State had, 12 on the regular jury panel and 2 on the alternates, is they used 3 of those 14 potential strikes against African-American jurors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 23. After the State and defense finally rested, defense counsel renewed its\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge. The trial court denied the challenge, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The [c]ourt, having made a further record on the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge, indicated that the State was afforded a total of 14 strikes, peremptory strikes, in this case. Three of that 14 were used against African-Americans. The final panel as it was seated included three African-Americans out of the total jury panel. My ruling remains the same on the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 24. On appeal, Jones argues that the State unconstitutionally struck African-American jurors with unsupported claims that they were related to individuals previously prosecuted or convicted of crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 25. \"Th[e] Court reviews a trial court's ruling on a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge with great deference and will not overturn the trial court's ruling unless it is clearly erroneous or against the overwhelming weight of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Pruitt v.

Jones argues that the State's use of two of its peremptory strikes on African-American Jurors 5 and 7 because it suspected that they were related to individuals whom the State previously had prosecuted was clearly a pretext for discrimination. Jones contends that the State did not question the potential jurors about their family relationships, and there was no proof that they were related to the individuals referenced by the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 35. Jones's contentions miss the mark. First, the State asked the venire whether any of them had a close, personal friend or family member who had been charged with a crime. When asked to provide race neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes, the State explained that part of the reason for exercising the strikes for Jurors 5 and 7 was that they had not answered the question. Second, there was no undisputed evidence that the jurors were not related.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 36. In\n   <em>\n    Pruitt\n   </em>\n   , the defendant argued that the record lacked support that the jurors were related to individuals prosecuted by the county.\n   <em>\n    Pruitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8188711\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/986/940/#p942\">\n    986 So.2d at 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 16). The Court held that, although lack of record support is one indication of pretext, the basis for the prosecutor's strike need not be in the record.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8188711\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/986/940/#p942\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8188711\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/986/940/#p942\">\n    at 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 19).

Here, the State based its reasoning for striking Jurors 5 and 7 on personal knowledge and information gained from law enforcement. The defense, which had been tasked with the burden of proof, simply responded to the State's race neutral reasons by saying:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Your Honor, it could be just like the Jones[es] and Jones[es]. I don't know if these folks were related. They were asked the question, and they didn't respond.

There was no response on anything from any of these; and three out of four blacks were challenged, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 38. The trial court did not prevent defense counsel from offering proof to show pretext in any way. In lieu of offering proof, defense counsel offered a mere cursory response, confirming that he did not know if the potential jurors were related to individuals who had been prosecuted in the past. Defense counsel obviously had the idea that questioning the jurors individually might be prudent but did not do so. If defense counsel truly had believed that the State's race neutral reasons were unfounded and merely pretext, he had the opportunity to offer proof in rebuttal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Birkhead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7046053\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/57/1223/#p1231\">\n    57 So.3d at 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 27) (the burden is on the appellant to ensure the record contains sufficient evidence to support his assignment of error on appeal). Most importantly, the relevant inquiry at the third step of the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   process is not whether\n   the State disproves pretext; rather, it is whether the opponent of the strike has met its burden of proving pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 39. The dissent's argument relies on characterizing the above-quoted statement by defense counsel as a rebuttal to the State's proffered race neutral reason, but the statement is no rebuttal of anything. Counsel for the defense asserted no facts or even argument. The statement fairly can be characterized as containing no positive assertions to contradict the State's proffered reason; defense counsel essentially stated that he did not know any pertinent information.

The Court of Appeals summarized the State's race neutral justifications and the trial court's determinations as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   The prosecution's first peremptory challenge was exercised against juror number twenty-two, Willie B. Nance. The prosecution stated that it had prosecuted many defendants and convicted several in the area with the last name Nance. After hearing these reasons the judge recalled hearing two cases of a person named Nance being prosecuted and found that this was a race-neutral justification for the exercise of the peremptory strike.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   The second peremptory challenge was used against juror number twenty-four, Melissa Randle. The prosecution stated that its reasoning for striking Randle was the same as before, that it had prosecuted many Randles and that Ms. Randle had not answered the jury questionnaire about her family. The judge then requested the names and numbers of Randles prosecuted by the district attorney's office but the question could not be answered sufficiently. The judge ruled the reason was sufficiently race neutral to survive a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge, but that he could not rule on the reason's truthfulness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   The third peremptory challenge was used against juror number thirty-five, Travis Ledbetter. The prosecution again mentioned a previous prosecution of a Ledbetter, specifically Charles Ledbetter. Apparently, Charles is an infamous character to the judge because during Charles'[s] prosecution he made accusations against the judicial system, the district attorney's office and the court. Charles and Travis are related and the\n   judge quickly ruled this was a race-neutral strike.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   The fourth and final peremptory challenge was used to strike juror number forty-two, Marie Hairston. The prosecution struck her because she was currently unemployed, it had prosecuted persons with her last name before, and she had failed to answer the question on her family when asked in the questionnaire.

Defense counsel objected based on\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   and argued that a prima facie case that race was the criteria for the State's challenge had been shown. Williams was a member of a cognizable racial group and several members of his race had been excluded as veniremen. Williams maintained that those facts created an inference that the State used its peremptory challenges to strike African-Americans. In response, the prosecutor explained that a defendant with the same last name as the venireman had recently been indicted on armed robbery and for this reason the State had exercised one of its peremptory challenges. The trial judge considered the State's explanation of the strike and found it to be racially neutral. The trial judge explained that the last name was an \"unusual name\" and \"were this a common name, that might be a different situation.\" We place our trust in trial judges to determine whether or not a discriminatory motive underlies the prosecutor's articulated reason.\n   <em>\n    Lockett v.

Jones argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict because the State's theory of the case was based on evidence that was \"fanciful, farfetched[,] and unreasonable.\" Specifically, Jones argues that, although Buck's surveillance video captured Covington walking past the store's gas pumps at 9:54 a.m., the State did not produce Buck's surveillance video capturing Hobson's SUV passing by the store. Jones argues that the video should have captured Hobson's SUV because she had indicated in a statement that she had passed by Buck's at 9:56 a.m. Because the surveillance video shown at trial did not show Hobson's SUV passing by Buck's and picking up Covington, Jones contends that the evidence is insufficient to support the first degree murder verdict. Essentially, Jones's position is that, because surveillance video should have captured Hobson's SUV at some point on the morning of the murder, Hobson's account of the murder was impossible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 48. Jones was indicted for first degree murder in violation of Mississippi Code Section 97-3-19(1)(a). Section 97-3-19 defines first degree murder as follows: \"The killing of a human being without the authority of law by any means or in any manner ... [w]hen done with deliberate design to effect the death of the person killed, or of any human being, shall be first-degree murder[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2097-3-19\">\n    Miss.

Hobson testified that on the morning of July 11, 2015, she and Jones were in her SUV on the way to her house, which is near Buck's. While Hobson provided a statement that she had passed by Buck's at 9:56 a.m., she also testified that Jones spotted Covington at Buck's as they passed by around 9:40 a.m. or 9:50 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Hobson testified that he told her to pick up Covington because he owed him \"some dope.\" Hobson testified that Covington got in the back seat and they proceeded to County Road 308.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 50. Hobson testified that Jones and Covington then began to argue about a previous drug deal. Hobson testified that the argument escalated, and that Jones punched Covington in the back seat. Hobson testified that she pulled over on County Road 308 and Jones and Covington exited the SUV. Hobson testified that the men proceeded to fight, and that Covington ended up on top of Jones. Hobson testified that Covington got off of Jones and began to walk away. Hobson testified that Jones yelled at Covington, \"I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you.\" Hobson testified that she heard a gunshot and saw Jones shoot Covington in the back of the head. Hobson testified that she saw Covington's knees buckle and that she saw him hit the ground. Hobson testified that she heard at least four more gunshots. Hobson testified that they left the scene after Covington had hit the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 51. Hobson's testimony was corroborated at trial. Two individuals riding all terrain vehicles on Count Road 308 discovered a body lying face down in the ditch by the roadside. Chief Deputy Poynor testified that he had responded to the scene and had identified the body as Covington. An individual also informed law enforcement that several gunshots had been fired that morning on County Road 308. Deputy Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Mississippi John Brently Davis testified as an expert in the area of forensic pathology. Deputy Chief Davis testified that Covington had suffered a total of seven gunshot wounds. Deputy Chief Davis opined that the cause of Covington's death was multiple gunshot wounds and the manner of death was homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 52. Chief Deputy Poynor corroborated Hobson's account regarding a previous bad drug deal between Jones and Covington. Chief Deputy Poynor testified that Jones had told him there had been a bad drug deal between him and Covington. Chief Deputy Poynor testified that Jones had \"tried to make it right\" with Covington \"by giving him some better dope.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 53. Chief Deputy Poynor testified that Jones's eye was red and inflamed when he interviewed Jones the day of the murder. Investigator Burrow also testified that he had observed Jones's eye was bruised and bloodshot, apparently the result of a fight. Glenda Armstrong, who lived on the same lot as Jones, testified that she had seen him the night before the murder and in the early morning hours on the day of the murder. Glenda Armstrong testified that she did not notice anything wrong with Jones's eye at the time. After the murder, Glenda Armstrong testified that she had noticed Jones's eye was red and asked him what had happened. Glenda Armstrong testified that Jones had responded, \"Me and Billy got into an altercation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 54.

The purported timestamp discrepancy and absence of Hobson's SUV on Buck's surveillance video are relevant only to the weight and worth of the evidence, which is solely within the jury's province. The purported timestamp discrepancy and absence of Hobson's SUV on Buck's surveillance video do not affect the essential elements of first degree murder.

Even so, the inconsistencies now alleged by Jones were developed at trial and squarely presented to the jury for factual resolution. Sheriff Greg Pollan testified that the timestamp on Buck's surveillance video was anywhere between three to five minutes off. Chief Deputy Poynor was specifically asked why Hobson's SUV did not appear on the video; he explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Q.

The Court today strikes a great blow to the progress this State has made in eliminating discrimination from the jury-selection process. During the jury-selection process for Frankie Terrell Jones's trial, the State used four of its first five peremptory strikes to eliminate three potential African American jurors and one Middle-Eastern juror. The defense raised a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   When asked for its race-neutral reasons for the first two peremptory strikes, the State responded that law-enforcement officers had informed the prosecution that people with the same last name previously had been prosecuted in that county. Counsel for the defense rebutted the State's explanations, arguing that the State had not alleged that these previously prosecuted persons were of any relation to the two potential jurors and had not attempted to voir dire the potential jurors. Yet, without requiring verification or inquiring if the potential jurors were related to those people, the trial court, and now this Court, found no issue with the vague and unsupported explanations offered by the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b6 66.

In\n   <em>\n    Flowers\n   </em>\n   , the State provided a specific example of why it had used a peremptory strike against the potential juror-that the juror's\n   <em>\n    husband\n   </em>\n   had been convicted criminally and had problems with the law. If the State had been aware of a familial relationship in this case, it offered no indication of who in the McKinney or Glaspie family had been prosecuted or at what point in time the family member had been prosecuted. If McKinney's or Glaspie's distant cousin had been prosecuted twenty years ago, it likely would have no effect on her fitness as a juror today. \"[T]he prosecutor must give a 'clear and\n   <em>\n    reasonably specific\n   </em>\n   ' explanation of his 'legitimate reasons' for exercising the challenges.\"\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    476 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   98 n.20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

The majority takes issue with Jones's arguments that the State had not questioned the potential jurors about family relationships and that no proof existed that the potential jurors were related to the individuals referenced by the State. To justify those strikes, the majority writes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   First the State asked the venire whether any of them had a close, personal friend or family member that had been\n   charged with a crime. When asked to provide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes, the State explained that part of the reason for exercising the strikes for Jurors 5 and 7 was because they had not answered the question. Second, there was no undisputed evidence that the jurors were not related.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   During voir dire, the State questioned the collective jury pool, asking:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   The next question is about whether any of you have been charged with a crime or close, personal friends, or family members that have been charged with a crime; and the judge kind of went over this a little bit.

Out of the collective jury pool, only five potential jurors responded in the affirmative: Jurors 13, 17, 48, 52, and 63. Out of those five, the State tendered the jury pool before it reached jurors 52 and 63. Therefore, the State had the opportunity to strike three potential jurors that had responded affirmatively that they had family members who had been charged with a crime. The State tendered two of those three jurors. State accepted Juror 17, Sherry Williams, who had a cousin who had been prosecuted in the same county. The State also accepted Juror 48, Ernie Doss, who had a family member convicted of a felony in the same area. Yet, although Jurors 5 and 7 had not indicated that they were related to or had any close personal friends that had been charged with a serious crime, instead of giving credence to the potential jurors or questioning those jurors further, the State, the trial court, and now the majority presume that only the two African American jurors were untruthful in their silence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \u00b6 73. Moreover, I note that, although the prosecution made lengthy prefatory remarks in its question to the jury pool, its specific question to the jury regarding relationships with individuals charged with crimes was: \"But anybody have any close, personal friends that have been charged with crimes?\" Hence, the prosecution wholly failed to ask the potential jurors if any family members had been charged with crimes. The majority's statement that \"the State asked the venire whether any of them had a close, personal friend\n   <em>\n    or family member\n   </em>\n   who had been charged with a crime\" is inaccurate. (Maj. Op. \u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \u00b6 74. The majority additionally states that \"there was no undisputed evidence that the jurors were not related.\" (Maj. Op. \u00b6 35). Yet, the opposite of that statement is far more true. No evidence exists in the record that those jurors were of any relation. Requiring the opponent of a peremptory strike to present undisputed evidence to rebut every explanation that the proponent of the strike offered would force a party challenging a peremptory strike somehow to: 1) anticipate the jurors on which the proponent of the strike may intend to use peremptory strikes; 2) imagine each possible explanation the proponent may use to defend that strike; and 3) be prepared to disprove any and every reason provided by the proponent. In the alternative, the challenging party would have to be allowed a recess after making a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge, so it could be provided an opportunity to develop information disproving the proffered explanation. The defense counsel in this case sufficiently\n   responded to the State's proffered explanation when he pointed to the glaring absences in the State's assertions. The majority finds that the trial court may accept vague, unsupported reasons for striking jurors, and allows the State idly to sit by, basking in the insurmountable security granted to it by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   \u00b6 75. The comment to Mississippi Rule of Professional Conduct 3.8 states that the prosecutor \"has the responsibility of a minister of justice and not simply that of an advocate.\" M.R.P.C. 3.8 cmt. Nothing in the record rebuts the conclusion that prosecutor's proffered explanations were based on anything other than the fact that these two potential jurors had the same last name as people who had been prosecuted before. In essence, the prosecution's explanations resound in pretext. If the prosecution had been concerned about those two jurors possibly being related to \"bootleggers\" or to individuals with the same last name who had been prosecuted, the prosecutor should have asked that question in voir dire. The prosecution failed to do this. It is insufficient simply to state that individuals with the same last name have been prosecuted without more.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The assertion that a juror was struck because people of the same last name had been prosecuted previously, without more, is suggestive of pretext.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b6 76. The majority cites\n   <em>\n    Chamberlin v. State\n   </em>\n   , in which the State struck seven African American potential jurors.\n   <em>\n    Chamberlin v.

The majority states that \"the Court wrote that because the objector failed to offer any proof that the State's reasons were pretextual, the State's reasons for the challenges were the only considerations before the trial court.\" In\n   <em>\n    Chamberlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   however, the defense offered no rebuttal to the State's reasons for the first four jurors challenged.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210969\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/989/320/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And on the remaining three jurors, the defense failed to rebut the specific reasons proffered by the State.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210969\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/989/320/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \u00b6 77. The majority further writes that, \"in the absence of rebuttal by the challenging party, the trial court is limited to the reasons proffered by the party exercising the peremptory strike.\" (Maj. Op. \u00b6 40). The majority's statements are misleading. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Chamberlin\n   </em>\n   , here, counsel for Jones did rebut the State's proffered explanations by pointing out correctly that the prosecutor had failed to state that an actual relationship existed and had not questioned the jurors during voir dire concerning the potential relationship. Thus, the majority errs in its conclusion that defense counsel had failed to rebut the State's proffered explanations. At that point, the trial court abused its discretion in failing to require the State to support its proposed explanation with some form of verification that an actual relationship existed. Jurors must not be disqualified based solely on the State's suspicions that the jurors\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have been related to people that had been convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   \u00b6 78.

First, that protection from racial discrimination in the jury-selection process extends to the litigants. A litigant has the right to participate and place information before the trial court. Second, the protection from racial discrimination in the jury-selection process extends also to potential jurors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campbell v.

Those potential jurors are not given an affirmative opportunity to question the jury-selection process. Nor can we assume that the interest of the potential jurors in being free from racial discrimination is so aligned with the interests of the litigants as to be protected by the litigants. The burden of protecting potential jurors from racial discrimination rests squarely with the court. It is therefore the responsibility of the trial court to give meaningful review, rather than mere lip service, to the question of pretext in jury selection. Under the facts of this case, I would find that the trial court abused its discretion by giving mere lip service, rather than meaningful review, to the issue of pretext.

This number includes several inmates who were convicted in that author's home county. The fact that these seventy inmates, some of whom were convicted in the home county of the dissent's author, share the same last name as the author of the dissent, is not indicative of any relationship between the dissent's author and these seventy persons.
