Husband concedes that, based on Husband's Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Wife's responsibility for these expenses should be only 28.48 percent rather than the 33.33 percent ordered in the final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    To the extent that Wife's argument is based upon the trial court's failure to recite specific factual findings warranting the denial of Wife's alimony claim, we note that Wife filed no motion for rehearing directed toward the final judgment, and the basis for the trial court's ruling is supported by the record.\n    <em>\n     Broadfoot v.
