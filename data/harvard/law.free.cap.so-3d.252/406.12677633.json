The petition, however, failed to set forth any facts that constitute the basis for entitlement to a belated appeal as required by Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.141(c)(4)(F). Additionally, the petition was not sworn to as required by rule 9.141(c)(4)(F). Accordingly, we deny the petition as facially insufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gugelman v.
