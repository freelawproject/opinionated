The trial court also dismissed the action based on its finding that the personal representative failed to comply with the informal presuit discovery process for medical malpractice claims in violation of section 766.205, Florida Statutes (2011). Significantly, in dismissing under this basis, the trial court made no finding that any perceived noncompliance with the discovery process resulted in prejudice to the Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Reviewing both bases for dismissal for an abuse of discretion and without addressing the issue of prejudice, the First District Court of Appeal affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Morris v.

First, the purpose of the medical malpractice presuit investigation is to \"facilitate evaluation of the claim.\" \u00a7 766.205(1), Fla. Stat. (2011). Indeed, as we have explained, the presuit process was created to \"facilitate the expedient, and preferably amicable, resolution of medical malpractice claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Oken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7041910\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/62/1129/\">\n    62 So.3d 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1133 n.1 (Fla. 2011) (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 766.201(2), Fla. Stat. (2011) (\"It is the intent of the Legislature to provide a plan for prompt resolution of medical negligence claims.\"). Second, this Court must construe the medical malpractice presuit screening requirements \"in a manner that favors access to courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Patry v. Capps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7449882\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/633/9/#p13\">\n    633 So.2d 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 13 (Fla. 1994) (citing\n   <em>\n    Weinstock v.

Additionally, we hold that, before a medical malpractice action can be dismissed based on a trial court's finding that the plaintiff or plaintiff's counsel failed to comply with the informal presuit discovery process for medical malpractice actions, the trial court must find that such noncompliance prejudiced the defendant. This holding is consistent with our precedent, which makes clear that before an action can be dismissed for a plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery, the trial court must find that the plaintiff's noncompliance prejudiced the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ham v. Dunmire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9039673\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/891/492/#p499\">\n    891 So.2d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499 (Fla. 2004) ;\n   <em>\n    Kukral v.

On appeal, the reviewing court should determine whether there was, in fact, a discovery violation and whether that violation prejudiced the defendant. To hold otherwise would not only deprive plaintiffs of their constitutional right to access the courts but would also frustrate the Legislature's intent in enacting the medical malpractice statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In this case, because the record demonstrates that Morris's presuit expert was qualified, and because the record does not establish that the Defendants suffered any prejudice for the alleged noncompliance with discovery, we conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing Morris's action. Accordingly, we quash the First District's decision and remand with instructions to reinstate Morris's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This case arises out of a medical malpractice wrongful death action brought by Tuyuana L. Morris, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Shunteria S. McIntyre, the decedent. As this case was dismissed before the opportunity for formal discovery, the facts set forth below, regarding the events that led to the decedent's death, are taken from the complaint and the affidavit of Morris's presuit expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 22, 2008, the decedent, who was pregnant, was accepted as a patient at Marianna OB/GYN Associates, Inc., for prenatal (obstetric) care by Dr. Orlando S. Muniz. Over the next three months, the decedent visited Dr. Muniz and Jackson Hospital numerous times with complaints of nausea and vomiting. By December 17, 2008, the decedent had lost twenty-six pounds since her October 22 visit; by December 29, the decedent had lost a total of thirty-six pounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 18, 2009, the decedent went to GCMC, complaining of, among other things, mouth sores and blisters, vomiting, and dizziness. She could not eat, walk, or use the restroom, was suffering hallucinations,\n   and was unable to detect movement of her unborn baby. On January 21, the decedent delivered a stillborn baby at GCMC. After delivery, the decedent underwent a surgical procedure-dilation and curettage. Hours after the surgery, the decedent was discharged from GCMC by Dr. Stephen G. Smith and advised to return for a follow-up appointment in three weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Three days later, on January 24, 2009, the decedent collapsed at home. She was transported to a nearby hospital where she died. An autopsy revealed that the decedent's cause of death was \"Klebsiella Pneumoniae Septicemia along with contributing causes [of] recent Intrauterine fetal demise and Severe Acute Diarrhea.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Prior to filing the complaint, Morris provided the Defendants with a notice of intent to initiate medical malpractice litigation and a verified written medical expert opinion, as required by section 766.203(2), Florida Statutes (2011). The expert opinion was provided by Dr. Margaret M. Thompson, who attested in a sworn affidavit that she was a board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist. Dr. Thompson first obtained board certification in 1984 and was thereafter recertified in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2009. Over the course of her thirty-year career, she delivered more than 14,000 babies, had been \"Chief of the OB-GYN department at a large medical center, Chief of Staff at a small women's specialty hospital, and member of hospital-wide peer review committees.\" According to her affidavit, Dr. Thompson received her Juris Doctorate in 2007 and her Master's in Public Affairs in 2008. She also swore that she \"was engaged in full-time patient care until March 2008.\" Although Dr. Thompson stated in her affidavit that she was now retired due to arthritis in her hands, she was currently licensed to practice medicine in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Upon receiving Morris's notice of intent to initiate medical malpractice litigation and Dr. Thompson's affidavit, the Defendants requested additional information related to Dr. Thompson's qualifications, including a detailed employment history for Dr. Thompson from January 2001 through the present, the number of hours per week Dr. Thompson devoted to the active clinical practice of the same or similar specialty field, and the number of babies Dr. Thompson delivered each year from 2006 through 2009. Morris responded to the Defendants by stating, \"See Affidavit of Dr. Margaret Thompson; please also see medical records as provided by Jackson Hospital as to treatment provided or the lack thereof.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Thereafter, Morris filed this action, alleging that the Defendants were negligent in, among other things, failing to recognize the severity of the decedent's complaints and failing to correctly diagnose and treat the decedent's condition. The Defendants moved to dismiss, arguing first, that Dr. Thompson was not a qualified expert under section 766.102(5)(a) 2, Florida Statutes (2011)-which requires that an expert in a medical malpractice case devote professional time during the three years immediately preceding the date of the occurrence that is the basis for the action-because she \"was enrolled in law school and graduate school during the three years prior to the time of the subject incident.\" GCMC and Jackson Hospital further argued that Dr. Thompson was not qualified under section 766.102(6), Florida Statutes (2011)-which requires that an expert in a medical\n   malpractice case concerning the standard of care of medical support staff such as nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants have knowledge of the standard of care applicable to such medical support staff. Thus, because Morris failed to provide corroboration of reasonable grounds to initiate medical malpractice litigation in a verified written medical expert opinion from a\n   <em>\n    qualified\n   </em>\n   medical expert, the Defendants argued, dismissal was warranted under section 766.206(2), Florida Statutes (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As a second basis for dismissal, the Defendants argued that Morris failed to provide them with the additional information they requested during the informal presuit discovery process, as required by statute. Thus, the Defendants argued, Morris did not act in good faith during the statutory presuit period and dismissal was warranted under section 766.205(2), Florida Statutes (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court agreed with the Defendants' skepticism, finding that the \"general qualifications\" in Dr. Thompson's affidavit did \"not state specifically the level of practice that she engaged in during the three years immediately preceding the date of the occurrence ... alleged in [Morris's] complaint.\" The trial court also agreed with the Defendants that Morris refused to provide the additional information regarding Dr. Thompson's qualifications sought by the Defendants. Relying on this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7041910\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/62/1129/\">\n    62 So.3d 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the trial court permitted the Defendants to engage in limited discovery directed solely to Dr. Thompson's qualifications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In compliance with the trial court's order, the parties scheduled the deposition of Dr. Thompson. Prior to the deposition, the Defendants requested certain documents, including copies of \"any and all publications\" authored by Dr. Thompson and copies of her law school and graduate school transcripts. Morris objected to the Defendants' request for production, arguing that the documents requested \"were beyond the scope\" of the order, were not in Dr. Thompson's possession, and related to information that had already been produced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At the deposition, Dr. Thompson testified that from 2006 through her retirement from clinical practice in March 2008, she worked more than fifty hours per week as an obstetrician-gynecologist (OB-GYN) in her office and at a hospital. However, the Defendants continued questioning Dr. Thompson as to how she could attend law school while continuing to engage in full-time patient care. Dr. Thompson explained that if she \"were working a hundred hours a week and 50 were devoted to [her] practice, that still le[ft] [her] 50 hours for law school.\" Additionally, prior to starting law school, Dr. Thompson met with the dean to inform him that she was going to continue practicing medicine. Although the law school did not have any special accommodations for part-time or alternative students, the dean allowed Dr. Thompson to \"choose the section that the hours of classes would most accommodate [her] practice schedule.\" Dr. Thompson explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   After the first year, then I had a lot more flexibility. For the first year, I\n   picked the section that classed, as I recall, from 8:30 to noon Monday through Thursday. On some mornings I would have a surgery or C-section prior to going to class at 7:00 or 7:30 in the morning. I went directly from my classes at 12:00 and started my practice in the office at 12:30 or 1:00, and worked till about 7:00 in the evening. I went home, I studied for law school if I wasn't on call or did not have patients in labor. If I did, I stayed at the hospital and always had my books ready to study there if I needed to be at the hospital. On weekends-on Friday, when I did not have classes, I usually did my surgeries and my deliveries that might be elective, like inductions. On Saturdays and Sundays I took call and studied.... I tell you, after the first year when I had more flexibility, I selected classes that, when possible, met for longer periods, two days a week, like Tuesdays and Thursdays. So I grouped my classes together to minimize the time that I had to be away from the office and the hospital. And I took an extra semester to graduate.... And that's how I did it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Following the deposition and an evidentiary hearing, the trial court granted the Defendants' motion to dismiss. Noting its previous determination that Dr. Thompson's affidavit did \"not state specifically the level of practice she engaged in during the three years immediately preceding the date of occurrence,\" the trial court wrote that it \"once again querie[d] the feasibility\" of Dr. Thompson's statement that she was engaged in full-time patient care until March 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moreover, the trial court found that the Defendants' \"reasonable inquiries\" as to Dr. Thompson's qualifications \"remain unanswered due to [Morris's] counsel [sic] restrictions to the limited discovery process.\" Referencing Morris's counsel's repeated objections during Dr. Thompson's deposition and direction to Dr. Thompson to not answer certain questions, the trial court found that the Defendants were \"thwarted\" from learning certain information, such as whether Dr. Thompson was aware of the American Bar Association (ABA) accreditation rules restricting students to no more than twenty hours of work per week while attending law school and whether she had applied for disability \"during the same period of time preceding this suit\" due to her arthritis. Further, the court found that the actions of Morris's counsel \"were purposeful and designed to deprive the Defendants' [sic] of the ability to meaningfully participate in pre-suit discovery of the medical negligence claims against them, and as such was not in good faith. Twenty three months after the initial hearing,\" the trial court wrote, \"the record establishes scant additional information about the specific qualifications of Dr. Thompson, nor her ability to devote professional time in this arena for years preceding the occurrence which is the gravamen of this suit.\" Ultimately, the trial court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   This Court is well aware the salient statutory provisions are not intended to deny parties' access to Courts on the basis of technicalities. However, the actions as demonstrated in this cause rise above mere technicalities. [Morris] has not complied with the statutory pre suit requirements, or allowed reasonable discovery into their expert's devoted professional time 3 to 5 years immediately preceding the occurrence in this cause. As the applicable statute of limitations has long since expired, and [Morris] cannot remedy this issue with another expert, dismissal is a proper remedy pursuant to [ sections] 766.205(2) and 766.206(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Morris appealed to the First District Court of Appeal, which, in a two-to-one decision, concluded that the trial court \"did not abuse its discretion\" and affirmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807864\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/189/348/#p351\">\n    189 So.3d at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The majority reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The Legislature has made it clear that the special qualifications required for presuit medical experts are essential to the Chapter 766 presuit investigation process. Likewise, courts have consistently noted the significance of the presuit expert requirements in determining a claim's legitimacy. Here, the record contains ample evidence to support the trial court's conclusions that [Morris] failed to offer sufficient proof of her proffered expert's statutory qualifications, and that [Morris's] lack of cooperation with [the Defendants'] attempts to verify the expert's qualifications merited dismissal under sections 766.205(2) and 766.206(2), Florida Statutes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807864\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/189/348/#p351\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807864\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/189/348/#p351\">\n    at 350-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Judge Swanson dissented with opinion, arguing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [Morris] complied with the statutory presuit requirements by obtaining written corroboration from a qualified medical expert, Dr. Margaret Thompson. Because Dr. Thompson's affidavit clearly established her qualifications, that should have been the end of the matter. Instead, [the Defendants] filed a motion to dismiss [Morris's] complaint and used court-ordered limited discovery to go on a fishing expedition in an attempt to impeach Dr. Thompson's qualifications. After [Morris's] counsel refused to cooperate in this endeavor, the trial court dismissed [her] wrongful death action, depriving [Morris] of her constitutionally guaranteed access to the courts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807864\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/189/348/#p351\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807864\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/189/348/#p351\">\n    at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Swanson, J., dissenting).

Moreover, they demonstrated that she had served in several roles requiring her to supervise OB/GYN nurses and other medical staff at a hospital and to be familiar with the relevant standards of care. Despite this, the trial court allowed [the Defendants] to depose Dr. Thompson regarding her qualifications. During her deposition, Dr. Thompson stated that she worked more than fifty hours per week as an OB/GYN in 2006 through March 2008 and explained how she managed to attend both graduate and law school during the same period. Although the trial court questioned the \"feasibility\" of Dr. Thompson's statement that she was engaged in full-time patient care while pursuing her master's and law degrees, the trial court was not permitted to make credibility determinations concerning an otherwise unrebutted and facially sufficient affidavit. On a motion to dismiss challenging a plaintiff's compliance with the statutory presuit requirements in a medical malpractice action, this court applies the de novo standard of review and must consider all factual allegations in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. Because the trial court did not apply the correct principles in determining that Dr. Thompson was not a qualified medical expert, I would reverse the trial court's order dismissing [Morris's] wrongful death action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807864\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/189/348/#p351\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807864\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/189/348/#p351\">\n    at 352-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).

From there, we turn to the trial court's first basis for dismissal under section 766.206(2), which states that a medical malpractice claim shall be dismissed where the prospective medical malpractice plaintiff does not comply \"with the reasonable investigation requirements\" of chapter 766, including obtaining \"a verified medical expert opinion by an expert witness\" as defined by statute. \u00a7 766.206(2), Fla.

Stated another way, where the facts regarding the presuit expert's qualifications are unrefuted, the trial court has not resolved any factual disputes that are entitled to deference on appeal.

Indeed, section 766.203(4), Florida Statutes (2011), states that the medical expert opinion corroborating a prospective plaintiff's claim of medical malpractice is \"subject to discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8187207\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/997/349/#p352\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That section goes on to state that the expert's opinion \"shall specify whether any previous opinion by the same medical expert has been disqualified and if so the name of the court and the case number in which the ruling was issued.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8187207\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/997/349/#p352\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, using this provision as an example, there could be a case where the presuit expert swears that he or she has not been previously disqualified and the defendant presents evidence to dispute that. The trial court's finding on that disputed fact would be entitled to deference on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   However, we reiterate that a trial court's ruling on whether an expert's stated qualifications satisfy the requirements of the statute is reviewed de novo, as such an inquiry requires simply construing the statute's requirements and determining whether the expert's qualifications align, which the appellate court is on equal footing with the trial court to do. We now turn to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    B. This Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In this case, Morris's expert, Dr. Thompson, stated in her sworn affidavit that she was a board-certified obstetrician, who, over her thirty-year career had been chief of the OB-GYN department at a large medical center, chief of staff at a small women's specialty hospital, and member of hospital-wide peer review committees. Her affidavit also stated that she was engaged in full-time patient care until March 2008, which was several months before the incidents alleged in the complaint began, she was currently licensed to practice medicine, and she was recertified as a board-certified obstetrician in 2007 and 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Defendants presented no evidence to suggest that Dr. Thompson's claims were false. Instead, they merely challenged the sufficiency of Dr. Thompson's stated qualifications and her ability to devote \"professional time to\" or be \"regularly engaged\" in the practice of medicine while in law school. Questioning the veracity of an expert's sworn statements is not the same as presenting evidence that suggests that the claims in the affidavit are false. Nevertheless, the trial court found that Dr. Thompson was not a qualified expert under section 766.102(5)(a) 2. or section 766.102(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that this was error, as Dr. Thompson's affidavit clearly established that she met the statutory requirements, and the Defendants presented no evidence to refute her sworn statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In concluding that Dr. Thompson was not a qualified expert, the trial court and\n   the dissent read far more into the statutes than what they clearly and unambiguously require. The trial court found that Dr. Thompson failed to establish that she was qualified because her affidavit contained only \"general qualifications\" and did not \"state specifically\" the level of practice she was engaged in during the relevant three-year period, but the statutes do not demand such specificity. As this Court has explained, we are \"not at liberty to construe\" terms \"so as to deprive plaintiffs of their causes of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Silva v. Sw. Fla.

Because Dr. Thompson's affidavit clearly complies with the statutory requirements, the trial court erred in finding that Dr. Thompson was not qualified. \u00a7\u00a7 766.202(6) ; 766.102(5)(a)2., Fla. Stat. (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As to the trial court's finding that Dr. Thompson's affidavit failed to establish that she was qualified to provide a medical expert opinion regarding the standard of care for medical support staff under section 766.102(6), we conclude that the trial court again misconstrued the statute's requirements. As stated previously, Dr. Thompson swore in her affidavit that she was \"Chief of the OB-GYN department at a large medical center, Chief of Staff at a small women's specialty hospital, and member of hospital-wide peer review committees.\" We fail to understand how Dr. Thompson could have overseen, managed, and reviewed medical support staff in those roles without knowledge of the standard of care applicable to that support staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Even if Dr. Thompson's affidavit was insufficient to demonstrate her qualifications under the statutes, Dr. Thompson clearly demonstrated at her deposition that she was qualified, as she testified that she employed a nurse practitioner and was familiar with Austin Medical Center's policies and procedures for nurses, having used them on a regular basis and \"probably contributed to writing some of them.\" Additionally, Dr. Thompson unequivocally testified that she was qualified to render an opinion as to the standard of care applicable to medical support staff treating a patient that was in her specialty. There is simply no evidence in the record to refute Dr. Thompson's sworn statements. Thus, because Dr. Thompson clearly met the statutory requirements, Morris's medical malpractice action should not have been dismissed under section 766.206(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Conclusion as to the Expert's Qualifications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   At the time the presuit medical expert in this case executed her affidavit corroborating Morris's claims of medical malpractice, she had enjoyed a thirty-year career as an OB-GYN, graduating from medical school in 1978 and becoming board-certified in obstetrics and gynecology in 1984. Her long career included serving as chief of the OB-GYN department at a large medical center and chief of staff at a small women's hospital. In short, Dr. Thompson is just the type of expert that the Legislature would consider is qualified. Accordingly, because Dr. Thompson was clearly qualified under the statutory requirements, under any standard of review, we conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing Morris's action under section 766.206(2), Florida Statutes (2011). We now turn to address the trial court's second basis for dismissal in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Dismissal for Failure to Allow Access to Information During the Presuit Process Without Formal Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The trial court also found that dismissal was proper under section 766.205(2), Florida Statutes (2011), because Morris failed to comply with the requirements of the informal presuit discovery\n   process. First, Morris argues that additional discovery into Dr. Thompson's qualifications should not have been permitted because Dr. Thompson's affidavit satisfied the statutory requirements. Even if the additional discovery was proper, Morris argues that she complied. Notwithstanding, Morris argues that it was improper to dismiss the action in the absence of any prejudice to the Defendants. The parties agree that the proper standard of review of a dismissal for failure to comply with discovery is abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth Fed.

Stat. (2011). Section 766.205(2) states that \"[s]uch access shall be provided without formal discovery ... and failure to so provide shall be grounds for dismissal of any applicable claim or defense ultimately asserted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8402351\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/974/1090/#p1092\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 766.205(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Scope of Permissible Discovery of a Presuit Expert's Qualifications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Morris first argues that additional discovery should not have been permitted because Dr. Thompson's affidavit satisfied the statutory requirements. As stated previously, a prospective plaintiff must corroborate their medical malpractice claim with a \"verified written medical expert opinion.\" \u00a7 766.203(2), Fla. Stat. (2011). Subsection (4) states that these medical expert opinions \"are subject to discovery\" and \"shall specify whether any previous opinion by the same medical expert has been disqualified and if so the name of the court and the case number in which the ruling was issued.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8402351\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/974/1090/#p1092\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 766.203(4). The statute does not specify the scope of this discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   While the statute does not specify the scope of discovery into a presuit expert's qualifications, certainly, if the defendant presents evidence that the expert's stated qualifications are false, presuit discovery on the discrete issue should be allowed. On the other hand, if the affidavit suggests a technical deficiency in the affidavit, there would be no reason to allow open-ended discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   We have explained that, where a plaintiff's presuit expert's affidavit fails to establish that he or she is qualified under the statute, the trial court should hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the expert is qualified.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7041910\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/62/1129/\">\n    62 So.3d at 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the defendant moved to dismiss the medical malpractice complaint, arguing that the plaintiff's expert's affidavit did not establish that he was an expert \"in the field of cardiology,\" and, thus, the plaintiff \"failed to attach a corroborating affidavit from a qualified medical expert.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7041910\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/62/1129/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7041910\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/62/1129/\">\n    at 1131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, nothing in the medical malpractice statutory scheme indicates that the Legislature intended the presuit process to include a deposition of a presuit expert regarding her qualifications, where the expert demonstrates in a sworn affidavit that he or she meets the statutory qualifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   We thus agree with Judge Swanson that, where a presuit expert clearly demonstrates that he or she is qualified in a sworn affidavit, and the defendant has not presented any evidence to refute those qualifications, medical malpractice defendants should not be permitted \"to go on a fishing expedition in an attempt to impeach\" those qualifications.\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807864\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/189/348/#p351\">\n    189 So.3d at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Swanson, J., dissenting).

This Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Here, the trial court found that, during Dr. Thompson's deposition, Morris's counsel \"repeatedly objected to questions,\" \"refused to allow\" Dr. Thompson to answer certain questions, and \"thwarted\" the Defendants from learning information such as whether Dr. Thompson was aware of the ABA accreditation rules restricting students to working no more than twenty hours a week while attending law school and whether Dr. Thompson applied for disability during the same period of time preceding the suit due to her arthritis. The trial court further found that these actions \"were purposeful and designed to deprive the Defendants' [sic] of the ability to meaningfully participate in pre-suit discovery of the medical negligence claims against them, and as such was not in good faith.\" Without making any finding as to whether Morris's actions prejudiced the Defendants, the trial court concluded that dismissal was warranted under section 766.205(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   On review, the First District concluded that \"the record contain[ed] ample evidence\" to support the trial court's conclusion that Morris's \"lack of cooperation\" with the Defendants' attempts to verify Dr. Thompson's qualifications warranted dismissal under section 766.205(2).\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807864\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/189/348/#p351\">\n    189 So.3d at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The First District did not identify any prejudice the Defendants suffered as a result of Morris putting a halt to what clearly was, in Judge Swanson's words, a \"fishing expedition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807864\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/189/348/#p351\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807864\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/189/348/#p351\">\n    at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Swanson, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   We first conclude that, because Dr. Thompson's affidavit clearly demonstrated that she was qualified, and the Defendants did not present any evidence to refute those qualifications, the trial court should not have permitted a deposition of Dr. Thompson. Dr. Thompson had been an OB-GYN for over three decades. While the Defendants attempted to challenge the veracity of Dr. Thompson's assertions that she was practicing in her field of medicine while attending law school, an issue that would have been impeachment on a collateral matter, they presented no evidence demonstrating that these assertions were false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Additionally, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing Morris's medical malpractice action under section 766.205(2) without finding that Morris's actions prejudiced the Defendants. Indeed, had the trial court or the First District considered the question of prejudice, they would have been hard-pressed to identify any. Although the Defendants attempt to argue that they were prejudiced because Morris's actions delayed the resolution of the claim, delay is not the type of prejudice contemplated by our case law. It was not as if Dr. Thompson's opinion changed from the time that her opinion was filed. Thus, the Defendants in this case had all information they needed in order to \"facilitate evaluation of the claim.\" \u00a7 766.205(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   It has been observed that \"there is an increasingly disturbing trend of prospective defendants attempting to use the [chapter 766] statutory requirements as a sword against plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Michael v. Med. Staffing Network, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8337810\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/947/614/#p619\">\n    947 So.2d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 619 (Fla. 3d DCA 2007). Unfortunately, it appears that this was such a case. Despite the sworn affidavit of Morris's presuit medical expert-which stated that she had been a board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist for more than twenty years and served as chief of the OB-GYN department at a large medical center and chief of staff at a small women's specialty hospital-the Defendants in this case used the medical malpractice statutory requirements as a sword.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   As a result of the Defendants' conduct, and the trial court's and First District's exceedingly restrictive reading of chapter 766, Morris has thus far been deprived of her right to access the courts. To uphold the result in this case would permanently deprive Morris of her right to such access to pursue her medical malpractice claim for the wrongful death of a twenty-year old woman because the statute of limitations has long since run. Such a result not only frustrates Morris's constitutional right to access to the courts, but also does nothing to advance the Legislature's purpose in creating the medical malpractice presuit statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Because Morris's presuit medical expert clearly met the statutory qualifications for medical experts, and because Morris complied with the necessary discovery, the trial court erred in dismissing Morris's action under sections 766.205(2) and 766.206(2), Florida Statutes (2011). Accordingly, we quash the First District's decision and remand with directions that the trial court reinstate Morris's medical malpractice\n   action arising out of a death that occurred over nine years ago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   It is so ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   LEWIS, QUINCE, and LABARGA, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   CANADY, C.J., dissents with an opinion, in which POLSTON and LAWSON, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    The Defendants in this case include Orlando S.

I would instead approve the result reached by the First District. Under a proper reading of the statutes governing the medical malpractice presuit process, Morris's purported presuit \"medical expert\"-Dr. Thompson-as a matter of law did not satisfy the statutory requirements for such experts. Accordingly, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   This case is readily resolved on the ground that Dr. Thompson failed to meet the threshold statutory requirement of being \"duly and regularly engaged\" in the practice of the profession at the time the presuit affidavit was executed in 2011. \u00a7 766.202(6), Fla. Stat. (2011). The record reveals that at the time Dr. Thompson executed the affidavit, she had been retired from her OB/GYN practice for more than three years and by all indications had transitioned (or was transitioning) into a new career. The fact that Dr. Thompson had a lengthy career as an OB/GYN before retiring in March 2008 does not defeat the plain language of the relevant statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   After examining the statutory requirements for a presuit \"medical expert\" and explaining why Dr. Thompson does not satisfy those requirements, I briefly address the problematic nature of Dr. Thompson's affidavit and the ensuing lack of compliance by the plaintiff and plaintiff's counsel regarding the trial court's order authorizing limited discovery into Dr. Thompson's qualifications. Given this record, I am troubled by the majority's decision to view this case through the lens of an \"unrefuted\" affidavit. The true extent of Dr. Thompson's activities before March 2008 are unknown. Thus, even assuming that the \"duly and regularly engaged\" requirement applies to some period of time prior to March 2008, I would approve the First District's decision to affirm the dismissal of the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Stat. (2011). As part of the mandatory presuit process, a prospective plaintiff must obtain \"a verified written medical expert opinion from a medical expert as defined in s. 766.202(6).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807864\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/189/348/#p351\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The purpose of the expert opinion is to \"corroborate reasonable grounds to support the claim of medical negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807864\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/189/348/#p351\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Prior to initiating litigation, the prospective plaintiff must first provide the defendant with a \"notice of intent to initiate litigation,\" along with the medical expert's opinion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807864\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/189/348/#p351\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The term \"medical expert\" is defined in section 766.202(6) as \"a person\n   <em>\n    duly and regularly engaged\n   </em>\n   in the practice of his or her profession who holds a health care professional degree from a university or college and who meets the requirements of an expert witness as set forth in s. 766.102.\" (Emphasis added.) There is nothing\n   backward-looking about the present-tense requirement that the person be \"duly and regularly engaged\" in the practice of the profession. In other words, the person must\n   <em>\n    be\n   </em>\n   duly and regularly engaged in the practice at the time the written medical expert opinion is offered, as opposed to having been duly and regularly engaged in the practice during some earlier period. But this \"duly and regularly engaged\" requirement, of course, is not the only statutory requirement for being a \"medical expert.\" Section 766.202(6) expressly provides that the person must also hold a certain professional degree\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   \"meet[ ] the requirements of an expert witness as set forth in s. 766.102.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Section 766.102 sets forth requirements for testifying experts in medical malpractice actions.

For giving expert testimony against a specialist, the expert witness must meet certain additional requirements, including that the witness \"[s]pecialize in the same specialty as the health care provider against whom ... the testimony is offered.\" \u00a7 766.102(5)(a) 1., Fla.

Namely, the expert witness must:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Have devoted professional time during the 3 years immediately preceding the date of the occurrence that is the basis for the action to\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   a.

Dr. Thompson's affidavit on its face paints the picture of someone who retired in March 2008 from a lengthy private medical practice and who had transitioned (or was transitioning) into a new career. That conclusion is supported by the rest of the record, including the following interrogatory response from the plaintiff regarding Dr. Thompson's profession or occupation: \"Retired OB/GYN, March 1, 2008, before law practice.\" Although Dr. Thompson maintained an active license to practice medicine in the State of Texas at the time she executed the affidavit, that license merely\n   <em>\n    authorized\n   </em>\n   her to engage in the practice of the profession. Indeed, having an active license is itself a separate statutory requirement for a \"medical expert.\" \u00a7 766.102(5), Fla. Stat.

In any event, Dr. Thompson described her work for the Texas Board of Medicine as \"sporadic,\" which is quite the opposite of \"regularly.\" In short, Dr. Thompson was not a qualified \"medical expert\" for purposes of chapter 766.

DR. THOMPSON'S INSUFFICIENT AFFIDAVIT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Even assuming that Dr. Thompson's activities during the three years immediately preceding the alleged malpractice in this case should control whether this case is permitted to proceed, I would approve the First District's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   In determining that the proper standard of review is de novo, the majority repeatedly remarks that the facts surrounding Dr. Thompson's qualifications were \"unrefuted.\" In doing so, the majority ignores that Dr. Thompson's affidavit was problematic on its face, the facts were in dispute, and the plaintiff and plaintiff's counsel-both leading up to and during Dr. Thompson's court-authorized deposition-obstructed the defendants' requests for relevant information. This case hardly\n   involved \"a fishing expedition in an attempt to impeach\" Dr. Thompson's qualifications. Majority Op. at 1159 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807864\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/189/348/#p351\">\n    189 So.3d at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Swanson, J., dissenting) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   According to Dr. Thompson's affidavit, she \"engaged in full-time patient care until March 2008\" when she retired due to arthritis in her hands. According to the very same affidavit, Dr. Thompson received her J.D. in 2007 and her M.P.Aff. (Master of Public Affairs) in 2008, both from the University of Texas. In other words, at the same time she was purportedly still caring for patients on a \"full-time\" basis, Dr. Thompson was also enrolled on a\n   <em>\n    full-time\n   </em>\n   basis in law school and in a Master of Public Affairs program. In addition to begging obvious questions, not the least of which is how it is humanly possible to simultaneously do all of those things, Dr. Thompson's affidavit facially conflicted with then Standard 304(f) of the American Bar Association's Standards for Approval of Law Schools, which prohibited full-time law students from working more than twenty hours per week. Any reasonable defense attorney-and any reasonable trial judge, as was the case here-would have been skeptical. And when the plaintiff chose to respond to the defendants' requests for information-both with regard to Dr. Thompson and other matters-the answers were either nonresponsive or begged more questions. For example, the defendants were told that Dr. Thompson somehow managed to deliver approximately\n   <em>\n    thirty-five babies per month\n   </em>\n   while she was enrolled full-time in law school and in a master's program. It should go without saying that the trial court acted within its discretion in authorizing limited discovery directed at Dr. Thompson's activities during the three-year period preceding the alleged malpractice. And that discovery included a properly noticed deposition of Dr. Thompson along with a request for documents to be produced at the deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The record reflects that the plaintiff waited until approximately ninety minutes before the deposition to file an objection to the defendants' request for documents. The record also reflects that during the deposition, the plaintiff's counsel repeatedly objected-and instructed Dr. Thompson not to answer-when certain relevant questions were asked regarding Dr. Thompson's purported activities during the three-year period preceding the alleged malpractice. When Dr. Thompson was permitted to answer questions, she testified that, among other things, she \"probably\" worked \"more than\" one hundred hours per week between her practice and her J.D. and M.P.Aff. degrees. That included being on call for unaffiliated patients at the hospital two to three days per month, as well as being on call for her own patients every third to fourth night or day until the final year of her practice when she \"took call ... 24/7\" for her own patients-all while suffering from arthritis in her hands that became \"severe\" in the final years of her practice. Of course, Dr. Thompson was not permitted to answer, for example, whether she filed for disability with regard to her arthritis and, if so, whether the application-which would have discussed her work history-was available for inspection. Similarly, Dr. Thompson was instructed to not answer questions such as whether she was aware of any requirements by her law school regarding not working outside the law school more than twenty hours per week, although her subsequent testimony implied that the dean of the law school knew and approved of her plan to continue practicing OB/GYN on a \"full-time\" basis-again, notwithstanding the American Bar Association's Standards for Approval of Law Schools. Dr. Thompson also was not permitted to discuss whether her compensation from and the finances of her medical\n   practice changed as a result of her starting law school. That was the case even though Dr. Thompson revealed earlier in the deposition that she had hired \"a contract physician\" \"during some of that time\" but could not quite recall the specifics of that hire, including when she hired the physician, the terms of payment, or whether the physician had a set schedule for a period of time at least as long as a law school semester. And Dr. Thompson was not permitted to answer whether she at some point sold her practice to that contract physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   On this record, I disagree with the majority's description of the defendants' attempts to confirm the claims made by Dr. Thompson as being \"a fishing expedition.\" Majority Op. at 1159. And I reject the majority's view that Dr. Thompson's affidavit conclusively established her statutory qualifications. The true extent of Dr. Thompson's activities during the relevant period remains very much in doubt. I therefore disagree with the majority's analysis, which is entirely predicated on the assertions that Dr. Thompson clearly met the statutory requirements and that her affidavit went \"unrefuted.\" This case should properly be viewed as a case in which a facially insufficient affidavit was submitted and the defendants were prevented from determining whether Dr. Thompson in fact met the statutory requirements. And no case law supports allowing a medical malpractice suit to proceed in the absence of a timely corroborating affidavit from a presuit \"medical expert\" as defined in section 766.202(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   In attempting to justify its decision, the majority notes that the presuit statutes should be \"interpreted liberally\" so as to favor access to courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   majority op. at 1151 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kukral\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7424123\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/679/278/#p279\">\n    679 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   284 ). But this case has nothing to do with roadblocks to court access. Instead, this case has to do with a plaintiff submitting a facially insufficient and suspect affidavit and then repeatedly declining-even in the face of a court-imposed order-to provide relevant information that would have confirmed or refuted the affidavit. \"Liberally\" interpreting the presuit process does not warrant allowing plaintiffs to obstruct defendants from obtaining relevant information regarding questionable claims and then rewarding that obstruction through an analysis that treats those claims as \"unrefuted.\" The majority's decision to simply reinstate the plaintiff's suit seriously undermines the presuit process established by the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Although the plaintiff's purported presuit \"medical expert\"-Dr. Thompson-appears to have enjoyed a lengthy career as an OB/GYN, she did not meet the statutory qualifications for a \"medical expert,\" given that she was not \"duly and regularly engaged\" in the practice of the profession at the time she executed the presuit affidavit. The plaintiff thus failed to meet the presuit burden of having corroborated that reasonable grounds existed to support a malpractice claim, and the plaintiff failed to remedy that defect prior to filing suit and prior to the expiration of the limitations period. Even assuming that the only relevant period is the three years immediately preceding the alleged malpractice, the record before us-due to the conduct of the plaintiff and plaintiff's counsel-cannot support the finding that Dr. Thompson met the statutory qualifications. I would approve the result reached by the First District in affirming the dismissal of the plaintiff's complaint. Accordingly, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   POLSTON and LAWSON, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    The majority concludes that \"[t]here is no indication that the Legislature ... intended to make the qualifications for a presuit expert more stringent than an expert testifying at trial.\" Majority Op. at 1153. But that conclusion ignores the text of section 766.202(6), which, by definition, provides that a presuit \"medical expert\" must meet certain requirements in addition to those for an expert testifying at trial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 766.202(6), Fla. Stat.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    The majority dismisses the notion that Dr. Thompson was required to \"be duly and regularly engaged at the time the opinion is offered\" in part on the ground that \"the role of the medical expert is to provide an opinion regarding the prevailing professional standard of care, or the professional standard of care existing\n    <em>\n     at the time of the occurrence that is the basis for action\n    </em>\n    .\" Majority Op. at 1154 (emphasis added). But even assuming that Dr. Thompson was only required to be \"duly and regularly engaged\" in the practice \"at the time of the occurrence,\" she still would not meet the statutory requirement. As the majority recognizes, Dr. Thompson \"retire[d] from clinical practice in March 2008,\" majority op. at 1148, \"which was several months before the incidents alleged in the complaint began,\" majority op. at 1156.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
