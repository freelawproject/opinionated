We conclude that the trial court properly denied the appellant's petition for writ of habeas corpus as it consisted solely of arguments made by him in prior unsuccessful post-conviction motions. Appellant raises two arguments: that his sentence is illegal and he did not violate his plea agreement. This Court has previously reviewed and dismissed those arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parks v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9058704\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/863/382/\">\n    863 So.2d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 3d DCA 2003). As such, we consider this petition as if filed as a 3.850 motion. We therefore affirm the trial court's denial of Park's petition as successive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
