In her petition to probate the 1995 will, Alice acknowledged the existence of the 2007 will, but she asserted that the 2007 will was invalid based on several grounds, including that Alice Earle Taylor lacked the\n   mental capacity to make the 2007 will because she suffered from dementia and that the 2007 will was procured through undue influence exerted by William. Alice attached a copy of the 2007 will as an exhibit to her petition to probate the 1995 will; the 2007 will purports to revoke all earlier wills executed by Alice Earle Harper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Monroe Probate Court set Alice's petition to probate the 1995 will for a hearing.

Simply because William has submitted a will with a later date, which purports to revoke all prior wills, does not mean that the 2007 will is valid, nor does it mean that the Escambia Probate Court is the proper venue. The legislature has provided for the proper venue in probate matters when more than one probate court has venue. That is what we have before us in this case. The Monroe Probate Court is the proper venue under \u00a7 43-8-162(1), and the Escambia Probate Court is the proper venue under \u00a7 43-8-162(5).

Among those reasons was that the 1995 will \"was revoked by\" the 2007 will, which, according to William, \"was duly signed, published, witnessed and self-proving.\" William attached a certified copy of the 2007 will to his answer and counterclaim, and he noted that he had filed the 2007 will\n   for probate in the Escambia Probate Court and that that proceeding was being held in abeyance pursuant to this Court's mandate in\n   <em>\n    Taylor I\n   </em>\n   . William's answer and counterclaim requested that the Monroe Probate Court deny Alice's petition to probate the 1995 will and enter an order stating \"that the alleged 1995 will was revoked either by Alice Earle Harper's execution of the 2007 will, or by other actions by Alice Earle Harper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On February 27, 2015, Alice filed in the Monroe Probate Court an \"Answer to Will Contest and Motion to Transfer,\" wherein Alice answered William's contest of the 1995 will and requested that the Monroe Probate Court transfer William's contest of the 1995 will to the Monroe Circuit Court. Thereafter, the Monroe Probate Court entered an order transferring the contest of the 1995 will to the Monroe Circuit Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On October 9, 2015, Alice filed a petition to probate the 2007 will in the Monroe Probate Court. Alice alleged that the will had \"purportedly\" been executed by Alice Earle Harper and had \"purportedly\" been witnessed. Alice attached a copy of the 2007 will to the petition. The prayer for relief in Alice's petition to probate the 2007 will states that Alice \"does now surrender said document for determination of whether it is due to be probated and whether it is the true Last Will and Testament of Alice Earle Harper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Also on October 9, 2015, Alice filed in the Monroe Probate Court a petition\n   <em>\n    contesting\n   </em>\n   the admission of the 2007 will to probate and requesting that her will contest be transferred to the Monroe Circuit Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As grounds for the will contest, Alice alleged that the 2007 will was not duly executed, that Alice Earle Harper was mentally incompetent and lacked testamentary capacity when she allegedly executed the 2007 will, and that the 2007 will was procured by fraud, coercion, or undue influence exerted by William, who was allegedly in a confidential, dominant, and controlling relationship with Alice Earle Harper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On October 15, 2015, William filed in the Monroe Probate Court a motion to dismiss Alice's petition to probate the 2007 will, her will contest, and her request for transfer of the will contest to the Monroe Circuit Court. William noted that Alice had filed only a copy of the 2007 will for probate and that the original of the 2007 will had been filed for probate in the Escambia Probate Court by William in January 2014. He asserted that venue for Alice's will contest was improper and that the proper venue was the Escambia Probate Court, where the original 2007 will had been filed for probate. Also, William alleged that Alice's petition was untimely because the petition to probate the 2007 will in Escambia County had been pending since January 2014. He further stated that Alice had waived her right to probate the 2007 will in the Monroe Probate Court because she had filed in the Escambia Probate Court an initial pleading in response to William's petition to probate the 2007 will in that court, and she had failed to contest the 2007 will or to seek a transfer of any will contest at that time. William further argued that Alice failed to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 43-8-198 (requiring that a demand for transfer of a will contest to the circuit court be filed \"at the time of [the] filing [of] the initial pleading\" of the party\n   seeking transfer) because the document constituting Alice's will contest and \"demand\" for transfer and Alice's petition to probate the 2007 will were filed as separate documents several minutes apart. Further, William argued that a person should not be allowed to offer a will for probate for the purpose of contesting that will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On December 3, 2015, the Monroe Probate Court entered an order granting William's motions to dismiss Alice's petition to probate the 2007 will, her will contest, and her request for transfer of her contest of the 2007 will to the Monroe Circuit Court. Alice petitions this Court for a writ of mandamus directing the Monroe Probate Court to enter orders reinstating her petition to probate the 2007 will, reinstating her will contest as to the 2007 will, and transferring that will contest to the Monroe Circuit Court pursuant to \u00a7 43-8-198, Ala. Code 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Although Alice has requested relief by way of a writ of mandamus, an order dismissing a petition to probate a will is an appealable order. See Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 12-22-20 (\"An appeal lies to the circuit court or Supreme Court from any final decree of the probate court, or from any final judgment, order or decree of the probate judge....\");\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Also, an order dismissing a will contest is an appealable order. See Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 12-22-21(1) (authorizing appeal from a probate court's \"decree, judgment or order on a contest as to the validity of a will\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It is well settled that, where \" 'the facts of the particular case' \" warrant our \"treat[ing] a petition for a writ of mandamus as a notice of appeal,\" this Court will do so.\n   <em>\n    Kirksey v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867900\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/166/633/#p643\">\n    166 So.3d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 643-44 (Ala. 2014) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Burch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11615514\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/730/143/#p147\">\n    730 So.2d 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 147 (Ala. 1999) ). We conclude that, based on the facts before us and the posture of the underlying proceeding, Alice's petition requesting that this Court correct alleged errors as to the dismissal of her petition to probate the 2007 will and her contest as to that will should be treated as an appeal. On appeal, we review such dismissals de novo, and the trial court's ruling is accorded no presumption of correctness. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    DGB, LLC v.

Code 1975, \u00a7 43-8-21(c). We read \u00a7 43-8-21(c) as further support for the consolidation of probate proceedings concerning an estate, where possible.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Section 43-8-21(a) states: \"When a proceeding under this chapter could be maintained in more than one place in this state, the court in which the proceeding is first commenced has the exclusive right to proceed.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The original of the 1995 will is in the possession of the Monroe Probate Court. The original of the 2007 will apparently remains in the possession of the Escambia Probate Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    As to the fact that the original of the 2007 will has not yet been presented to the Monroe Probate Court, we note that William does not contest the validity of that will and, of course, is himself responsible for placing that will in the possession of the Escambia Probate Court. His position is that the 2007 will is the last will of Alice Earle Harper, and he has made that assertion in both the petition he filed in the Escambia Probate Court and his pleadings in the Monroe Probate Court. William does not contend that the copy of the will Alice has provided to the Monroe Probate Court is not in fact a copy of the 2007 will that is being held by the Escambia Probate Court. Also, no evidentiary hearing has been held in the Monroe Probate Court as to the validity of the 2007 will. The fact that Alice merely attached a copy of the 2007 will to her petition does not mean that she cannot and will not arrange for the original will to be presented to the Monroe Probate Court if and when such presentation is necessary for purposes of the probate proceedings in that court. Under the circumstances presented, Alice's failure thus far to have procured the original of the 2007 will and to have filed it in the Monroe Probate Court did not justify that court's dismissal of her petition. Alice may seek the transfer of the original of the 2007 will from the Escambia Probate Court to the Monroe Probate Court at the appropriate time, if William has not done so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    We note that William reads\n    <em>\n     Allan v. Allan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9746831\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/353/1157/#p1157\">\n     353 So.2d 1157\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1157 (Ala. 1977), as holding that the mere meeting of the formalities for execution of the 2007 will is all that is required to sustain his contest of the 1995 will and that the fact that the 2007 will might be invalid for some other reason is not admissible as to the 1995 will contest. Such a conclusion, however, fails to appreciate the consequence of what would occur if the 2007 will were itself later successfully contested on grounds other than those relating to the formalities of execution. In such an event, an invalid will (the 2007 will), would have been allowed to revoke an otherwise valid will (the 1995 will-assuming the only reason the 1995 will was held invalid is because of the execution of the 2007 will), thus potentially resulting in Alice Earle Harper's dying intestate. We cannot sanction such an approach for two reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    First, the validity of the 2007 will cannot be subdivided. The 2007 will is either valid or it is not; the validity of the revocation clause in that will depends on the validity of the will itself. See\n    <em>\n     Grisby v. Andrews\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7417757\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/686/303/#p304\">\n     686 So.2d 303\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 304 (Ala. Civ. App. 1996) (\"[B]ecause the revocation clause in the subsequent will was a product of undue influence, one must conclude that Carter lacked the intent to revoke the first will. That purported revocation was inoperative.\"); see also\n    <em>\n     Vaughn v. Vaughn\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3626910\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ala/217/364/#p366\">\n     217 Ala. 364\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 366,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3626910\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ala/217/364/#p366\">\n     116 So. 427\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 429 (1928) (\"[R]evocation by mistake, fraud, undue influence, or by one not of testamentary capacity, ... is inoperative because of the lack of animus revocandi.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Second, William's argument runs counter to the general rule favoring testacy over intestacy where possible. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Anderson v. Griggs\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9585081\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/402/904/\">\n     402 So.2d 904\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Ala. 1981).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    If Alice's contest of the 2007 will fails, nothing would prevent William, at that time, from requesting that, \"in the interest of justice,\" the Monroe Probate Court transfer the proceedings concerning the estate of Alice Earle Harper to the Escambia Probate Court. See Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 43-8-21(c).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Section 43-8-190, Ala. Code 1975, provides that otherwise proper grounds for contesting the will may be asserted \"by any person interested therein, or by any person, who, if the testator had died intestate, would have been an heir or distributee of his estate.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    We recognize that the probate court might have dismissed the motion to transfer the contest as to the 2007 will simply because it had dismissed the will contest itself, i.e, there was no remaining contest to be transferred. But because Alice was entitled to continue with her contest, she therefore was entitled to a transfer order upon meeting the requirements of \u00a7 43-8-198.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Because the Escambia Probate Court's order admitting the 2007 will to probate was reversed in\n    <em>\n     Taylor I\n    </em>\n    , there is no concern that Alice's effort to contest the 2007 will might be precluded by the statute of limitations applicable to a will contest. See Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 43-8-199 (providing that will contest in circuit court must be filed \"within the six months\n    <em>\n     after the admission of such will to probate\n    </em>\n    in this state\"). See also Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 43-8-190 (providing that will may be contested in probate court \"before the probate thereof\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
