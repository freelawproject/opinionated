Lowry's direct appeal became final on May 19, 2016. His current petition was put into the correctional facility mailing on June 11, 2018. Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.141(c)(4)(B) states that \"[a] petition alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel shall not be filed more than 2 years after the conviction becomes final on\n   direct review unless it alleges under oath with a specific factual basis that the petitioner was affirmatively misled about the results of the appeal by counsel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This petition was filed more than two years after the conviction became final, and Lowry makes no allegation that his counsel affirmatively misled him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We dismiss this petition for habeas corpus as untimely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    Additionally there is no substantive merit to this petition, as Lowry simply restates issues raised and disposed on direct appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
