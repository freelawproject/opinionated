Because Bork was entitled to a hearing on his facially sufficient motion, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On July 8, 2010, a final judgment of injunction was entered against Bork and in favor of Sara Pare, a friend of Bork's ex-wife. The injunction prohibited Bork from contacting Pare or causing any other person to contact her. In her petition for injunction, Pare alleged that Bork called her repeatedly and left her voicemails in\n   which he threatened her with violence. Pare also alleged that Bork had closely followed a vehicle that she and Bork's ex-wife occupied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Seven years later, Bork, while incarcerated on an unrelated matter, filed a motion to dissolve the permanent injunction. In that motion, Bork alleged that he has not contacted Pare since entry of the injunction and has no desire to maintain any relationship with her. He further alleged that he has completed anger management courses and that the injunction is preventing him from participating in certain rehabilitative prison work programs. The trial court denied Bork's motion without a hearing, stating that Bork \"may wish to file a Motion to Dissolve Injunction upon release from incarceration, and where there is an opportunity to have an evidentiary hearing.\" The trial court offered no other explanation for its summary denial of Bork's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Section 741.30(6)(c), Florida Statutes (2010), authorizes either party to an injunction to file a motion to dissolve it at any time without making any specific allegations. \"[C]ourts applying section 741.30(6)(c) have indicated that a motion to modify or dissolve an injunction should allege some basis upon which relief may be granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Carrozza v.

Because a movant must show a change of circumstances to obtain relief on a motion filed under section 741.30(6)(c), the motion is facially sufficient if it alleges facts demonstrating a change of circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carrozza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6893629\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/153/340/\">\n    153 So.3d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that a motion filed under section 741.30(6)(c) was facially sufficient because it alleged facts demonstrating changed circumstances);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reyes v.

Here, just like the movant in\n   <em>\n    Carrozza\n   </em>\n   , Bork sufficiently alleged a change in circumstances. Specifically, he alleged that he has not contacted Pare since entry of the injunction approximately seven years ago. He further alleged that he has no desire to maintain a relationship with Pare. He asserted that he has completed anger management courses and is incarcerated on an unrelated matter. He explained in his motion that because the injunction remains intact, he is ineligible for placement in certain rehabilitative work programs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6893629\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/153/340/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6893629\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/153/340/\">\n    at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
