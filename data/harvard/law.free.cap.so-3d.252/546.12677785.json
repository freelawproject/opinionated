For the following reasons, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This mineral law case involves forty acres of immovable property located in Jefferson Davis Parish of which Grace Ranch, LLC (\"Grace Ranch\") is the owner. On October 10, 2011, Grace Ranch filed suit in contract and tort for contamination of its property resulting from the historical oil and gas exploration and production activities of multiple defendants, including J.P. Van Way (\"JPVW\"), BP America Production Company (\"BP\"), and BHP Billiton Petroleum (Americas), Inc. (\"BHP\") (collectively \"Defendants\"), pursuant to valid mineral leases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The forty acres at issue was part of an approximate 166-acre tract (\"subject tract\") of immovable property owned by Ellen M. Davies in 1915. In 1944, Ms. Davies, as the lessor, executed a mineral lease with John J. Doyle, as the lessee (\"subject lease\"). That same year, Doyle assigned the subject lease to Stanolind Oil and Gas Company (\"Stanolind\"), BP's predecessor. In 1957, Stanolind merged into\n   Pan American Petroleum Company (\"Pan American\"). In 1969, Pan American assigned the subject lease to Clinton Oil Company (\"Clinton Oil\"), BHP's predecessor. In 1972, Clinton Oil released all of its rights in the subject lease except for the forty acres at issue in this matter. In 1976, Clinton Oil changed its name to Energy Reserves Group, Inc. (\"Energy\"). In 1977, Energy assigned the subject lease to Tommy Littlepage Oil Properties (\"Littlepage Oil\"). In 1978, Littlepage Oil assigned half of its working interest in the subject lease to Jack Williams Pipe and Supply Company. In 1984, Littlepage Oil assigned the remaining half of its working interest to JPVW. The subject lease expired in 1985 or 1986 due to non-production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   With respect to the surface and mineral ownership of the subject tract, it was acquired by Ms. Davies' heirs in 1971. In 1972, Ms. Davies' heirs sold the same to Donald J. Leblanc and Janet Sue Cagle Leblanc (\"the Leblancs\"), reserving for themselves \"all of the oil, gas and other mineral in, on or under said property, together with the right of ingress and egress for the purpose of exercising this mineral servitude.\" In 1973 and 1974, the Leblancs sold the subject tract to General Farms, Inc. (\"General Farms\"), subject to any outstanding servitudes and reservations of minerals and leases. In 1995, General Farms acquired one hundred percent of the minerals arising from the termination of the Davies servitude. In 1999, General Farms and the Leblancs transferred the subject tract to Daniel and Jeralyn Ewing (\"the Ewings\"), reserving an undivided one-half interest in the minerals. The Ewings subsequently sold the subject tract to Grace Ranch in 2006, subject to their one-half interest in the minerals. Grace Ranch acquired one half of the minerals in 2009 as a result of the expiration of General Farms' one-half mineral servitude. Grace Ranch acquired the other half of the minerals in 2016 as a result of the expiration of the Ewings' one-half mineral servitude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2013, approximately two years after filing suit, Grace Ranch sought and obtained assignments of rights in tort and contract from General Farms and the Leblancs, or their heirs and assigns. On January 13, 2017, approximately four years after obtaining the assignments, Grace Ranch filed its First Amended Petition for Damages to assert its assigned claims. Defendants subsequently filed motions for summary judgment, seeking dismissal of Grace Ranch's suit. Additionally, JPVW filed an Exception of No Right of Action, seeking dismissal on similar grounds. The trial court heard the motions and exception on June 14, 2017, and took them under advisement. Pursuant to the trial court's written reasons for judgment dated July 12, 2017, and its subsequent judgment dated September 16, 2017, the trial court granted the motions and exception and dismissed Grace Ranch's case with prejudice. Grace Ranch appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, Grace Ranch asserts the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1. The trial court committed error in dismissing the plaintiff's claims on the basis of the subsequent purchaser rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2.

Nevertheless, if the mover will not bear the burden of proof at trial on the issue that is before the court on the motion for summary judgment, the mover's burden on the motion does not require him to negate all essential elements of the adverse party's claim, action, or defense, but rather to point out to the court the absence of factual support for one or more elements essential to the adverse party's claim, action, or defense.

This is accounted for in the Comments to La.R.S. 31:16, which note:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   It is true that there are certain distinctions from the normal real right which give the mineral lease markings of kinship to personal rights.

Thus, Grace Ranch's reliance on La.R.S. 31:122 is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Moreover, Grace Ranch's argument presumes that a mineral lease burdens the lessee with a real obligation to restore property in favor of the landowner. To determine whether Grace Ranch's presumption is correct, we look to the relationship between real obligations and real rights. In that regard, \"[a]n obligation is a legal relationship whereby a person, called the obligor, is bound to render a performance in favor of another, called the obligee.\" La.Civ.Code art. 1756. \"A real obligation is a duty correlative and incidental to a real right.\" La.Civ.Code art. 1763. The comments to La.Civ.Code art. 1763 provide that real obligations are \"incurred as a result of ownership or possession of a thing burdened by a real right[.]\" \"Mineral rights are real rights\" which are subject to prescription of nonuse for ten years. La.R.S. 31:16. \"The basic mineral rights that may be created by a landowner are the mineral servitude, the mineral royalty, and the mineral lease.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Under La.R.S. 31:114, \"[a] mineral lease is a contract by which the lessee is granted the right to explore for and produce minerals.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In analyzing the foregoing articles with respect to mineral leases, we find that the mineral lessee is the owner of the real right. The corresponding real obligation, therefore, relates to the burden placed on the landowner's rights in property pursuant to the mineral lease, i.e., the property owner's obligation to let the mineral lessee enter the property and explore for oil and gas. Thus, Grace Ranch's presumption that the mineral lease burdens the lessee with a real obligation to restore property in favor of the landowner is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Grace Ranch contends that it has a right of action to sue for pre-acquisition damages based upon the legal principles governing limited personal servitudes and usufructs. In that regard, we look to the dual nature of a mineral lease, i.e., featuring characteristics of both contracts and rights in property, as explained by the federal court in\n   <em>\n    Minvielle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8935548\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/380/755/#p775\">\n    380 F.Supp.2d at 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Thus, it is in the nature of a limited personal servitude that the mineral lease is a real right. The limited personal servitude is explained in the Comments to La. C.C. Art. 639 as constituting \"an intermediary category between personal and predial servitudes. Like usufruct and habitation, they are charges on things in favor of a person rather than an estate; like predial servitudes, they are necessarily charges on an immovable belonging to another person and are confined to certain advantages of use or enjoyment.\" Although a right of use, i.e., a personal servitude, is a real right, it is one granted in favor of a person rather than an estate, and therefore it does not pass with the property upon sale of the property.\n   <em>\n    Sustainable Forests, L.L.C. v.

Thus, Grace Ranch's argument does not defeat application of the subsequent purchaser rule whereby the right to sue for pre-acquisition damages is a personal right of action that a subsequent purchaser cannot acquire without an assignment or subrogation of rights. Accordingly, Grace Ranch's argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Grace Ranch further contends that as the surface owner, it has a right of action pursuant to La.R.S. 31:11(A), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   The owner of land burdened by a mineral right or rights and the owner of a mineral right must exercise their respective rights with reasonable regard for those of the other. Similarly the owners of separate mineral rights in the same land must exercise their respective rights with reasonable regard for the rights of other owners.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Grace Ranch then compares La.R.S. 31:11(A) to its analogous provision contained in La.Civ.Code art. 667, which governs the limitations placed on a proprietor's use of his property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A similar issue was addressed in\n   <em>\n    Global Marketing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904333\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/153/1209/\">\n    153 So.3d 1209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , wherein the plaintiff alleged that it had a real right of action against the defendants based upon La.R.S. 31:11 and La.Civ.Code art. 667.

C.C. art 667 bestows real rights and obligations between owners of adjacent immovable property, Global never shared that relationship with the defendants. As the article is written, Global and the defendants were never \"neighbors.\" The mineral leases were executed decades before Global purchased the property. By the time Global purchased the property in 2005, all of the defendants' mineral leases had expired. The defendants never did lease rights to the minerals under the property while Global owned it, which means they never could have been \"neighbors,\" even in the broadest sense. Therefore, Global cannot enforce any rights against the defendants under La. C.C. art. 667. While Global insists that this article confers real rights to be enforced against the defendants, Global presents no statute or jurisprudence which supports this interpretation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Article 11 of the Mineral Code confers correlative rights on the land owner and the owner of the mineral right to exercise their rights with reasonable regard for those of the other, and Article 134 states that in violation of a mineral lease, the aggrieved party is entitled to appropriate relief provided by law.

Grace Ranch contends that it was assigned the right to enforce the restoration obligation of the subject lease from General Farms, in its capacity as owner of the mineral rights. It alleges that the right of restoration was also assigned by both General Farms and the Leblancs, in their capacity as surface owners, since their surface rights were subject to the lease.

The trial court noted that General Farms had been previously dissolved by affidavit without formal liquidation in accordance with La.R.S. 12:142.1, which did not enable General Farms' own claims to survive.

As discussed, the tort rights had prescribed before the original petition was filed, and the assignments did not confer a right of action in contract. The rights sought to be bestowed in the assignments were not exigible at the time of suit in 2010.

The former allows a party to \"\n   <em>\n    amend\n   </em>\n   its petition if the new claims accrued\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to filing the original suit\" whereas the latter allows a party \"to file a\n   <em>\n    supplemental\n   </em>\n   petition setting forth related items of damage or causes of action that became exigible\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the original petition was filed[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Boone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977709\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/139/1047/\">\n    139 So.3d at 1061, n.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Boone\n   </em>\n   court advised, however, that \"relation back of [ La.Code Civ.P. art.] 1153 applies only to the\n   <em>\n    amended\n   </em>\n   petition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977709\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/139/1047/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In this case, the evidence in the record confirms that Grace Ranch filed its original petition in 2011. In 2013, Grace Ranch sought several assignments of tort claims from the Leblancs and/or their heirs. According to La.Civ.Code art. 3493, \"[w]hen damage is caused to immovable property, the one year prescription commences to run from the day the owner of the immovable acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge of the damage.\" In 2017, Grace Ranch filed a \"First Amended Petition for Damages,\" asserting the tort claims it was previously assigned in 2013. According to the dictates of\n   <em>\n    Boone\n   </em>\n   , the rights sought to be bestowed in the assignments were not exigible at the time Grace Ranch filed suit in 2011. Thus, the claims asserted in Grace Ranch's 2017 pleading were supplemental rather than amending. Since relation back under La.Code Civ.P. art. 1153 applies only to amending petitions, the claims asserted in Grace Ranch's 2017 supplemental petition do not relate back to the original petition's filing. Since the claims do not relate back, the newly alleged tort claims prescribed before they were asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   On appeal, Defendants also contend that the mineral lease was expired. Defendants argue that General Farms could not validly assign claims under an expired mineral lease just as the LeBlancs could not validly assign rights that were subject to an expired lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   On review, we look to\n   <em>\n    LeJeune Brothers, Inc. v.
