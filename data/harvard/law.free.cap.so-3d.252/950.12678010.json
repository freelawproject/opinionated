For the reasons that follow, we find no abuse of the trial court's discretion in issuing the Order and we affirm that ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This protracted and contentious family matter commenced with the filing, on October 31, 2013, of a Petition for Divorce Pursuant to Louisiana Civil Code Article 102 (\"Divorce Petition\") by S.L.B.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Divorce Petition, appellant, S.L.B., and appellee, C.E.B., were married on September 3, 2000 and established their matrimonial domicile in Orleans Parish. D.E.B. subsequently moved to Mobile, Alabama, for a medical residency program. J.B. and D.B. were born during the marriage. At the time of the Divorce Petition's filing, the children were ages eight and ten, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Over the ensuing several years, various pleadings were filed and hearings held in the matter, resulting in trial court rulings not pertinent to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2016 and by consent of the parties, the case was consolidated with two cases pending in other divisions and filed subsequent to the instant suit. The first of these suits, filed in 2015 and entitled \"State of Louisiana, et al. v. [C.E.B.].,\" sought to establish C.E.B.'s child support obligations and to require C.E.B. to maintain health insurance for the children. The second suit, filed in 2016 and entitled \"[S.L.B.] v. [C.E.B.],\" was a divorce proceeding (with incidental matters) based on the parties'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   living separate and apart pursuant to La. C.C. art. 103.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Other than the consolidation of the cases in 2016, nothing of record took place in the cases between September 8, 2014, and March 2, 2017, when C.E.B. filed a Petition for Protection From Abuse (\"Petition\"). A temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") was issued in connection with the Petition, effective through March 16, 2017, the date on which a hearing was set. C.E.B. then filed, on March 7, 2017, a motion to terminate child support on the basis that custody of the children should remain with C.E.B. and therefore, there would be \"no further need or requirement for child support.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In open court on March 16, 2017, the parties agreed to continue the hearing on the Petition and the TRO was extended. The hearing was continued on several other occasions by consent of the parties and ultimately took place on September 7 and 19, 2017. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found that C.E.B. \"has met his burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence that [J.B.] was physically abused by his mother ... and that the abuse occurred in the presence of [D.B.].\" The trial court placed both children in the temporary custody of C.E.B. subject to supervised visitation with S.L.B. The court also ordered S.L.B. to attend anger management and parenting classes. The trial court denied the request for attorney's fees and ordered the parties to bear their own respective costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The written Order, memorializing the trial court's oral judgment, was then issued on September 19, 2017, finding that S.L.B. \"represents a credible threat to the physical safety of a family member\" and issuing an injunction (an Order of Protection in the form of a \"P.O./Preliminary or Permanent Injunction\"), effective until March 19, 2019. The trial court also issued a judgment assessing costs against S.L.B. in the amount of $258.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   S.L.B. has devolutively appealed the September 19, 2017 Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This case arises under the Domestic Abuse Assistance Act, La.

We, therefore, look to the Act for guidance as to what constitutes \"physical abuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   There are few cases under the Act addressing the issue of domestic abuse by a parent of a child. In\n   <em>\n    Vital v. Francois\n   </em>\n   , 12-1279 (La.

While the case did not address the Act specifically (and the issue did not concern domestic abuse allegations), the court, \"mindful that corporal punishment, when reasonable in degree, used by a parent of a minor child for disciplinary reasons is permitted in Louisiana,\" found that the father's admission to striking a child \"10 to 15 times with a belt ... did not constitute reasonable discipline so as to be considered corporal punishment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8158923\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/6/256/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pp. 9-10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8158923\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/6/256/\">\n    6 So.3d at 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   S.L.B. also cites\n   <em>\n    State in Interest of BS v.

She also points to other testimony in the record from C.E.B. and Rochelle Gauthier, a counselor at J.B.'s school, that J.B. has a history of behavioral issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   S.L.B. argues that the nature of J.B.'s nose bleed \"was minor and transitory.\" In support, she notes that, when C.E.B. brought J.B. to the emergency room on February 22, 2017, there were no signs of physical injury. He likewise, had no sign of injury when he was examined by Dr. Jamie Jackson on February 24, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In Dr. Jackson's examination, J.B. related that he and his mother argued about having to do the dishes and that she \"swung at [him] and hit [him], causing [his] nose to bleed.\" She then threw him on the ground and \"climbed on top of [him]\" where he \"couldn't move.\" J.B.'s statement is consistent with the testimony of S.L.B. that she struck him; he indicated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   ...whenever I did something she didn't like then she would just go to town on [him]. So like if she - - if I said a curse word - - then she's [sic] hit me. If I tried to roll over and crawl away, she'd roll back over and hit me. If I did anything she didn't like, she would hit me, And so I had a bused [sic] lip, so my mouth was bleeding and my nose was bleeding from almost every time she hit me, for two or\n   three times. It took a couple of swings to make me start bleeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   At the conclusion of trial, the trial judge stated that \"this case does not demonstrate reasonable corporal punishment as outlined in the statute by a parent.\" She then concluded that it had been proven \"by a preponderance of the evidence that J.B. was physically abused by his mother.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Mindful of our standard of review, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in issuing the Order and in finding that there was domestic abuse (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , physical abuse) under the circumstances of this case. The trial court obviously weighed the conflicting testimony of the witnesses in making its ruling and we do not find that the record demonstrates the lack of a reasonable basis for the trial court's finding, warranting a reversal of the trial court's determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We further note that \"[t]he reviewing court must always keep in mind that if a trier of fact's findings are reasonable in light of the record reviewed in its entirety, the court of appeal may not reverse even if convinced that if it had been sitting as trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\"\n   <em>\n    Sam Staub Enterprises, Inc. v.

The motion for the\n   <em>\n    Watermeier\n   </em>\n   hearing was set for March 16, 2017, also before the notice of depositions. C.E.B. then moved, without opposition, to reset the hearing on his motion for a\n   <em>\n    Watermeier\n   </em>\n   hearing to May 9, 2017, the date on which the original hearing on the Petition for Protection from Abuse had been set. Thereafter, on April 24, 2017, C.E.B. filed a Motion to Quash the depositions of the children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   All matters were continued to August 2, 2017, due to the illness of counsel for S.L.B.; the TRO in place was extended through that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On August 2, 2017, the trial court issued another Order, containing written comments indicating that the \"[p]arties consent to continue and reset Petition for Protection from Abuse and Motion for [\n   <em>\n    Watermeier\n   </em>\n   ] hearing and Motion to Quash/Protective Order, et al[.] all set for May 9, 2017 to the new date of August 2, 2017 at 9:00 a.m.\" The matter was again reset, by consent of the parties, for September 7, 2017, due to counsel for S.L.B.'s recent surgery. The TRO was again kept in effect until September 7, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In the interim, S.L.B. filed a memorandum in opposition to the\n   <em>\n    Watermeier\n   </em>\n   interview on August 31, 2017. In it, she argued that she should be allowed \"to cross examine the ... boys in open court,\" which in this case, was \"particularly essential ... because of the severe remedies provided in a Protective Order case.\" She further argued that \"due process and fundamental fairness entitle[d] her to effectively present her defense including the right to hear and or [sic] to cross-examine witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   When the matter proceeded on September 7, 2017, other than a discussion of whether witnesses would be sequestered, no other preliminary matters were considered before the first witness, Dr. Jackson, testified. On the second day of trial, September 19, 2017, near the end of trial, counsel for S.L.B. brought the issue of the\n   <em>\n    Watermeier\n   </em>\n   hearing and motion to quash to the trial court's attention, asking the court to \"address those issues.\" Counsel for C.E.B. then interjected that, \"when [he] filed to reset [the]\n   <em>\n    Watermeier\n   </em>\n   hearing, [he] requested that the Court defer the decision on the\n   <em>\n    Watermeier\n   </em>\n   hearing until the end of this hearing\" and he asked that the \"decision not be ruled upon at this point in time and wait until the end of Counsel's case.\" The trial judge responded \"[o]kay\" and trial resumed. Two remaining witnesses testified (S.L.B. and Ms. Gauthier), followed by counsels' closing arguments and the trial court's ruling. The issue of the\n   <em>\n    Watermeier\n   </em>\n   hearing or the motion to quash were neither brought up again nor ruled upon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   S.L.B. does not contend that the trial court erred in failing to conduct a\n   <em>\n    Watermeier\n   </em>\n   hearing. Such an argument would be contrary to the position she has taken throughout this litigation; namely, that J.B. and D.B were of sufficient age that they could testify at the trial and a\n   <em>\n    Watermeier\n   </em>\n   hearing was unnecessary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead,\n   the argument she made in opposing the motion for a\n   <em>\n    Watermeier\n   </em>\n   hearing, was that \"[w]hen a judge interviews a child without the consent of the domiciliary parent[,] it deprives him or her to [sic] the right to hear crucial evidence and be given an opportunity to explain or to rebut statements made by the child[ren].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   S.L.B.'s argument focuses on the fact that she did not depose J.B. or D.B. and that neither were called as witnesses at the hearing; thus, she argues that her due process rights were violated because she had no opportunity to cross-examine them. She relies heavily on the case of\n   <em>\n    Fuge v. Uiterwyk\n   </em>\n   , 94-1815 (La.

The\n   <em>\n    Watermeier\n   </em>\n   sequestration order, by its own terms, is neither ordained nor mandatory. The Uiterwyk boys, honor students at Jesuit High School in New Orleans, and declared by the trial judge to be \"bright and capable young men,\" had no need for protection from the mere presence of their parents to balance against Ms. Fuge's due process rights, and her exclusion from the proceedings requires reversal of the judgment below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869098\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/166/981/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The instant matter is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Fuge\n   </em>\n   in many respects. There is no issue in this case concerning the trial court's refusing to allow S.L.B. access to medical records and, in particular, the records of Dr. Jackson and Dr. Jackson's March 3, 2017 report. Nothing in the record indicates that the medical records were not provided to S.L.B. In fact, the medical records submitted into evidence at the hearing were all attached to the motion for the\n   <em>\n    Watermeier\n   </em>\n   hearing, which had been filed into the record in March, 2017, some six months prior to the September hearing. Accordingly, S.L.B. had access to\n   all of the medical records well before the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Likewise, unlike the\n   <em>\n    Fuge\n   </em>\n   case, here, the trial court did not refuse to allow counsel for S.L.B. to cross-examine Dr. Jackson. The record clearly reflects that Dr. Jackson was cross-examined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   There is a lack of jurisprudence on the issue of whether a child must testify in a hearing under the Domestic Abuse Assistance Act. Neither the Act, nor cases arising from the Act, specify that a victim must testify at a hearing on a protective order. To the contrary, the Act only specifies that a protective order be issued when \"[r]easonable notice and opportunity to be heard is given to the person against whom the order is sought sufficient to protect that person's right to due process.\" La. R.S. 46:2136 B(2) (or if the parties enter into a consent agreement). In this case, there can be no question that the parties had reasonable notice of hearing (the Petition was filed in March and the hearing took place in September) and an opportunity to be heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We note, too, that the record reflects that notices of the depositions of J.B. and D.B. were filed into the record on March 31, 2017, setting the depositions for April 24, 2017. On April 24, 2017, C.E.B. filed a motion to quash those depositions (along with other motions). The motion to quash was never heard. However, no other efforts were made in the six months between the notice of depositions and the hearing on the Petition to secure those depositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Similarly, there is nothing in the record indicating that S.L.B. issued subpoenas to J.B. or D.B. for the September, 2017 hearing or moved to require their presence at the hearing. By analogy to a criminal matter, our Constitution provides that \"[a]n accused is entitled to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him, to compel the attendance of witnesses, to present a defense, and to testify in his own behalf.\" La. Const. Art. 1, Section 16. That right encompasses the \"right to demand subpoenas for witnesses and the right to have those subpoenas served.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Likewise, they were never called as witnesses by S.L.B. Nor was there an objection made that they were not brought to court by C.E.B. In sum, S.L.B. failed to properly preserve this issue for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We find no merit in S.L.B.'s argument that her due process rights were violated in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Testimony of Dr. Jackson and audiotaped interview\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In her next assignment of error, S.L.B. contends that the trial court erred in allowing Dr. Jackson to testify and in allowing into evidence an audiotaped recording of an interview she conducted with J.B. four days after the February 20, 2017 altercation. She argues that Dr. Jackson's testimony was hearsay for which there are no exceptions. She further argues that the audiotape recording is hearsay as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In support of her arguments, S.L.B. cites the Louisiana Supreme Court case of\n   <em>\n    C.M.J. v.

However, this does not mean that the expert has usurped the authority of the trial court in determining the key issue of \"best interest of the child.\" As we stated in our discussion of the exclusion of the children's testimony, this decision is based on all the evidence and testimony presented to the fact-finder.

While Dr. Jackson did not find any physical signs of abuse, she testified that she saw him four days after the incident and the \"types of injuries [J.B. sustained] can resolve very quickly.\" She explained that \"[t]he tissue inside the nose and inside the mouth, those are espousal tissues so they can heal really quickly and really well.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Dr. Jackson's ultimate conclusion, based on her interview with J.B. and the photographs she saw, and as she noted in the report she created, was of \"child physical abuse.\" There is no question that S.L.B. struck J.B. (although the nature of the strike is disputed) in such a manner as to cause his nose to bleed given that she admitted it at the hearing. She likewise admitted to having \"restrained\" J.B. by sitting on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As the Supreme Court found in\n   <em>\n    C.M.J.\n   </em>\n   , in the instant case, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's finding that S.L.B.'s actions against J.B. constituted \"physical abuse\" within the meaning of the Act. To the extent that that finding was based, in part, on Dr. Jackson's opinion, we likewise find no abuse of discretion, given that, as the\n   <em>\n    C.M.J.\n   </em>\n   Court noted, \"the trial court is not bound by the testimony of an expert, but such testimony is to be weighed the same as any other evidence\" and the trial court may substitute its own judgment where warranted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6887520\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/156/16/#p17\">\n    156 So.3d at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Nor do we find any error in the trial court's allowing the audio recorded interview into evidence.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   First, Dr. Jackson authenticated the recording by testifying that she personally made the recording. Only she and J.B. were present in the room when the recording was made. According to Dr. Jackson, the recording \"is part of the medical record\" and audio recordings are always made as standard procedure at the Audrey Hepburn Care Center. There is no indication in the record that the recording is not accurate, nor that the recording is in any way unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   While most cases involving audio recordings arise in the context of criminal cases and criminal sexual assault cases, we find those cases to be instructive.

And, when she was asked if the child in the photograph was her son, she replied, \"[i]t appears to be a child\" but she couldn't \"tell for sure.\" S.L.B. was also less than forthright when it came to other depictions in the photographs (e.g., her legs, her hands, the table).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   It cannot seriously be disputed that C.E.B. is not \"a witness having personal knowledge of the subject depicted by the photograph [who] identifies it as such.\" Nor can it seriously be contested that C.E.B. is not a \"person familiar with the photographs [and] the photographer.\" We therefore find that a proper foundation was laid for the admission of the photographs as there is no question as to their authenticity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   We now turn to the issue of whether the probative value of the photographs is outweighed by their prejudicial effect.
