The dispositive issue before the Court is whether Robert Hammons Jr. properly named fictitious parties in his original complaint so his amended complaint related back to the filing of the original complaint to avoid the statute-of-limitations bar. The Circuit Court of Leflore County ruled that Hammons had failed to comply with the fictitious-party rules and granted summary judgment for the defendants. The Court of Appeals, in an evenly divided decision, affirmed the circuit court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    Hammons v. Navarre\n   </em>\n   , --- So.3d ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201392835\">\n    2017 WL 1392835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 18, 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Hammons's amended complaint-fifteen pages longer than his original complaint-added new parties and new claims against those parties. As the amendment was not a substitution under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 9(h), it does not relate back to the time of filing of the original complaint under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(2). Further, the amended complaint was filed outside the statute of limitations, and Hammons's claim is time-barred. Thus, we affirm the\n   judgment of the circuit court and the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. On October 25, 2009, Hammons was piloting a helicopter spraying herbicides on timber fields near Eupora when the helicopter crashed. Hammons was employed by Provine Helicopter, which owned the subject helicopter. Hammons was severely injured and now is paralyzed from the waist down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4. On May 26, 2011, the National Transportation Safety Board (\"NTSB\") adopted and published its final report on the accident. The NTSB found that the probable cause of the crash was a loss of engine power due to fuel contamination. The NTSB report stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   A postaccident examination of the helicopter's fuel system revealed a brown contaminate, of a density greater than jet fuel.... Examination of the dual use truck that was used to service the helicopter with fuel and herbicide revealed that the fuel filter between the Jet-A fuel tank and the fuel delivery hose was also contaminated. A common trough that ran along the top of the fuel truck provided an area where any over flow of water used to fill the truck's herbicide tank could be introduced into the truck's Jet-A fuel tank through gaps in the fuel tank's cap seal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The \"dual use truck\" was owned and operated by Hammons's employer, Provine Helicopter. The NTSB report went on to state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A 500-gallon fuel tank was located a[t] the foreword end of the truck, while a tank for mixing water and spray chemical was located at the aft end. A common trough ran along the top portion of both tanks, which would retain any over-fill of water or fuel, and was drained through two small holes at the forward end. Examination of the cap for the fuel tank revealed that the o-ring seal and the fuel vent were deteriorated, and that the seals were not continuous. The fuel tank was configured in a way that fuel was taken directly from the lowest point in the tank, and pumped through a filter to the fuel filler hose. No standpipe was present at the bottom of the tank that would have prevented any collected water from entering the fuel filter, and no pressure gauges or sensors were installed up or downstream of the filter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The truck-based fuel tank was checked for the presence of water using a water finding paste applied to a dip stick. A small amount of water was detected. The fuel filter between the tank and the delivery hose was removed and examined. The filter element appeared \"bulged\" and water was present in the filter. The brown contaminant was present throughout the paper folds of the fuel filter, and was collected along its interior.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 5. On December 27, 2011, Hammons filed an eleven-page complaint in the circuit court. The only named defendant was Scott Petroleum, which supplied fuel to Provine Helicopter. Hammons alleged that the fuel supplied by Scott Petroleum \"was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\" Hammons further alleged that there was no \"substantial change in [the fuel's] condition from the time the fuel left the places of manufacture and/or processing until the time of the accident.\" Rather, Hammons alleged, the fuel was already in a \"defective condition\" when it was \"sold\" and \"left the control of Scott Petroleum.\" The complaint\n   did not allege or articulate any wrongful conduct by any other entity, known or unknown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 6. Hammons's complaint purported to name \"Defendants A-P.\" As to these defendants, the complaint stated, in its entirety:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants, A-P, are corporations or persons whose true identities and addresses are unknown at this time and whose liability to the Plaintiff is unknown at this time. Plaintiff will amend his Complaint and include the true names and addresses of the Defendants A-P once their identities are learned and once their liabilities are ascertained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 7. Scott Petroleum was served on March 8, 2012. On April 6, 2012, Scott Petroleum's counsel provided Hammons's counsel with a copy of the NTSB report. The cover letter from Scott Petroleum's counsel stated in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Based on this report, it appears that if fuel contamination existed, that fuel contamination originated in the field service truck owned by Provine Helicopter which refueled the subject helicopter several times the day of the incident. Consequently, pursuant to this correspondence, we hereby request that you dismiss this matter with prejudice as to [Scott Petroleum].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Obviously, Scott Petroleum can have no liability for the failure of Provine Helicopter to maintain its service truck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Scott Petroleum subsequently answered the complaint and filed a motion for summary judgment that attached the NTSB report as an exhibit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 8. On April 8, 2013, Hammons filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. On April 17, 2013, the court entered an agreed order granting Hammons's motion. On April 30, 2013, Hammons filed a twenty-six-page amended complaint that identified Defendants A through F from the original complaint as follows: Metal Craft Inc. (\"Metal Craft\"); Wade C. Navarre and Navarre Fabrication (collectively, \"Navarre\"); Velcon Filters LLC (\"Velcon\"); Knappco Corporation (\"Knappco\"); and \"Wilden.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amended complaint alleged that Metal Craft and Navarre manufactured the fuel truck and fuel compartments used to fuel the helicopter; the amended complaint further alleged, for the first time, that the truck and compartments were defective. Also, the amended complaint alleged that Velcon Filters manufactured a fuel filter on the fuel truck; the amended complaint further alleged, for the first time, that the filter was defective. The amended complaint alleged that Knappco manufactured the lid on the fuel truck's fuel tank; the amended complaint further alleged, for the first time, that the lid was defective. Finally, the amended complaint alleged that Wilden manufactured the fuel truck's pump; the amended complaint further alleged, for the first time, that the pump was defective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 9. Navarre, Velcon, Knappco, and Wilden all filed motions to dismiss and/or for summary judgment. They argued that Hammons's claims against them were barred by the statute of limitations because the original complaint did not properly identify them as fictitious parties pursuant to Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 9(h) and, therefore, the amended complaint's allegations against them did not relate back to the date of the original complaint. Knappco and Wilden also argued that the claims against them should be dismissed due to insufficient service of process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It does not appear that Metal\n   Craft was ever served, and it never entered an appearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 10. In response to the defendants' motions, Hammons's attorney submitted an affidavit that stated in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   I was associated on or about February 9, 2011. I was asked to investigate and prosecute a claim, if one existed, against those individuals or entities responsible for the accident on October 25, 2009.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   .... I immediately began to research and investigate the accident but was prohibited from making any meaningful investigation whatsoever because of the inability to inspect and test the fuel and the fueling equipment. I was not provided with a description of most of the products involved in the fueling operation; the names and addresses of manufacturers of the parts; or each party's roll [sic]in the refueling procedure until January of 2013. The NTSB investigator filed his supplemental report on May 26, 2011, and for the first time mentioned potential problems with the fuel supply devices....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   .... The NTSB did not release any of the information until May 26, 2011, and the fuel equipment used by Provine Helicopter was not made available to the Plaintiff until approximately January of 2013 .... Only after suit was filed and after Scott Petroleum partially responded to discovery requests was it revealed that [Metal Craft, Navarre, Velcon, Knappco, and Wilden] were potentially additionally responsible for the October 25, 2009 accident ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   I did not receive ... the responses to Freedom of Information requests [from the NTSB/FAA] until April of 2013. A copy of my Freedom of Information request letter dated March 6, 2013, is attached hereto ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 11. The circuit court subsequently held a hearing on the defendants' motions to dismiss and/or for summary judgment and entered an opinion and order granting summary judgment in favor of Navarre, Velcon, Knappco, and Wilden. The court certified its order as final pursuant to Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 12. Hammons appealed to this Court, and we assigned the case to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the trial court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    Hammons\n   </em>\n   , --- So.3d at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201392835\">\n    2017 WL 1392835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10.

Rule 9(h) is not intended to serve as an insurance policy to plaintiffs who wish to protect themselves in case they discover new defendants in the course of litigation. Rule 9(h) authorizes the plaintiff to deviate in only one respect from the requirements of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure in bringing a claim. That is, the plaintiff is allowed to use a fictitious name, rather than the true name of the defendant. In other words, the purpose of Rule 9(h) is to allow a plaintiff to proceed with a lawsuit where the plaintiff knows and can articulate the wrongful conduct of, and claims against, the fictitious party, but simply does not know that party's name.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Rule 9(h) does not say that a plaintiff may include a fictitious party because the plaintiff suspects that there\n   <strong>\n    might\n   </strong>\n   be someone out there who\n   <strong>\n    might\n   </strong>\n   have engaged in conduct which\n   <strong>\n    might\n   </strong>\n   be actionable. For instance, if the plaintiff knew that a nurse was assisting a doctor with a procedure and that the nurse engaged in negligent conduct, the plaintiff is not prevented from proceeding with litigation against the nurse simply because the plaintiff does not know the name of the nurse. The plaintiff may sue \"Nurse X\" and upon learning the nurse's name, substitute it for the fictitious party under Rule 9(h).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miss. R. Civ. P. 9(h).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   However, where a plaintiff suspects that there might have been others involved in the procedure who might have been negligent, but is, at the time suit is filed, unaware of who they are or what negligent act they are alleged to have committed, the plaintiff may not include a fictitious party in the complaint. This Court has previously stated that \"the purpose of Rule 9(h) is to provide a mechanism to bring in responsible parties,\n   <strong>\n    known\n   </strong>\n   , but unidentified, who can only be ascertained through the use of judicial mechanisms such as discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Ralph Walker, Inc. v.

Further, Hammons was clear in his original allegations that the defective fuel was defective at the point that it left Scott Petroleum's control and was used to fuel the aircraft in the same defective state. No other allegations were made in the original complaint against any other party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 29.

Hammons, through the amended complaint, though, alleged that Scott Petroleum \"certified that the fuel pumped into the Aircraft was safe, not defective and not unreasonably dangerous.\" He then alleged the new claim that the fuel was contaminated by Navarre, Velcon, Knappco and Wilden after it left Scott Petroleum's control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 30. \"[A]t the time the original complaint was filed, [Hammons] neither knew the identities of the parties, nor was [ ]he aware of any facts giving rise to any cause of action against such unknown individual or corporate entity.\"\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7059922\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/21/509/#p526\">\n    21 So.3d at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Such an amendment is not contemplated under Rule 9(h). Rule 9(h) does not provide authority for a party to join a fictitious party without knowing whether or not the party that is joined is liable. Thus, Hammons-who admitted that the alleged fictitious defendants' \"liability to the Plaintiff is unknown at this time\"-did not join any fictitious parties to his suit by means of the original complaint. Navarre, Velcon, Knappco and Wilden were named to the suit, for the first time, by Hammons's amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 31.

Hammons's final argument is that the statute of limitations was tolled by Mississippi Code Section 15-1-63, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   If, after any cause of action has accrued in this state, the person against whom it has accrued be absent from and reside out of the state, the time of his absence shall not be taken as any part of the time limited for the commencement of the action, after he shall return.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-1-63\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2012). In\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v. Trustmark National Bank\n   </em>\n   , this Court stated that this provision\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   require[s] that a plaintiff seeking to benefit from it must have been unable to effect service on the defendant for the period which it is claimed that the statute is tolled. That is, the defendant must have left the state and not be amenable to service under a long-arm statute or other means, because for example, his whereabouts are unknown. The period of time that the defendant's whereabouts are unknown is deducted from the period of the statute which would otherwise have run, in effect, adding that time to the statute of limitations. However, the statute of limitations is not tolled where the plaintiff knew or should have known of the defendant's whereabouts. The burden of proof that the defendant was absent and not amenable to service is on the plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v.

According to Hammons, Section 15-1-63 tolled the limitations period simply because it allegedly was impossible for him to discover the identities of the added defendants. As the Court of Appeals\n   noted, Section 15-1-63\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   has been applied to toll the statute of limitations where a plaintiff cannot discover the identity of a defendant. Further, Hammons provided no evidence that the added defendants were not amenable to service. In fact, he promptly served or attempted service on them after he filed the amended complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 39. We recognize the finality of our decision today for Hammons. Hammons, though, was not without recourse under our law. Hammons could have amended his complaint to allege a cause of action to hold liable the fictitious defendants before the statute of limitations ran.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 26, 2011, the NTSB publicly adopted the final report of the crash. This was only one year and seven months after the accident on October 25, 2009. While no claim is in the record that the NTSB report was not publicly available on May 26, 2011, Hammons's counsel (who, according to his affidavit, primarily practices in airplane and helicopter crash litigation) admitted that he received the NTSB report on April 6, 2012. This was approximately two years and five months after the accident. The NTSB report revealed information about the fuel truck and its mechanisms that clearly contradicted the sole theory of liability in Hammons's original complaint. There is no evidence in the record or any allegation before us that Hammons, after reviewing the NTSB report, could not have amended his complaint to allege a theory of liability against the fictitious defendants to preserve his claims against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 40. Hammons's original complaint did not name any fictitious defendants within the meaning of Rule 9(h). As such, he actually named Navarre, Velcon, Knappco and Wilden for the first time in his amended complaint; thus, the amendment did not relate back to the time of filing of the original complaint. Further, the claims against Navarre, Velcon, Knappco and\n   Wilden-made three years and six months after the injury in this case-are barred by the statute of limitations. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court and the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 41.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   WALLER, C.J., RANDOLPH, P.J., COLEMAN, MAXWELL AND BEAM, JJ., CONCUR.

Thus, Hammons's argument that the circuit court did not consider his arguments concerning the statute of limitations and that he is entitled to remand on the issue is without merit. We also find no support for Hammons's claim. The circuit court did not specifically detail each of Hammons's arguments in its analysis-focusing on Rules 9 and 15, but it clearly determined that the claim was time-barred.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Hammons of course argues that he already had preserved these claims by means of his original complaint. As discussed, however, in his original complaint, Hammons admitted that he did not know if the alleged fictitious defendants even were liable to him. With the statute of limitations looming, Hammons did nothing to bring claims against the alleged fictitious defendants. Instead, he allowed the statute of limitations to expire on his claims without amending his complaint to inform the Court that the fictitious defendants actually were liable to him. Nothing in the law required Hammons to know every detail of his theory of liability against the fictitious defendants. Mississippi long has recognized pleading in the alternative.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    M.R.C.P. 8(a), (e)(2) (\"A party may set forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically....\"). The law, though, did require Hammons actually to bring a cause of action before the statute of limitations expired. Further, Hammons simply could have added additional defendants to his lawsuit.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    M.R.C.P. 21. Nothing in our holding today limits the types of claims or the number of claims available to a party under the Rules of Civil Procedure. A party may toll the statute of limitations against a fictitious party by bringing a known claim against the fictitious party. Otherwise, a party simply must add another party under Rule 21. M.R.C.P. 21. Any claims against new parties joined not only would be subject to the statute of limitations-including any claim of tolling-but likewise would have available to them any defenses under the statute of limitations as well.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-91\">\n   KITCHENS, PRESIDING JUSTICE, DISSENTING:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 42.

Miss. Apr. 22, 2008). As Judge Greenlee noted, the\n   <em>\n    Womble\n   </em>\n   standard has been employed as the prevailing rule even after our decision in\n   <em>\n    Veal\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 48. Moreover, the rule from\n   <em>\n    Womble\n   </em>\n   fully comports with the relation-back provisions of Rule 9(h) and Rule 15(c). For relation back under Rule 15(c), the claim or defense must have arisen \"out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading.\" M.R.C.P. 15(c). Because an amendment under Rule 9(h) does not change the party against whom a claim is asserted, such an amendment automatically relates back. M.R.C.P. 15(c)(2). Under\n   <em>\n    Womble\n   </em>\n   , \"[e]ven if the plaintiff knows the true name of the person, he is still ignorant of his name if he lacks knowledge of the facts giving him a cause of action against [ ] that person.\"\n   <em>\n    Womble\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7482203\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/618/1252/#p1267\">\n    618 So.2d at 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . I observe that this language came almost\n   <em>\n    verbatim\n   </em>\n   from\n   <em>\n    Breceda v.

Turning to this case, I would find that Hammons's original complaint sufficiently set forth claims against the appellees. Under\n   <em>\n    Womble\n   </em>\n   , Hammons was not required to allege all the facts giving him a cause of action against the unknown parties to satisfy Rule 9(h). A comparison of Hammons's original complaint with the amended complaint reveals that both complaints were founded on the same theory and general set of facts: that a fuel defect\n   caused the injurious helicopter crash. The theory underlying Hammons's original complaint was that \"the fuel pumped into the Aircraft in question was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\" In his amended complaint, Hammons continued to maintain this theory, claiming that \"[t]he fuel pumped into the accident Aircraft was defective and unreasonably dangerous and/or was rendered defective and/or unreasonably dangerous because of the actions or non actions of [the defendants].\" Thus, as recognized by Judge Greenlee in his dissenting opinion for the Court of Appeals, Hammons's original complaint alleged a claim for product liability for defective fuel, and his amended complaint continued to maintain a product liability claim based on defective fuel, although more detailed, against the appellees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 50. I recognize the majority's concern with the fact that Hammons's complaint says that the fictitious defendants \"are corporations or persons whose liability to the Plaintiff is unknown at this time.\" Nonetheless, this Court has held that it is not bound by the literal language of the complaint and that substance must prevail over form.\n   <em>\n    Sanderson Farms, Inc. v. McCullough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346647\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/212/69/#p74\">\n    212 So.3d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 74 (Miss. 2017). Substantively, Hammons maintained the same claim between his original and amended complaints. I would hold that, because Hammons's amended complaint asserted the same theory of liability, based on the same general facts, as his original complaint, it complied with Rule 9(h). However, because the trial court never considered whether Hammons exercised reasonable diligence to identify the fictitious parties, I would reverse and remand for a determination on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   KING, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
