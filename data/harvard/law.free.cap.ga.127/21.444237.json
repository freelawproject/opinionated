Before Judge Kimsey. Habersham superior court. March 21, 1906.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-7\">Williams was indicted for assault with intent to murder, and was convicted of that offense, but the jury recommended that he be punished as for a misdemeanor, and the judge sentenced him as for a misdemeanor. At the trial the testimony was taken down in stenographic notes, by the official court stenographer. The defendant, on moving for a new trial, demanded that the stenographer \u201ctranscribe his notes in said ease into longhand and file the same\u201d with the clerk of the court, for the defendant\u2019s \u201cuse in preparing a brief of the evidence in said case,\u201d and \u201cto remain of file in said clerk\u2019s office as required by law, for the use in the future of [the defendant] or any citizen of the county:\u201d The stenographer refused to do this, unless paid for it by the defendant; the stenographer contending that it is not a part of his official duty to transcribe his notes into longhand when a defendant tried for a felony is convicted with a recommendation that he be punished as for a misdemeanor, and the recommendation is approved by the court. By petition for mandamus, in which he set out the foregoing facts, the defendant sought to compel the stenographer to transcribe into longhand his notes of the evidence. The judge refused to grant a mandamus nisi, and the petitioner excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b54-8\"><em>J. G. Edwards </em>and <em>I.

In the event of the jury returning a verdict of guilty, the testimony shall be entered oh the minutes of the court, or in a book to be kept for that purpose.\u201d Under the provisions of that law it is the duty of court stenographers in all felony cases, where defendants have been convicted, to transcribe their notes and file the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>with the clerks of court for the purpose of going upon the minutes. Assault with intent to murder is a felony, and upon conviction the offense was rendered none the less a felony because, under the provisions of the Penal Code, \u00a7 1036, the jury trying the defendant saw fit to recommend that he be punished as for a misdemeanor, and the judge, regarding the recommendation, actually sentenced him as for a misdemeanor. Where one is placed on trial for a felony, it is the indictment that.gives character to the charge against the accused, and determines whether the testimony shall be taken down. Under.\u00a7 981, when the defendant is indicted for a felony, it is the duty of the court to require the stenographer to report the ease. That section does not contemplate that the court shall await the termination of the case to determine whether or not it is a felony, and whether or not he must require it reported. The court sees by an inspection of the indictment that the case is a felony, and the trial proceeds under all the rules prescribed for the trial of felonies. He may be convicted of the offense charged dr of a lesser offense, or acquitted, but, regardless of the result, it could not be said after the trial that the defendant had not been tried for a felony. The language of the code is, \u201cOn the trial of all felonies.\u201d It is evident that the court\u2019s duty on the trial of the case was to require it to be reported, because it was a felony. After reporting \u201c'the testimony and proceedings in the case, except the argument of counsel,\u201d the stenographer, upon one contingency only, is required to transcribe and furnish to the clerk his stenographic notes. What is that contingency? That the jury return a \u201cverdict of guilty.\u201d Nothing further is required to create the contingency; and if it ari\u00e1es by the finding of a verdict of \u201cguilty,\u201d no qualification of the verdict by way of recommendation to mercy can destroy the contingency.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In so construing \u00a7 981 we h$ive not been unmindful of \u00a7 1036 of the same code. That section permits certain felonies (and among them assault with intent to murder) \u201con the recommendation of the jury trying the case, when such recommendation is approved by the judge presiding on the trial, . . [to] be punished as misdemeanors,\u201d and authorizes the judge trying the case, if he sees proper, in his punishment, to \u201creduce such felonies to - misdemeanors.\u201d This section is one of a forgiving character and looks only to leniency to the defendant after trial and after his guilt has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>been established. By this act it was never intended to dispense with any of the machinery of the law provided for the trial of the felony case. The legislature did not intend to dispense with any of the rules or procedure theretofore employed touching the trial of the accused. In so far as it affects the case now involved, the duties of the court stenographer are not different from those imposed upon him in any other felony cases where there is conviction without recommendation. He should transcribe his notes to be entered upon the minutes. His compensation should come from the county, just as he is paid for reducing the evidence to stenographic notes. If he refuses to transcribe and file notes, he can be compelled to do so by the writ of mandamus sued out by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">From, what has been said, it follows that the judge committed error in refusing to sanction the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"A5P\">\n<em>All the Justices concur.</em>\n</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
