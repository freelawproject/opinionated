He was deported on July 25, 1997 following his release from state prison on a conviction for burglary of a habitation. He was then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\u201cfound\u201d in the United States by the federal government on April 13, 2000 while again in prison in Texas for burglary. Upon his release from prison on July 18, 2002, he was taken into custody by immigration officials who determined that he had not obtained permission from the Attorney-General to return to the United States. A one-count indictment was filed in the district court for the southern district of Texas charging Garcia-Mejia under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2) with illegal re-entry by a previously deported alien subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony. He entered a plea of guilty on October 29, 2002 and was sentenced on October 21, 2003 to, <em>inter alia, </em>seventy-seven months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Garcia-Mejia challenges his sentence on two grounds. First, he argues, as he did below, that the district court abused its discretion by prohibiting him from possessing \u201ca firearm, destructive device, or any other dangerous weapon\u201d while on supervised release because the term \u201cother dangerous weapon\u201d is both impermissibly vague and overbroad.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, he argues, for the first time on this appeal, that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">Garcia-Mejia first challenges the condition of supervised release prohibiting him from possessing dangerous weapons by arguing that it is overly broad.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The crux of his argument is that the term \u201cdangerous weapon,\u201d as it is defined in the guidelines, plausibly includes everyday items like eating utensils and construction tools.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The condition of supervised release, in other words, seemingly applies to things that, though potentially dangerous in some sense, are, by virtue of their ubiquity and ordinariness, an almost unavoidable part of everyday life. Garcia-Mejia\u2019s claim that the condition of supervised release is overly broad is in effect a claim that the condition fails to satisfy the statutory requirement, codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(2) and u.s.s.g. \u00a7 5D1.3(b), that every condition of supervised release involves \u201cno greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary in light of the need to protect the public and prevent recidivism.\u201d <em>Paul, </em>274 F.3d at 165 n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">Garcia-Mejia also objects to the condition <em>of </em>supervised release on the ground of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>vagueness. He contends that he cannot reasonably ascertain what sort of conduct is proscribed by the prohibition on the possession of a \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 166 (stating that offenders subject to conditions of supervised release are entitled to \u201cfair notice\u201d of what is prohibited).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">We addressed similar arguments in <em>United States v. Paul. </em>In <em>Paul, </em>the district court imposed a series of broad prohibitions as conditions of supervised release on a defendant convicted of child pornography crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 164-172. Paul, for example, was to avoid \u201cplaces, establishments and areas frequented by minors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165. Paul contended that this condition was too broad because it encompassed inevitable encounters with children in places like grocery stores. He further argued that it was vague because he could not determine what it meant for a place to be \u201cfrequented by minors.\u201d He similarly complained of the requirement that he avoid \u201cdirect and indirect contact with minors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">We concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion. We reasoned that the condition in question should be construed to exclude \u201cchance or incidental encounters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166. In reaching this conclusion, we implicitly drew a distinction between unavoidable situations that arise as a regular part of daily life and avoidable situations that arise as a result of conduct undertaken with a purpose of achieving a result which the supervised release conditions plainly intend to preclude. We also stated, with respect to Paul\u2019s contention that the condition in question was too vague, that conditions of supervised release are to be interpreted in light of common sense. <em>Id. </em>at 166-167 (\u201c \u2018[Conditions of probation do not have to be cast in letters six feet high, or [ ] describe every possible permutation, or [ ] spell out every last, self-evident detail\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Gallo, </em>20 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir.1993)). Using common sense as his guide, Paul should have been able to distinguish between the sorts of places that are \u201cfrequented by minors\u201d that he cannot reasonably avoid, such as grocery stores, and the sorts of places that he can, such as playgrounds and video arcades.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Applying <em>Paul </em>to the instant case, we similarly find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to prohibit Garcia-Mejia from possessing \u201cdangerous weapons\u201d as a condition of supervised release. The lesson of <em>Paul </em>is that Garcia-Mejia will violate his supervised release only by possessing a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d in a context in which, by the dictates of common sense, that \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d has no legitimate, everyday use. The district court\u2019s prohibition on the possession of \u201cdangerous weapons,\u201d for instance, would not prevent Garcia-Mejia from using the restaurant\u2019s steak-knife to cut the meat he was eating there, but it would prevent him from carrying a steak-knife in his pocket for protection. In using common sense this way, we strive to balance Garcia-Mejia\u2019s interest in leading an unencumbered life with the public\u2019s interest in being protected from people with a history of violent crime. <em>See also United States v. Santillana, </em>109 Fed.Appx. 665, 667-68 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Turning to his <em>Apprendi </em>challenge, as Garcia-Mejia concedes, his argument that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi </em>is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Apprendi </em>did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Al-mendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, Garcia-Mejia\u2019s argument has no merit. It certainly does not present plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">. Though the condition in question appears in the guidelines as a \"special condition,\u201d <em>see </em>u.s.s.g. \u00a7 5D1.3(d)(l), it is considered akin to a \u201cstandard condition\u201d as those are set forth in u.s.s.g. \u00a7 5D 1.3(b) and (c). <em>See United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 937 (5th Cir.2003). This court reviews the imposition of conditions of supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Paul, </em>274 F.3d 155, 165 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-11\">.

Instead, he simply objects that this prohibition is overly broad and vague.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b423-16\">.The guidelines provide that: \" 'Dangerous weapon\u2019 means (i) an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury; or (ii) an object that is not an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury but (I) closely resembles such an instrument; or (II) the defendant uses the object in a manner that created the impression that the object was such an instrument <em>(e.g. </em>a defendant wrapped a hand in a towel during a bank robbery to create the appearance of a gun).\u201d u.s.s.g. \u00a7 1B 1.1, comment, n. 1(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b424-6\">.
