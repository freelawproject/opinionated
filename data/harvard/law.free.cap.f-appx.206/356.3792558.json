Flores argues that his sentence is unreasonable and greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He does not challenge the calculation of his guidelines sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-17\">A sentence, such as Flores\u2019s, \u201cwithin a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). We note that, at sentencing, the district court specifically referenced the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, which sets out the sentencing goals found in \u00a7 3553(a). The district court\u2019s written statement of reasons also stated that the district court had considered the factors found in \u00a7 3553(a). We conclude that Flores has failed to demonstrate that his properly calculated guidelines sentence was unreasonable. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554; <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-24\">Flores also challenges 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Flores\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Flores contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Flores properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-27\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
