On appeal, Briscoe contends the district court violated the Sixth Amendment by sentencing him as an armed career criminal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000) and <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.4 (2005), because his prior convictions were neither charged in the indictment nor proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">We will affirm the sentence imposed by the district court as long as it is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005). An error of law or fact can render the sentence unreasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). In considering whether a sentence is unreasonable, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Hampton, </em>441 F.3d 284, 287 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">On appeal, Briscoe does not challenge the existence of his prior convictions or their qualification as predicate offenses under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Rather, he argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), has been effectively overruled. We have rejected this argument. <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">Accordingly, we affirm Briscoe\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
