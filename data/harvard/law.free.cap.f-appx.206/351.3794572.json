Gonzalez argues that the district court erred by enhancing his offense level by two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 based on his flight from the police. Gonzalez argues that his flight did not rise to the level of reckless endangerment because there was no evidence that he fled through a commercial or residential area or any other evidence of an aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-28\">While Gonzalez objected to the imposition of the enhancement in the district court, he did not object to sufficiency of the evidence. Accordingly, we review this argument for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Cabral-Castillo, </em>35 F.3d 182, 188-89 (5th Cir.1994) (if a defendant ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>jects to a sentencing adjustment in the district court, but on grounds different from those raised on appeal, the new arguments raised on appeal are reviewed for plain error only). Whether a defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes reckless endangerment during flight under \u00a7 3C1.2 also is a factual finding. <em>United States v. Lugman, </em>130 F.3d 113, 115-16 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">We conclude that the district court did not plainly err in finding that Gonzalez\u2019s flight, at a speed of up to 70 miles per hour, while transporting 19 aliens, during which he engaged in evasive driving tactics, amounted to reckless endangerment under \u00a7 3C1.2. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>323 F.3d 320, 321-24 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
