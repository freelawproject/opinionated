Cruz-Bacho was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 130 months. We affirm Cruz-Bacho\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">On appeal, Cruz-Bacho contends the district court erred by refusing to grant him a reduction under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 (2004) as a minor participant in the criminal activity that led to his convictions. When reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). The materials included in the joint appendix establish that Cruz-Bacho, like the other individual involved, served as a drug courier. Thus, we conclude the district court\u2019s refusal to grant Cruz-Bacho a reduction for his role in the criminal activity was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Cruz-Bacho\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
