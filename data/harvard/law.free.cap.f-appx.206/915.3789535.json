The district court concluded that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine barred her complaint seeking declaratory relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">Merry Morris (\u201cMrs. Morris\u201d) signed a post-nuptial agreement (\u201cthe agreement\u201d) with her husband, Leland Morris (\u201cMr. Morris\u201d). The agreement contained a no-challenge clause providing that if Mrs. Morris challenged in court any provision of the agreement, she would forfeit the $1.5 million paid in consideration by her husband. Mr. and Mrs. Morris then divorced in August 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">In June 2003, Mrs. Morris moved to enforce and modify the agreement in a Florida state court, claiming that Mr. Morris had violated the agreement and that the agreement did not address child custody arrangements for birthdays, school holidays, and Jewish holidays. Mr. Morris counterclaimed, seeking Mrs. Morris\u2019s forfeiture of the $1.5 million. After a three-day trial, the state court denied Mrs. Morris\u2019s motion to enforce and supplement the agreement, and awarded Mr. Morris the $1.5 million plus interest and attorney\u2019s fees. Mrs. Morris appealed the judgment to a Florida intermediary appellate court, the Fourth District Court of Appeal. On March 21, 2005, the state appellate court dismissed her appeal based on her continuing failure to satisfy the money judgment and the related contempt orders arising out of it. In July 2005, Mrs. Morris petitioned the Florida Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus to reinstate her appeal. The Florida Supreme Court denied her petition on April 13, 2006.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">On May 5, 2006, Mrs. Morris filed the complaint here in federal district court against two Florida judges in their official capacities, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Mrs. Morris sought declaratory judgment that: (1) a Florida state-court trial judge may not enforce a post-nuptial agreement that by its terms prohibits upon pain of forfeiture any access to court for child custody and visitation issues as violating federal and Florida constitutional rights; and (2) the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal may not refuse to hear an appeal challenging, on public policy grounds, the federal and Florida constitutional rights of a parent. The district court granted the defendant judges\u2019 motion to dismiss under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-16\">Mrs. Morris timely appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-17\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b943-18\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine limits the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>district courts. <em>See D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 476, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 1311, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Powell v. Powell, </em>80 F.3d 464, 466 (11th Cir.1996). A federal district court does not have jurisdiction to review state-court decisions where: (1) the party in federal court is the same as the party in state court; (2) the prior state-court ruling was a final or conclusive judgment on the merits; (3) the party seeking relief in federal court had a reasonable opportunity to raise its federal claims in the state-court proceeding; and (4) the issue before the federal court was either adjudicated by the state court or was inextricably intertwined with the state court\u2019s judgment. <em>Amos v. Glynn County Bd. of Tax Assessors, </em>347 F.3d 1249, 1265 n. 11 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cA federal claim is inextricably intertwined with a state court judgment \u2018if the federal claim succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Siegel v. LePore, </em>234 F.3d 1163, 1172 (11th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., </em>481 U.S. 1, 25, 107 S.Ct. 1519, 1533, 95 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987) (Marshall, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">In the present case, the plaintiff, Mrs. Morris, was a party in state court. Mrs. Morris obtained a final judgment from the highest state court in which review could be sought, because the state appellate court dismissed her appeal based on her contempt conduct and the Florida Supreme Court denied her mandamus petition that sought to compel the appellate court to hear her appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Mrs. Morris also had a reasonable opportunity to raise her federal constitutional claims in the state-court proceedings. For example, Mrs. Morris could have attacked, in the state trial court, the constitutionality of the no-challenge clause in response to her ex-husband\u2019s counterclaim for the $1.5 million. Likewise, in the state appellate court, Mrs. Morris could have raised her constitutional concerns about the $1.5 million judgment when she opposed Mr. Morris\u2019s motion to dismiss which was based on her failure to pay the $1.5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">Finally, the issue before the federal district court was \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state-court decision, because Mrs. Morris\u2019s claims succeed only to the extent that this Court determines that the state courts wrongly decided the issues. Mrs. Morris frames her request for declaratory judgment in general terms, but she is seeking relief specific to her situation. To grant Mrs. Morris the declaratory relief she seeks would mean that (1) the state trial court wrongly rendered the monetary judgment for Mr. Morris pursuant to the no-challenge clause and (2) the state appellate court incorrectly dismissed Mrs. Morris\u2019s appeal of that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">Mrs. Morris also contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Lance v. Dennis, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1198, 163 L.Ed.2d 1059 (2006), interred the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine no longer survives. We disagree. In <em>Lance, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the widespread conflation of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine with claim preclusion and held that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine \u201cdoes not bar actions by nonparties to the earlier state-court judgment simply because, for purposes of preclusion law, they could be considered in privity with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>party to the judgment.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at -, 126 S.Ct. at 1202. <em>Lance </em>did not inter the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-12\">. On April 22, 2006, Mrs. Morris filed a petition for rehearing, which the Florida Supreme Court denied on June 15, 2006 \u2014 after she filed suit in federal district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b943-13\">. We review questions of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). On appeal, Mrs. Morris also contends that the domestic relations exception to federal diversity jurisdiction does not apply. Because we decide that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, we do not reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b944-6\">. We reject Mrs. Morris's claim that the Florida state-court judgment was not final because she had a petition for rehearing pending before the Florida Supreme Court. Mrs. Morris\u2019s petition for rehearing addressed the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s denial of a petition for a writ of mandamus, not the state trial court\u2019s judgment against her or the state appellate court\u2019s dismissal of her appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b945-18\">. Further, in <em>Lance, </em>the Supreme Court stated that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is limited to those circumstances, articulated in <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>where a party \"seeks to take an appeal of an unfavorable state-court decision to a lower federal court.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at -, 126 S.Ct. at 1202 (citing <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005)). In <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>the Supreme Court stated that a federal plaintiff presenting an independent claim is not barred \"simply because [he] attempts to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court.\u201d 544 U.S. at 293, 125 S.Ct. at 1527. We do not decide whether <em>Lance </em>or <em>Exxon Mobil </em>require us to modify in any way our above four-part <em>Amos </em>test, because Mrs. Morris\u2019s claims fail under either test. Mrs. Morris appears before us in the exact circumstances that <em>Exxon Mobil </em>described the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applying: as a state-court loser filing suit in federal court after the state proceedings ended, complaining of an injury caused by that state-court judgment, and inviting a federal district court to review and reject it. See 544 U.S. at 291-92, 125 S.Ct. at 1526.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
