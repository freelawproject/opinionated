Chatmon appeals the two-year term of imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>imposed following the revocation of his term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Chatmon argues that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable. Although the two-year term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of Chatmon\u2019s supervised release exceeded the sentencing range indicated by the policy statements in Chapter Seven of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, it did not exceed the statutory maximum term of imprisonment that the district court could have imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Accordingly, Chatmon\u2019s revocation sentence was neither \u201cunreasonable\u201d nor \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006). Chatmon has not shown error.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
