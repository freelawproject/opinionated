This case is one of several related cases, all of which the district court dismissed on the same basis: that the plaintiffs had no cause of action against the insurance company\u2019s attorney-in-fact and that the statute of limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>had run by the time the plaintiffs served the insurance company with process. As to the order of dismissal of the attorney-in-fact, we affirm for the reasons stated in our disposition of <em>Martinez v. State Farm Lloyds, </em>204 Fed.Appx. 435. As to the entry of summary judgment, we likewise affirm because the Matas\u2019 original petition, filed in state court on January 31, 2003, estops them from denying that their claims had already accrued \u2014 and therefore the limitation period began to run \u2014 at the time they filed their lawsuit. The Matas did not serve State Farm Lloyds until August 2005, after the statute of limitations had run. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
