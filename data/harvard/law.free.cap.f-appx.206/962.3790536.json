Penoyer, a Florida inmate, appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his civil rights complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In his complaint, Penoyer named seven individuals as defendants, including three Florida Parole Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) members, three Commission employees, and the Secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections. Penoyer alleged, among other things, that the Commission violated his due process rights, as well as Florida\u2019s government in the sunshine law, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 286.011 (2001), and that changes to Florida\u2019s parole laws violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>clause of the United States Constitution. The district court, finding that Penoyer \u201cseem[ed] to acknowledge that he knew more than four years before filing this action that the Florida schedule for parole consideration had changed,\u201d determined that Penoyer\u2019s complaint was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-16\">On appeal, Penoyer argues that the dismissal of his complaint, as amended, was improper. Specifically, Penoyer reiterates that the Commission violated his due process rights as well as state law. Further, with regard to his <em>ex post facto claim, </em>Penoyer states that \u201ca copy of [the] hearing examiner[\u2019]s written report was not furnished to petitioner for years,\u201d and that \u201c[w]hen [he] finally did receive the written reports from 1999 and 2004 [on or about the] first part of 2005, he began to prepare [his] complaint.\u201d He alleges that \u201cwithout [those] documents it [was] impossible to determine if an issue exist[ed].\u201d On this basis, Penoyer agues that if the defendants had \u201cproperly and timely provided [him] with a copy of [the documents], he would have been able to timely file [his \u00a7 1983 complaint].\u201d Because this action was dismissed <em>sua sponte </em>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) prior to serving the defendants, there is no brief from the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-18\">A district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>using the same standards that govern Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissals. <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1489-90 (11th Cir.1997). Under that standard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>we \u201cview[ ] the allegations in the complaint as true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1490. Further, a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. <em>Marsh v. Butler County, Ala., </em>268 F.3d 1014, 1022-23 (11th Cir.2001) <em>(en </em>banc). A complaint is also subject to dismissal when its allegations-on their face-show that an affirmative defense, such as the statute of limitation, bars recovery on the claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1022. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling concerning the applicable statute of limitations and the tolling of the limitations period. <em>United States v. Carrell, </em>252 F.3d 1193, 1198 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">\u201cA district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for frivolity under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003). Under this provision, \u201can action is frivolous if it is \u2018without arguable merit either in law or fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Napier v. Preslicka, </em>314 F.3d 528, 531 (11th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1112, 124 S.Ct. 1038, 157 L.Ed.2d 901 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\"><em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>350 F.3d at 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">Upon review of Penoyer\u2019s brief and the record, we conclude that the district court did not err when it implicitly denied Penoyer\u2019s due process claim in its order dismissing the case, and likewise declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state-law arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">It is well established in this Circuit that \u201cthere is no constitutional right to parole in Florida.\u201d <em>Jonas v. Wainwright, </em>779 F.2d 1576, 1577 (11th Cir.1986). Therefore, the parole process in Florida is not protected by the due process clause. Moreover, to the extent that Penoyer made an argument under Florida\u2019s government in the sunshine act as part of his due process claim, it is meritless. To the extent that Penoyer\u2019s arguments in this regard did not otherwise implicate a federal right, they were not proper issues for a \u00a7 1983 complaint. <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). Finally, even if the court could have exercised supplemental jurisdiction over a Florida state-law claim, because it dismissed all the federal issues that gave it original jurisdiction, and, because we find that such dismissal was appropriate, the district court correctly dismissed this claim as well. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). For these reasons, the district court did not err in dismissing both of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">Addressing first the district court\u2019s timeliness findings, we note that the length of the limitations period governing a \u00a7 1983 action is dictated by state law. <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 270-275, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 1943-1947, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985). Accordingly, in Florida, the state\u2019s four-year residual statute of limitations applies. <em>City of Hialeah v. Rojas, </em>311 F.3d 1096, 1102 n. 2 (11th Cir.2002); Fla. Stat. 95.11(3)(p).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-12\">Nevertheless, the time of accrual of the cause of action is governed by federal law. <em>Lovett v. Ray, </em>327 F.3d 1181, 1182 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cGenerally, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the facts which would support a cause of action are apparent or should be apparent to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Specifically, a plaintiff \u201cmust know or have reason to know that [he was] injured, and must be aware or should be aware of who inflicted the injury.\u201d <em>Rozar v. Mullis, </em>85 F.3d 556, 562 (11th Cir.1996). Stated dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>ferently, once Penoyer \u201cknew, or should have known, all of the facts necessary to pursue a cause of action,\u201d the statute of limitations began to run. <em>Lovett, </em>327 F.3d at 1182. Analyzing this issue, \u201ca court [must] first ... identify the alleged injuries, and then ... determine when [the] plaintiff! ] could have sued for them.\u201d <em>Rozar, </em>85 F.3d at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">\u201cTo dismiss a prisoner\u2019s complaint as time-barred prior to service, it must \u2018appear beyond a doubt from the complaint itself that [the prisoner] can prove no set of facts which would avoid a statute of limitations bar.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hughes, </em>350 F.3d at 1163 (reversing in part to allow plaintiff to amend his complaint if he could \u201cplead facts that would support a finding that the statute of limitations [had] been tolled\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">\u201cThe interests of justice, however, can weigh in favor of allowing a plaintiff to assert untimely claims if circumstances beyond the plaintiffs control prevented timely filing.\u201d <em>Arce v. Garcia, </em>434 F.3d 1254, 1261 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cEquitable tolling is appropriate when a movant untimely files because of extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence.\u201d <em>Sandvik v. United States, </em>177 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.1999). Equitable tolling is only proper on the court\u2019s \u201cfinding [that] an inequitable event ... prevented plaintiffs timely action,\u201d and the plaintiff bears the burden of proof. <em>Justice v. United States, </em>6 F.3d 1474, 1479 (11th Cir.1993). Nevertheless, \u201c[equitable] tolling is an extraordinary remedy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">Addressing the merits of Penoyer\u2019s claim, we note that the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>clause of the United States Constitution prohibits the states from making laws \u201cwhich, by retroactive operation, increase the punishment for a crime after its commission.\u201d Gar<em>ner v. Jones, </em>529 U.S. 244, 249, 120 S.Ct. 1362, 1367, 146 L.Ed.2d 236 (2000). While \u201c[r]etroactive changes in laws governing parole of prisoners, in some instances, may be violative of this preeept[,] not every retroactive procedural change creating a risk of affecting an inmate\u2019s terms or conditions of confinement is prohibited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250, 120 S.Ct. at 1367. The determinative question is \u201cwhether retroactive application of the change in [the state] law created \u2018a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered crimes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, </em>514 U.S. 499, 509, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 1603, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995) (holding that a California law did not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>clause because it created only an insignificant risk that covered inmates would suffer increased punishment)). Finally, the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the law \u201ccreate[s] a significant risk of increasing his punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 120 S.Ct. at 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">Although it is not entirely clear which particular law(s) are at issue here, we have reviewed Florida\u2019s changing parole laws before. In 1985, for example, we held that laws adopted two years earlier \u201cin an effort to eliminate the arbitrariness and capriciousness that had crept into the old system,\u201d did not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>clause because they did nothing to change the fact that \u201cthe ultimate discretion on parole remained with the [C]ommission,\u201d and the changes to the law only affected \u201cthe manner in which it exercise[d] this power.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Wainwright, </em>772 F.2d 826, 827 (11th Cir.1985); <em>see also Damiano v. Fla. Parole &amp; Prob. Comm\u2019n, </em>785 F.2d 929, 933 (11th Cir.1986) <em>(per </em>curiam) (changes to parole laws adopted in 1978 did not affect the Commission\u2019s complete discretion and did not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>clause as to inmate convicted in 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>In 1997, Florida amended its statutes further. Prior to 1997, Florida inmates were interviewed for a review of their PPRD every two years. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 947.174 (2001); <em>see also Tuff v. State, </em>732 So.2d 461, 462 n. 1 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1999) (noting that from 1970 until 1997 subsequent parole interviews were conducted every two years). The statute enacted that year is still in force. Section 947.174 now directs, in relevant part, that, while the default frequency of such interviews is two years,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-4\">[f]or any inmate convicted of murder, attempted murder, sexual battery, attempted sexual battery, or who has been sentenced to a 25-year minimum mandatory sentence ..., [subsequent interviews to review the inmate\u2019s PPRD] shall take place once within 5 years after the initial interview and once every 5 years thereafter if the [Commission finds that it is not reasonable to expect that parole will be granted at a hearing during the following years and states the bases for the finding in writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 947.174(1)(a)-(b) (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">For purposes of this appeal, we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the Commission repeatedly refused to give Penoyer certain documents he requested concerning his eligibility for parole, and as a result, he did not know all he needed to know to file a \u00a7 1983 claim until some point after the state law governing frequency of parole hearings had changed. However, as discussed below, we can affirm the district court\u2019s order under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). <em>See Parks v. City of Warner Robins, Ga., </em>43 F.3d 609, 613 (11th Cir.1995) (holding we can \u201caffirm the district court\u2019s decision on any adequate ground, even if it is other than the one on which the court actually relied\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">We have not addressed whether the current version of \u00a7 947.174 violates the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>clause. However, the Supreme Court has offered guidance on the issue. In <em>Morales, </em>the Supreme Court approvingly analyzed a California parole statute that allowed California\u2019s parole board \u201cto defer subsequent [parole] hearings for up to three years if the prisoner ha[d] been convicted of more than one offense which involve[d] the taking of a life and if the [b]oard [found] that it [was] not reasonable to expect that parole would be granted at a hearing during the following years and state[d] the bases for the finding.\u201d <em>Morales, </em>514 U.S. at 503, 115 S.Ct. at 1600. The Supreme Court found that this law did not violate the Ex Post <em>Facto </em>clause because: (1) it applied to a narrow class of prisoners \u201cfor whom the likelihood of release on parole is quite remote\u201d; (2) it only affected subsequent hearings, meaning that it never applied until findings of an initial hearing had been made; (3) it required California\u2019s board to make specific findings justifying the deferral; and (4) it required that the deferral be put in writing. <em>Id. </em>at 509-11, 115 S.Ct. at 1603-04. Further, the Supreme Court noted that the statute established annual hearings as a default. <em>Id. </em>at 511-12, 115 S.Ct. at 1604.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">The Supreme Court concluded in <em>Morales </em>that because of the \u201cparticularized findings\u201d the law required, combined with the board\u2019s \u201cbroad discretion,\u201d the class of prisoners that the statute affected could not \u201creasonably expect that their prospects for early release on parole would be enhanced by the opportunity of annual hearings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512, 115 S.Ct. at 1604. Thus, rather than increase the prisoner\u2019s punishment, the statute merely allowed California\u2019s parole board to \u201cavoid the futility of going through the motions of reannouneing its denial of parole suitability on a yearly basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, holding that the statute created \u201conly the most speculative and attenuated risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered crimes,\u201d the Supreme Court found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>that it did not violate the Ex Post <em>Facto </em>clause. <em>Id. </em>at 514, 115 S.Ct. at 1605.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Section 947.174 bears marked similarities to the California statute at issue in <em>Morales. </em>First, it applies only to a narrow class of prisoners, though it is slightly broader than California\u2019s. Second, it only affects the timing of subsequent parole hearings, not the initial hearing. Third, similar to the California law, Florida\u2019s statute requires the specific finding that \u201cit is not reasonable to expect that parole will be granted at a hearing during the following [five] years.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 947.174(1)(b). Finally, it requires the Commission to support its decision by explaining it in writing. Based on the foregoing, as in <em>Morales, </em>it appears that this statute was crafted to reduce the \u201cfutile\u201d work of frequently \u201creannouncing\u201d the denial of parole to a class of prisoners who, in the Commission\u2019s broad discretion, were very unlikely to warrant it. Accordingly, Penoyer has not alleged facts showing that changes in the law \u201ccreate[d] a significant risk\u201d of increasing the length of his imprisonment, and, as in <em>Morales, </em>we conclude that he faded to state a cognizable <em>Ex Post Facto </em>clause violation as a matter of law. <em>Accord Tuff v. State, </em>732 So.2d 461, 466 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">Accordingly, Penoyer\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>claim lacks arguable merit and the district court properly dismissed his complaint as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. <em>Napier, </em>314 F.3d at 531. This being so, and as all of Penoyer\u2019s other claims similarly lack merit, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b993-21\">.
