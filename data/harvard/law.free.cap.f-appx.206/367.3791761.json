Vanegas also argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that his imprisonment term exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326 offense charged in his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">The record reflects that the district court considered factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) when it determined that a 77-month term of imprisonment was a fair and reasonable sentence in Vanegas\u2019s case. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Vanegas\u2019s sentence fell at the lowest end of his properly calculated advisory guideline range and is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006). Vanegas has failed to rebut that presumption. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">Vanegas\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated-felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Vanegas contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Vanegas properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
