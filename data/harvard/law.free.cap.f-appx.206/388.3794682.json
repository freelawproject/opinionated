Pace does not challenge the dismissal of any other defendants. Pace also does not challenge the district court\u2019s rulings in favor of Talley, Howard, and Douglas regarding Daniel Pace\u2019s detention, Pace\u2019s official-capacity claims, and Pace\u2019s state-law claims. These issues are thus deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Pace contends that Talley and Douglas violated Daniel Pace\u2019s constitutional rights. They did so, Pace contends, by reporting to the police a threat suggesting school violence purportedly made by Daniel, without having first afforded Daniel an opportunity to respond to the accusation. It is clear, however, that Pace\u2019s contentions do not establish the violation of a clearly established constitutional right on such grounds. <em>See Siegert v. Gilley, </em>500 U.S. 226, 231, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991); <em>Wood v. Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 319, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Pace also asserts that Howard violated Daniel Pace\u2019s constitutional right to privacy by disseminating confidential information. Pace has not shown that the public interest in school safety was outweighed by Daniel\u2019s expectation of privacy. <em>See Cantu v. Rocha, </em>77 F.3d 795, 805-08 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Pace thus has not established that the district court erred in granting summary judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); Am<em>burgey v. Corhart Refractories Corp., </em>936 F.2d 805, 809 (5th Cir.1991). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">The defendants move for costs on the basis of their expenses in defending this appeal. This motion is DENIED. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1912, 1927; Fed. R. App. P. 38; <em>Edwards v. General Motors Corp., </em>153 F.3d 242, 246 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
