In rejecting Lakhwinder\u2019s applications, the BIA found that Lakhwinder lacked credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-26\">This court generally reviews only the BIA\u2019s decision, not that of the IJ, except to the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision influences the BIA. <em>Mikhael v. I.N.S., </em>115 F.3d 299, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>302 (5th Cir.1997). Because the BIA summarily affirmed, without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision, the IJ\u2019s decision is the final agency determination for judicial review. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The BIA articulated cogent reasons, supported by substantial evidence in the record, for rejecting Lakhwinder\u2019s testimony as incredible. <em>See Chun v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). Absent credible testimony by Lakhwinder, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Lakhwinder failed to establish that he was eligible for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>Because Lakhwinder failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of relief under the CAT in his appeal to the BIA, he has not exhausted this issue. This court thus lacks jurisdiction to review it. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, Lakhwinder\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
