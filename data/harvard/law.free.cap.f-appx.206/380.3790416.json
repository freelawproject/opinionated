On January 23, 2006, the appellant, James Payne, filed his notice of appeal in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-22\">Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure requires that, in the absence of special circumstances not relevant here, the notice of appeal \u201cmust be filed with the district clerk within 30 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). \u201c[A] timely filed notice of appeal is an absolute prerequisite to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Moody Natl Bank of Galveston v. GE Life and Annuity Assurance Co., </em>383 F.3d 249, 250 (5th Cir.2004). Because Payne failed to file his notice of appeal within 30 days of the final judgment, this court lacks jurisdiction over his appeal. Payne\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
