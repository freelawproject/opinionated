Montelongo appeals his sentence of 50 months for illegal reentry into the United States. Montelongo argues that the district court violated section 3553(a) because it failed both to state and find that Montelongo\u2019s sentence was \u201cnot greater than necessary.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The advisory Sentencing Guidelines range was 46 to 57 months of imprisonment, and Montelongo did not object at sentencing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-19\">\u2018When a defendant fails to object to an error before the district court, we review the argument for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied - U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 196, 163 L.Ed.2d 207 (2005). Plain error occurs where \u201c \u2018(1) there is an error; (2) that is plain or obvious; (3) affecting the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Hall, </em>314 F.3d 565, 566 (11th Cir.2002)). The district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-22\">\u201c[N]othing ... requires [a] district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the [section] 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the [section] 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). In addition, we review the sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness and \u201cordinarily ... expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Because Montelongo\u2019s sentence \u201cachieve[s] the purposes of sentencing as stated in [section] 3553(a),\u201d it was reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
