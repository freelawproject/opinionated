Solis asserts that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) based on a Texas prior conviction for robbery. The parties disagree whether the proper standard of review is plain error or de novo. We conclude that the result is the same under either standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), a defendant\u2019s base offense level is increased by sixteen levels if he was previously deported after being convicted of a crime of violence. The Commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 states that a prior conviction may qualify as a crime of violence if (1) it is one of the predicate offenses listed in that section or (2) it has as an element of the crime the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1(B)(iii). Robbery is an offense expressly listed as a crime of violence in the Commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. 1(b)(iii). Recently in <em>United States v. SantiestebanHernandez, </em>469 F.3d 376 (5th Cir.2006), we held that the Texas robbery statute, \u00a7 29.02, qualifies as \u201crobbery\u201d for the purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. The arguments raised by Solis are almost identical to the arguments made in <em>Santiesteban-Hernandez </em>and thus foreclosed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-14\">Solis also contends that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional. He acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but raises it to preserve it for further review. We have \u201crepeatedly rejected arguments like the one made by [Solis] and ... held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding despite <em>Apprendi [v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).]\u201d <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir. 2005). Solis\u2019s guilty-plea conviction and the sentence imposed are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-10\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
