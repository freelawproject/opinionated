Fort was involved in the criminal activities orchestrated by former Kennedale, Texas, Police Chief David Geeslin. <em>See United States v. Geeslin, </em>447 F.3d 408 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Fort argues, contrary to our holding in <em>Geeslin, </em>that Officer Gary Cooper was not a victim of Geeslin\u2019s activities for purposes of calculating the amount of loss pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1. Fort\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Geeslin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Fort argues for the first time on appeal that Cooper was not a victim of her criminal conduct and that she was as much a victim of Geeslin\u2019s conduct as Cooper was. Fort\u2019s contentions implicate factual determinations that could have been made by the district court upon proper objection; Fort has not demonstrated plain error. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>923 F.2d 47, 50 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
