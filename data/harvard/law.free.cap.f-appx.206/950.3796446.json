Hunter argues that the district court unconstitutionally used his prior convictions, not alleged in the indictment or submitted to the jury, to sentence him to a mandatory life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-23\">Because Hunter objected to the use of his prior convictions to enhance his sentence below, he has preserved this issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>for appeal. <em>United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1305 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">The district court sentenced Hunter to a life sentence pursuant to \u00a7 841(b)(1)(a). Section 841(b) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-6\">In the case of a violation of subsection (a) of this section involving ... (ii). .50 grams or more of a mixture or substance described in clause (ii) [cocaine] which contains cocaine base [and].... If any person commits a violation of this subparagraph ... after two or more pri- or convictions for a felony drug offense have become final, such person shall be sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">The Supreme Court has specifically held, in the context of using prior convictions that were <em>not </em>alleged in the indictment, that \u201ca State need not allege a defendant\u2019s prior conviction in the indictment or information that alleges the elements of an underlying crime, even though the conviction was \u2018necessary to bring the case within the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 243, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1231, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (emphasis in original). In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court further confirmed the continuing validity of the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>holding, when it held that prior convictions were the exception to the rule that any fact that increased a penalty had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Therefore, the Supreme Court has specifically exempted past convictions having to be alleged and proved when being used by the government to increase a defendant\u2019s penalty. The Court in <em>Shepard </em>acknowledged that it had not yet reconsidered <em>Almendarez-Torres. Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 27, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1264, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">Further, we have previously rejected the argument that using unalleged past convictions to enhance a penalty is unconstitutional or that <em>Booker </em>would prohibit a district court from using prior convictions to enhance a sentence. <em>See United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257-58 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1013, 125 S.Ct. 637, 160 L.Ed.2d 480 (2004) (citations omitted); <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 223, 163 L.Ed.2d 191 (2005). Additionally, \u201cthe district court was, and still is, bound by the statutory m\u00ednimums.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">In light of the current binding Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit precedent allowing the district court to use unalleged prior convictions to enhance sentences, the district court did not act unconstitutionally by sentencing Hunter pursuant to a statutory minimum. Accordingly, we affirm Hunter\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-14\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-9\">.
