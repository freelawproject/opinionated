Mosley argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the testimony of a witness, Charles James, that Mosley threatened him. Mosley argues that the evidence had little or no probative value and that the probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Mosley\u2019s threat against a specific adverse witness was relevant to show Mosley\u2019s consciousness of guilt. <em>See United States v. Rocha, </em>916 F.2d 219, 240-41 (5th Cir.1990). Because the evidence was probative of an issue other than Mosley\u2019s character, it was admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). <em>See United States v. Carrillo, </em>981 F.2d 772, 774 (5th Cir.1993). Under the circumstances of this case, it was reasonable for the district court to conclude that the danger of unfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence. <em>See Rocha, </em>916 F.2d at 241. Further, any potential prejudice was mitigated by the district court\u2019s limiting instruction that the defendant was not on trial for an act, conduct, or offense not alleged in the indictment. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>210 F.3d 311, 318 (5th Cir.2000). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Charles James\u2019s testimony that Mosley threatened him. <em>See Rocha, </em>916 F.2d at 240-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
