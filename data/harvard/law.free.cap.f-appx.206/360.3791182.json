He argues that the district court erred in assessing a 16-level sentencing enhancement for his prior felony conviction for sexual assault of a child under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.011(a)(2) because the conviction did not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-23\">The argument is without merit. A conviction under \u00a7 22.011(a)(2) \u201cmeets a common-sense as well as a generic, contemporary definition of statutory rape,\u201d and it is thus the equivalent of an enumerated offense which triggers the enhancement. <em>United States v. Alvarado-Hernandez, </em>465 F.3d 188, 189-90 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-24\">Torres also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Athough he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Torres properly concedes that his argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>merit is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth, in 5th Cir.
