Moore, III, appeals from the district court\u2019s order revoking his supervised release and sentencing him to eleven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>months imprisonment after he admitted to violations of his supervised release. Moore\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), representing that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but challenging the length of Moore\u2019s sentence. Moore has filed a pro se supplemental brief, asserting that his sentence was based on hearsay. Finding no meritorious issues and no error by the district court, we affirm the revocation order and the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In light of Moore\u2019s admission that he violated the terms of his supervision, we find no error by the district court in revoking his supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West Supp.2006); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). Moore challenges the length of the sentence imposed. Before imposing sentence, the court considered the relevant factors and noted that Moore\u2019s non-compliance with his supervised release terms and his numerous violations justified a sentence of eleven months. The eleven-month term of incarceration imposed by the district court was within the five-to-eleven-month advisory guideline range and was not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a). Although Moore contends that his sentence was enhanced based on hearsay statements that he was a drug dealer, Moore corrected the court\u2019s misstatement, and, in light of the court\u2019s explanation of its reasons for the sentence, Moore\u2019s speculation is insufficient to show that the sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have independently reviewed the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order revoking Moore\u2019s supervised release and imposing an eleven-month sentence and a twenty-five-month supervised release term. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
