Kazibutowski challenges only the denial of withholding of removal and has abandoned by failing to brief any challenge to the denial of relief under the CAT. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-20\">Kazibutowski argues that the BIA erred in determining that he did not have a well-founded fear of persecution based on his refusal to report for military service. Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that the BIA\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence and is reasonable. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 350 (5th Cir.2002). Kazibutowski has not shown that the evidence compels a finding that he would face persecution on a protected ground if returned to Venezuela. <em>See Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 667, 669 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see also Jukic v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Alonzo v. INS, </em>915 F.2d 546, 548 (9th Cir.1990). Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
