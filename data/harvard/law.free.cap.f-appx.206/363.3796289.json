He contends that the Government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he violated a condition of his supervised release by failing to obtain representative payee status for his Social Security check. This court need not consider this argument because revocation of Jacobs\u2019s supervised release was mandatory based on the district court\u2019s finding that Jacobs violated another condition of supervised release by failing to report for drug testing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g)(3); <em>United States v. McCormick, </em>54 F.3d 214, 219 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.1995). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Jacobs\u2019s supervised release. <em>See McCormick, </em>54 F.3d at 219 &amp; n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-24\">Jacobs also contends that the 11-month sentence imposed following the revocation of his supervised release was plainly unreasonable because it failed to take into account his mental and financial limitations. Jacobs was subject to a five-year statutory maximum sentence upon revocation of his supervised release. <em>See </em>18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3559(a)(1), 3583(e)(3); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A). The Sentencing Guidelines recommended a prison term of between 5 and 11 months based on Jacobs\u2019s Grade C violations and his criminal history category of III. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). Jacobs\u2019s 11-month sentence was within the advisory guideline range and is neither unreasonable nor plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
