Porter appeals his conviction for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006). Porter was also convicted of possession with intent to distribute marijuana, which he does not contest. On appeal, Porter\u2019s sole argument is whether the Government presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that his possession of the firearm was to further a drug trafficking crime. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">To determine whether there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction, this court considers whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, any reasonable trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c), the Government must prove that the defendant possessed a firearm and that the firearm \u201cfurthered, advanced, or helped forward a drug trafficking crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Lomax, </em>293 F.3d 701, 705 (4th Cir.2002). Factors that might lead a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that the requisite nexus existed between the firearm and the drug offense include: \u201c \u2018the type of drug activity that is being conducted, accessibility of the firearm, the type of weapon ..., whether the gun is loaded, proximity to drugs or drug profits, and the time and circumstances under which the gun is found.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Ceballos-Torres, </em>218 F.3d 409, 414-15 (5th Cir. 2000)). \u201cUltimately, the test is whether a reasonable jury could, on the evidence presented at trial, find beyond a reasonable doubt that possession of the firearm facilitated a drug trafficking crime ...; \u2018in furtherance\u2019 means that the gun afforded some advantage (actual or potential, real or contingent) relevant to the vicissitudes of drug trafficking.\u201d <em>United States v. Lewter, </em>402 F.3d 319, 322 (2d Cir.2005). To that end, a firearm might further or advance drug trafficking as a defense against someone trying to steal drugs or drug profits or as a deterrence to a robbery. <em>Lomax, </em>293 F.3d at 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Here, we find that a reasonable jury could conclude that Porter\u2019s possession of the firearm was to further drug trafficking. The .45 caliber pistol with a fully loaded magazine, but empty chamber, was found on Porter\u2019s kitchen counter next to digital scales and within close proximity to a large amount of marijuana. <em>See id. </em>We therefore affirm Porter\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
