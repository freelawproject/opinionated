The district court determined that Hampton qualified for sentencing as a career offender, and his Guideline<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> range was 262 to 327 months. The Government moved for a departure based on Hampton\u2019s substantial assistance, and recommended a sentence of 240 months of imprisonment. The district court granted the motion for departure and sentenced Hampton to a total of 240 months of imprisonment. On appeal, counsel filed an Anders<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> brief, in which he states that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questions whether the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to recommend a greater departure from the Guideline range. Hampton was advised of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Hampton did not assert at sentencing that the Government breached the plea agreement, and he must therefore demonstrate plain error before he can obtain any relief on this claim. <em>See United States v. Fant, </em>974 F.2d 559, 562 (4th Cir.1992) (applying plain error analysis in context of breach of plea agreement). In order to do so, Hampton must establish the breach was \u201c \u2018so obvious and substantial that failure to notice and correct it affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. McQueen, </em>108 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Fant, </em>974 F.2d at 565). Our review of the plea agreement and the transcripts of the plea and sentencing hearings leads us to conclude that the Government did not breach the plea agreement, and Hampton is therefore not entitled to relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Hampton\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Hampton, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Hampton requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Hampton. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-27\">. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b329-25\">. <em>Anders v.
