Discovering no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Cowan was charged and convicted for possession of a firearm after having earlier been convicted of a felony. The charges arose after police officers executed a search warrant at Cowan\u2019s residence. The officers found Cowan in his bedroom, and when they announced themselves, Cowan reached for a loaded pistol. After subduing Cowan, the officers searched Cowan\u2019s room and hall closet and found a bulletproof vest, an electronic scale used for measuring illegal narcotics that tested positive for cocaine, and the pistol\u2019s box, which contained a bill of sale indicating that Patricia Biederman sold Cowan the firearm. At trial, Biederman said she purchased the gun at a pawn shop and sold it to Cowan to clear a $200 debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">The government presented evidence\u2014 which included recorded telephone conversations made by Cowan at jail \u2014 indicating that Cowan attempted to influence Biederman\u2019s testimony. One conversation between Cowan and a person known as \u201cKevin\u201d went this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-7\">COWAN: And if I can get Patty, I wrote her in the letter, if I can get her to ... testify sayin\u2019 something about ... you know that .380[gun] was hers and that she had left ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-8\">KEVIN: Yeah, yeah ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-9\">COWAN: ... the mother fucker there while I was asleep. Then, then I can get out, dawg, I\u2019ll be out within two weeks. You know, that\u2019s what I need her to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-10\">COWAN: If you can get a hold her, man, I got, I got her ... I gave you her number, if you could get a hold her and tell her, uh, tell her pretty much what I said. Now she\u2019s not the kind of person that would, you know, want to be involved in some shit like that, but ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHj\">KEVIN: Yeah, I know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-11\">COWAN: Tell her how serious it is. These mother fuckers talkin\u2019 about seven years, but ... um, I\u2019m knowing I won\u2019t get no seven years. I\u2019ll fuck around though for real dawg and get it like three years if she don\u2019t help me out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-12\">The government also presented statements taken of Cowan\u2019s roommates by the police officers during the search. Two roommates said they suspected Cowan of selling drugs because they had seen people come over and meet with Cowan in the laundry room and behind closed doors. Another roommate said he saw Cowan meet with unknown people in the laundry room, and he also saw a handgun on Co-wan\u2019s desk in his bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">In addition, the government offered testimony of Special Agent Saier about the drug-related investigation of Cowan before the search \u2014 specifically regarding controlled purchases of cocaine made by a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) at Cowan\u2019s house. The Cl reported to Saier that, while the Cl was at Cowan\u2019s house to purchase cocaine, Cowan showed the Cl three firearms \u2014 including one handgun in Cowan\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">The probation officer assigned Cowan a base offense level of 20 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), increased the base offense level by four levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) because Cowan used a firearm in connection with another felony offense, and gave another two-level increase for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. For a total offense level of 26 and a criminal history of catego<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>ry V, the guideline imprisonment range was 110-137 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">In sentencing Cowan, the district court concluded that Cowan did obstruct justice by attempting to influence Biederman\u2019s testimony and did use a firearm in connection with another felony offense \u2014 namely, drug trafficking. The court sentenced Co-wan to 120 months, noting that 120 months was the statutory maximum, but was slightly below the midpoint of the guideline range. Cowan appealed his sentence to this Court, and we remanded in the light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because \u201cCowan\u2019s sentence erroneously was based in part on extra-verdict enhancements under a mandatory guidelines system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">On remand, the district court again sentenced Cowan to 120 months imprisonment but noted that the court considered the guideline range as advisory. Cowan appeals the re-sentencing on four grounds: (1) the district court erred in applying the firearm enhancement because nothing evidenced that a gun was present during any drug transaction; (2) the district court erred in applying the obstruction of justice enhancement because \u201cthere was no evidence that [Cowan] actually attempted to persuade Ms. Biederman to change her testimony,\u201d and that the Appellant\u2019s statements were \u201cjust talk;\u201d (3) the district court erred under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because the facts used for the enhancements were not put to a jury or admitted by Cowan; and (4) the district court erred under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 in sentencing Cowan to 120 months in the light of his acceptance of responsibility and extraordinary rehabilitation efforts and in not stating its reason for imposing the 120 month sentence. We affirm on every ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and the underlying factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Pope, </em>461 F.3d 1331, 1333 (11th Cir.2006). We review the ultimate sentence for reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>And we review constitutional challenges to a sentence <em>de novo, </em>but we will reverse only upon a finding of harmful error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">First, the district court did not err in applying the firearm enhancement. The sentencing guidelines authorize a four-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). The evidence shows that Cowan was selling drugs out of the laundry room in his house; and at his house, he possessed one to three firearms. And Cowan showed his firearms to a customer \u2014 the Cl \u2014 who came to the house to purchase cocaine. The district court was not clearly mistaken in finding that Cowan used a firearm in connection with drug trafficking.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">Second, the district court did not err in applying the obstruction of justice enhancement. The guidelines authorize a two-level enhancement if (1) \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>ministration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction,\u201d and (2) the obstructive conduct related to either the offense of conviction or any relevant conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The evidence shows that Cowan attempted to influence Biederman\u2019s testimony on the ownership of the gun. Cowan told \u201cKevin\u201d to contact Biederman and ask her to say the gun was hers. The district court did not clearly err in finding that Cowan attempted to influence Biederman\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Third, the district court\u2019s findings that Cowan used a firearm in connection with a felony and that Cowan obstructed justice did not violate Cowan\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. In making these findings based upon the preponderance of the evidence, the district court noted that it was applying the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory. Thus, Cowan\u2019s right to a jury was not violated. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he use of extra-verdict enhancements in a non-mandatory guidelines system is not unconstitutional\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Fourth, the district court ultimately imposed a reasonable sentence. Pursuant to section 3553(a) of Title 18, a district court must consider several factors to determine a reasonable sentence. Those \u201cfactors include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence and protection of the public, pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1180 (11th Cir. 2006); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">Here, the district court expressly noted that it considered the factors and the advisory guideline range in sentencing Cowan. The court considered Cowan\u2019s \u201chistory and characteristics\u201d and explicitly acknowledged Cowan\u2019s rehabilitation efforts and acceptance of responsibility. The court considered \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense\u201d and expressly concluded that Cowan\u2019s rehabilitation efforts did not lessen the seriousness of his crime. The court said it considered \u201cthe Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements\u201d and possible upward or downward departures, but said that no departures were warranted. After considering all of these factors, the court imposed a sentence slightly below the midpoint of the guideline range. We conclude that the sentence was reasonable and that the district court considered the factors and adequately expressed its reasons for imposing the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgement is</p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-6\">. Cowan argues that no evidence shows he had a gun with him during any of his drug transactions. All drugs were sold in the laundry room, and the guns were elsewhere in the house. But a gun need not be within arm's reach of a criminal transaction to be used in connection with the offense. <em>See United States v. Flennory, </em>145 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.1998) (upholding a finding that a weapon was used \"in connection with\u201d drug trafficking when the drugs were distributed in a vacant lot and the weapon was in a car across the street), <em>superseded on other grounds, United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b985-7\">. Cowan argues that his comments were \"just talk\u201d and that they were never communicated to Biederman. But that the comments were not communicated to Biederman does not save Cowan. See <em>United States v. Bradford, </em>277 F.3d 1311 (11th Cir.2002) (deciding that indirect threats of a witness made to third parties can constitute obstruction of justice even without a showing that the threats were communicated to the target).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b985-14\">. Under <em>Booker, </em>a court is not required \"to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the section 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). \"[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
