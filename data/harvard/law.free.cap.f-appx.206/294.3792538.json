Barnes\u2019 appeals from his conviction pursuant to a guilty plea to uttering and possessing counterfeit securities and his resulting sentence of three years probation. Barnes\u2019 counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues of appeal, but addressing the validity of Barnes\u2019 plea and sentence. Barnes was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so. Because our review of the record discloses no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">We find Barnes\u2019 guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered after a thorough hearing pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. Barnes was properly advised of his rights, the offense charged, and the maximum sentence for the offense. The court also determined that there was an independent factual basis for the plea and that the plea was not coerced or influenced by promises. <em>See North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116-20 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">We find the district court properly applied the Sentencing Guidelines and considered the relevant factors before imposing the three-year probationary term. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006); <em>see United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). Additionally, we find that the sentence imposed was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.) (holding that a sentence within the properly calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
