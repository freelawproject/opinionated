Acosta challenges the constitutionality of the treatment by \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) of certain prior drug convictions as sentencing factors rather than offense elements that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He also argues that the district court committed plain error by failing to ask whether he affirmed or denied his prior conviction, as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-23\">Acosta\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Acosta contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and a majority of the current Court would overrule it in the light of <em>Apprendi </em>and subsequent Supreme Court authority. We have repeatedly rejected such contentions because <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Acosta <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Regarding Acosta\u2019s \u00a7 851 challenge, in the absence of a showing that the prior conviction was unconstitutionally obtained or was not committed by Acosta, he has not shown plain error. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>848 F.3d 78, 86-87 (5th Cir. 2003). Moreover, Acosta\u2019s prior conviction occurred well beyond the five-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 851(e). Accordingly, Acosta has failed to establish error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s failure to follow the \u00a7 851(b) colloquy. <em>See United States v. Fragoso, </em>978 F.2d 896, 902-03 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
