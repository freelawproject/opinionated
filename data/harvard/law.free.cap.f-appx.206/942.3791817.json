On appeal, Horne challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) and argues that the district court erred by applying the 15-year mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 924(e). For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-14\">Horne, a convicted felon, was found in possession to two live shotgun shells. He pled guilty to possession of ammunition by a convicted felon and, at sentencing, made no objection to the probation officer\u2019s determination that, because he was subject to a mandatory 15-year minimum term of imprisonment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), his applicable Guideline range was 180-210 months\u2019 imprisonment. Horne was sentenced to the mandatory minimum term of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-15\">For the first time on appeal, Horne, stating that he raises the issue only for purposes of preservation, argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is unconstitutional on its face because it does not explicitly require a substantial effect on interstate commerce and is unconstitutional as applied because there was no such evidence in this case. As Horne correctly recognizes, we have previously rejected this challenge and held that a \u201cminimal nexus\u201d to interstate commerce is sufficient. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1273-74 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-16\">Horne next argues that the indictment suffered from a jurisdictional defect, resulting in the erroneous application of the 15-year mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 924(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The premise of Horne\u2019s argument is that, by specifying 12 prior convictions in the indictment, the 3 predicate convictions needed to trigger \u00a7 924(e) could only come from those 12 convictions. Horne concedes that two of those convictions meet the criteria in \u00a7 924(e). However, he argues that the remaining ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>prior felonies, on their face, did not meet the \u00a7 924(e) criteria. As a result, he contends, there was a jurisdictional error because the three required qualifying convictions were not present on the face of the indictment. He further argues that the district court erred by failing to determine whether the Florida burglary convictions alleged in the indictment qualified as predicate convictions based on the conduct surrounding those convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether an indictment sufficiently charges a statutorily proscribed offense. <em>United States v. Pease, </em>240 F.3d 938, 942 (11th Cir.2001). Because Horne raised this argument for the first time on appeal, \u201cthe indictment must be held sufficient unless it is so defective that it does not, by any reasonable construction, charge the offense to which [the defendant] pleaded guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943. An indictment suffers from a jurisdictional defect when it charges no crime at all, <em>i.e., </em>a non-offense. <em>See United States v. Peter, </em>310 F.3d 709, 714-15 (11th Cir.2002). A defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary plea of guilty, however, waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings. <em>United States v. Yunis, </em>723 F.2d 795, 796 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">Horne does not dispute that he was a felon in possession of ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). His challenge to \u00a7 924(e) fails because \u00a7 924(e) is a sentence enhancement provision, not a separate offense. <em>United States v. McGatha, </em>891 F.2d 1520, 1527 (11th Cir.1990). Accordingly, the prior convictions need not be alleged in the indictment and are relevant only for sentencing. <em>Id. </em>Any defect in the manner in which the indictment charged a violation of \u00a7 924(e), therefore, is of no relevance to whether the indictment failed to charge the offense to which Horne pled guilty. Horne cannot challenge his conviction on the ground there was an insufficient factual basis to support the application of \u00a7 924(e), as a claim that \u201cthere was an insufficient factual basis to support the indictment\u201d is a non-jurisdictional defect. <em>United States v. Fairchild, </em>803 F.2d 1121, 1124 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">To the extent that Horne challenges the application of \u00a7 924(e) to his sentence, because it is raised for the first time on appeal, we review his claim \u201cfor plain error, or error that is clear or obvious and affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>166 F.3d 1360, 1361 (11th Cir.1999). We have repeatedly rejected the argument that prior convictions must be charged in the indictment for a defendant to be sentenced as an armed career criminal. <em>E.g., United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 335, 166 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006). Furthermore, sentencing under \u00a7 924(e) is mandatory and must be applied automatically regardless of whether the government affirmatively seeks the enhancement. <em>United States v. Cobia, </em>41 F.3d 1473, 1475 (11th Cir.1995). Accordingly, any error by the district court in relying on convictions other than those charged in the indictment cannot be said to be clear or obvious.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>In light of the foregoing, Horne\u2019s conviction and sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"AJG\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-12\">.

Home asks us to remand the case to allow the district court to make a specific finding as to Horne's third qualifying offense, if any. The parties characterize this issue as a question of whether or not we should affirm on alternate grounds. Because Home has not otherwise shown error by the district court, there is no need to affirm on alternate grounds.
