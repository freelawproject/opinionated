We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In March 1996, a jury sitting in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia found Winfield guilty of, <em>inter alia, </em>conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, murder while engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise and possession with intent to distribute 109.7 grams of marijuana. He was sentenced on July 29, 1996 to life imprisonment with a consecutive five year sentence on the possession charge. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Winfield\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentence, and the Supreme Court denied certiorari. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>139 F.3d 896 (4th Cir. 1998) (table), <em>cert. denied </em>524 U.S. 962, 118 S.Ct. 2389, 141 L.Ed.2d 755 (1998). Win-field thereafter filed a motion to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was denied by the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on March 17, 2000. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals denied Winfield\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and, once again, the Supreme Court denied certiorari. <em>See United States v. Winfield, </em>1 Fed.Appx. 118 (4th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied </em>532 U.S. 1044, 121 S.Ct. 2011, 149 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">On March 21, 2006, Winfield filed the underlying \u00a7 2241 petition in the Middle District of Pennsylvania asserting that the sentencing court erred by imposing a five year sentence for the possession conviction. Winfield further argued that \u00a7 2255 is an inadequate or ineffective means of contesting his sentence because the sentencing judge made a mistake \u201cand therefore cause and prejudice is absent for this claim to be heard on a section 2255 motion.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255 motion at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Winfield\u2019s petition was referred to a Magistrate Judge who issued a Report recommending that it be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction insofar as the challenge presented was clearly within the purview of \u00a7 2255. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation and dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition, ruling that appellant\u2019s claim was essentially a sentencing claim and that he failed to show how a \u00a7 2255 motion was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. For essentially the same reasons set forth by the District Court, we will summarily affirm the order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">As the District Court properly concluded, a \u00a7 2255 motion is the presumptive means for a federal prisoner to challenge the validity of a conviction or sentence, unless such a motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 115. A \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective only when \u201csome limitation of scope or procedure\u201d prevents a movant from receiving an adjudication of his claim. <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). Section 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because a prior motion has been unsuccessful or a petitioner is unable to meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements for filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). <em>Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120-21. <em>See also Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The \u201csafety valve\u201d provided under \u00a7 2255 is extremely narrow and has been held to apply in unusual situations, such as those in which a prisoner has had no prior opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime later deemed to be non-criminal because of an intervening change in the law. See <em>Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120 <em>(citing In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251). Such is not the case here. Winfield makes no allegation that he is actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted. He only asserts that he should have received a lesser sentence. The exception identified in <em>In re Dorsainvil </em>is simply inapplicable, and Winfield may not seek relief under \u00a7 2241. This conclusion is unaffected by the District Court\u2019s statement \u2014 brought about by the erroneous information contained in the \u00a7 2241 petition \u2014 that Win-field had not previously sought relief under \u00a7 2255. Winfield\u2019s recourse at this point is to seek permission from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the sentencing court in the Eastern District of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Because the \u00a7 2241 petition was properly dismissed and no substantial question is presented by this appeal, appellee\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is granted and the District Court\u2019s order of dismissal entered on April 26, 2006 will be affirmed. See Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
