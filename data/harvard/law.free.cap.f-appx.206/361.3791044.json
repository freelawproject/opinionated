Vega-Soto argues that his sentence is unreasonable and greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He does not challenge the calculation of his guidelines sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-22\">A sentence, such as Vega-Soto\u2019s, \u201cwithin a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). We note that the district court considered and rejected Vega-Soto\u2019s arguments for a departure or variance based on the application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to his case. Vega-Soto has failed to demonstrate that his properly calculated guidelines sentence was unreasonable. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554; <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-25\">Vega-Soto also argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 96-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. Vega-Soto\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>darez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Vega-Soto properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
