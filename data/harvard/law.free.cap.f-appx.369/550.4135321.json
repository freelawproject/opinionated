Rohden now moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). To obtain leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Rohden must show that he is a pauper and that he will present a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. <em>See Carson v. Policy, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Rohden\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion challenges his sentencing as a career offender. A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion may not be used to challenge a district court\u2019s application of a career offender enhancement in its calculation of an original sentence. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). To the extent that Rohden is relying on recent amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for cocaine base offenses, we have held that these amendments \u201cdo not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">As Rohden has not shown that he will present a nonfrivolous issue for appeal, his request for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED. <em>See Carson, </em>689 F.2d at 586. Because his appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b574-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
