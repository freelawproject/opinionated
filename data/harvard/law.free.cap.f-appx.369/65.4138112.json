Barrett, Jr., <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal, with preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>dice, of his amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). On appeal, Barrett argues that his wages from a non-federally-connected private sector job are not subject to federal taxation. The government has filed a motion for sanctions, pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">According to his amended complaint, Barrett worked as a project program manager for BAE Systems, a private sector company. BAE Systems reported Barrett\u2019s pay as \u201cwages\u201d to the IRS on a W-2 form each year from 2003 to 2007. Barrett filed a Form 4852 each year disputing BAE Systems\u2019 third party reporting to the IRS through the W-2 forms. Barrett alleges that the plain language of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cI.R.C.\u201d), particularly I.R.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 3401(a), (c) and 3121(a), (b), demonstrates that the definition of \u201cwages\u201d does not apply to private sector jobs that are unconnected to the federal government. Therefore, he asks for a refund of the taxes levied on his earnings from BAE Systems, pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6402(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim <em>de novo, </em>\u201caccepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Glover v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>459 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (citation omitted). It is appropriate to grant a motion to dismiss \u201cwhere it is clear the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claims in the complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cDismissal is therefore permitted when on the basis of a dispositive issue of law, no construction of the factual allegations will support the cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Barrett complains of a tax that is imposed on the \u201ctaxable income\u201d of every individual. I.R.C. \u00a7 l(a)-(d). \u201cTaxable income\u201d is defined as \u201cgross income minus the deductions allowed by this chapter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 63(a). \u201c[Gjross income means all income from whatever source derived, including ... [cjompensation for services....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 61(a)(1). Barrett concedes in his amended complaint that BAE Systems paid him in exchange for his work as a project program manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Instead of relying on these sections, however, Barrett\u2019s argument is grounded in I.R.C. \u00a7 6051, which requires an employer \u201cengaged in a trade or business\u201d to furnish to its employees a written statement that includes \u201cthe total amount of wages as defined in [I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 ] 3401(a) ... [and] 3121(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6051(a), (a)(3)-(4). \u201cWages\u201d are defined in I.R.C. \u00a7 3401(a) as \u201call remuneration ... for services performed by an employee for his employer.\u201d An \u201c \u2018employee\u2019 includes an officer, employee, or elected official of the United States, a State, or any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3401(c); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 3121(b) (stating that \u201cemployment\u201d includes any service performed \u201cwithin the United States\u201d). Barrett argues that these sections demonstrate that Congress intended that \u201cincludes\u201d be read narrowly to cover only federal employees. However, I.R.C. \u00a7 6051 does not impose a tax on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Barrett, and instead spells out the reporting requirements of employers. Therefore, Barrett has not asserted any legal cause of action that would entitle him to relief. Further, Barrett\u2019s argument concerning these sections is without merit. <em>See, e.g., Sullivan v. United States, </em>788 F.2d 813, 815 (1st Cir.1986) (per curiam) (\u201cTo the extent [Appellant] argues that he received no \u2018wages\u2019 ... because he was not an \u2018employee\u2019 within the meaning of [I.R.C.] \u00a7 3401(c), that contention is merit-less .... The statute does not purport to limit withholding to the persons listed therein.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">We have held that the argument that an individual\u2019s income is not subject to federal taxation because his income \u201cwas derived from employment in the private sector\u201d is \u201cutterly without merit\u201d and \u201cfrivolous.\u201d <em>United States v. Morse, </em>532 F.3d 1130, 1132-33 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Therefore, in this case, the district court did not err by dismissing Barrett\u2019s amended complaint for failure to state a claim. Even after accepting Barrett\u2019s factual allegations as true, he has not asserted a legal cause of action. As such, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We have held that individuals who sue for a refund of income taxes and assert \u201cthat their wages are not income subject to tax,\u201d or \u201cthat only public servants are subject to tax liability,\u201d are subject to sanctions for advancing frivolous claims. <em>Motes v. United States, </em>785 F.2d 928, 928 (11th Cir.1986) (per curiam). Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38, \u201c[i]f a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\u201d There is no doubt that Barrett\u2019s claim is frivolous; however, in an exercise of discretion, we deny the government\u2019s motion for sanctions due to Barrett\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status. <em>See Woods v. I.R.S., </em>3 F.3d 403, 404 (11th Cir.1993); <em>Pollinger v. I.R.S. Oversight Bd., </em>362 Fed.Appx. 5, 13-14 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam). However, Barrett is strongly cautioned against bringing further frivolous claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-6\">.
