On appeal, Segura, represented by new counsel, for the first time contends only that trial counsel was ineffective in counseling him prior to his guilty plea. He contends that counsel\u2019s failure to properly explain the factual basis to him resulted in confusion. Segura asserts in a general manner that counsel did not properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>advise him of the factual basis and its consequences at sentencing. No claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was raised below.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Although Segura\u2019s plea agreement contained a waiver-of-appeal provision, Segura retained the right to bring a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, this appeal is not barred by the waiver. However, Segura\u2019s challenge to counsel\u2019s effective assistance will not be reviewed by this court. Generally, this court addresses claims on direct appeal of inadequate representation not raised in the trial court only in rare cases where the record is adequate to allow the court to consider the claim\u2019s merits. <em>United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987); <em>United States v. Aguilar, </em>503 F.3d 431, 436 (5th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the instant case, the record is not sufficiently developed. The district court had no opportunity to hold a hearing. <em>See Aguilar, </em>503 F.3d at 436. Segura failed to place on the record sufficient detail about trial counsel\u2019s conduct and motivations, and discussions with him, to allow this Court to make a fair evaluation of the merits of Segura\u2019s claim. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, this court declines to consider this claim without prejudice to Segura\u2019s right to raise it in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 502-06, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003) (noting that habeas proceedings are the preferred method for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b603-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\">. The government requests that we affirm on the basis of this doctrine. We agree, but make no determination as to whether the claim facially has even arguable merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
