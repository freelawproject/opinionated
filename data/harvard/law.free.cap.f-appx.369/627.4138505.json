Hall contends that, in denying his motion, the district court overstated the seriousness of his offense and the danger he posed to society and failed to consider all the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-17\">The district court <em>may </em>grant a sentence reduction \u00a7 3582(c)(2), but it is not compelled to do so. <em>United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297 (5th Cir.2009). The district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when ruling on a 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 09-8939 (U.S. Jan. 28, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-23\">The record in this case belies Hall\u2019s assertions. In denying Hall\u2019s motion, the district court noted the amount of crack cocaine involved in Hall\u2019s offense, his prior murder conviction, and his other convictions for aggravated robbery and carrying a weapon. The court emphasized the need to keep Hall from committing additional crimes. Given that the district court articulated concerns that \u00a7 3553(a) contemplates, it did not abuse its discretion when it denied Hall\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b651-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
