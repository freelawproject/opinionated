On appeal, Demer argues that: (1) the district court erred in holding her accountable, in determining her offense level at sentencing, for the total loss amount stemming from a coconspirator\u2019s tax liability for the tax years of 1996 to 2003; (2) the district court clearly erred in failing to grant her a minor-role reduction; (3) the district court clearly erred in overruling her objection to a two-level enhancement for encouraging others, besides the co-conspirator, to violate the internal revenue laws or to impede the collection of revenue; and (4) the district court plainly erred in holding her liable for restitution in the amount of the co-conspirator\u2019s tax liability from the tax years of 2001 to 2003. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>We review the sentencing court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts <em>de novo, </em>and the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>419 F.3d 1189, 1192 (11th Cir.2005). We review for clear error a district court\u2019s factual determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), and of a defendant\u2019s intention to encourage others under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2T1.9(b)(2). <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en bane); see also United States v. Sileven, </em>985 F.2d 962, 970 (8th Cir.1993). We review the district court\u2019s order of restitution <em>de novo. United States v. Dickerson, </em>370 F.3d 1330, 1335 (11th Cir.2004). Nevertheless, in this case, we review Demer\u2019s restitution argument on appeal for plain error because she failed to raise the issue below. <em>See United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th Cir.2005). Plain error exists if there was (1) error; (2) that is \u201cclear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute\u201d; (3) that affects defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it would affect the outcome of the trial; and (4) if the first three prongs are satisfied, we have the discretion to remedy the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">First, we are unpersuaded by Demer\u2019s claim that the district court erred in holding her accountable, in determining her offense level at sentencing, for the total loss amount stemming from a co-conspirator\u2019s tax liability for the tax years of 1996 to 2003, because she only entered the conspiracy in January 2002. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.3, relevant conduct that should be taken into account to calculate a defendant\u2019s base offense level includes, among other things, \u201call acts and omissions committed\u201d by the defendant, \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of ... jointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d that \u201coccurred during the commission of the offense of conviction,\u201d and all harm that resulted from or was the object of such acts and omissions. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a). We have held that, according to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3\u2019s commentary, a defendant cannot be held accountable for conduct that occurred before her entry into the joint criminal undertaking, even if she knows of that conduct. <em>United States v. Hunter, </em>323 F.3d 1314, 1320 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">As applied here, the district court did not err in finding that Demer was accountable for the co-conspirator\u2019s tax liability predating her entry into the conspiracy from 1996 to 2000. As the record shows, Demer committed the act of printing five fictitious bonds from her computer in 2003 and mailing them as payment in full to satisfy co-conspirator Jerry Lahr\u2019s tax liability from 1996 to 2000, in the total amount of approximately $800,000. The intended harm of Demer\u2019s act was to fraudulently discharge Lahr\u2019s tax liability from 1996 and 2000, and, in turn, deprive the IRS of approximately $800,000. Thus, the district court properly included Lahr\u2019s tax liability from 1996 to 2000 in the total loss amount attributable to Demer, based on her own conduct of mailing five fictitious bonds to discharge the co-conspirator\u2019s past liability and the financial harm that she intended to cause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>the extent Demer argues for the first time on appeal that she should not be held accountable for the tax liability accrued from the tax year of 2001, the district court did not plainly err because the district court properly held that Demer entered the conspiracy in January 2002, and helped Lahr evade his tax liability for the 2001 tax year. <em>Raad, </em>406 F.3d at 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Next, we find no merit in Demer\u2019s argument that the district court clearly erred in failing to grant her a minor-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, if a defendant was a minor participant in the criminal activity, then the offense level is decreased by two levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A minor participant is a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 comment, (n.5). A defendant who seeks an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2 bears the burden of proving her mitigated role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 939. When determining the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the district court\u2019s consideration is guided by two principles: (1) the court must compare the defendant\u2019s role in the offense with the relevant conduct attributed to her in calculating her offense level; and (2) the court may compare the defendant\u2019s conduct to that of other participants involved in the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 940-945.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">The district court\u2019s determination \u2014 that Demer did not play a minor role in comparison to the relevant conduct for which she was held accountable \u2014 was not clearly erroneous. Indeed, the district court properly evaluated Demer\u2019s role against the relevant conduct that was taken into account to determine her base offense level, by comparing her role against her conduct within the conspiracy and the loss for which she was held accountable. In addition, the district court compared Demer\u2019s conduct to that of Lahr\u2019s, and concluded that each coconspirator shared a \u201ccotermi-nus\u201d role in the conspiracy. Further, the record supports the district court\u2019s findings, as the record shows that Demer: (1) established warehouse bank accounts from shell entities that she had created for Lahr to conceal his true income; (2) at Lahr\u2019s direction, used the bank deposits to purchase assets and pay expenses for him; (3) assisted Lahr with his trust seminars; and (4) printed five fictitious U.S. bonds from her computer to pay for Lahr\u2019s tax liability from 1996 to 2000 in the approximate amount of $ 800,000. Accordingly, since the district court properly compared Dem-er\u2019s role in the conspiracy with the relevant conduct that was attributed to her, the district court did not clearly err in denying her a minor-role adjustment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>We also reject Demer\u2019s claim that the district court clearly erred in overruling her objection to a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2T1.9(b)(2). Section 2T1.9(b)(2) of the U.S. Sentencing Guideline provides a two-level enhancement if the defendant \u201cintended to encourage persons other than or in addition to co-conspirators to violate the internal revenue laws or impede, impair, obstruct, or defeat the ascertainment, computation, assessment, or collection of revenue.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2T1.9(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">The district court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement because Demer did encourage others, in addition to Lahr, to evade taxes and to obstruct the collection of revenue by the IRS. Specifically, the record shows that Demer helped an unknown number of clients evade taxes by opening various warehouse bank accounts based on approximately 30 shell entities that she had created, and she used those accounts to pay for expenses and purchase assets for her clients. Furthermore, Dem-er assisted Lahr with his anti-tax seminars on how to use trusts to evade taxes. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err in finding that the record painted a \u201cclear picture\u201d that Demer actively encouraged, assisted, and helped others to avoid their tax obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Demer\u2019s arguments on appeal against the \u00a7 2Tl.9(b)(2) enhancement are without merit. First, Demer\u2019s factual assertions\u2014 that she merely assisted Lahr with organizing the seminars and distributed UCC documents there, and that she arranged \u201cbookkeeping services\u201d to others \u2014 are contradicted by the record, which shows that Demer was actively involved with Lahr\u2019s trust seminars, and that she allowed the clients to use her warehouse bank accounts to conceal their income from the IRS. Also, as for Demer\u2019s argument that the district court made its findings based solely on her anti-tax beliefs, the district court merely stated that the evidence painted a \u201cclear picture\u201d that, consistent with Dem-er\u2019s \u201cclearly-held belief in that area,\u201d she actively encouraged, assisted, and helped others to avoid tax liabilities. Nor can Demer rely on <em>Sileven. </em>There, the Eighth Circuit upheld the applicability of a \u00a7 2T1.9(b)(2) enhancement where the defendant helped his clients evade taxes through his \u201cactions and words,\u201d by accepting transfers of untaxed cash income and returning the funds in the form of untaxable loan proceeds for a fee. <em>Sile-ven, </em>985 F.2d at 964-65, 970. Similarly, Demer helped her clients evade taxes in a scheme where she created warehouse bank accounts for them to deposit untaxed income and paid their expenses from those accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">Finally, we disagree with Demer that the district court plainly erred in holding her liable for restitution in the amount of the co-conspirator\u2019s tax liability from the tax years of 2001 to 2003. The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act requires a district court to order a defendant to pay restitution where the defendant is convicted of an offense in which an identifiable victim has suffered a pecuniary loss. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(l) and (c)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">As an initial matter, since Demer does not contest the restitution amount assessed for the tax years of 2002 and 2003, she has abandoned any argument as to those claims. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that an issue is abandoned if the defendant fails to proffer argument on its merits on appeal). As for the restitution amount for the tax year of 2001, Dem-er entered the conspiracy in January 2002, and helped Lahr evade his tax liability for the 2001 tax year. Therefore, Demer was not ordered to pay restitution for losses predating her entry into the conspiracy, and the district court did not err, much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>less plainly err. <em>See Raad, </em>406 F.3d at 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">. Moreover, Demer's reliance on <em>United States v. Word, </em>129 F.3d 1209 (11th Cir.1997), is misplaced. In <em>Word, </em>we held that the defendant was not responsible for the total loss amount, according to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, because he joined several months after the inception of the conspiracy. 129 F.3d at 1213. But even though U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.3 forbids holding a defendant responsible for relevant conduct of others that occurred before her entry into the conspiracy, <em>Word </em>is distinguish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>able because the district court here attributed Lahr\u2019s pre-conspiracy tax liability from 1996 to 2000 to Demer based on her <em>own </em>conduct during the conspiracy and the intended financial harm to the IRS. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 comment, (n.2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">. Demer\u2019s arguments to the contrary are without merit. First, it is of no moment that Lahr might have played a more integral role than Demer because <em>De Varon </em>makes clear that, even assuming she was less culpable than him, there are instances where, like here, there are no minor or minimal participants. 175 F.3d at 944. Second, Demer misplaces her reliance on cases standing for the proposition that, if a defendant received a lower offense level because she was convicted of a significantly less serious offense than her actual criminal conduct, a mitigating role reduction would not be appropriate. <em>See United States v. Everett, </em>129 F.3d 1222 (11th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>92 F.3d 1121 (11th Cir.1996). Demer cannot rely on this principle for support because it does not impart that the opposite is true, <em>i.e., </em>that a mitigating role is always appropriate when a defendant is held accountable for the entire loss amount, as here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
