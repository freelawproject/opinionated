Steen pleaded guilty in 2002 to conspiracy to manufacture 50 grams or more of crack cocaine. At that time, the district adopted the calculation of the presentence report assigning Steen a guidelines range of 262 to 327 months of imprisonment and sentenced him to 262 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-22\">Steen argues that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to reduce his sentence to the low end of a recalculated guidelines range of 210 to 262 months based on the crack amendments. The district court found that Steen was \u201celigible for a reduction in sentence\u201d under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) but also found \u201cthat the history and characteristics of the Defendant, the nature of the Defendant\u2019s criminal history and post-sentencing conduct, which includes a post-sentencing conviction for inflicting serious bodily injury on a child, and three disciplinary violations for assaul-tive conduct since the Defendant has been incarcerated, demonstrate a history of violent assaultive conduct.\u201d The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Steen\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b650-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
