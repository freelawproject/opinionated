Specifically, he appeals the district court\u2019s reimposition of a $100 special assessment. Perez-Hernandez argues that the assessment should be stricken from the written judgment because it is contrary to the oral pronouncement and evidence presented at the revo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>cation hearing. He further contends that he is no longer obligated under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013(b) to pay the assessment. The Government concedes that the district court lacked authority to reimpose the special assessment and that it should be stricken from the written judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">A review of the transcript from the revocation hearing reflects that the district court\u2019s imposition of the special assessment is contrary to the oral pronouncement and evidence presented at the hearing. Moreover, as the Government also concedes, the district court lacked authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583 to reimpose a special assessment. <em>See United States v. Pineda, </em>594 F.3d 892, 892-93 (5th Cir.2010). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is REFORMED to omit the $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED AS REFORMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b630-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
