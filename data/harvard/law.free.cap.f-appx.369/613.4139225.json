Petitioner Freddie Mae Hyatt argues that the amount of attorney\u2019s fees she was awarded in a partially successful action against Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, Inc., Ingalls Shipbuilding Division, (\u201cIn-galls\u201d) was too low. Respondent Ingalls seeks affirmance of the existing award.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the substance of her claims before this court, Hyatt\u2019s petition for review of the BRB\u2019s affirmance of the attorney\u2019s fee award comes too late, and we must DISMISS her petition for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">I. Facts &amp; Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b638-14\">Hyatt was employed by Ingalls as a welder. Following a back injury, Hyatt made claims against Ingalls, a self-insured employer, for medical and compensatory benefits. Ingalls denied all of Hyatt\u2019s claims except the cost of ambulance service to the hospital immediately following the back injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-15\">After Ingalls denied her claims, Hyatt filed an administrative claim with the United States Department of Labor, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs pursuant to the LHWCA. Her claim was referred to an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) for resolution. The ALJ entered a decision and order finding that Hyatt suffered a compensable back injury on December 12, 2001 and was temporarily totally disabled from the date of that injury through June 24, 2002. He therefore awarded past medical benefits and temporary disability benefits. The ALJ denied Hyatt\u2019s permanent partial disability claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-16\">Pursuant to the LHWCA\u2019s fee-shifting provisions, Hyatt petitioned the ALJ for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses after receiving this partially favorable determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Hyatt\u2019s attorney requested $16,531.03 in attorney\u2019s fees, paralegal fees, and expenses of litigation. Ingalls objected. The ALJ ultimately awarded only part of what Hyatt requested: $5,575.00 in attorney\u2019s fees, $281.25 in paralegal fees, and $1,161.00 in expenses \u2014 a total of $7,017.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Hyatt moved for reconsideration of the fee award before the ALJ, who denied the motion. Hyatt then appealed the fee award to the Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d), an administrative appeals body within the Department of Labor. The BRB affirmed the award on February 12, 2009. Hyatt purported to seek the BRB\u2019s en banc review of the fee award pursuant to section 21(b)(5) of the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(5).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.407(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">On April 21, 2009, the BRB denied Hyatt\u2019s petition of rehearing en banc on procedural grounds alone. Section 802.407(b) of the BRB\u2019s rules of practice and procedure provides that every petition for rehearing en banc \u201cmust accompany a motion for reconsideration directed to the panel which rendered the decision.\u201d Hyatt did not file a motion for reconsideration addressed to the BRB panel \u2014 and, indeed, offered no reason for rehearing en banc. The April denial order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">We deny claimant\u2019s motion, as it is merely a request for <em>en banc </em>review, which is not accompanied by a motion for panel reconsideration. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.407(b). Moreover, claimant has not stated any rationale for [her] motion for reconsideration nor alleged any specific error in the Board\u2019s decision. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.408(a). The Board\u2019s decision is affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">Following this order, Hyatt petitioned this court for review pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c) by notice filed June 22, 2009.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">II. Scope of Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">We first address the scope of our jurisdiction to review the orders that are the subject of Hyatt\u2019s petition to this court. Ingalls has not challenged our jurisdiction to do so, but \u201c[w]e must raise the issue of our appellate jurisdiction <em>sua sponte, </em>if necessary.\u201d <em>Said v. Gonzales, </em>488 F.3d 668, 670-71 (5th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., </em>526 U.S. 574, 583, 119 S.Ct. 1563, 143 L.Ed.2d 760 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-14\">Our jurisdiction to review an order of the BRB\u2019s is limited by the statute authorizing petition to the courts of appeals. <em>Gulf Best Elec., Inc. v. Methe, </em>396 F.3d 601, 603-04 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cThis court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear a petition for review from an LHWCA administrative decision is derived solely from the appeal provision contained in 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c).\u201d). Under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c), \u201c[a]ny person adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order of the [BRB] may obtain a review of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>order in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the injury occurred, by filing in such court within sixty days following the issuance of such [BRB] order a written petition praying that the order be modified or set aside.\u201d Hyatt\u2019s petition expressly seeks this court\u2019s review of the BRB\u2019s order dated April 21, 2009 \u2014 that is, the non-merits denial of her petition for rehearing en banc for failure to comply with the BRB\u2019s filing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">While our jurisprudence permits review of the underlying final judgment when a party erroneously seeks review of a denial of reconsideration, <em>see Trust Co. Bank v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>950 F.2d 1144, 1147-48 (5th Cir.1992) (interpreting Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c)); <em>Castillo-Rodriguez v. INS, </em>929 F.2d 181, 183-84 (5th Cir.1991) (holding that Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 15(a), governing petitions for review, should be interpreted the same as Rule 3(c), governing notices of appeal), that rule cannot enlarge the scope of our jurisdiction beyond the express time limitations imposed by the statute creating our jurisdiction. Section 921(c) required Hyatt to file her petition with this court \u201cwithin sixty days following the issuance of\u2019 the BRB\u2019s order. Hyatt filed her petition exactly sixty days after the BRB denied her \u201cpetition for review\u201d for rehearing en banc \u2014 but well in excess of that time limit as to the BRB\u2019s February 12, 2009 order on the merits of her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The BRB\u2019s rules of practice provide that an order is final after sixty days \u201cunless a timely request for reconsideration by the Board has been filed as provided under \u00a7 802.407,\u201d in which case \u201cthe 60-day period for filing such petition for review will run from the issuance of the [BRB]\u2019s decision on reconsideration.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.406. Section 802.407 requires that a motion for reconsideration en banc must be accompanied by a motion for reconsideration directed to the' panel. Thus, Hyatt\u2019s filing did not comply with this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Therefore, even liberally construing Hyatt\u2019s petition as seeking our review of the underlying merits determination of the BRB, we conclude that we nevertheless have no jurisdiction to do so. <em>See, e.g., Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2363-64, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (explaining that statutory time limits on seeking review are \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Accordingly, the petition is DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b638-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-11\">. The Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, United States Department of Labor, the nominal respondent in this matter, de-dined to participate in briefing but is aligned with the claimant-petitioner. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 15.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b638-18\">. Hyatt separately petitioned the Office of the District Director for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses incurred before the Office of the District Director pursuant to the LHWCA\u2019s pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>cedures. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.132(a) (\u201cAny person seeking a fee for services performed on behalf of a claimant with respect to claims filed under the Act shall make application therefor to the district director, administrative law judge, Board, or court, as the case may be, before whom the services were performed.\u201d). That fee petition is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b639-8\">. Hyatt's document was entitled \u201cPetition for Review\u201d and stated, in its entirety: \u201cComes now, the claimant Freddie Hyatt, by and through her undersigned counsel, and files this, her petition for the entire permanent Benefits Review Board to review the panel decision rendered in the above styled and numbered cause dated February 12, 2009. This petition is being filed pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(5) (as amended). The claimant requests review of the Board's decision to affirm the Supplemental Decision and Order Awarding Fees of the Administrative Law Judges who heard the claim.\" \u00a7 921(b)(5) authorizes en banc review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b639-16\">. The petition for the April 21 order was due June 20, which was a Saturday, making the Monday, June 22 filing timely to appeal the April 21 order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
