Veal pleaded guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base (\u201ccrack cocaine\u201d) (Count Three) and two counts of carrying and use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime (Counts Five and Ten). The district court sentenced him to consecutive terms of 360 months of imprisonment on Count Three, 60 months on Count Five, and 240 months on Count Ten, for a total of 660 months. Pursuant to the government\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 motion, the court subsequently reduced the sentence by 50 percent, resulting in an amended sentence of 180 months on Count Three, 30 months on Count Five, and 120 months on Count Ten, for a total of 330 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">The court denied Veal\u2019s motion for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction, noting that \u201c[t]he previous term of imprisonment imposed was less than the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing as a result of a departure or Rule 35 reduction, and the reduced sentence [was] comparably less than the amended guideline range.\u201d The court also observed that the \u201c[responses and objections by all parties [had] been received, reviewed, and considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">Veal contends that the court committed procedural error and abused its discretion when it denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Specifically, he argues that although the sentence is less than the amended guideline range, it is not \u2014 contrary to the district court\u2019s conclusion \u2014 \u201ccomparably less\u201d than 292 months. Veal also urges that the court committed significant procedural errors by neither referencing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors nor providing any explanation for the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-16\">Section 3582(c)(2) allows discretionary modification of certain sentences if the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). In such cases, the district court may reduce the sentence after considering the applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the applicable guidelines policy statements. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Although \u00a7 3582(c)(2) directs the court to consider the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), the \u201cbifurcated procedural-soundness, substantive-reasonableness\u201d review derived from <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny does not apply in proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). Thus, a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and its interpretation of the guidelines <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Veal has not shown that the court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. \u201cEven though the district court <em>may </em>grant a comparable sentence reduction, ... it is not compelled to do so.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297 (5th Cir.2009). Further, the court need not provide reasons for its denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion or explain its application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The probation officer\u2019s recalculation report correctly provided that Veal was subject to an amended guidelines range of 292-365 months on Count Three. Because of the rule 35 motion, the 180-month sentence is lower than both the original and amended guidelines ranges. The box selected by the district court on the preprint-ed form sets out significant background information pertaining to the previously-imposed sentence, namely, that it was less than the applicable guidelines range because of a rule 35 reduction. Although the court\u2019s selection adds that \u201cthe reduced sentence [was] comparably less than the amended guidelines range,\u201d the record reflects that the court implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and concluded that no further reduction was warranted. The court was not required to provide any further explanation for denying Veal\u2019s motion. <em>See Cooley, </em>590 F.3d at 298. Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b615-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
