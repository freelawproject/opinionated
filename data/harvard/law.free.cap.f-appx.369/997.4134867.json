No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). The district court issued a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issue: \u201cwhether a state-court motion for discretionary sentence reduction is an \u2018application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim\u2019 within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2).\u201d On appeal, Baker argues that instead of applying <em>Alexander v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>523 F.3d 1291 (11th Cir.2008), which held that a Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.800(c) (\u201cRule 3.800(c)\u201d) motion is not a tolling motion, we should apply the contrary holding from <em>Robinson v. Golder, </em>443 F.3d 718, 720-21 (10th Cir.2006), in which the Tenth Circuit held that a motion for a sentence reduction was a tolling mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>tion. He also argues that the holding in <em>Alexander </em>is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a habeas petition is time-barred.\u201d <em>Cramer v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>461 F.3d 1380, 1383 (11th Cir.2006). Because Baker is proceeding <em>pro se, </em>his argument is \u201centitled to liberal construction.\u201d <em>See Mederos v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1252, 1254 (11th Cir.2000). However, appellate review is limited by the scope of the COA. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Section 2254 petitions are subject to a one-year statute of limitations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). This limitations period runs from the latest of one of four events, including the date on which the judgment became final. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). To qualify as an \u201capplication for State post-conviction or other collateral review,\u201d a pleading must actually seek \u201creview\u201d by making a good faith request for legal relief from the court. <em>Sibley v. Culliver, 377 </em>F.3d 1196, 1200-01 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Rule 3.800(c) states that \u201c[a] court may reduce or modify ... a legal sentence imposed by it.\u201d Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.800(c). \u201cWhile Rule 3.800(c) does not enumerate any basis for which a petitioner may seek to reduce or modify his sentence, it presupposes that the sentence the court is being asked to reduce or modify is \u2018a legal sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alexander, </em>523 F.3d at 1295. A panel of this Court has previously held that a Rule 3.800(c) motion is not a tolling motion under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 1297-98. In this Circuit, a panel is bound by a prior panel decision even if it is convinced that the prior decision is wrong. <em>United States v. Steele, </em>147 F.3d 1316, 1317-18 (11th Cir.1998) <em>(en </em>banc). We must follow that prior panel decision until such time as it is overruled by either this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>or the U.S. Supreme Court. <em>Cargill v. Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1386 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">In <em>Alexander, </em>the panel noted that a Rule 3.800(c) motion \u201cassumes that the sentence sought to be modified or reduced is legal and functions effectively as a procedure for a petitioner to request leniency from the sentencing court based on mitigating circumstances.\u201d 523 F.3d at 1295. A tolling motion must contain some form of legal analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 1297. Therefore, relying on other circuit\u2019s language, we conclude that a Rule 3.800(c) motion that was only a plea for leniency, but not an attack on the constitutionality or legal correctness of a sentence, was not a tolling motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1297-99. We later clarified that a state court motion is not a tolling motion unless it attacks the legality of the underlying sentence or conviction. <em>Davis v. Barrow, </em>540 F.3d 1323, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Here, Baker is only arguing that the Tenth Circuit\u2019s contrary holding in <em>Robinson </em>is a better rule than the one we adopted in <em>Alexander. </em>However, because <em>Alexanders </em>holding is directly on point, this Court is bound to apply <em>Alexander. See Cargill, </em>120 F.3d at 1386. Therefore, Baker\u2019s Rule 3.800(c) motions were not tolling motions under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). <em>See Alexander, </em>523 F.3d at 1297-99. Furthermore, we reject Baker\u2019s argument that the <em>Alexander </em>holding is unconstitutional. Accordingly, after review of the parties\u2019 briefs and consideration of the record, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
