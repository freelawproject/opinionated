Dr. Gregory Horn reported the test results to the Harrison County Department of Human Services, which removed the child from Stewart\u2019s custody. Four days later, Youth Court Judge Michael H. Ward conducted a shelter hearing and found that removal was in the best interest of the child. Accordingly, he ordered the Department of Human Services to take temporary custody of Brendon and to secure appropriate placement for him. The Department of Human Services subsequently placed Brendon with Stewart\u2019s mother, where he has remained since. Stewart\u2019s complaint alleged that these actions violated her due process rights. The district court dismissed Stewart\u2019s complaints against some defendants pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on the remainder of the claims. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">\u2018We review a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal de novo, accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and reviewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The Fourteenth Amendment protects parents\u2019s liberty interest \u201cin the care, custody and control of their children.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Government officials may neither permanently terminate parental rights,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> nor temporarily remove children from their parents,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> without affording the parents due process of law. Government officials may, however, seize a child from his parents without a court order if exigent circumstances exist.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-15\">Stewart argues that the removal of her child from her custody violated her due process rights. Her argument is without merit. The record fully supports the district court\u2019s finding that exigent circumstances existed to justify the Department of Human Services\u2019s initial seizure of her child. After the initial seizure, Stewart was granted a hearing before a judge, who found that removal was in the best interest of the child. Stewart points to no evidence to support her assertion that the government\u2019s actions were based on lies or malicious intent. Therefore, the district court correctly found that the defendants\u2019 actions did not violate Stewart\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-16\">Stewart also argues on appeal that she was denied access to her medical records in violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. This issue is raised for the first time on appeal, and thus we will not entertain it here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ak7\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b618-17\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b617-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
