Although the court determined that Chatman was subject to an amended-guidelines range of 120 to 135 months, the court only reduced his sentence from 144 to 140 months\u2019 imprisonment. In doing so, the court indicated incorrectly that the reduced sentence was within the amended-guidelines range and indicated that the amount of the reduction was directly affected by Chatman\u2019s \u201cpoor post-incarceration record\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">A district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion; its interpretation of the Guidelines, <em>de novo. United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). Chatman claims the district court abused its discretion when it reduced his sentence to a term of imprisonment that constituted an upward deviation from the amended-guidelines range, while erroneously concluding that the reduced sentence was within the amended range. He maintains the sentence reduction was based solely on his post-incarceration record, without reference to any of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and without taking into account his administrative punishment for his disciplinary infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">District courts are under no obligation to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). In exercising its discretion to grant Chatman\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, however, the district court, as noted, checked a box on the pre-printed order indicating that the sentence imposed was within the amended-guidelines range. If the district court intended to depart from the amended-guidelines range, it should have indicated it was doing so by checking the box labeled \u201cOther\u201d. <em>See United States v. Franklin, </em>356 Fed.Appx. 778, 780 (5th Cir.2009) (unpublished). Instead, the district court erroneously indicated that Chatman\u2019s reduced sentence was \u201cwithin the amended guideline range\u201d, when it plainly was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b614-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
