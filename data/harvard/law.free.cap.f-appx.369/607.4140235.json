Harris argues that: (1) the district court failed to consider all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and imposed an unreasonable sentence; and (2) the district court did not adequately account for the victim\u2019s conduct and grant the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.10 downward departure. Because the district court was not under the mistaken impression that it could not depart, this court is without jurisdiction to consider Harris\u2019s argument that the district court erred in denying him a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006). However, we will view his arguments on appeal in support of his downward departure as asserting that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court \u201cfailed adequately to consider factors counseling in favor of a downward departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir.2007). Given that Harris does not allege procedural error, we need only consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of [his] sentence.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Harris raises on appeal a number of factors supporting his argument that the imposed sentence should have been lower. However, all of those factors were raised before the district court, which explicitly considered all of the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors before imposing sentence. Harris has failed to overcome the presumption of reasonableness afforded to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b631-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
