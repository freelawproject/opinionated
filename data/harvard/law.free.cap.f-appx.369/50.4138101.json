Graves argues that the government failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that he possessed the firearm in furtherance of his drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">We review <em>ele novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of judgment of acquittal on sufficiency of evidence grounds, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>565 F.3d 1324, 1333 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1032, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2009). We will uphold a conviction \u201cunless the jury could not have found the defendant guilty under any reasonable construction of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The evidence need not exclude \u201cevery reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1333-34 (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, the credibility of the government\u2019s witnesses is exclusively determined by the jury, and we will not revisit that issue. <em>Id. </em>at 1334.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-15\">To prove a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), the government must show that a defendant used or carried a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime, or possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). \u201cThe \u2018in furtherance\u2019 element requires proof that \u2018the firearm helped, furthered, promoted, or advanced the drug trafficking.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Woodard, </em>531 F.3d 1352, 1362 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1252 (11th Cir.2002)). Thus, to show that a gun was possessed \u201cin furtherance\u201d of a drug trafficking crime, the government is required to establish \u201csome nexus between the gun and the drug selling operation.\u201d <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1253 (11th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). We consider several factors when determining whether a defendant possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, including: the type of drug activity, accessibility of the firearm, the type of weapon, whether the weapon was stolen, the legality of firearm possession, whether the gun is loaded, proximity to the drugs, and the time and circumstances under which the gun is found. <em>Woodard, </em>531 F.3d at 1362; <em>Timmons, </em>283 F.3d at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-16\">Given the ease with which Graves could reach the loaded gun and its proximity to the drugs, we conclude that a jury could reasonably find a sufficient nexus between the gun and the drug trafficking crime to find Graves guilty of a violation of \u00a7 924(c). Accordingly, we affirm Graves\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
