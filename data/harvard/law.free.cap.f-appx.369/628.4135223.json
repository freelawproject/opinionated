He contends that the district court\u2019s order on remand failed to sufficiently clarify that his revocation sentence is to run consecutively only to any sentences that were imposed on him prior to the date of the original judgment of revocation, October 16, 2008, and not to any sentence imposed subsequently. We affirm the district court as we find the written judgment, as amended, sufficiently clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">\u201cCriminal sentences must reveal with fair certainty the intent of the court to exclude any serious misapprehensions by those who must execute them. Therefore, unclear or ambiguous sentences must be vacated and remanded for clarification in the interest of judicial economy and fairness to all concerned parties.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">At Eckstein\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court orally pronounced that Eck-stein\u2019s thirty-six month sentence was \u201cto be consecutive to any sentence that you\u2019re serving under the state or any other system.\u201d However, the district court\u2019s original written judgment of revocation, dated October 16, 2008, stated that Eckstein\u2019s thirty-six month sentence was \u201cto be served consecutive to any sentence imposed by any other court.\u201d Eckstein appealed from the original -written judgment, contending that it failed to conform to the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of the sentence. The government agreed and moved, unopposed, for a limited remand to allow the district court to conform its written judgment to its orally pronounced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">On remand, the district court issued a nunc pro tunc order on May 11, 2009, clarifying the sentence. The district court stated that it was amending the relevant portion of its October 16, 2008 written judgment to \u201cconform exactly to [its] oral pronouncement of sentence.\u201d It amended the relevant portion of its written judgment to state that Eckstein\u2019s revocation sentence was \u201cto be served consecutive to any sentence that he is serving under the state or any other system.\u201d Eckstein now appeals from the district court\u2019s clarification order and his appeals have been consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">Eckstein argues that remand for further clarification is necessary because the district court\u2019s written judgment, as amended by the May 11, 2009 order, could be misinterpreted to mean that Eckstein\u2019s revocation sentence is to run consecutively to a sentence imposed after the imposition of his revocation sentence. His argument is unavailing. The May 11, 2009 order explains that it is amending the October 16, 2008 written judgment. As such, the amendment was to be effective October 16, 2008. Given that the written judgment, as amended by the May 11, 2009 order, speaks in the present tense regarding the sentences to which Eckstein\u2019s revocation sentence will be consecutive, is dated October 16, 2008, and explicitly indicates that the date of the imposition of the revocation sentence was October 16, 2008, it is apparent the term \u201che is serving\u201d refers to any sentence being served by Eckstein as of October 16, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">Moreover, when the district court\u2019s amended sentence is read in context with the explanation provided in the body of its May 11, 2009 order, the alternative interpretations proposed by Eckstein lack plausibility. The district court explained in the May 11, 2009 order the meaning of the oral sentence, stating \u201c[t]he oral sentence was that defendant be committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons to serve a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>term of imprisonment of thirty-six months \u2018consecutive to any sentence that [he was] serving under the state or any other system.\u2019\u201d (alteration in original). The district court\u2019s alteration of \u201cyou\u2019re serving\u201d to \u201c[he was] serving\u201d makes clear that it was amending its written judgment, in conformity with its oral pronouncement, to indicate that Eckstein\u2019s revocation sentence is to be served consecutively to any sentence he was serving as of the date of the oral pronouncement \u2014 October 16, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Because the district court\u2019s written judgment, as amended by its May 11, 2009 order, is not unclear or ambiguous, remand is not necessary. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b652-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
