He contends that the affidavit in support of the search warrant failed to establish a connection between his apartment and any criminal activity and omitted material information.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">\u201cIn reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we review the findings of fact for clear error and the application of law to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Lee, </em>586 F.3d 859, 864 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). We construe all facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party \u2014 in this case, the government. <em>See United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 967 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">To be valid, a search warrant must be supported by probable cause. U.S. Const, amend. IV. The affidavit underlying the search warrant must \u201cstate facts sufficient to justify a conclusion that evidence or contraband will probably be found at the premises to be searched.\u201d <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>297 F.3d 1308, 1314 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cSpecifically, the affidavit should establish a connection between the defendant and the residence to be searched and a link between the residence and any criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-15\">The search warrant affidavit stated that on March 9, 2006 police responded to a call that shots were fired in the area of Propst\u2019s apartment. The responding officer talked to Propst who stated that he had been shot in the left hand. He told the officer that after being shot he retrieved a gun from his apartment and fired several times at the person who shot him. The responding officer observed a trail of blood leading from the street to the door of Propst\u2019s apartment, corroborating his story. Although Propst contends otherwise, those factual allegations were sufficient to establish a connection between Propst\u2019s apartment and criminal activity. Propst\u2019s argument that the affidavit omitted material information because it did not state that the police had recovered a gun from his brother\u2019s car is without merit. That \u201comission\u201d does not undermine the district court\u2019s finding that probable cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>existed to search his apartment. <em>See United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1309 (11th Cir.2009) (stating that \u201ceven intentional or reckless omissions will invalidate a warrant only if inclusion of the omitted facts would have prevented a finding of probable cause\u201d) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Even if Propst used the gun recovered from his brother\u2019s car to return fire at the person who shot him, additional evidence of the shooting reasonably could have been found in his apartment. The district court properly denied his suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Propst also contends that the district court erred in failing to suppress evidence seized from his apartment on October 19, 2007. A bail bondsman entered Propst\u2019s apartment on October 19 to apprehend him \u2014 after a security guard employed by his apartment complex opened his apartment door. While in the apartment looking for Propst, the bail bondsman saw weapons, drug paraphernalia, and what he believed to be heroin. The bail bondsmen contacted law enforcement and, based on that information, they obtained a warrant to search Propst\u2019s apartment. Propst argues that the bail bondsman was a state actor because the security guard who opened his apartment door was allegedly an off-duty sheriff. Because the bail bondsman did not have a warrant, Propst contends that his entry of the apartment was illegal and thus all evidence recovered as a result of his entry should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u201cA search by a private person does not implicate the Fourth Amendment unless he acts as an instrument or agent of the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Steiger, </em>318 F.3d 1039, 1045 (11th Cir.2003). To determine whether a private person was acting as an instrument or agent of the government, we consider two factors. Those factors are: \u201c(1) whether the government knew of and acquiesced in the intrusive conduct, and (2) whether the private actor\u2019s purpose was to assist law enforcement efforts rather than to further his own ends.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Ford, </em>765 F.2d 1088, 1090 (11th Cir.1985) (holding that the district court properly denied motion to suppress where there was no evidence that the government \u201chad any pre-knowledge of the search [or] that the agents openly encouraged or cooperated in the search\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">The district court properly denied Propst\u2019s suppression motion because the bail bondsman was acting as a private individual when he entered Propst\u2019s apartment. The bail bondsman\u2019s purpose in entering the apartment was to apprehend Propst \u2014 not to assist law enforcement. Even if the security guard who opened the door for the bail bondsman was an off-duty sheriff, he was acting in his capacity as a security guard \u2014 not in his capacity as a sheriff \u2014 at the time he opened the door. Because all the parties involved in the entry were acting as private individuals, Propst\u2019s suppression motion was properly denied. <em>See Steiger, </em>318 F.3d at 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">Propst also contends that the district court erred in failing to suppress statements he made during custodial interviews on October 19 and 22, 2007. He argues that he invoked his right to counsel during the October 19 interview, but the interrogating officers ignored his request and continued questioning him. Propst asserts that his subsequent statements, including statements he made during a separate interview on October 22, should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>\u201cWhen a suspect undergoing a custodial interrogation asserts his right to counsel, the interrogation must cease.\u201d <em>Mincey v. Head, </em>206 F.3d 1106, 1131-32 (11th Cir.2000). The suspect\u2019s request for counsel must be unambiguous and unequivocal. <em>See United States v. Acosta, </em>363 F.3d 1141, 1152-53 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 461-62, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 2356, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994) (\u201cIf the suspect\u2019s statement is not an unambiguous or unequivocal request for counsel, the officers have no obligation to stop questioning him.\u201d); <em>Acosta, </em>363 F.3d at 1152 (\u201cIf the statement is ambiguous or equivocal, then the police have no duty to clarify the suspect\u2019s intent, and they may proceed with the interrogation.\u201d). The suspect \u201cmust articulate his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. at 2355. If the suspect\u2019s request is subject to \u201ctwo reasonable, competing interpretations,\u201d it is ambiguous, and the interrogation may continue. <em>See Acosta, </em>363 F.3d at 1155.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">During the October 19 interview after signing a written waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and agreeing to answer the officers\u2019 questions, Propst asked the officers whether they could make a deal with him in exchange for his cooperation and inquired about the sentence he would receive if convicted of the charged offenses. In response, one of the officers stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">I don\u2019t know offhand.... I am not a judge.... I am not making you any promises. I am not making you any guarantees that I can get you out of something. Cause that is not something that is going to happen. I do not have any control over that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Propst responded \u201cI mean, I\u2019d rather have a lawyer around to talk or, you know what I am saying, have some papers saying something, you know.\u201d After one of the officers explained that written deals for cooperation were only available on television, Propst continued answering the officers\u2019 questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">After a careful review of the record, we conclude that Propst\u2019s request for counsel during the October 19 interview was ambiguous and thus the interrogating officers were not required to cease questioning. Propst made a reference to a lawyer after asking the officers whether they could make a deal with him. He qualified his reference to a lawyer by saying: \u201cyou know what I am saying, have some papers saying something.\u201d Under the circumstances, a reasonable officer could have concluded that Propst was not requesting to have a lawyer present during the interview but rather was requesting a written deal in exchange for his cooperation. The district court did not err in denying Propst\u2019s motion to suppress his October 19 statements. Because Propst waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and never invoked his right to counsel during the October 22 interview, the district court also properly admitted those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">Propst contends that the government improperly commented on his right to remain silent during closing arguments. He takes issue with the prosecutor\u2019s comment that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-11\">If [Propst] were truly an innocent victim on March 9, 2006, why wouldn\u2019t he cooperate more? Why wouldn\u2019t he have done everything in his capacity to help the police find Memphis, give them a last name, give them about this girl who was driving the car allegedly who may have been a girl friend depending on the story that he is telling the police?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>He also takes issue with the prosecutor\u2019s comment that \u201che asked, well, what do you want \u2014 he asked for some paper. He wanted some sort of deal and wouldn\u2019t even tell them anything unless he protected himself. Again, always protecting himself and his business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Because Propst did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments until he filed his motion for a new trial, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Newton, </em>44 F.3d 913, 920-21 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cFor there to be plain error, there must (1) be error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects the substantial rights of the party, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of a judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Foley, </em>508 F.3d 627, 637 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\u201cWe subject allegations of prosecutorial misconduct to a \u2018two-part test.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 997 (11th Cir.2008). We determine \u201c(1) whether the challenged comments were improper and (2) if so, whether they prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). After a defendant has been arrested and advised of his right to remain silent, there is an implicit assurance that his \u201csilence will carry no penalty.\u201d <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 618, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 2245, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). However, \u201ca defendant who voluntarily speaks after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings has not been induced to remain silent,\u201d and the prosecution may comment on those statements to challenge a legal theory asserted by the defendant or to highlight material omissions in the statements. <em>United States v. Dodd, </em>111 F.3d 867, 869-70 (11th Cir.1997). The prosecution may also comment on a defendant\u2019s silence if it occurred prior to the time that the defendant was arrested and given a <em>Miranda </em>warning. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>944 F.2d 1563, 1568 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Neither of the prosecutor\u2019s comments challenged by Propst were improper. The prosecutor\u2019s statement regarding his lack of cooperation on March 9, 2006 was not improper because it related to Propst\u2019s behavior before being arrested and advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See Rivera, </em>944 F.2d at 1568. The prosecutor\u2019s statement regarding Propst\u2019s request for a deal during his October 19, 2007 custodial interview also was not improper. Propst did not invoke his right to remain silent during that interview, and the prosecutor\u2019s comment challenged Propst\u2019s assertion during closing that he was only a drug user \u2014 not a drug dealer. <em>See Dodd, </em>111 F.3d at 869-70. We conclude that no error occurred, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">Finally, Propst contends that the district court erred in concluding that it was required under \u00a7 924(c)(1) to impose mandatory consecutive sentences for each of his firearm convictions. He argues that his second firearm conviction in Count 7 required a mandatory minimum 25-year sentence under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(i), and therefore the district court erred in imposing an additional 5-year consecutive sentence under \u00a7 924(e)(l)(A)(i) for the firearm conviction in Count 5. He asserts that under the \u201cexcept\u201d clause in \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) the district court should have only sentenced him to 25 years imprisonment for both firearm convictions. We rejected this argument in <em>United States v. Tate, </em>586 F.3d 936 (11th Cir.2009). <em>See id. </em>at 947 (holding that district court did not err in sentencing the defendant to consecutive terms of imprisonment for his three firearm convictions). As in <em>Tate, </em>the district court did not err in imposing the mandatory minimum sentence for each of Propst\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>firearm convictions and running them consecutive to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
