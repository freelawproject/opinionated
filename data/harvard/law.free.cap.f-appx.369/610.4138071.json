Bell appeals the district court\u2019s denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Although the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence ordinarily is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, a court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). Because the district court\u2019s denial of Bell\u2019s motion was based on its determination that it could not reduce Bell\u2019s sentence due to his career offender status under the Guidelines, review is de novo. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582 are thus \u201cgoverned\u201d by the policy statements of the Guidelines. <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Bell\u2019s guideline range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, but rather from his career offender status. The district court was thus correct in concluding that a reduction was not permitted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Bell\u2019s argument that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582 in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is unavailing because \u201cthe concerns at issue in <em>Booker </em>do not apply in a[] \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.\u201d <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238. Although the Guidelines must be treated as advisory in an original sentencing proceeding, <em>Booker </em>does not prevent Congress from incorporating a Guideline provision \u201cas a means of defining and limiting a district court\u2019s authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239, 125 S.Ct. 738 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">The district court also did not err in declining to reopen Bell\u2019s original 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6) to allow him to litigate his claim that he was improperly sentenced as a career offender. A Rule 60(b) motion filed in a collateral proceeding should be construed as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, even where the motion seeks to raise a claim based on a change in the law. <em>See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 531-32, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005) (\u00a7 2254 case); <em>see also United States v. Rich, </em>141 F.3d 550, 551-53 (5th Cir.1998) (noting that federal prisoner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion, which raised for the first time a theory of relief based on the assertion that a Supreme Court decision changed the law, should be construed as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b634-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
