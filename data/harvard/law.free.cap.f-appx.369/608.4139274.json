He complains that the district court improperly considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) in imposing his sentences. Rodriguez argues that the district court was precluded from considering the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors because they are not among those that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) directs courts to weigh in fashioning a revocation sentence. He does not allege, and the record does not reflect, that the district court, in imposing his revocation sentence, made any specific reference to \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) or that the district court discussed any of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). His argument instead rests on a statement in the district court\u2019s written judgment of revocation and sentence that the court had considered all factors set forth in \u00a7 -3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-20\">We have not yet addressed whether a district court may consider the factors in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) when imposing a revocation sentence. However, we need not reach the issue in the instant case. When sentencing Rodriguez, the district court noted that it had imposed what it believed \u201cto be a reasonable sentence that adequately and appropriately address[ed] all of the factors the Court is to consider under \u00a7 3553(a) of Title 18.\u201d By limiting its consideration to only those factors it is to consider under \u00a7 3553(a), the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>court indicated that it was not considering the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. The district court\u2019s oral pronouncement at sentencing controls to the extent it conflicts with the court\u2019s written judgment. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>250 F.3d 941, 942 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, Rodriguez has not shown error. Rodriguez\u2019s argument fails to establish that his revocation sentence is unreasonable or plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 119-20 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b632-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
