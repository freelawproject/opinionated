Gaedtke, through counsel, seeks review of the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas corpus petition, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, in which he raised, <em>inter alia, </em>an ineffective assistance of counsel claim arising out of his attorney\u2019s failure to perform an adequate investigation before advising Gaedtke to plead no contest to child molestation. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Gaedtke was charged in 2004 with lewd and lascivious molestation of a person under the age of twelve (his granddaughter), in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 800.04. Exh. Folder 9, Exh. E. The charge carried with it a maximum prison sentence of thirty years. <em>Id., </em>Exh. A at 4. After spending thirty-four days in county jail without seeing a lawyer, Gaedtke was brought before a judge during an <em>en masse </em>arraignment. Rl-1 at 7; Exh. Folder 16, Exh. G.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">At the arraignment, the presiding judge informed the defendants that any plea offer they received that day would be the best offer they would ever receive, and that the offer would only be good for the day. Exh. Folder 16, Exh. G at 4-5. The judge also advised Gaedtke that he had to the right to plead not guilty and to a trial by jury and that if he pleaded no contest, \u201cthe only thing that will be left to do is to sentence [him].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. The state offered a plea of fifteen-years of imprisonment. Exh. Folder 9, Exh. A at 3-4; Exh. Folder 16, Exh. F. The judge informed Gaedtke that the charge against him carried a maximum penalty of thirty years in prison and that if he had any prior qualifying convictions he could be declared a sexual predator and may be subject to commitment under Florida\u2019s Jimmy Ryce Civil Commitment Act. Exh. Folder 9, Exh. A at 4. Gaedtke told the court that he understood he was forfeiting the right to trial by entering into the plea agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 6. He denied any threats or coercion regarding his plea, confirmed that he had discussed his case with appointed counsel, and stated that he was satisfied with his representation. <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. Following the state\u2019s proffer, Gaedtke pleaded no contest and was sentenced to a term of fifteen years of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 7; Exh. Folder 9, Exh. E at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-12\">In April 2005, Gaedtke filed a motion for post-conviction relief in state court, pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850. Exh. Folder 9, Exh. B. Gaedtke argued in his motion that his plea was not knowing and voluntary and that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to perform an investigation prior to advising him to plead no contest. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 9-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-13\">The state trial court rejected Gaedtke\u2019s arguments regarding the knowingness and voluntariness of his plea, finding that they were \u201cclearly refuted\u201d by the transcript of his plea hearing. Exh. Folder 9, Exh. C at 3. As to his ineffective-assistance-of-eoun-sel claim, the trial court found that while Gaedtke</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-14\">assert[ed] that his attorney performed no research on his case, conducted no investigation, and urged him to plead guiltyt,] [he] ... does not indicate how these supposed deficiencies affected the outcome of his case, and does not allege that he was prejudiced in any way by his attorney\u2019s actions. Since the Defendant has failed the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland [v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)], there is no need to determine whether his attorney\u2019s conduct was actually deficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><em>Id. </em>The state appellate court denied Gaedtke\u2019s appeal without opinion as well as his subsequent motions for rehearing and rehearing <em>en banc. See Gaedtke v. State, </em>908 So.2d 1080 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2005); Exh. Folder 9, Exh. D.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">On 17 October 2005, Gaedtke filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus, in which he raised the same arguments that he raised in the state post-conviction proceedings. <em>See </em>Rl-1 at 4, 6-9. In support of his petition, Gaedtke filed a memorandum stating that he would have pled not guilty at his arraignment had his counsel investigated his case and informed him that a plea of \u201cno contest\u201d was tantamount to a guilty plea and would result in no trial and immediate sentencing. Rl-8 at 9-12. The state argued in response that Gaedtke\u2019s counsel was not ineffective because Gaedtke was able to secure a plea agreement that halved the term of imprisonment Gaedtke faced under the charges. Rl-9 at 6-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The district court found that further development of the record was necessary and appointed a federal public defender to represent Gaedtke. Rl-17, 19. The district court also <em>sua sponte </em>ordered further briefing on the issue of prejudice resulting from the alleged ineffectiveness of counsel. Rl-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">At the evidentiary hearing, Gaedtke testified that his appointed counsel had not read the case file before meeting with him and met with him for only ten to fifteen minutes. During that meeting, counsel\u2019s only advice to Gaedtke was to take the plea offered by the state. R3 at 17-27. According to Gaedtke, counsel did not explain the consequences of his plea <em>(i.e., </em>that there would be no trial), and Gaedtke would not have accepted the plea had he been informed of those consequences. <em>Id. </em>at 25-29. Gaedtke admitted that the only three witnesses to the alleged crime had already given statements to the police at the time of his arraignment and explained that he did not seek to withdraw his plea upon learning the he would be sentenced immediately because he was \u201cin shock.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36-40, 43-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">James Jacobs, Gaedtke\u2019s appointed counsel, testified that he reviewed the discovery exhibit and case file provided by the state at the arraignment and met with Gaedtke for about fifteen to thirty minutes to discuss his case and the plea deal. <em>Id. </em>at 163-66. Viewing his contemporaneous notes, he stated that they discussed the Jimmy Ryce Act, the thirty-year maximum sentence, and the fifteen-year offer. <em>Id. </em>at 165-66. He testified that the case file contained a written confession by Gaedtke and that Gaedtke never denied the charges against him and never told him that his confession had been coerced. <em>Id. </em>at 166-67; 171-71. Jacobs further testified that the discovery exhibit contained Gaedtke\u2019s criminal history, which showed that he had six prior felony convictions for sexually molesting his two stepdaughters. <em>Id. </em>at 168, 193-95. Finally, Jacobs stated that said he would not have allowed Gaedtke to accept the plea deal if there had been any indication that Gaedtke was hesitant about the agreement or had been coerced by law enforcement. <em>Id. </em>at 206-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">Post-hearing briefs were permitted by the district court and were filed by both parties. <em>See generally </em>R1-49, 52, 53. The state argued that Gaedtke\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was procedurally barred because, insofar as he did not allege prejudice, he failed to sufficiently plead an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim in the state proceedings. Rl-52 at 11-13. The state argued alternatively that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Gaedtke\u2019s claim failed on the merits, as he demonstrated neither deficient performance nor prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 16-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The district court issued a 51-page order denying Gaedtke\u2019s petition on 25 March 2009. Rl-56. The court first found that Gaedtke\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was not procedurally barred because the state court\u2019s adjudication of that claim was not clearly and expressly based on independent and adequate state procedural grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 8-9. The district court further ruled that Gaedtke\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was sufficiently pled in the state court for procedural default purposes because Gaedtke \u2018\u201cpresented his claim[] to the state court such that a reasonable reader would understand [the] claim\u2019s particular legal basis and specific factual foundation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9 (citing <em>Williams v. Allen, </em>542 F.3d 1326, 1345 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2383, 173 L.Ed.2d 1325 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">The district court then found that, given the seriousness of the charges and penalties Gaedtke faced, it was objectively unreasonable for counsel to advise him to plead no contest at his arraignment after only a cursory review of the file and a short personal interview. <em>Id. </em>at 35-43. The district court reasoned that counsel had an affirmative duty, regardless of Gaedtke\u2019s admissions of guilt, to further investigate the charges and evidence against Gaedtke before considering a plea offer. <em>Id. </em>at 39-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">Though troubled by counsel\u2019s deficient performance and what it described as \u201cstructural deficiencies\u201d in the state proceedings, the district court nevertheless concluded that Gaedtke was not prejudiced thereby. <em>Id. </em>at 43-50. The court first found that, notwithstanding counsel\u2019s errors and any defects in the procedures employed by the state courts, Gaedtke\u2019s case did not represent the type of \u201cfundamental breakdown of the adversarial process\u201d giving rise to a presumption of prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 44-45. This was especially so, the court observed, in light of \u201cthe additional overlay of AEDPA deference due to the state court\u2019s decision that there was no prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court noted that such deference must be given to that decision, even though \u201cit [was] not entirely clear whether the state habeas court found that Gaedtke had failed to adequately allege prejudice or whether it found that prejudice had not been shown.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45 n. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-13\">The court further found that, given the strength of the state\u2019s case, which included Gaedtke\u2019s signed confession; the testimony of the child victim, or, at the very least, the victim\u2019s statements to her mother, father, and grandmother; Gaedtke\u2019s prior felony convictions for molesting his two stepdaughters; and the sworn statement of Gaedtke\u2019s wife establishing Gaedtke\u2019s access to the victim and opportunity to commit the crime \u2014 all of which would have been admissible at trial \u2014 Gaedtke could not affirmatively establish prejudice under <em>Strickland. Id. </em>at 48-49. The court dismissed Gaedtke\u2019s assertions that there were other witnesses who could testify that they had access to the house on the day of the crime, that his wife\u2019s statement to police had been coerced, and that he had not been read his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights. The district court first found that the testimony of the proposed witnesses would most likely be irrelevant given that there were only three people in the house at the time of the offense \u2014 Gaedtke, his wife, and the victim \u2014 and each had provided statements to the police that day. <em>Id. </em>at 46^7. The court further found that Gaedtke\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>contention that his wife\u2019s sworn statement was coerced was contradicted by evidence that his wife had made a prior consistent statement to the responding deputy on the day of the incident. <em>Id. </em>at 47. Finally, the court found that because the discovery file contained a written and signed <em>Miranda </em>waiver, there was no merit to Gaedtke\u2019s claim that he was not advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and it was thus \u201chighly unlikely that the confession would have been suppressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court therefore concluded that the record contained \u201cnothing to suggest the likelihood that anything that counsel could have or would have done ... would have led counsel to change his recommendation as to the plea, because there [was] in turn no likelihood that any actions by counsel likely would have changed the outcome of trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The district court denied Gaedtke\u2019s petition in its entirety, and a final judgment to that effect was entered on 26 March 2009. Rl-57. On 28 April 2009, the district court granted Gaedtke\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability as to its ruling on his ineffectiveness-of-counsel claim only, stating that \u201c[reasonable jurists would find [its] assessment of the constitutional claim debatable or wrong.\u201d Rl-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">On appeal, Gaedtke argues that the district court erred in refusing to apply a presumption of prejudice under <em>United States v. Cronic </em>466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984) because his appointed counsel did not subject the state\u2019s case to any \u201cmeaningful adversarial testing\u201d before recommending that he enter a plea at his arraignment. Gaedtke contends alternatively that, even without a presumption of prejudice, the district court .erred in denying his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim because he demonstrated a reasonable probability, as required by <em>Strickland, </em>that, absent counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pled no contest and would have insisted on going to trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Because Gaedtke filed his habeas petition after 24 April 1996, this case is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, \u201cwhich establishes a highly deferential standard for reviewing state court judgments.\u201d <em>Carroll v. Sec\u2019y, Dept. of Corr., </em>574 F.3d 1354, 1364 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Under AEDPA, federal courts may not grant habeas relief on any claim that was previously \u201cadjudicated <em>on the merits </em>\u201d by the state court, <em>unless </em>the adjudication</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-10\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-11\">(2) resulted in a decision based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2) (2009) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>\u201cA state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in Supreme Court cases or confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant Supreme Court precedent and arrives at a result opposite to the Court\u2019s.\u201d <em>Windom v. Sec\u2019y, Dept. of Corr., </em>578 F.3d 1227, 1247 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted) (per curiam). A state-court decision involves an unreasonable application of federal law where the state court unreasonably applies the correct governing legal principle to the facts, \u201cunreasonably extends a legal principle ... to a new context where it should not apply[,] or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 407, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1520, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">A federal court may also grant habeas relief if the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). The state court\u2019s factual determinations are entitled to a presumption of correctness that may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence that the state court\u2019s factual determinations were erroneous. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2254(e)(1); <em>see Parker v. Head, </em>244 F.3d 831, 835-36 (11th Cir.2001). To prevail on a claim of ineffective-assistance-of-counsel, a petitioner must demonstrate that: (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, <em>and </em>(2) the deficient performance prejudiced the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. \u201cBecause both parts of the test must be satisfied in order to show a violation of the Sixth Amendment, the court need not address the performance prong if the defendant cannot meet the prejudice prong, or vice versa.\u201d <em>Holladay v. Haley, </em>209 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Because we conclude, for the reasons set forth below, that Gaedtke has failed to establish the required prejudice prong of his ineffective-assistance claim, we do not address the performance prong. <em>See Sullivan v. DeLoach, </em>459 F.3d 1097, 1099 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">To show prejudice under <em>Strickland, </em>the petitioner must demonstrate a reasonable probability, which is \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome,\u201d that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the result of the proceeding would have been different. 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. \u201cIt is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693, 104 S.Ct. at 2067.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">In the context of a guilty plea, \u201cthe defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 370, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). Where the alleged error is the failure to adequately investigate, the prejudice inquiry will \u201cdepend on the likelihood that discovery of the evidence would have led counsel to change his recommendation as to the plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis assessment, in turn, will depend in large part on a prediction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>whether the evidence likely would have changed the outcome of a trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Although <em>Strickland </em>generally requires defendants alleging deficient performance to affirmatively prove prejudice, <em>see </em>466 U.S. at 693, 104 S.Ct. at 2067, the Supreme Court held in <em>Cronic </em>that a showing of prejudice is not required \u201cif there are \u2018circumstances that are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chadwick v. Green, </em>740 F.2d 897, 900 (11th Cir.1984) (quoting <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 658, 104 S.Ct. at 2046). Circumstances giving rise to a presumption of prejudice include those in which the accused is denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial, the accused\u2019s counsel \u201centirely fails to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing,\u201d or the accused is \u201cdenied the right of effective cross-examination.\u201d <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 659, 104 S.Ct. at 2047 (quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cIt is within this narrow range of cases exemplified by such circumstances that the petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance claim must fall to gain relief without a showing of prejudice.\u201d <em>Chadwick, </em>740 F.2d at 900. To the extent it applies, the burden of proof under <em>Cronic </em>is \u201ca very heavy one.\u201d <em>Smith v. Wainwright, 111 </em>F.2d 609, 620 (11th Cir.1985) (stating that \u201c[w]e have yet to find that a petitioner received ineffective assistance of counsel under the <em>Cronic </em>standard based solely on his counsel\u2019s performance, without regard to some interference attributable to the state\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In this case, Gaedtke alleges that his appointed counsel failed to conduct an adequate investigation prior to advising him to plead no contest to the charge against him. We have held, however, that counsel\u2019s failure \u201cto investigate and pursue all avenues of defense is best characterized as a failure by counsel in the performance of his investigative duties, which is to be analyzed under <em>[Strickland </em>], rather than as a fundamental breakdown of the adversarial process such that prejudice is presumed under <em>Cronic.\u201d Chadwick, </em>740 F.2d at 901. Because Gaedtke\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim pertains solely to appointed counsel\u2019s failure to investigate, we cannot say that it falls within that \u201cvery narrow spectrum of cases where the circumstances leading to counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness are so egregious that the defendant was in effect denied any meaningful assistance at all.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Because Gaedtke is not entitled to a presumption of prejudice, he must affirmatively prove prejudice under <em>Strickland. </em>This he cannot do. The record reflects that, at the time of Gaedtke\u2019s arraignment, the state\u2019s case consisted of the following: (1) a signed confession from Gaedtke, admitting that he had fondled his granddaughter; (2) a written statement from his wife establishing that Gaedtke had the opportunity to commit the crime; (3) admissible prior statements from Gaedtke\u2019s stepdaughters claiming similar abuse when they were young girls; (4) Gaedtke\u2019s convictions in Virginia for molestation of his stepdaughters; and (5) either the live testimony of the child victim alleging molestation by Gaedtke or prior consistent statements she made to relatives about the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Although Gaedtke claimed that there were additional witnesses who would testify that they had access to the house on the day of the crime, that his wife\u2019s statement was coerced, and that he did not receive his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the district court found that the proposed witness testimony would have limited, if any, probative value, that Gaedtke\u2019s wife had given a prior consistent statement to the officer on the scene the day before, and that the case file contained a signed <em>Miranda </em>waiver. Because the evidence Gaedtke claims his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>counsel should have discovered through investigation would not likely have changed the outcome of the trial, we fail to see how it would have led counsel to change his plea recommendation. <em>See Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 59, 106 S.Ct. at 370. Accordingly, we agree with the district court that the state court did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland </em>when it found that Gaedtke failed to show that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to conduct a pre-plea investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Gaedtke appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus, in which he alleged that he received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel during the plea process. For the reasons set forth herein, the judgment of the district court denying petition for a writ of habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-11\">. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b40-7\">. Gaedtke argues on appeal that the state court denied his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim as facially insufficient and, therefore, it was not an adjudication on the merits entitled to deference under \u00a7 2254(d). Although \u00a7 2254(d)(l)'s requirement of deference does not apply where the state court fails to resolve a federal constitutional claim on the merits, <em>see Davis v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>341 F.3d 1310, 1313 (11th Cir.2003) (per cu-riam), we think it is fairly clear that the state court, in concluding that Gaedtke \"failed the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland,\" </em>Exh. Folder 9, Exh. C at 3, denied the claim \"on the merits,\u201d so as to trigger 2254(d)(l)'s deference requirement, <em>see Ferguson v. Culliver, </em>527 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>1144, 1146 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (stating that \"a state court's summary rejection of a claim qualifies as an adjudication on the merits under \u00a7 2254(d) so as to warrant deference\u201d); <em>Wright v. Sec\u2019y for Dept. of Corr., </em>278 F.3d 1245, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that under the plain language of \u00a7 2254(d)(1), \"all that is required is a rejection of the claim on the merits, not an explanation\u201d). Accordingly, we reject Gaedtke\u2019s argument that deference is not owed to the state court's decision in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
