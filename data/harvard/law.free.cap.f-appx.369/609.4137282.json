He argues that since his original sentence was near the bottom of his original guidelines range of 87-108 months of imprisonment, the district court erred by sentencing him at the top of his revised guidelines range of 70-87 months of imprisonment without explicitly considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or giving a \u201clegally sufficient reason\u201d for the revised sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-21\">This court reviews the decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667 (5th Cir.2009). Reasonableness review, as outlined in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is not applicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>Id. </em>As this court observed in <em>Evans, </em>since \u201ca defendant cannot successfully challenge a district court for failing to provide reasons for <em>denying </em>his motion to reduce his sentence, it is axiomatic that he cannot do so for <em>granting </em>his motion but not providing a satisfactorily low enough sentence within the recalculated range.\u201d <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674 (emphases in original). The district court was aware of the facts that Russell claims justified a lower sentence. Although Russell deduces from the district court\u2019s brevity that it ignored the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cthat the court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>mention the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it summarily reduced [his] sentence does not mean that it did not consider them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673. \u201cThe court, which was under no obligation to reduce [Russell\u2019s] sentence at all, was under no obligation to reduce it even further within the recalculated range.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b633-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
