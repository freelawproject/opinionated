He argues that the transcripts are necessary to file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-24\">To obtain a transcript at government expense, the movant must satisfy 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f). <em>See Harvey v. Andrist, </em>754 F.2d 569, 571 (5th Cir.1985). Section 753(f) \u201cprovides for a free transcript for indigent prisoners asserting a claim under \u00a7 2255 if a judge certifies that the assert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>ed claim is not frivolous and that the transcript is needed to decide the issue.\u201d <em>United States v. MacCollom, </em>426 U.S. 317, 320-21, 96 S.Ct. 2086, 48 L.Ed.2d 666 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted). The movant must \u201cbring to [the court\u2019s] attention any facts that might require a close examination of the trial transcript.\u201d <em>Harvey, </em>754 F.2d at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Davis\u2019s motion for transcripts did not set forth the issues he intended to raise in his \u00a7 2255 motion or explain why the requested transcripts were necessary to decide those issues. His allegations of judicial and prosecutorial misconduct were not presented in the district court and thus will not be considered by this court. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). Moreover, Davis\u2019s conelusional allegations are insufficient to establish that his proposed \u00a7 2255 claims are not frivolous and that the transcripts are necessary to decide the issues. <em>See </em>\u00a7 753(f); <em>Harvey, </em>754 F.2d at 571. Therefore, he has not shown that the district court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The instant appeal involves no legal points arguable on their merits and is therefore is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Davis is cautioned that his use of abusive and insulting language directed at the district court is improper; similar language and accusations in future filings will result in the imposition of sanctions. <em>See Theriault v. Silber, </em>579 F.2d 302, 303 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b570-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cut. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
