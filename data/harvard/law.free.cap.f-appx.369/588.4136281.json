Malik\u2019s bag contained valuable items, including jewelry, and she filed suit to recover the value of her lost luggage, which she estimates to be $436,000. The district court held that Ma-lik\u2019s Contract of Carriage with Continental excluded all but $800 of her claim and entered judgment in her favor in that amount.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Malik argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>the district court erroneously enforced certain exclusions in her Contract of Carriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Federal common law provides a cause of action for the value of lost luggage against air carriers. <em>See Sam L. Majors Jewelers v. ABX, Inc., </em>117 F.3d 922, 926-29 (5th Cir.1997). But carriers are allowed to limit them liability by contract if they give reasonable notice to passengers. <em>Id. </em>at 930; <em>see also Casas v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>304 F.3d 517, 524 (5th Cir.2002). Here, Continental limited its liability for lost luggage to $2,800.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It also excluded any liability for, <em>inter alia, </em>heirlooms, irreplaceable items, and jewelry. When Malik bought her ticket through an online travel service she acknowledged that Continental\u2019s Contract of Carriage applied, that carriers may limit their liability for lost baggage, and that more information regarding luggage liability restrictions could be obtained from the carrier. A full copy of Continental\u2019s Contract of Carriage was available to Malik on Continental\u2019s website. Further, Malik was given a notice of Continental\u2019s liability limitations when she received her boarding pass. This notice indicated that Continental limited its liability for lost baggage to $2,800 and \u201cassumed no liability for fragile, valuable or perishable articles that are lost, damaged, or delayed.\u201d It also instructed that further information could be obtained from the carrier. In <em>Casas, </em>we enforced a similar exclusion in like circumstances, and the district court correctly enforced the exclusions here. <em>See </em>304 F.3d at 524-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Malik makes several attempts to distinguish our precedent, but none is persuasive. She contends that she was not given reasonable notice of the liability exclusions because her bag was checked by airline personnel without her permission. Continental, however, reserved the right to check any passenger\u2019s bag in the Contract of Carriage by which Malik agreed to be bound. Malik\u2019s further argument that Continental\u2019s liability exclusion is invalid because it violates 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 254.4 is also foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See id. </em>at 525. Finally, Malik alleges that Continental\u2019s staff repeatedly assured her after she reached her final destination that her suitcase had been found and would arrive on the \u201cnext plane.\u201d The suitcase never arrived, and Malik asserts that these allegedly false assurances warrant abrogating Continental\u2019s liability exclusions. Malik cites no authority for this proposition, and the Court finds no support for Malik\u2019s position in our case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b612-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-24\">. Malik does nol challenge the value of her non-excluded items on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\">. Federal law restricts how low a carrier can limit its liability for lost luggage. When Continental lost Malik\u2019s bag, that limit was set at $2,800. It has since increased. See 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 254.4 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
