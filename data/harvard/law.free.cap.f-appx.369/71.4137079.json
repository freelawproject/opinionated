Govan sought a reduction of his sentence based on Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines, which retroactively provides for a two-level reduction in base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses if the amendment has the effect of altering the defendant\u2019s sentencing range. <em>See generally United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008). The district court held that it lacked authority to reduce Govan\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Govan was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and as a result Amendment 706 did not lower his guidelines range. <em>See id. </em>at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-23\">Govan contends that the district court erroneously concluded that it lacked discretionary authority to grant his motion for a sentence reduction. He bases his argument on the fact that when he was originally sentenced, the district court rejected a career offender enhancement and applied a downward departure on the ground that his criminal history category significantly overrepresented the seriousness of his prior narcotics offenses. The government appealed that decision, and this Court reversed, concluding that the district court erred by failing to apply the career offender guidelines and by departing downward for Govan\u2019s criminal history. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Govan was resentenced as a career offender. Govan argues that the district court should have considered the intent of the original sentencing court when evaluating whether Govan was eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). In the present case the district court correctly determined that it lacked authority to reduce Govan\u2019s sentence. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Go-van acknowledges <em>Moore\u2019s </em>holding but points out that <em>Moore </em>distinguished cases in which defendants ultimately were not sentenced as a career offenders because prior convictions overrepresented the seriousness of their criminal history. <em>See id. </em>at 1329-30. The <em>Moore </em>opinion observed that in those situations \u201ca reduction in sentence is within the district court\u2019s discretionary authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Even if that observation were something more than dicta, it would not change the result for Govan. He was ultimately sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Therefore, the district court properly determined that it lacked authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence based upon Amendment 706. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">As an alternative argument, Govan contends that <em>Moore </em>was wrongly decided. That argument is to no avail. We are bound to follow our prior precedent unless and until it is overruled by this Court sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
