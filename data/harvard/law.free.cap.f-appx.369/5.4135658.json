Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s wife, Maria Jose Cabrera-De Botero, and their two children, Maria Andrea Cabrera-Bote-ro, and Juan Esteban Cabrera-Botero, appeal as derivative beneficiaries of Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s asylum application. Botero\u2019s daughter, Natalia Botero, appeals as a derivative beneficiary of Botero\u2019s asylum application. The petitioners argue that the IJ erred in finding that (1) Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s testimony was not credible, and (2) Cabrera-Noriega failed to demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. For the reasons set forth below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-13\">On January 19, 2001, Cabrera-Noriega, a native and citizen of Colombia, filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal. On February 14, 2002, Botero, Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s sister-in-law, also a native and citizen of Colombia, filed an asylum application. All of the petitioners were issued notices to appear, which charged that they were subject to removal under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), as non-immigrants who remained in the United States for a period longer than permitted. The petitioners admitted the allegations contained in the notices to appear and conceded removability. The IJ consolidated Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s and Botero\u2019s cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-14\">Cabrera-Noriega testified before the IJ that, while in Colombia, he had been a conservative party activist, campaigning for his uncle, a governor and member of the House, and Alvaro Gomez, a conservative party candidate for president. Cabrera-Noriega was also a member of the Junior Chamber, which he described as \u201ca non-profit organization\u201d with no political affiliation whose objective was \u201cto help the people that need[ ] the most help, and poor people.\u201d Cabrera-Noriega also belonged to an organization known as \u201cFree Country,\u201d which he described as \u201ca nonprofit organization that helps the families of kid-naped people.\u201d As a coordinator for Free Country, Cabrera-Noriega held meetings and participated in marches.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-15\">Cabrera-Noriega explained that he was contacted by the Red Cross to act as a negotiator between Ejercito de Liberaci\u00f3n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Nacional (\u201cELN\u201d) guerillas and the family of Allister Taylor, an English employee of a multinational corporation who the ELN had kidnaped in July 1999. He stated that the Red Cross asked him to help with Taylor\u2019s case because he was known as a person who provided humanitarian aid. On September 25, 1999, Cabrera-Noriega met with ELN members at a Red Cross office. The ELN members drove Cabrera-Noriega two-and-a-half hours into the jungle, where they met a group of ten armed guerillas. An ELN commander took Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s personal information and told him that they would only deal with him in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s second meeting with the guerillas occurred on October 13,1999. The guerillas informed Cabrera-Noriega that they were seeking a $19 million ransom for Taylor\u2019s release. Taylor\u2019s family subsequently offered to pay $50,000. Cabrera-Noriega informed the guerillas of the family\u2019s offer, and the guerillas told him that they were willing to reduce the ransom to $8 million. Cabrera-Noriega met with the guerillas 11 times and the guerillas ultimately lowered their ransom demand to $2 million, although the family offered to pay only $600,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s last meeting with the guerillas was held on June 14, 2000. Cabrera-Noriega told the guerillas that Taylor\u2019s family was willing to pay $600,000. A commander told Cabrera-Noriega that \u201cthis is not a game, you son-of-a-bitch. You\u2019re staying here with us.\u201d Cabrera-Noriega was blindfolded, handcuffed with a chain, and thrown into a car. After a four-hour drive over an unpaved road, the men forced Cabrera-Noriega to walk for two-and-a-half hours. Cabrera-Noriega was chained to a post in a wooden cabin, where he remained for 24 days. The guerillas called Cabrera-Noriega an \u201coligarch and a son-of-a-bitch\u201d and told him that they were going to kill him and his family \u201cfor not cooperating.\u201d Cabrera-Noriega explained that, to the guerillas, an oligarch meant an individual with a social status and a better life. Cabrera-Noriega was eventually released under the condition that he would help secure Taylor\u2019s ransom. Cabrera-Noriega was told to return on July 24th \u201cwith a positive answer\u201d and, if possible, with the $2 million ransom. Cabrera-Noriega returned to Bogota after the kidnaping on July 8, 2000, and left Colombia on September 3, 2000. From the time he was released until the time he left Colombia, Cabrera-Noriega received threatening phone calls from ELN guerillas, who told him that \u201cno oligarch son-of-a-bitch was going to mock them,\u201d that he had been \u201cdeclared a military target,\u201d and that they would not rest until Cabrera-Noriega was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">The IJ found that Taylor\u2019s testimony was not credible, based on discrepancies between his testimony and his asylum application. It also found that Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s account was implausible and that he failed to present corroborating documents from the Red Cross or Taylor\u2019s family, although it would have been reasonable to do so. The IJ denied Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s and Botero\u2019s applications based on the lack of credibility and corroborating evidence. The IJ found that, even if Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s claims were credible, he would not be eligible for relief because he failed to show that the actions taken against him were on account of his political opinion. Instead, the found that the ELN\u2019s actions were based on Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s failure to obtain the ransom money. The IJ also determined that Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s kidnaping did not rise to the level of persecution because he was not physically injured. Finally, the IJ denied Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s and Botero\u2019s claim for CAT relief, finding that Cabrera-Noriega failed to show that the ELN was a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>official or acted with the acquiescence or consent of Colombian officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Cabrera-Noriega and Botero appealed the IJ\u2019s denial of relief, arguing that the IJ erred by (1) determining that Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s testimony was not credible, (2) denying their applications for political asylum, (3) determining that they failed to meet their burdens of proof to establish that they were refugees, and (4) denying their applications for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The BIA determined that all of the petitioners\u2019 claims, including those of Botero, rested on Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s claim. It determined that it was \u201cunnecessary to address\u201d the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility finding because, even if Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s testimony was credible, the IJ did not err in determining that Cabrera-Noriega failed to establish eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. The BIA found that the IJ did not clearly err in determining that Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s kidnaping and the subsequent threats were on account of his failure to obtain the ransom amount, rather than on account of his political opinion. It noted that the guerillas\u2019 comments that Cabrera-Noriega was an \u201coligarch,\u201d Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s testimony that he was kidnaped because the ELN was angry about his failure to obtain the ransom, the fact that the ELN never mentioned Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s political opinions, and the fact that Cabrera-Noriega was released so that he could obtain the ransom money, indicated that the ELN\u2019s actions were based on their desire to obtain the ransom, rather than Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s political affiliation. Thus, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s finding that Cabrera-Noriega failed to establish a nexus between the persecution he suffered and a protected ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The BIA also found that Cabrera-Noriega did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of a protected ground because he was never harmed in Colombia, he failed to show that his affiliation with any political party or organization was so significant or well-known that he would still be targeted nine years after leaving the country, Taylor was released in 2001, and there was no evidence that the ELN continued to look for Cabrera-Noriega. Because Cabrera-Noriega failed to establish that he was entitled to asylum, the BIA found that he necessarily failed to meet his burden of proof with respect to his claim for withholding of removal. Finally, the BIA found that Cabrera-Noriega was not entitled to relief under the CAT because the IJ correctly found that it was not \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that Cabrera-Noriega would be tortured if he returned to Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion or reasoning. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s order, so we review only the BIA\u2019s order. When reviewing an order of the BIA, we review legal issues <em>de novo. Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 44, 172 L.Ed.2d 22 (2008). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283. Under this test, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-14\">\n<em>Credibility of Cabrerar-Noriega\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b33-15\">We review credibility determinations under the substantial-evidence test. <em>Chen v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number><em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThe trier of fact must determine credibility, and [we] may not substitute [our] judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). The BIA must make \u201cclean determinations of credibility,\u201d and, to be considered an adverse-credibility determination, the fact finder must state explicitly that the applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). If the BIA fails to make an explicit adverse-credibility determination, we accept the petitioner\u2019s testimony as credible. <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1257 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">As discussed above, because the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s reasoning or opinion, we review only the BIA\u2019s order. See <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. The BIA\u2019s order did not make an express adverse-credibility determination but instead, analyzed Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s claims under the assumption that his testimony was credible. Accordingly, because the BIA did not make an express adverse-credibility determination, we accept Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s as credible. <em>See Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\n<em>Past Persecution or a WelV-Founded Fear of Future Persecution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">An alien may establish eligibility for asylum if he shows that he has suffered either \u201cpast persecution\u201d or has a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution based on a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b); <em>Tang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>578 F.3d 1270, 1277 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cTo establish asylum based on <em>past </em>persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that [ ]he was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1232 (11th Cir.2007). A well-founded fear of future persecution may be established by showing (1) past persecution that creates a presumption of a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution, (2) a reasonable possibility of being singled out for persecution that cannot be avoided by relocating within the subject country, or (3) a pattern or practice in the subject country of persecuting members of a statutorily defined group of which he is a part. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1), (2), (3)(i). \u201cBoth past persecution and future persecution must be \u2018on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1232 (quoting INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">An alien is entitled to withholding of removal under the INA if he can show that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of a protected ground. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). This standard is more stringent than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum; thus, if an applicant is unable to meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard, he necessarily is unable to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">As an initial matter, the petitioners\u2019 appellate brief fails to present any argument regarding the BIA\u2019s denial of them claims for CAT relief. Thus, the petitioners have abandoned any such argument, and we do not address the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that a petitioner abandons an issue if he fails to offer argument on it).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">With respect to Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s application for asylum, the BIA correctly determined that Cabrera-Noriega failed to establish a nexus between the alleged persecution and his political opinion. <em>See Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1232; INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Cabrera-Noriega testified that he had participated in conservative party politics by campaigning for his uncle and for Gomez. However, there was no indication that the guerillas targeted Cabrera-Noriega based on his involvement in these campaigns. Cabrera-Noriega also testified that he was involved in the \u201cJunior Chamber,\u201d but he acknowledged that this non-profit organization had no political affiliation. Cabrera-Noriega asserts that the ELN targeted him based on his involvement in Free Country, which was committed to helping kidnaping victims. However, Cabrera-Noriega testified that it was the Red Cross that contacted him and asked him to serve as a mediator, not the ELN. Moreover, no persecution occurred during the first ten meetings Cabrera-Noriega had with the ELN. It was during the eleventh meeting, after Cabrera-Noriega had failed to secure an acceptable ransom payment, that Cabrera-Noriega was detained and the alleged persecution commenced. Thus, the persecution was caused by Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s failure to secure the $2 million ransom, rather than his political beliefs. <em>See Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that \u201c[i]t is not enough to show that [the petitioner] was or will be persecuted ... due to h[is] refusal to cooperate with the guerillas\u201d). This finding is supported by Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s testimony that he was released under the condition that he would secure the $2 million payment from Taylor\u2019s family and that the ELN expected the money within two weeks or he would be killed. Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s testimony that the ELN called him an \u201coligarch\u201d does not establish that the persecution occurred on account of a protected ground because he explained that an \u201coligarch\u201d refeiTed to an individual with a better social status and a better life, rather than someone with a particular political opinion. Accordingly, Cabrera-Noriega failed to establish that any persecution he suffered occurred on account of a protected ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s claim based on a well-founded fear of future persecution also fails because there was no evidence that any future persecution would be caused by Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s political opinions. <em>See Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1232; INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). All of the persecution that Cabrera-Noriega suffered while in Colombia arose out of his failure to obtain the $2 million ransom from Taylor\u2019s family. Although Cabrera-Noriega testified that he was involved in conservative party politics and Free Country, he did not offer any evidence showing that he was persecuted by individuals other than those involved in the Taylor kidnaping. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the ELN would continue to look for Cabrera-Noriega nine years after he left the country. Accordingly, because Cabrera-Noriega failed to show that he suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground, or that he had a well-founded fear of being persecuted based on a protected ground, the district court correctly denied Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s application for asylum. Furthermore, because Botero asserted that the threats she received were based on Cabrera-Noriega\u2019s problems with Taylor\u2019s kidnapers, the district court also correctly denied her claim for asylum. Because Cabrera-Noriega and Botero failed to meet the higher standard of proof required to establish eligibility for asylum, they also necessarily failed to show eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
