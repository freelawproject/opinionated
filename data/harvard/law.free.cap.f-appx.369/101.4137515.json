On appeal, Aguirre argues that: (1) the IJ\u2019s reasoning for denying Aguirre\u2019s motion to reconsider as untimely was erroneous, and this erroneous denial was not a determination on the merits; (2) when the BIA acknowledged that the IJ\u2019s reasoning was incorrect, the BIA should have remanded to the IJ to allow the IJ to evaluate the merits of his motion to reconsider, and thereby review the additional evidence that he had submitted, and to determine whether the removal proceedings should be reopened <em>sua sponte; </em>and (3) the BIA erred by reviewing the merits of the motion to reconsider, which involved reviewing the findings of the IJ on the underlying motion to reopen, and then affirming, despite the IJ\u2019s erroneous reasoning. After careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, the BIA issued its own determination affirming the IJ\u2019s decision to deny the motion for reconsideration, so as to this issue, we will review only the decision of the BIA. However, to the extent that the BIA relied on the findings of the IJ with respect to the underlying decision to deny the motion to reopen, we will review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">We generally review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Assa'ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). Our review is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). A motion to reconsider presented to an IJ \u201cshall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the [IJ\u2019s] prior decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(2); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">The BIA \u201cmay review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges <em>de novo.\u201d </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); <em>see Matter of Adelina Martinez, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 66, 69, 76-79 (BIA 2009) (finding that the IJ\u2019s discretionary grant of relief was not appropriate after a <em>de novo </em>review of the evidence). Findings of fact determined by the IJ are reviewed by the BIA only to determine if those findings are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The concept of harmless error which does not prejudice the substantial rights of a defendant, can be utilized in immigration proceedings. <em>See Matter of Santos, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 105, 108-09 (BIA 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>An IJ has the <em>sua sponte </em>authority at any time to reopen or reconsider any case in which he or she has made a decision, unless jurisdiction has vested in the BIA. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1). Likewise, the BIA may at any time reopen or reconsider <em>sua sponte </em>any case in which it has rendered a decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). We lack jurisdiction to review decisions to refuse to reopen immigration proceedings in exercise of an agency\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>authority. <em>Lenis v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1293-94 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also Kucana v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 827, 839, n. 18, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -(2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Here, the BIA did not err in conducting a <em>de novo </em>review of the motion to reconsider and affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of that motion. The BIA exercised its authority to review the decision of the IJ de novo, and as part of its <em>de novo </em>review, the BIA properly considered the findings of the IJ on the underlying motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). Although the BIA discovered in its review that the IJ\u2019s reasoning for the denial of the motion to reconsider as untimely was erroneous, it was not required to stop there and remand to the IJ. The BIA properly continued its <em>de novo </em>review, and bound by the standard governing review of motions to reconsider, the BIA properly reviewed the underlying decision \u2014 the denial of the motion to reopen \u2014 to determine if an error of law or fact affected the outcome of the motion to reopen which would justify granting the motion to reconsider. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C). The BIA then concluded that Aguirre had not met his burden on a motion to reconsider because he had not shown an error of law or fact affecting the underlying denial of the motion to reopen. The BIA thus did not abuse its discretion in conducting a <em>de novo </em>review and affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of the motion to reconsider. Moreover, Aguirre was not prejudiced by the erroneous reasoning of the IJ because the BIA conducted an independent review on the merits and reached the same decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Finally, to the extent Aguirre is arguing that the BIA\u2019s decision prevented the IJ from exercising her authority to reopen the removal proceedings <em>sua sponte, </em>this argument fails because the IJ actually had two opportunities to exercise this authority, but refused to do so. The IJ had this opportunity when she was considering the motion to reopen, and again, when she was considering the motion to reconsider. Then, when Aguirre filed the appeal to the BIA, he was relying on the BIA\u2019s authority to reopen the removal proceedings <em>sua sponte. See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1) (the IJ has <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen until jurisdiction is vested in the BIA). Even after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ku-cana, </em>we do not have jurisdiction to review the refusal of the BIA to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen or reconsider. <em>Kucana, </em>130 S.Ct. at 839 n. 18; <em>Lenis, </em>525 F.3d at 1293-94. For these reasons, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
