We will affirm. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4 (2008); 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-31\">Cotto instituted this action by submitting a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the District Court along with a motion for leave to proceed IFP. The filing fee for the habeas petition is $5.00. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\u00a7 1914(a). A Magistrate Judge recommended that the District Court deny the IFP motion because Cotto\u2019s prison account statement showed an average monthly balance of $56.43, which \u201cfar exceeds\u201d the $ 5.00 filing fee. Cotto objected on the sole ground that the Magistrate Judge wrongly identified the institution in which he is incarcerated, but did not otherwise challenge the Magistrate Judge\u2019s assessment of his prison account statement. The District Court overruled Cotto\u2019s objection, adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation, and denied Cotto\u2019s IFP motion by order entered October 9, 2009. Cotto appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The denial of a motion for leave to proceed IFP is final and appealable, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Redmond v. Gill, </em>352 F.3d 801, 803 (3d Cir.2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review the denial of leave to proceed IFP for abuse of discretion. <em>See Jones v. Zimmerman, </em>752 F.2d 76, 78 (3d Cir.1985). \u201cIn this circuit, leave to proceed [IFP] is based on a showing of indigence.\u201d <em>Deutsch v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 1080, 1084 n. 5 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In this case, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in requiring Cotto to pay the $5.00 filing fee. We are not certain how the Magistrate Judge calculated Cotto\u2019s average monthly balance, but our review of his account statement reveals that he earned an average of $55.38 per month in prison wages and had a balance of $82.80 at the time he submitted his IFP application to the District Court. Thus, requiring Cotto to pay the $5.00 filing fee did not impermissibly \u201c\u2018force [him] to abandon what may be a meritorious claim in order to spare himself complete destitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones, </em>752 F.2d at 79 (quoting <em>Adkins v. DuPont Co., </em>335 U.S. 331, 340, 69 S.Ct. 85, 93 L.Ed. 43 (1948), and holding that District Court abused its discretion in requiring prisoner to pay $5.00 fee from an account balance of only $17.39). Accordingly, we will affirm. Our ruling is without prejudice to Cotto\u2019s right to refile his habeas petition with the $5.00 filing fee or resubmit it with another motion for leave to proceed IFP, as his circumstances may warrant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-6\">. We have not decided whether a certificate of appealability is necessary to appeal the District Court's denial of leave to proceed IFP in a habeas proceeding. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). To the extent that a certificate of appealability might be required, we deny it for the reasons discussed herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-7\">. We granted Cotto leave to proceed IFP on appeal, but our action is not inconsistent with the denial of his IFP motion at the District Court level because the $450.00 fee for filing a notice of appeal is far higher than the $5.00 fee for filing a habeas petition. Cotto asserts in his IFP motion in this Court that the account statements he submitted to the District Courl do not reflect his current financial condition because he was removed from his prison job in July 2009 and is no longer receiving wages (a circumstance that he did not bring to the attention of the District Court). Nevertheless, he twice asserts in his IFP motion in this Court that he is now willing and able to pay the $5.00 fee in the District Court following our disposition of this appeal. We decline to dismiss this appeal as moot, however, because Cotto's financial condition may have changed in the interim and he does not appear to have in fact refiled his habeas petition with the filing fee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
