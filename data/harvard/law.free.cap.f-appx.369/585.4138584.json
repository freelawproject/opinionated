He contends that the district court clearly erred when it denied him a minor role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(b). Mendez-Perez argues that he was essentially just another customer of co-defendant Ernesto Hernandez-Perez and that his sole participation in the alien-trafficking offense was to temporarily drive the vehicle in which the aliens were secreted in hopes of lowering his own smuggling fee. According to Mendez-Perez, the district court clearly erred in finding that this isolated act made him a full participant in the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-24\">The district court must apply the Guidelines and calculate the advisory range correctly. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>520 F.3d 414, 422 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 111, 172 L.Ed.2d 89 (2008). Whether the defendant is a minor participant is a factual determination that is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record read as a whole.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-27\">Mendez-Perez has not shown that the district court clearly erred in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>that he was not entitled to a minor role reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2(b). <em>See id. </em>Notwithstanding that his role in temporarily driving the vehicle may have been only part of a larger alien smuggling scheme, Mendez-Perez pleaded guilty to transporting illegal aliens for private financial gain. As a driver, his role was central to the transportation of the illegal aliens and clearly \u201ccoextensive with the conduct for which he was held accountable.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598-99 (5th Cir.2001). Further, although Mendez-Perez may have been less culpable than Hernandez-Perez, his activities were not peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203-04. Because Mendez-Perez was not substantially less culpable than the average participant, the district court did not clearly err when it denied him a two-level reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2(b). <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b609-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
