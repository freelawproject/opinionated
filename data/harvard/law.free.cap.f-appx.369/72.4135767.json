His motion asked the district court \u201cfor permission to tape-record [the] conversation of a suspicious person who committed a crime in [his] case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Hernandez and other members of his family were convicted of \u201ccharges related to the 1989 murder-for-hire of the night watchman at them family business\u2019 warehouse, the burning of that warehouse, and the ensuing fraud on the warehouse\u2019s insurer.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>141 F.3d 1042, 1044 (11th Cir.1998). Hernandez filed a direct appeal, and this Court affirmed his conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 1045. After that, Hernandez filed a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, challenging his sentence on various constitutional grounds, and that motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">\u201c[T]o file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the movant must first file an application with the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider it.\u201d <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A)). \u201cWithout authorization, the district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a second or successive petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We \u201care obligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction sua <em>sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-13\">To determine whether a <em>pro se </em>motion is actually a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, we examine the content of the filing and the relief sought, not the label placed on the motion. <em>See United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1175 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that a <em>pro se </em>motion for a writ of <em>audita querela </em>was actually a \u00a7 2255 motion). If the movant collaterally attacks his sentence as being unconstitutional, we construe it as a \u00a7 2255 petition. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-14\">The district court did not construe Hernandez\u2019s motion as an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 petition, and Hernandez did not style his motion as one seeking \u00a7 2255 relief. Even so, the substance of his arguments amounts to a collateral attack on the constitutionality of his sentence. His initial brief to this Court does not even mention his motion to tape conversation. Instead, he argues that he \u201chas been accused, convicted, and sentenced to prison for a crime he did not commit,\u201d and he asks this Court to \u201cgive him the relief that is entitled.\u201d Because Hernandez\u2019s motion is an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 petition, we reverse and remand with instructions that the district court dismiss the motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-15\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
