He unsuccessfully objected to the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d), arguing that a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) was improperly applied because \u201cthere ha[d] been no showing with competent evidence that he was convicted of an offense that qualifies as a drug trafficking offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">Zavala-Alonso contends in his initial brief that the documents available to the district court were inadequate to demonstrate that he received at least one sentence under California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11351 or \u00a7 11351.5, each of which he admits states a drug trafficking offense. <em>See United States v. Palacios-Quinonez, </em>431 F.3d 471, 474 (5th Cir.2005). Zavala-Alonso argues that the court erred in determining that the California abstract of judgment and the criminal information are sufficiently reliable competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">In his reply brief, however, Zavala-Al-onso concedes that he was deported after three qualifying drug trafficking offenses, his convictions under \u00a7\u00a7 11351 and 11351.5. For the first time in his reply brief, he argues \u201cthat the record was inconsistent regarding which statutory offenses produced a sentence ... in excess of 13 months,\u201d and he describes, as the critical issue on appeal, \u201cwhich counts of conviction produced a qualifying sentence\u201d to support the 16-level enhancement. If Zavala-Alonso had been deported following a drug trafficking offense for which he was sentenced to 13 months or less, he would have received a 12-level rather than 16-level enhancement. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-16\">We do not entertain arguments made for the first time in a reply brief where the same issue has not been raised by the appellee. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>557 F.3d 200, 203 (5th Cir.2009). We note, moreover, that no evidence presented to the district court indicates that Zavala-Alonso received a sentence of 13 months or less for his three drug trafficking offenses. The PSR reported two five-year sentences, at least one of which was for a drug trafficking offense, and the abstract of conviction reflects concurrent sentences of five, four, and three years, the four-and three-year sentences being imposed for a qualifying drug trafficking crime. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b572-12\"> Pursuant to 5th C\u00edr R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cut. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
