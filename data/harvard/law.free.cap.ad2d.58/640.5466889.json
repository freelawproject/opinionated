Inc., Respondent.</parties>\n\n<opinion><p id=\"AuBS\">\u2014 In a negligence action to recover damages for personal injuries, plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Queens County, entered June 16, 1976, which denied her motion: (1) to remove the action to that court from the Civil Court of the City of New York; (2) to increase the <em>ad damnum </em>clause of the complaint; and (3) for leave to serve a supplemental complaint <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>Order reversed, without costs or disbursements, and motion granted. Plaintiff\u2019s papers show that she may have a meritorious cause of action and that the delay did not prejudice the defendant (cf. <em>Darrow v Del\u00f1no Crescenzo &amp; Sons, </em>55 AD2d 635). Hopkins, J. P., Hargett, Shapiro and Suozzi, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
