Respondent-respondent-appellant shall recover of petitioner-appellant-respondent $60 costs and disbursements of this appeal. Upon appeal, the sole issue presented is whether the parties will go to arbitration before the AAA in New York City or in Cleveland. In signing Swanzey\u2019s sales form No. 16355, Simon initially agreed to arbitrate any dispute in New York City. The question of whether the parties\u2019 subsequent exchange of unsigned invoices canceled, superseded or amended their original agreement is a matter that must be resolved at arbitration under the terms of that original agreement <em>(Matter of Popular Pub. [McCall Corp.], </em>36 AD2d 927). Therefore, while the AAA will normally determine the locale of arbitration under section 10 of its rules, the parties in this proceeding have set the locale in New York City by their own agreement.
