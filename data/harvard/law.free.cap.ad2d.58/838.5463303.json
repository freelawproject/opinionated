With respect to the People\u2019s refusal to grant immunity see <em>People v Sapia </em>(41 NY2d 160). We have considered appellants\u2019 other arguments and find them without merit. The case is remitted to the Supreme Court, Queens County, for further proceedings pursuant to CPL 460.50 (subd 5) as to defendant Conti. Cohalan, J. P., Damiani, Hawkins and Mollen, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
