Determination confirmed insofar as reviewed and proceeding dismissed on the merits, with costs. There is substantial evidence in the record to support the finding that Dorothy Forman had demonstrated untrustworthiness when she made racially discriminatory remarks. The penalty imposed was proper (see <em>Matter of Butterly &amp; Green v Lomenzo, </em>36 NY2d 250). Hopkins, J. P., Martuscello, Margett and O\u2019Connor, JJ. concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
