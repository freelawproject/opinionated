L. c. 93A (c. 93A), to the Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund (insolvency fund, or fund). In <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>456 Mass. 594, 596 (2010) <em>(Wheatley I), </em>we held that the insolvency fund was subject \u201cto consumer actions brought pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1).\u201d We conclude in the present case that where, as here, a plaintiff prevails in a consumer action against the insolvency fund under c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), the insolvency fund is liable for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (4). We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-15\"><em>Background. </em>The facts of this ongoing dispute are described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>in detail in <em>Wheatley I, </em>456 Mass, at 596-598. We summarize briefly those facts and proceedings relevant to this decision, primarily taken from the parties\u2019 joint statement of agreed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The insolvency fund is an unincorporated association, created by the Legislature, for the purpose of settling unpaid claims covered by an insurance policy issued by an insurer that later becomes insolvent. G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7\u00a7 1 (5), 2, 3. See <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>373 Mass. 798, 799 (1977). In October, 2001, the plaintiff, Kirsten M. Wheatley, then a special education student at a public elementary school in the town of Duxbury (town), fell and sustained injuries while unsupervised at school. At the time of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, the town was insured by Legion Insurance Company (Legion). In August, 2003 (by which time Legion had been declared insolvent by a Pennsylvania court), the plaintiff presented a claim to the town based on her injuries, in compliance with the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258. Under G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 5, the insolvency fund was obligated to defend the town against the plaintiff\u2019s claim. By July, 2004, the insolvency fund had made no offer to settle the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and the plaintiff filed a negligence action against the town in the Superior Court. The insolvency fund appointed counsel to defend the town in that action. The plaintiff prevailed, and a judgment in the amount of $20,786.31 entered in her favor. The insolvency fund has paid the judgment in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">On November 1, 2004, after the insolvency fund had failed to take any action to settle the plaintiff\u2019s negligence action against the town, the plaintiff sent a written demand letter to the fund pursuant to c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3). The insolvency fund failed to respond within thirty days of receiving the letter. On August 31, 2006, the plaintiff commenced the present action against the insolvency fund pursuant to c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), asserting wilful violations of G. L. c. 176D (c. 176D), \u00a7 3 (9), and c. 93A, \u00a7 2. A judge in the Superior Court thereafter allowed the insolvency fund\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, agreeing with the fund that it was not subject to being sued in a consumer action brought under c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">After this court decided in <em>Wheatley I </em>that the insolvency fund was subject to consumer actions under c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>and remanded the case to the Superior Court, see <em>Wheatley I, </em>456 Mass, at 596, 611, the parties settled the plaintiff\u2019s c. 93A, \u00a7 9, claim for damages on account of the insolvency fund\u2019s violation of c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9), leaving open the question whether the plaintiff was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (4). The parties thereafter filed cross motions for summary judgment on that issue. A different Superior Court judge (motion judge) allowed the plaintiff\u2019s motion, concluding that the question of the fund\u2019s liability for attorney\u2019s fees had effectively been answered in the affirmative in <em>Wheatley I, </em>and the same answer was also compelled by at least one other decision of this court, <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>434 Mass. 556, 564 (2001) <em>{Hopkins).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The insolvency fund appealed, and thereafter this court allowed its motion for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1) (\u00a7 9 [1]), which authorizes civil actions by consumers to enforce or recover for violation of the consumer protection act, contains two prongs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the first prong, a person \u201cwho has been injured by another person\u2019s use or employment of any method, act or practice declared to be unlawful by [\u00a7 2]\u201d may bring an action for damages in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Under the second prong, any person \u201cwhose rights are affected by another person violating the provisions of [c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9),] may bring an action in the superior court.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>As the decision in <em>Wheatley I </em>recounted, 456 Mass, at 599-600, in 1992, this court decided in <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>412 Mass. 774, <em>111 </em>(1992) <em>(Barrett), </em>that the insolvency fund was not liable and subject to suit under c. 93A because the fund did not engage in \u201ctrade or commerce,\u201d or otherwise operate in a \u201cbusiness context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 775-776. In 1994, we reached the same conclusion in <em>Poznik </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Med. Professional Ins. Ass\u2019n, </em>417 Mass. 48, 53 (1994) <em>(Poznik), </em>with respect to the Massachusetts Medical Professional Insurance Association (MMPIA), a statutorily created joint underwriting association. See <em>id. </em>at 50. Not long thereafter, the Legislature amended c. 176D, \u00a7 1, to include the insolvency fund and any joint underwriting association within the definition of \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of that statute. St. 1996, c. 313 (1996 amendment). See <em>Wheatley I, </em>456 Mass, at 595 &amp; n.3, 599-600. We concluded in <em>Wheatley I </em>that in adding the insolvency fund and joint underwriting associations to this statutory definition, the Legislature in substance was defining these entities as being \u201cperson[sj\u201d that engaged \u201cin the business of insurance\u201d for purposes of c. 176D, their activities therefore were covered by G. L. c. 93A, and the insolvency fund was subject to a consumer action brought under \u00a7 9 (1). See <em>Wheatley I, supra </em>at 601-604. More particularly, we interpreted the 1996 amendment as a legislative effort to abrogate our <em>Barrett </em>and <em>Poznik </em>decisions. <em>Wheatley I, supra </em>at 608-609.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In the present case, the insolvency fund underscores the fact that \u00a7 9 (1) has two separate prongs that identify two separate types of consumer injury for which a consumer may seek recovery in a court action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It argues that although, after <em>Wheatley I, </em>the insolvency fund may be liable under \u00a7 9 (1) for compensatory damages to a consumer injured by an unfair claims settlement practice, by definition, liability is limited to the type of injury described in \u00a7 9 (l)\u2019s <em>second </em>prong, that is, a violation of c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9). Therefore, the fund is not liable for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 9 (4),* <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because such fees are only recoverable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>where the defendant has been found liable for a violation of c. 93A, \u00a7 2, and liability for a violation of \u00a7 2 is only available under the <em>first </em>prong of \u00a7 9 (1). Furthermore, because <em>Wheatley I </em>did not specifically address the question whether the fund could be found liable under the first prong of \u00a7 9 (1), the motion judge erred in reading that decision to do so. The fund\u2019s argument fails on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">First, nothing in the language of the 1996 amendment indicates or suggests that the Legislature intended to subject the insolvency fund to liability under c. 93A <em>only </em>pursuant to the second prong of \u00a7 9 (1). This is hardly surprising, given that the 1996 amendment makes no direct mention of c. 93A; it amends only c. 176D, \u00a7 1 <em>(a). </em>See St. 1996, c. 313. Moreover, the second prong of \u00a7 9 (1) was added to c. 93A well before the 1996 amendment, and for reasons having nothing to do with the insolvency fund. See <em>Hopkins, </em>434 Mass, at 565 n.12.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, the reference to c. 176D in the second prong of \u00a7 9 (1) cannot be read as reflecting a legislative intent to restrict the fund\u2019s liability under c. 93A to that prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Second, the insolvency fund is not correct that <em>Wheatley I </em>left open the question whether the fund could be found liable under the first prong of \u00a7 9 (1). We concluded in the case that the 1996 amendment had the effect of defining the fund as being \u201cin the <em>business </em>of insurance\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Wheatley I, </em>456 Mass, at 602-606. Implicit in this conclusion is the fact that for the purposes of c. 93A, the insolvency fund operates in a \u201cbusiness context,\u201d see <em>Barrett, </em>412 Mass, at 775, and thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>engages in \u201cthe conduct of trade or commerce\u201d within the meaning of c. 93A, \u00a7 2. As a result, the insolvency fund is subject to liability to consumers under the first prong of \u00a7 9 (1), for business acts or practices, including claim settlement acts or practices, that are unfair or deceptive and therefore unlawful under c. 93A, \u00a7 2. See, e.g., <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Arbella Mut. Ins. Co., </em>426 Mass. 683, 684 (1998).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">In sum, although we did not state expressly in <em>Wheatley I </em>that the insolvency fund was subject to c. 93A liability under both prongs of \u00a7 9 (1), our analysis of the 1996 amendment\u2019s effect and intent \u2014 namely, to abrogate the <em>Barrett </em>and <em>Poznik </em>decisions \u2014 indicates that this was indeed our conclusion. The motion judge correctly interpreted the <em>Wheatley I </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The motion judge also relied on our decision in <em>Hopkins, </em>434 Mass, at 563-565, in concluding that the insolvency fund was liable to pay reasonable attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (4). We agree with the judge\u2019s analysis. The plaintiff in <em>Hopkins </em>suffered substantial personal injuries as a result of a multivehicle accident, and brought suit against the insurance company insuring two of the drivers who were at fault in the accident. She claimed that the defendant insurer had committed knowing and wilful violations of c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9) (/), and c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 9, by engaging in unfair and deceptive claim settlement practices. <em>Hopkins, </em>434 Mass, at 557-558. The insurer argued, as the insolvency fund does here, that it was not liable for multiple damages or attorney\u2019s fees under c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3) and (4), respectively, because in substance the plaintiff\u2019s claim of unfair claim settlement practices in violation of c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9) (/), was not a violation of c. 93A, \u00a7 2, and recovery of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>multiple damages and attorney\u2019s fees is limited to cases involving violations of c. 93A, \u00a7 2. <em>Hopkins, supra </em>at 563-564. We rejected this argument. <em>Id. </em>at 563-565. We stated that c. 93A, \u00a7 2, \u201cincorporates\u201d c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9), \u201cand an insurer that has violated G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9) (/), by failing \u2018to effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear,\u2019 by definition has violated the prohibition of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2.\u201d <em>Hopkins, supra </em>at 564, quoting c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9) (/).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The insolvency fund characterizes the result in <em>Hopkins </em>as \u201cunsurprising!],\u201d but irrelevant here. The fund\u2019s lack of surprise, it claims, derives from the fact that the defendant insurer in that case, Liberty Mutual, was a traditional, for-profit insurance company. As such, its business clearly came within the scope of the definition of \u201ctrade\u201d and \u201ccommerce\u201d in c. 93A, \u00a7 1, and therefore was covered by the proscription in c. 93A, \u00a7 2 <em>(a), </em>against \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d The insolvency fund, on the other hand, is not an insurance company. It does not earn a profit, cannot collect premiums or issue insurance policies, and therefore, in the fund\u2019s view, its activities do not meet the definition of \u201ctrade\u201d or \u201ccommerce.\u201d As discussed above, the premise underlying the insolvency fund\u2019s position is simply incorrect: following the 1996 amendment, the fund is in \u201cthe business of insurance\u201d for purposes of c. 176D and c. 93A, and therefore in exactly the same position as a traditional for-profit insurer such as Liberty Mutual \u2014 that is, subject to the provisions of both statutes. As the motion judge concluded, this court\u2019s analysis of the interrelationship between c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9) (/), and c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 9, in <em>Hopkins </em>is directly on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The insolvency fund further contends, as it did in <em>Wheatley I, </em>456 Mass, at 607-608, 609-610 &amp; n.30, that subjecting it to attorney\u2019s fees and the possibility of multiple damages would represent a radical change in the law and contravene the provisions of its governing statute, G. L. c. 175D, that strictly limit the circumstances in which the fund is obligated to cover obligations of insolvent insurers. Moreover, any requirement that the insolvency fund pay attorney\u2019s fees or multiple damages for violations of c. 93A would have the unwelcome effect of shifting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>onto insurers, and eventually the insurance-buying public, an increased financial burden. All we decide today is that a plaintiff who prevails in a consumer action brought against the insolvency fund pursuant to \u00a7 9 (1) is entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs under c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (4). We continue to leave for another day the question whether the insolvency fund may be liable for multiple damages under c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3). See <em>Wheatley </em>/, <em>supra </em>at 610 (\u201cWe do not consider and do not decide whether any of the statutory limitations on the insolvency fund\u2019s obligations to pay claims set forth in G. L. c. 175D and elsewhere apply as well to any damages that may be awarded against the insolvency fund under G. L. c. 93A\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Tased on his decision, the motion judge entered a judgment awarding the plaintiff $50,000 for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred.

Co., </em>373 Mass. 72, 81-82 (1977) <em>{Dodd), </em>where we had concluded that although c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (a), applied to unfair or deceptive insurance practices, <em>Dodd, supra </em>at 78, \u00a7 9 (1) as then written only conferred a private right of action on consumers who purchased policies from the company, not on additional insureds or third-party claimants: \u201cThe effect of the [1979] amendment [to \u00a7 9 (1)] was to broaden the class of persons who could bring private causes of action for unfair insurance claim settlement practices, beyond purchasers of insurance.\u201d <em>Hopkins, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Moreover, as the plaintiff points out, in <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>456 Mass. 594 (2010) <em>(Wheatley I), </em>after analyzing the insolvency fund\u2019s post-1996 amendment status as an entity \u201cin the business of insurance\u201d and the connection between that status and liability under c. 93A, we considered the application of the second prong of \u00a7 9 (1) to the insolvency fund and specifically characterized that application as constituting a \u201csecond\u201d and \u201cindependent\u201d basis on which the fund would be subject to c. 93A liability. <em>Wheatley I, supra </em>at 606-607. This choice of adjectives indicates that the \u201cfirst\u201d basis of liability was the one tied to the insolvency fund being \u201cin the business of insurance\u201d \u2014 which, as discussed in the text, leads to the conclusion that c. 93A, \u00a7 2, applies to the insolvency fund, and that therefore the fund may be subject to a consumer action under the first prong of \u00a7 9 (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\">It is worth mentioning, however, that in contrast to the insolvency fund\u2019s obligations under G.
