P. 15 (a) (2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996), and ordered the appeal to proceed in this court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because we conclude that, on the particular facts of this case, Carrie could vicariously consent to the recording of the victim\u2019s oral communications, we affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the judge\u2019s findings of fact, supplemented with uncontested testimony adduced at the evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah, </em>448 Mass. 334, 337 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>(2007), and cases cited. The defendant\u2019s son has two daughters by different mothers: the victim, who is autistic and mute,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Carrie, the victim\u2019s older half-sister. The defendant\u2019s son lived in a room at the defendant\u2019s home in Melrose. When the victim was with her father,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> she would spend most of her time in his bedroom watching television and movies.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">Carrie claimed that, while visiting her father at the defendant\u2019s home when she was between three and fourteen years of age, the defendant repeatedly inappropriately touched her. When she was thirteen or fourteen years of age, Carrie informed her grandmother, the defendant\u2019s wife who lived with him, about the defendant\u2019s actions. Carrie testified that the touching \u201cwould stop for about three days, and then continued on.\u201d Eventually Carrie decided to \u201cstay away\u201d from her father\u2019s family. When she was nineteen years of age, however, Carrie decided to see her father\u2019s family again.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">In February, 2010, near the victim\u2019s twelfth birthday, Carrie, then twenty-seven years of age, noticed changes in the victim\u2019s temperament and behavior. The victim, who ordinarily was happy, which was exhibited by her smiles and laughter, suddenly was crying a lot and was tensing her body. Carrie suspected that the changes in the victim\u2019s behavior were due to the defendant sexually abusing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">On March 21, 2010, Carrie set up a hidden video camera in the bedroom used by her father in the defendant\u2019s home, aiming the camera at the bed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Carrie left the video camera recording for approximately six hours, during which time the victim was periodically alone with the defendant and her grandmother.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That evening, after retrieving the video camera and watching the video recording,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Carrie went to the Melrose police depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>ment to report her belief that the defendant had sexually abused the victim. Carrie spoke with Detective Lieutenant Paul Norton. She informed him of what her grandfather allegedly had done to her in the past and that she had set up the video camera because she suspected that he might be sexually assaulting the victim. When they finished meeting, Carrie went home and transferred the video recording onto six digital video discs (DVDs), which she delivered to the police station the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">On March 23, after viewing the DVDs, Detective Lieutenant Norton called the defendant and asked him to come to the police station. The defendant promptly complied and on his arrival was escorted into an interview room where Norton, in the presence of another detective, read him the Miranda warnings from a form. The defendant signed the form, indicating that he understood his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">Norton asked the defendant about his relationship with Carrie and whether he had ever sexually abused her. The defendant responded that he used to \u201cplay rough\u201d with Carrie and may have \u201cpatted her on the ass before,\u201d but that he never touched her inappropriately. Turning to the defendant\u2019s relationship with the victim, Norton asked the defendant what he would say if, hypothetically, Norton had an audio and video recording of the defendant in the room with the victim. Norton proceeded to inform the defendant that this \u201cvideo\u201d hypothetically showed the defendant walking up, undoing his zipper, and taking his right hand and putting it around the back of the victim\u2019s head saying, \u201cPut it in your mouth.\u201d The defendant said, \u201cI did wrong,\u201d and that he \u201chad just wanted to see what she would do and got carried away.\u201d The defendant added that he usually kisses the victim and again, that he \u201cgot carried away.\u201d He also admitted that \u201cit\u201d had happened before, namely, during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>week of the victim\u2019s birthday. Norton ended the interview and placed the defendant under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cIn reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error \u2018but conduct an independent review of [her] ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>440 Mass. 642, 646 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 218 (2002). The defendant argues that the judge should have suppressed the audio portion of the recording under the Federal wiretap statute. A brief overview of the statute is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">The Federal wiretap statute, as relevant here, \u201cmakes it a crime, except in limited circumstances, to intentionally intercept [an oral communication] or to intentionally disclose the contents of such a communication.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Damiano, </em>444 Mass. 444, 447 (2005), quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511. In addition to providing criminal penalties for violations of the statute, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(4)(a) (2006) (violators \u201cshall be fined . . . or imprisoned not more than five years, or both\u201d), the statute also provides civil remedies for any person whose oral communication was intercepted, see <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 2520(a) &amp; (b) (2006). Further, the statute contains an exclusionary rule provision, \u201cprohibiting] the admission in evidence of unlawfully intercepted \u2018wire\u2019 or \u2018oral\u2019 (but not \u2018electronic\u2019) communications, and evidence derived therefrom.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Damiano, supra </em>at 447-448. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2515 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">An \u201coral communication\u201d under the Federal wiretap statute is defined as \u201cany oral communication uttered by a person exhibiting an expectation that such communication is not subject to interception under circumstances justifying such expectation . . . .\u201d See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(2) (2006). Thus, a defendant \u201cseeking to suppress a recording [must show that he] had a legitimate expectation of privacy when he made the recorded statements.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>445 Mass. 119, 128 (2005), citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(2). \u201cIn determining whether a defendant has made the requisite showing, courts apply the familiar standards of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>\u201cConversations intercepted with the consent of either of the parties are explicitly exempted from Title III liability.\u201d <em>Pollock </em>v. <em>Pollock, </em>154 F.3d 601, 606 (6th Cir. 1998). Under the so-called \u201cconsent exception\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-5\">\u201cIt shall not be unlawful ... for a person not acting under color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication where such person is a party to the communication or where one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception unless such communication is intercepted for the purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(d) (2006) (consent exception).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">a. <em>Legitimate expectation of privacy. </em>The Commonwealth argues that no unlawful interception occurred under the Federal wiretap statute because the defendant had no legitimate expectation of privacy either in the location the recording occurred or in the content of his statements that were recorded. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, supra. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">The Commonwealth first asserts that the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his son\u2019s bedroom, adding that the defendant did not even lock the bedroom door at the time of the recording. This fact, however, does not mandate a conclusion that the defendant lacked a legitimate expectation of privacy in the room. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion, the record does not establish that the defendant\u2019s son \u201chad exclusive access and control\u201d over his bedroom. The Commonwealth ignores the fact that the defendant\u2019s son had left the house with Carrie without limiting his father\u2019s access to his room. Significantly, the record contains no information concerning the son\u2019s arrangement with his parents to use a room in their home, whether he paid rent to do so, or even if there was a means to lock it. In these circumstances, there is no reason to depart from the express mandate set forth in our Federal and State Constitutions that \u201cevery person has the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures in his home.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porter P, </em>456 Mass. 254, 260 (2010). See Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution (\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>right of the people to be secure in their persons, <em>houses, </em>papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated ...\u201d [emphasis added]); art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights (\u201cEvery subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches, and seizures, of his person, his <em>houses, </em>his papers, and all his possessions\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 585 (1980), quoting <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 630 (1886) (Fourth Amendment \u201capplies] to all invasions [by] government of the sanctity of a man\u2019s home\u201d). We conclude that the defendant had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the bedroom his son occupied in his (the defendant\u2019s) home. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>$40,995.00 in United States Currency, </em>554 F.3d 752, 754, 757 (9th Cir.), cert, denied sub nom. <em>El Farra </em>v. <em>United States, </em>558 U.S. 895 (2009) (concluding that \u201cuncontested declarations of ownership and occupancy established [parents\u2019] expectations of privacy in the entire home, which included [defendant\u2019s] bedroom\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">Relying on <em>Bartnicki </em>v. <em>Vopper, </em>532 U.S. 514 (2001), the Commonwealth contends that the defendant \u201cenjoys little to no legitimate expectation of privacy in statements concerning his . . . [subjugation] of a minor child to physical or sexual abuse.\u201d The <em>Bartnicki </em>decision, however, is factually distinguishable from this case. In <em>Bartnicki, supra </em>at 518-519, the United States Supreme Court was not concerned with the admissibility of an illegally intercepted communication, but rather with the liability of a radio commentator and a citizen who were given the tape of an illegally intercepted conversation, made during contentious collective bargaining negotiations, between the president of a teachers\u2019 union and the union\u2019s chief negotiator. The radio commentator and citizen separately published the content of the tape, which contained the union president\u2019s threat to \u201cblow off\u201d the \u201cfront porches\u201d of school board members. <em>Id. </em>Where the publishers of the threat had not unlawfully obtained the information, the Court concluded that because the intercepted speech was \u201cunquestionably a matter of public concern, and [the press] were clearly engaged in a debate about that concern,\u201d the First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited recovery of damages against them. <em>Id. </em>at 517-518, 525, 535. In his concurring opinion, Justice Breyer noted that \u201c[w]here publication of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>private information constitutes a wrongful act, the law recognizes a privilege allowing the reporting of threats to public safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539 (Breyer, J., concurring). This language, however, must be viewed in context with the facts of the <em>Bartnicki </em>case. Here, we are not concerned with a public threat and our decision involves the admissibility of the oral communications of the recording, not the liability of Carrie for publishing its content to police. The <em>Bartnicki </em>decision simply does not apply in determining whether the defendant had a legitimate expectation of privacy when he made the recorded statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">b. <em>Vicarious consent exception. </em>The Commonwealth argues that the vicarious consent doctrine of the consent exception applies in this case and therefore the audio portion of the recording is admissible. The consent provision of the Federal wiretap statute has been interpreted to allow a parent or guardian, acting to protect the welfare of his or her child or children, to vicariously consent to the recording of the child\u2019s conversations with another. See <em>Thompson </em>v. Dulaney, 838 F. Supp. 1535, 1543-1544 (D. Utah 1993). The United States District Court for the District of Utah was the first Federal court to adopt the doctrine of vicarious consent and did so in the context of custody proceedings where one parent recorded the other parent\u2019s conversations with the couple\u2019s two minor children, then three and five years of age. <em>Id. </em>at 1537. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-6\">\u201c[A]s long as the guardian has a good faith basis that is objectionably reasonable for believing that it is necessary to consent on behalf of her minor children to the taping of the phone conversations, vicarious consent will be permissible in order for the guardian to fulfill her statutory mandate to act in the best interests of the children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1544. The court cautioned that its holding was \u201cvery narrow\u201d and \u201climited\u201d to its facts. <em>Id. </em>at 1544 n.8. Other Federal courts have adopted the vicarious consent doctrine.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Pollock </em>v. Pollock, 154 F.3d 601, 610 (6th Cir. 1998); <em>March </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number><em>Levine, </em>136 F. Supp. 2d 831, 848 n.39 (M.D. Tenn. 2000), cert, denied, 534 U.S. 1080 (2002); <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Wagner, </em>64 F. Supp. 2d 895, 896 (D. Minn. 1999); <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Price, </em>2 F. Supp. 2d 1186, 1191 (E.D. Ark. 1998). The fundamental premise for applying the doctrine is that there are compelling circumstances making it \u201cnecessary to protect [a] child from harm.\u201d <em>Pollock </em>v. <em>Pollock, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Many State courts also have adopted the vicarious consent doctrine either under the consent exception of the Federal wiretap statute, or under the cognate provision of their State wiretapping statute. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitner, </em>399 S.C. 547, 554 (2012) (adopting vicarious consent doctrine under State wiretap statute that was patterned on Federal wiretap statute); <em>State </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>737 N.W.2d 124, 132 (Iowa 2007) (permitting, under State wiretap statute, parents to vicariously consent for minor); <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>308 NJ. Super. 504, 510, 516 (1998) (under State wiretap statute, which was \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to Federal wiretap statute, parents could vicariously consent to recording involving their infant child who was being physically abused by nanny). Without specifying which exemption applied, the Appeals Court addressed this issue and concluded that \u201ca recording by parents of their own minor son talking on the telephone in their own home, motivated by concerns that he was being sexually exploited by an adult,\u201d was not illegal under the Federal wiretap statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barboza, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 99, 107, cert, denied, 537 U.S. 887 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Were the victim\u2019s father the person who made the recording at issue here, we would not hesitate to apply the vicarious consent doctrine. We are confronted, however, with an issue of first impression, namely, whether to interpret the vicarious consent doctrine to allow a nonparent, and specifically, the adult half-sister of the victim, to vicariously consent to the oral communications of her half-sister. We know of no Federal or State court that has interpreted the vicarious consent doctrine in this manner; conversely, we know of no court that has been asked to do so and refused. The circumstances of this case support application of the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">We first point out that the defendant does not challenge the fact that the victim was incapable of providing consent. Nor does he contest that Carrie was acting at all times to protect her half-sister, that she was acting in the victim\u2019s best interests, or that Carrie had a good faith basis for doing so. Thus, if Carrie were a parent or a legal guardian of the victim, there would be no doubt that application of the vicarious consent doctrine would be appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">When we speak of child welfare, we generally speak in terms of a <em>parent\u2019s </em>duty to act in the best interest of his or her child. See <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649, 657 (2002), cert, denied, 537 U.S. 1189 (2003) <em>(Blixt) </em>(\u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard \u201chas long been used in Massachusetts to decide issues of custody and visitation and other issues relating to child welfare\u201d). See also <em>Bellotti </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>443 U.S. 622, 635, 639 (1979) (parents have duty to protect their child because children \u201coften lack the experience, perspective, and judgment to recognize and avoid choices that could be detrimental to them\u201d). A fundamental right of parental autonomy rests \u201con a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making life\u2019s difficult decisions. More important, historically it has recognized that natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interests of their children.\u201d <em>Troxel </em>v. <em>Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 68 (2000), quoting <em>Parham </em>v. <em>J.R., </em>442 U.S. 584, 602 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u201cParental rights, however, are not absolute.\u201d <em>E.N.O. </em>v. <em>L.M.M., </em>429 Mass. 824, 832, cert, denied, 528 U.S. 1005 (1999). \u201cIt cannot be disputed that the State has a compelling interest to protect children from actual or potential harm.\u201d <em>Blixt, supra </em>at 656, and cases cited. See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court for Norfolk County, </em>457 U.S. 596, 607-608 (1982) (\u201csafeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor\u201d constitutes \u201ccompelling\u201d State interest). \u201cThis interest is expressed in a variety of statutes and proceedings, ranging from the complete severance of parental rights on a judge\u2019s finding of parental unfitness, to the limitation of parental choices in the areas, for example, of education, health care, and safety\u201d (footnotes omitted). <em>Blixt, supra. </em>See <em>Sher </em>v. <em>Desmond, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 270, 283-284 (2007) (possibility of ongoing physical abuse and pattern of isolating child from family warranted grandparent visitation to protect child from further significant harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Significantly, the State has not reserved exclusively either to itself or to parents the duty to protect children and to prevent harm (or further harm) to children. For example, certain individuals who work with children or who come into contact with children by virtue of their employment, who \u201cha[ve] reasonable cause to believe that a child is suffering from physical or emotional injury resulting from . . . sexual abuse,\u201d are required, hence are \u201cmandated reporters,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to notify the Department of Children and Families (department). See G. L. c. 119, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u00a7 51A (a). Indeed, \u201c[a]ny person may file a report [with the department] if that person has reasonable cause to believe that a child is suffering from . . . abuse or neglect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 51A (/). There are no parental notification requirements imposed on anyone before filing a report. If a report is made in \u201cgood faith\u201d and \u201cthe reporter did not cause the [reported] abuse or neglect,\u201d the reporter, whether it be a mandated reporter or any \u201cother person,\u201d will not be \u201cliable in any civil or criminal action for filing [the] report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 51 (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">In this case, we turn to these principles because the Federal wiretap statute is silent on the issue before us and traditionally issues of child protection have been matters left to the States. See <em>Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Newdow, </em>542 U.S. 1, 13 (2004) (\u201cin general it is appropriate for the federal courts to leave delicate issues of domestic relations to the [S]tate courts\u201d); <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>484 U.S. 174, 186 n.4 (1988) (United States Supreme Court traditionally reserves \u201cdomestic relation matters to the [S]tates\u201d). See also <em>Bellotti </em>v. <em>Baird, supra </em>at 639, quoting <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>New York, </em>390 U.S. 629, 639 (1968) (\u201cUnder the Constitution, the State can \u2018properly conclude that parents and others, teachers for example, who have [the] primary responsibility for children\u2019s well-being are entitled to the support of laws designed to aid discharge of that responsibility\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Here, the record is silent as to what, if any knowledge the victim\u2019s father may have had concerning the sexual abuse of the victim.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We are not confident in the circumstances of this case that the \u201cnatural bonds of affection,\u201d <em>Troxel </em>v. <em>Granville, supra, </em>necessarily would have motivated him to act in the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>best interests on learning of the abuse. We say this because he would have faced conflicting loyalties between protecting his daughter, the victim, and protecting his own father, the defendant. Assuming, however, that the victim\u2019s father did not know of the sexual abuse, the abuse continued<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and the victim, because of her autism, was unable physically to disclose the occurrence of that sexual abuse to her father. Without intervention, the sexual abuse may very well have occurred again. In these circumstances, it was understandable, and objectively reasonable, that Carrie sought to act on behalf of the victim in order to protect her from actual and substantial physical and emotional harm. In view of the policy to afford minors \u201ca unique and protected status,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A </em>Juvenile, 389 Mass. 128, 132 (1983), and also to protect those with disabilities from abuse, see <em>Cooney </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Retardation, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 378, 382-383 (2001), we conclude that where there is an adult sibling who is acting in good faith and in the best interests of a child, where the danger to the child is posed by a parent of the child\u2019s parent, and where, for that reason, a reasonable person in the sibling\u2019s position would have reason to fear that the child\u2019s parent may not act in the best interest of the child to protect the child from actual or potential harm, then the adult sibling may safeguard the child by giving vicarious consent. Our conclusion is consistent with the State\u2019s \u201ccompelling interest in protecting children from actual or potential harm,\u201d <em>Blixt, supra </em>at 656, to which the privacy interests of the grandfather must yield. We cannot imagine that Congress would not similarly embrace such a policy. Indeed, were we to hold to the contrary, Carrie would be subject to criminal prosecution, a result that we do not believe Congress intended. See <em>Scheib </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>22 F.3d 149, 154 (7th Cir.), cert, denied, 513 U.S. 929 (1994) (\u201cWe cannot attribute to Congress the intent to subject parents to criminal and civil penalties for recording their minor child\u2019s phone conversations out of concern for that child\u2019s well-being\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">One final matter must be addressed. The defendant contends that his statements to police should be suppressed under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine set forth in <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 487-488 (1963). We reject this argument because Carrie vicariously consented to the recording in accordance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(d), thus there was no \u201cprimary illegality\u201d to exploit in order to obtain the defendant\u2019s statements. <em>Id. </em>at 488, quoting Maguire, Evidence of Guilt 221 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The motion to suppress was properly denied. The order denying motion to suppress is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b20-11\">A pseudonym, see G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 24C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b20-12\">Autism is defined as \u201ca mental disorder characterized by severely abnormal development of social interaction and of verbal and nonverbal communication skills. . . . The disorder is probably caused by organically based central nervous system dysfunction, especially in the ability to process social or emotional information or language.\u201d Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary 183-184 (28th ed. 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b20-13\">The defendant did not move to suppress the video portion of the recording because it is well-established that the Federal wiretap statute does not prohibit domestic silent video surveillance. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Falls, </em>34 F.3d 674, 679-680 (8th Cir. 1994); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Koyomejian, </em>970 F.2d 536, 540 (9th Cir. 1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b20-14\">We do not consider the defendant\u2019s conclusory assertion that his oral com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>munications should be suppressed under the Massachusetts wiretap statute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, because it does not rise to the level of acceptable appellate argument. See Mass. R. A. R 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eberhart, </em>461 Mass. 809, 814 n.10 (2012), and cases cited. That said, suppression of these communications, as the defendant concedes, is not mandated under the Massachusetts wiretap statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santoro, </em>406 Mass. 421, 423 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b21-10\">A Middlesex County grand jury also returned indictments charging the defendant with two offenses against Carrie (over a six-year period from 1990 to 1996) including assault on a child under the age of sixteen with intent to rape, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 24B, and forcible rape of a child under the age of sixteen, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b21-11\">In pursuing his appeal, the defendant neglected to file a notice of appeal in the trial court and did not timely file his application for leave to file an interlocutory appeal, see Mass. R. Crim. R 15 (b) (1), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996) (\u201cAn application for leave to appeal under subdivision [a] [2] shall be made by filing within ten days of the issuance of notice of the order being appealed, or such additional time as either the trial judge or the single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court shall order\u201d). Although the Commonwealth raised both of these issues in the county court, the Commonwealth does not assert the challenges here. In the circumstances, and in view of the significance of the issue underlying the interlocutory appeal, we decline to comment on the procedural propriety of the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b21-12\">Two witnesses testified on behalf of the Commonwealth at the evidentiary hearing: Carrie, who first waived her right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and Detective Lieutenant Paul Norton of the Melrose police department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b22-8\">The victim communicates through tapping and pointing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b22-9\">The victim would regularly visit her father at the defendant\u2019s home.

The defendant could be heard on the recording repeatedly instructing [the victim] to \u2018put it in your mouth.\u2019 The defendant was also seen in the recording placing his hand over [the victim\u2019s] head and directing her head towards his groin. At this time, and on other occasions outside of the camera\u2019s viewing, sucking/slurping noises could be heard. At times, [the victim] could also be seen moving her head in a downward motion.\u201d Based on our review of the recording, this description is accurate. We add that when the defendant told the victim to \u201cput it in your mouth,\u201d he did so in a whisper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b27-8\">Some Federal courts have broadly interpreted the so-called \u201cextension telephone exemption\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(5)(a)(i) (2006) to permit a parent to record a conversation of a minor child from an extension telephone within the home.
