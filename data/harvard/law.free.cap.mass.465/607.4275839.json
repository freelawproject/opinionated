(Jan-Pro). Depianti alleges, inter alia, that Jan-Pro misclassified him as an independent contractor, see G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B, and committed various wage law violations. A judge of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts certified the following questions to this court, pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 1:03, as appearing in 382 Mass. 700 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">\u201c[1.] Whether a plaintiff\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant to [G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150,] by filing a complaint with the Attorney General deprives a court of jurisdiction to consider the plaintiff\u2019s claims under [G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148, 148B, and 150,] and under [G. L. c. 151, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 1A],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\u201c[2.] Whether and how to apply the \u2018right to control test\u2019 for vicarious liability to the franchisor-franchisee relationship. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">\u201c[3.] Whether a defendant may be liable for employee misclassification under [G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B,] where there was no contract for service between the plaintiff and defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">We answer the first question, \u201cNo.\u201d We answer the second question, \u201cYes,\u201d with further discussion concerning the application of the \u201cright to control test\u201d to the franchisor-franchisee relationship. We answer the third question, \u201cYes.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">1. <em>Background. </em>Jan-Pro is a Massachusetts corporation \u201cin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>the business of operating and franchising comprehensive cleaning and maintenance businesses.\u201d It sells regional rights to use the Jan-Pro brand to so-called \u201cregional master franchisees.\u201d Upon purchasing these rights, regional master franchisees become the exclusive franchisors of the Jan-Pro brand within defined geographic areas. Regional master franchisees, in turn, sell the right to use the Jan-Pro brand to so-called \u201cunit franchisees,\u201d who perform cleaning services for customers. Unit franchisees are provided with customer accounts by regional master franchisees, though unit franchisees may solicit additional business on their own. All customer accounts so obtained become the property of regional master franchisees.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Regional master franchisees invoice customers directly and receive payment for cleaning services rendered by unit franchisees. They deduct certain fees from the gross revenue collected and remit the balance to unit franchisees. They pay a portion of the fees deducted from the gross revenue to Jan-Pro, in the form of royalties.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Depianti contracted with BradleyMktg Enterprises, Inc. (Bradley), a Jan-Pro regional master franchisee operating in Massachusetts, to purchase a Jan-Pro unit franchise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>He performed cleaning services under the Jan-Pro name from approximately June, 2003, through December, 2006. In 2008, he filed a putative class action against Jan-Pro in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging unfair and deceptive business practices in violation of G. L. c. 93A; misclassification as an independent contractor in violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B; various wage law violations pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148 and 150, and G. L. c. 151, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 1A; intentional or negligent misrepresentation; quantum meruit; and unjust enrichment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Depianti\u2019s claims of unfair and deceptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>business practices and misrepresentation are based in part on alleged conduct of Bradley, not Jan-Pro, and therefore depend on Jan-Pro being held vicariously liable for the conduct of Bradley, its franchisee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By contrast, Depianti\u2019s misclassification and wage claims allege direct, rather than vicarious, liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Jan-Pro sought summary judgment as to all claims, and Depianti moved for partial summary judgment on the misclassification claim. After a hearing on the parties\u2019 motions, the United States District Court judge stated his intention to certify the second and third questions, set forth supra, to this court, and invited comment by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Jan-Pro thereafter argued that the misclassification claim should be dismissed, because Depianti neglected to file a complaint with the Attorney General pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150 (\u00a7 150),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> before initiating his action, thereby failing to exhaust his administrative remedies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The United States District Court judge determined that Jan-Pro had waived this argument by not raising it earlier in the litigation. However, pursuant to his independent obligation to ensure the United States District Court\u2019s jurisdiction, see <em>FW/PBS, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dallas, </em>493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990), the judge added the first question, set forth <em>supra, </em>to his certification order, to determine whether Depianti\u2019s failure to file a complaint with the Attorney General before bringing suit deprived the United States District Court of jurisdiction over his misclassification and wage claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Failure to file with the Attorney General. </em>The first reported question asks \u201c[w]hether a plaintiff\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant to [\u00a7 150] by filing a complaint with the Attorney General deprives a court of jurisdiction to consider the plaintiff\u2019s claims under [G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148, 148B, and 150,] and under [G. L. c. 151, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 1A].\u201d To this question, we answer, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 150, an individual alleging a violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148 or 148B, may bring a private civil action ninety days after filing a complaint with the Attorney General, or sooner if the Attorney General assents to such suit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Here, Depianti neglected to submit a complaint to the Attorney General before commencing his private action against Jan-Pro. As stated, however, the United States District Court judge ruled that Jan-Pro waived its objection to this procedural defect. Therefore, Depianti\u2019s failure first to file with the Attorney General is fatal to his misclassification and wage claims only if such failure deprives the United States District Court of jurisdiction. See <em>FW/PBS, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dallas, supra </em>(Federal court has independent duty to ensure its own jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In determining whether a procedural defect deprives a court of jurisdiction to hear a claim, we consider (1) to what extent the defect interferes with the \u201caccomplishment of the purposes implicit in the statutory scheme,\u201d and (2) to what extent the opposing party can \u201cjustifiably claim prejudice.\u201d <em>Schulte </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>369 Mass. 74, 79-80 (1975). Here, Depianti\u2019s failure to file a complaint with the Attorney General before initiating his action neither interfered with the accomplishment of the purposes implicit in \u00a7 150 nor prejudiced Jan-Pro.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The purposes implicit in \u00a7 150 are twofold. The first paragraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>of \u00a7 150 authorizes, but does not require, the Attorney General to bring criminal charges for alleged violations of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, the wage statute. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150. The second paragraph permits an individual alleging violations of certain employment statutes to bring a private suit for damages, but requires that such individual first file a complaint with the Attorney General. <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u00a7 150 establishes a permissive, two-tiered framework for enforcement: it permits both criminal enforcement of wage violations and private civil enforcement of wage and other employment violations. See <em>id. </em>See also G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 <em>21C </em>(authorizing Attorney General to enforce various employment statutes, including G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148 and 148B, and G. L. c. 151, \u00a7\u00a7 1A and IB, either civilly or criminally).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The Attorney General\u2019s right to enforce G. L. c. 149 and the right of private citizens to enforce provisions of that chapter represent parallel and distinct enforcement mechanisms. See <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Zenhire, Inc., </em>462 Mass. 164, 172 (2012). The requirement that a plaintiff file a complaint with the Attorney General before bringing a private suit is intended simply to ensure that the Attorney General receives notice of the alleged violations, so that she may investigate and prosecute such violations at her discretion. See <em>Nahigian </em>v. <em>Leonard, 233 </em>F. Supp. 2d 151, 164 (D. Mass. 2002) (\u201cthe purpose of Section 150\u2019s administrative requirement, rather than giving potential defendants notice and an opportunity to conciliate, seems to be to give the <em>Attorney General </em>notice that a crime [failure to pay wages] may be occurring\u201d). In this way, the statute ensures that private actions for wage violations do not come and go without the Attorney General ever being made aware of the alleged unlawful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The Massachusetts antidiscrimination statute, G. L. c. 15IB, offers a helpful contrast. That statute includes a similarly worded procedural requirement, permitting aggrieved individuals to bring private actions \u201cat the expiration of ninety days after the filing of a complaint with the [Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD)], or sooner if a commissioner assents in writing.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9. However, the filing of a complaint with MCAD triggers mandatory \u201cprompt investigation\u201d by that agency. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5. After such investigation, if MCAD determines that there is probable cause to credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>the allegations, it shall \u201cimmediately endeavor to eliminate the unlawful practice complained of. . .by conference, conciliation and persuasion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Melley </em>v. <em>Gillette Corp., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 511, 512 (1985). Where such efforts are unavailing, MCAD is to conduct a hearing on the matter, and may thereafter issue a cease and desist order or an order for affirmative relief, or impose civil penalties. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5. If, at the expiration of ninety days after the filing of the complaint with MCAD, the complainant elects to bring a civil action for damages, \u201cany complaint before the commission shall then be dismissed without prejudice, and the petitioner shall be barred from subsequently bringing a complaint on the same matter before the commission.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The purpose implicit in the antidiscrimination statute is to \u201cresolve claims of discrimination with fairness and efficiency\u201d via a \u201ccomprehensive remedial process.\u201d <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Holie Donut, Inc., </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 633, 639 (2012). In essence, the statute grants MCAD exclusive jurisdiction over claims of discrimination for ninety days, so that it may attempt to resolve such claims with greater flexibility and efficiency than may be had in a judicial forum. Therefore, where an individual brings a private suit pursuant to G. L. c. 15 IB without first filing with MCAD, the accomplishment of the purpose implicit in the statutory scheme is significantly obstructed. See <em>Schulte </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 80. For this reason, Massachusetts courts correctly have held that the filing requirement in the antidiscrimination statute is jurisdictional and that \u201c[rjesort to the courts is not available for a complaint of discrimination within the jurisdiction of the MCAD unless the person claiming to have been the object of unlawful discrimination first makes a timely complaint to that agency.\u201d <em>Cherilla </em>v. <em>Phoenix Techs. Ltd., </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 919, 919 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Section 150 stands in stark contrast to the antidiscrimination statute. It does not provide a comprehensive remedial scheme to resolve claims outside a judicial forum. Rather, \u00a7 150 authorizes two types of actions that may come before a court, one brought by the Attorney General, the other by individual plaintiffs. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150. Further, unlike the filing requirement in the antidiscrimination statute, the filing requirement in \u00a7 150 trig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>gers no mandatory agency investigation or administrative adjudicatory action. While the filing requirement in the antidiscrimination statute operates as the necessary first step in a comprehensive remedial scheme, the filing requirement in \u00a7 150 operates merely to ensure that the Attorney General receives notice of potential employment violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Accordingly, we hold that failure to file a complaint with the Attorney General before initiating a private suit for alleged employment violations does not interfere with the accomplishment of the statutory purposes of \u00a7 150 to a substantial degree, at least where the Attorney General is notified of the suit during its pendency. See <em>Schulte </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra. </em>In such circumstances, the purposes implicit in the statutory scheme are effectively served, as the Attorney General may yet pursue enforcement action against the employer, even if the Attorney General was made aware of the alleged violations somewhat later than is anticipated under the statute. Moreover, a defendant cannot plausibly claim prejudice by the tardiness of the plaintiff\u2019s filing, at least where, as here, the plaintiff\u2019s suit would not have been time barred under the three-year limitations period included in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, had he first filed with the Attorney General and waited ninety days before bringing suit against the defendant. See <em>Schulte </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra. </em>For these reasons, we conclude that Depianti\u2019s failure first to file a complaint with the Attorney General does not deprive the United States District Court of jurisdiction to consider his claims under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148, 148B, and 150, and G. L. c. 151, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 1A.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">b. <em>Vicarious liability. </em>The second reported question asks \u201c[wjhether and how to apply the \u2018right to control test\u2019 for vicarious liability to the franchisor-franchisee relationship.\u201d To this question, we answer \u201cYes,\u201d with the proviso that a court applying the \u201cright to control test\u201d in such circumstances should consider whether the defendant had the right to control the particular instrumentality of the plaintiff\u2019s asserted harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Pursuant to his G. L. c. 93A and misrepresentation claims, Depianti seeks to hold Jan-Pro vicariously liable for alleged conduct of Bradley. Generally, vicarious liability may be imposed where \u201cthe relation of master and servant existed at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>the plaintiff was injured, whereby the . . . act of the servant was legally imputable to the master\u201d (alteration in the original). <em>Cowan </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing Ass\u2019n, </em>330 Mass. 135, 141 (1953), quoting <em>Khoury </em>v. <em>Edison Elec. Illumination Co., </em>265 Mass. 236, 238 (1928). The test to establish the existence of such a relationship is whether the alleged master had \u201cpower of control or direction\u201d over the alleged servant. <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Ballantine, </em>380 Mass. 186, 195 (1980). See Asia, Employment Relation: Common-Law Concept and Legislative Definition, 55 Yale. L. J. 76, 81 (1945) (emphasis on control is \u201cin harmony with the notion of fault\u201d). \u201cIt is not necessary that there be any actual control by the alleged master to make one his servant or agent, but merely a right of the master to control.\u201d <em>Cowan </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>quoting <em>Khoury </em>v. <em>Edison Elec. Illumination Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">This test is \u201cnot easily transferable to the franchise relationship.\u201d <em>Kerl </em>v. <em>Dennis Rasmussen, Inc., </em>273 Wis. 2d 106, 125 (2004) <em>(Kerl). </em>Franchisors, such as Jan-Pro, license their trademarks and brand identities to franchisees, such as Bradley. Under Federal law, a franchisor is required to maintain control and supervision over a franchisee\u2019s use of its mark, or else the franchisor will be deemed to have abandoned its mark under the abandonment provisions of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(5)(A) (2006). <em>Mini Maid Servs. Co. </em>v. <em>Maid Brigade Sys., Inc., </em>967 F.2d 1516, 1519 (11th Cir. 1992). However, the controls that franchisors are required to maintain under the Lanham Act are not intended \u201cto create a [Fjederal law of agency ... [or to] saddle the licensor with the responsibilities under [S]tate law of a principal for his agent.\u201d <em>Oberlin </em>v. <em>Marlin Am. Corp., </em>596 F.2d 1322, 1327 (7th Cir. 1979), citing <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Cities Serv. Oil Co., </em>346 F.2d 349 (7th Cir. 1965), and <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Holiday Inns, Inc., </em>216 Va. 490 (1975). Cf. <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>867 F.2d 1234, 1236-1237 (9th Cir. 1989) (tire company not vicariously liable for conduct of tire manufacturer that licensed company\u2019s mark, despite significant quality controls retained by company). Broadly extending the \u201cright to control test\u201d for vicarious liability to the franchisor-franchisee relationship, where franchisors are obligated to maintain certain controls, could have the undesirable effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>penalizing franchisors for complying with Federal law. See Note, The Law of Franchisor Vicarious Liability: A Critique, 1993 Colum. Bus. L. Rev. 89, 99 (1993). For this reason, the \u201cright to control test\u201d should be applied to the franchisor-franchisee relationship in such a way as to ensure that liability will be imposed only where the conduct at issue properly may be imputed to the franchisor. See <em>Cowan </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>quoting <em>Khoury </em>v. <em>Edison Elec. Illumination Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In <em>Kerl, supra, </em>the Supreme Court of Wisconsin addressed an analogous situation. There, Robin Kerl and her fianc\u00e9, David Jones, were shot by Harvey Pierce, Kerl\u2019s former boy friend. <em>Id. </em>at 111. Kerl was seriously injured, and Jones was killed. <em>Id. </em>At the time, Pierce was a work-release inmate at a nearby jail, employed at a franchise restaurant operated by the defendant, Dennis Rasmussen, Inc. (DRI). <em>Id. </em>Pierce had left work without permission prior to the shooting. <em>Id. </em>Jones\u2019s estate and Kerl sued DRI, alleging negligent supervision of Pierce. <em>Id. </em>They also named DRI\u2019s franchisor as a defendant, on a theory of vicarious liability. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The <em>Kerl </em>court held that \u201cthe marketing, quality, and operational standards commonly found in franchise agreements are insufficient to establish the close supervisory control or right of control necessary to demonstrate the existence of a master/servant relationship for all purposes or as a general matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113. Accordingly, the court applied a modified version of the \u201cright to control test,\u201d concluding that a franchisor may be held vicariously liable for the conduct of its franchisee only if the franchisor controls or has a right to control \u201cthe daily conduct or operation of the particular \u2018instrumentality\u2019 or aspect of the franchisee\u2019s business that is alleged to have caused the harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129. Because the franchisor did not control or have a right to control DRI\u2019s supervision of its employees, the court concluded that the franchisor was not vicariously liable for DRI\u2019s negligent supervision. <em>Id. </em>at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The \u201cinstrumentality\u201d test adopted by the <em>Kerl </em>court accords with the approach of the majority of courts that have considered vicarious liability in the context of the franchise relationship. See, e.g., <em>Hong Wu </em>v. <em>Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Inc., </em>105 F. Supp. 2d 83, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>88 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) (\u201cthe franchisor typically is found to be vicariously liable only in situations where it exercised considerable control over the franchisee and the specific instrumentality at issue in a given case\u201d); <em>Pizza K, Inc. </em>v. <em>Santagata, </em>249 Ga. App. 36, 38-39 (2001) (no vicarious liability for collision caused by franchisee\u2019s delivery driver where franchisor had no supervisory authority over franchisee\u2019s employees); <em>VanDeMark </em>v. <em>McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>153 N.H. 753, 763 (2006) (no vicarious liability for attack on franchisee\u2019s employee where franchisor had no authority to control franchisee\u2019s security operations).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Today we join these courts in concluding that a franchisor is vicariously liable for the conduct of its franchisee only where the franchisor controls or has a right to control the specific policy or practice resulting in harm to the plaintiff. This test best serves the primary justification for the imposition of vicarious liability \u2014 namely, that liability should be imposed where a servant\u2019s conduct reasonably may be imputed to its master. See <em>Cowan </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>quoting <em>Khoury </em>v. <em>Edison Elec. Illumination Co., </em>supra; Asia, Employment Relation: Common-Law Concept and Legislative Definition, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">c. <em>Misclassification. </em>The third reported question asks \u201c[wjhether a defendant may be liable for employee misclassification under [G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B (independent contractor statute),] where there was no contract for service between the plaintiff and defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To this question, we answer, \u201cYes.\u201d This certified question arises within the context of pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>cross motions for summary judgment as to Jan-Pro\u2019s liability for employee misclassification under the independent contractor statute. In contrast to his G. L. c. 93A and misrepresentation claims against Jan-Pro, which allege vicarious liability by virtue of Bradley\u2019s conduct, here Depianti maintains that Jan-Pro is directly liable for its own violation of the independent contractor statute. In essence, Depianti claims that Jan-Pro itself misclassified Depianti as an independent contractor by designing and implementing the multi-tiered franchise structure that labels Depianti a franchisee, or independent contractor, rather than an employee, and by imposing this structure, through which it maintains control over a network of cleaning workers, upon \u201cmaster franchisees\u201d such as Bradley and \u201cunit franchisees\u201d such as Depianti.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Jan-Pro appears to have taken the position in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>the United States District Court that, as a matter of law, and irrespective of whether it can establish the indicia of an independent contractor relationship set forth in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B (a), it cannot be held liable under the statute because it has no contract with Depianti.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">It is within this context that we consider the limited question certified to us, which we understand as asking only whether a contract between the parties is a necessary element of a claim under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We conclude that the lack of a contract between the parties does not itself, without more, preclude liability under the independent contractor statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The nub of the parties\u2019 dispute as to whether a contract between them is a necessary element of a claim for misclassification under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B, derives from language contained in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B (a) (1). This language requires that an independent contractor be \u201cfree from control and direction in connection with the performance of the service, both under his contract for the performance of service and in fact.\u201d The parties dispute the import of the reference to a putative employee\u2019s \u201ccontract for the performance of service\u201d and, specifically, whether it contemplates, as a prerequisite for holding a putative employer liable for misclassification under the independent contractor statute, that there be a contract between the putative employer and the putative employee. Depianti argues that nothing in the language of the independent contractor statute restricts the statute\u2019s application to circumstances where the parties have entered into a contract together, and that it would counter the legislative intent to read such a restriction into the statute. Jan-Pro contends that the language of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B (a) (1), indicates that the Legislature presumed a contractual relationship between the parties, and that we should therefore require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>such a relationship as a prerequisite to application of the independent contractor statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">\u201cWhere the meaning of a statute is not plain from its language, familiar principles of statutory construction guide our interpretation.\u201d <em>DiFiore </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc., </em>454 Mass. 486, 490 (2009) <em>(DiFiore). </em>We seek to interpret the statute \u201caccording to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all the words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Industrial Fin.

We previously have recognized the importance of proper clas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>sification of employees. See <em>Somers </em>v. <em>Converged Access, Inc., </em>454 Mass. 582, 593 (2009) (\u201cMisclassification not only hurts the individual employee; it also imposes significant financial burdens on the Federal government and the Commonwealth in lost tax and insurance revenues. Moreover, it gives an employer who misclassifies employees as independent contractors an unfair competitive advantage over employers who correctly classify their employees and bear the concomitant financial burden\u201d). See also Advisory 2008/1, Attorney General\u2019s fair labor and business division (detailing deleterious effects of employee misclassification).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The independent contractor statute establishes a framework for determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor. First, \u201can individual performing any service\u201d is presumed to be an employee. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B <em>(a). </em>Second, the statute lays out three indicia of an independent contractor relationship, all three of which must be established to rebut the presumption of employment. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B <em>(a) </em>(l)-(3). The statute contains no language limiting its application to circumstances where the putative employer and the putative employee have entered into a contract together.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In light of the statute\u2019s broad remedial purpose, \u201cit would be an error to imply ... a limitation where the statutory language does not require it.\u201d <em>Psy-Ed Corp. </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>459 Mass. 697, 708 (2011). See <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>429 Mass. 798, 803 (1999) (court will not read words into statute). Limiting the statute\u2019s applicability to circumstances where the parties have contracted with one another would undermine the purpose of the statute, see <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Eastern Connection Operating, Inc., supra, </em>as such limitation would permit misclassification where a putative employer, otherwise hable under the statute, is insulated from such liability by virtue of an arrangement permitting it to distance itself from its employees. Cf. <em>Cumpata </em>v. <em>Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., </em>113 F. Supp. 2d 164, 168 (D. Mass. 2000) (\u201cThe Wage Act is meant to protect employees from the dictates and whims of shrewd employers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">As stated, Jan-Pro contends that the mention of a contract in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B (a) (1), indicates that the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>intended the independent contractor statute to apply only where the parties have contracted with one another. Subsection <em>(a) </em>(1) delineates the first of the three factors that must be established to rebut the presumption of employment: \u201cthe individual is free from control and direction in connection with the performance of the service, both under his contract for the performance of service and in fact.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B <em>(a) </em>(1). While the use of the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d rather than the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d between the phrases \u201cunder his contract for the performance of service\u201d and \u201cin fact\u201d arguably suggests that the Legislature presumed a contractual relationship between the parties, we conclude that such language \u201creflects nothing more than the Legislature\u2019s failure to imagine the possibility\u201d that an entity that did not contract with the plaintiff would be the agent of misclassification. <em>DiFiore, supra </em>at 497. Such language does not reflect any legislative intent to allow an employer to insulate itself from liability for misclassification by causing or creating another entity to contract with its employees. See <em>id. </em>In light of the purpose of the independent contractor statute, see <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Eastern Connection Operating, Inc., supra, </em>and given that remedial statutes are \u201centitled to liberal construction,\u201d <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., supra, </em>we understand G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B (a) (1), to indicate merely that a putative employer\u2019s control and direction over a putative employee\u2019s performance is to be assessed both under the terms of the putative employee\u2019s contract for service, if any, as well as in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Further, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, the wage statute, declares that \u201c[n]o person shall by a special contract with an employee <em>or by any other means </em>exempt himself\u201d from the obligation to pay lawful wages to employees (emphasis added). See <em>Awuah </em>v. <em>Coverall N. Am., Inc., </em>460 Mass. 484, 492 (2011). The enactment of this provision indicates that the Legislature \u201cwas cognizant, in general, of the risk that employers or other persons may seek to find ways, through special contracts or other means, to attempt to avoid compliance . . . and intended to thwart such schemes.\u201d <em>DiFiore, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>In <em>DiFiore, supra, </em>we addressed a nearly identical provision in the context of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A, the tips statute, which prohibits an employer from imposing a \u201cservice charge\u201d on customers and not remitting such charge to its employees. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>(d). </em>See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A (g) (\u201cNo employer or person shall by a special contract with an employee or by any other means exempt itself from this section\u201d). There, we held that the defendant airline could not escape the requirements of the tips statute \u201cby entering into a contract with a service entity . . . under which the service entity would employ the service employees, waitstaff employees, and service bartenders, and agree to pay to or share with the airline or restaurant the service charge billed to customers.\u201d <em>DiFiore, supra </em>at 494. We held that \u201c[t]his would be precisely the type of special contract prohibited by [G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A (g),] because it would provide a means to exempt the airline or restaurant from its obligations under the [tips statute].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo allow such an \u2018end run\u2019 around the [tips statute] would contravene the express purpose of the [statute], namely to protect gratuity payments given to, or intended for, service employees . . . and would nullify \u00a7 152A (g) of the [tips statute], which specifically forbids this type of a maneuver \u2018by special contract. . . [or] any other means.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496, citing <em>Newton Wellesley Hosp. </em>v. <em>Magrini, </em>451 Mass. <em>777, </em>784 (2008), and <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The instant case is directly analogous. Assuming without in any way suggesting that Depianti was working as an employee of Jan-Pro,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and not as an independent contractor, Jan-Pro\u2019s contractual arrangement with Bradley, if enforceable, would provide a means for Jan-Pro to escape its obligation, as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>employer, to pay lawful wages under the wage statute, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148. To allow such an \u201cend run\u201d around G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, would contravene the express purpose of the statute and would nullify the provision therein that specifically forbids this type of arrangement \u201cby a special contract with an employee or by any other means.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148. See <em>DeFiore, supra. </em>See also Advisory 2008/1, Attorney General\u2019s fair labor and business division (Attorney General \u201cwill enforce [G.

L. c. 151, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 1A. However, Depianti\u2019s claims under G. L. c. 151, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 1A, are predicated on his claim of misclassification under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B. See G. L. c. 151, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 1A (applying only to employees and not to independent contractors). Therefore, as the judge recognized, Depianti\u2019s claims under G. L. c. 151, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 1A, depend on the United States District Court\u2019s jurisdiction to consider his claim of misclassification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b635-6\">It is important to note that \u201cinstrumentality\u201d in this context is to be understood broadly, as the particular practice of the franchisee that led to the plaintiff\u2019s injury. In <em>Kerl </em>v. <em>Dennis Rasmussen, Inc., </em>273 Wis. 2d 106, 135 (2004), the instrumentality of the harm was identified as the franchisee\u2019s supervision of its employees. The franchisor was held not vicariously' liable, because it did not have authority to control such supervision. <em>Id. </em>Here, Depianti alleges that Bradley made certain representations as to monthly income, available volume of customer accounts, and anticipated hourly rates of pay. He also alleges that certain conduct by Bradley constituted systemic breach of its contract with Depianti. These would appear to be the \u201cinstrumentalities\u201d at issue, and the assessment of Jan-Pro\u2019s vicarious liability would then turn on whether Jan-Pro controlled or had a right to control Bradley in connection with such representations and conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 148B, states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\"><em>\u201c(a) </em>For the purpose of this chapter and chapter 151, an individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>performing any service, except as authorized under this chapter, shall be considered to be an employee under those chapters unless: \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHd\">\u201c(1) the individual is free from control and direction in connection with the performance of the service, both under his contract for the performance of service and in fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtD\">\u201c(2) the service is performed outside the usual course of the business of the employer; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXO\">\u201c(3) the individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business of the same nature as that involved in the service performed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ach\"><em>\u201c(d) </em>Whoever fails to properly classify an individual as an employee according to this section and in so doing fails to comply, in any respect, with chapter 149, or section 1, 1A, IB, 2B, 15 or 19 of chapter 151, or chapter 62B, shall be punished and shall be subject to all of the criminal and civil remedies, including debarment, as provided in section 27C of this chapter. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b636-9\">In this regard, Depianti alleges, inter alia, that \u201cJan-Pro has developed the methods, procedures, and products which it requires its [regional master franchisees] to use in selling cleaning franchises and directing the work of [unit franchisees],\u201d that the contracts between regional master franchisees and unit franchisees are \u201cstandard form contracts that are developed and written by Jan-Pro,\u201d that \u201cJan-Pro janitors must conduct their cleaning services according to the procedures that Jan-Pro dictates in its training program,\u201d that \u201cJan-Pro retains the right to enforce provisions of [the contracts between regional master franchisees and unit franchisees] directly and may directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>oversee the work of any [unit franchisee],\u201d and that \u201cJan-Pro reserves the right to terminate any account assigned to [unit franchisees] and to cancel the entire franchise agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Accordingly, we neither analyze the elements necessary to maintain a claim under G.

We take no position on the question whether the necessary predicates for liability can be established here, a matter involving determinations as to the summary judgment record that are solely within the purview of the United States District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b642-6\">To the extent that the dissent maintains that the statute has no application where the parties have neither an independent contractor nor an employment relationship, we do not disagree. Our conclusion today, in accordance with the limited scope of the question certified to us, is merely that the absence of a contract between the parties does not alone preclude liability under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">This is borne out by the hypothetical situation that the dissent outlines. There, company A contracts with company B for services, and company B enters into arrangements with third parties to perform the work it undertook under its contract with company A. We agree that ordinarily, in such circumstances, company A would not be liable for misclassification of the third-party workers. This is because ordinarily, in such circumstances, company B would be the agent of any misclassification. However, here Depianti alleges that Jan-Pro, and not Bradley, designed and implemented the contractual framework under which he was misclassified as an independent contractor. See note 13, <em>supra. </em>The lack of a contract between Depianti and Jan-Pro does not itself preclude liability. Where a party is the agent of misclassification, it may be directly liable under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B, even where it utilizes a proxy to make arrangements with its employees. Nothing we say today, then, is at odds with the law of corporate disregard.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">In suggesting that there can be no liability under the statute absent some sort of \u201cwork arrangement\u201d between the parties, the dissent\u2019s focus seems to be upon aspects of the statute other than the language giving rise to the limited question certified to us, see G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B <em>(a) </em>(1), which asks only if a contract between the parties is a necessary element of a claim brought under the statute. The dissent instead appears to be concerned with what it means to \u201cperform[] any service,\u201d see G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B (a), and who has responsibility for employee classification where such service is performed. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B <em>(d) </em>(\u201cWhoever fails to properly classify an individual as an employee according to this section . . . shall be punished. . .\u201d). We have not been asked to address these questions and we do not do so.

I concur with the court\u2019s answers and analysis with respect to the first two certified questions. I disagree on the third certified question. It seems to me that whether a defendant may be liable for employee misclassification under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B (\u00a7 148B), depends first and foremost on whether there is a work arrangement of some type between the defendant and the person claiming misclassification. If there is a work arrangement (i.e., some form of an agreement of pay for services), our law makes it quite clear that regardless of how the parties characterize that arrangement, it will be presumed to be an employer-employee relationship unless the party receiving the services can establish the presence of the three statutory factors set out in \u00a7 148B.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">In the absence of a work arrangement between the parties, be it a written or oral, implicit or explicit, contract, agreement, or understanding, \u00a7 148B simply does not apply. If corporation A contracts with corporation B to manage a facility to certain specifications, and corporation B enters into arrangements with third parties to perform the work it had undertaken under that contract, \u00a7 148B would plainly apply to the relationship between corporation B and the persons it has engaged to do the work, but not between those persons and corporation A. The only exceptions to such an obvious conclusion would arise if corporation B was set up by corporation A specifically for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>of evading the independent contractor law, or if corporation A were otherwise found to be the alter ego of corporation B, such that the corporate veil between them would be properly pierced and the work arrangement entered into by corporation B thereby attributed to corporation A. The factors to be considered in whether to disregard the deeply ingrained observance of corporate form are set out in <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>M.C.K., Inc., </em>432 Mass. 546, 555 n.19 (2000). I see no evidence of legislative intent in \u00a7 148B to change the body of law that governs the liability of such distinct entities.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
