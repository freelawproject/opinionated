The defendant\u2019s sole claim of error is the denial of his pretrial motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of a vehicle stop conducted by a Merrimac police officer in the neighboring city of Amesbury. Because the stop was authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>under the terms of the mutual aid agreement between the municipalities, and that agreement complied with the requirements of G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 8G, we affirm the denial of the motion and the judgments of conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><em>Background. </em>The defendant was indicted on charges of operating while under the influence of liquor, fifth or subsequent offense, in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(a) </em>(1); operating under the influence of liquor, with a blood alcohol content of .08 per cent or greater, fifth or subsequent offense, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(a) </em>(1); possession of a class D substance, more than one ounce of marijuana, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34; and possession of a class C substance, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. The defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the Merrimac officer\u2019s stop of his vehicle. A Superior Court judge denied the motion, and a single justice of this court denied the defendant\u2019s request to file an interlocutory appeal pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. R 15 (a) (2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). At a jury-waived trial in the Superior Court, the defendant was convicted of operating while under the influence and possession of a class D substance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a bifurcated proceeding, the defendant pleaded guilty to operating while under the influence, fifth or subsequent offense. The defendant appealed from his convictions, arguing that the motion to suppress should have been allowed, and we transferred his appeal to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\"><em>Motion judge\u2019s findings of fact. </em>Following an evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress, at which a Merrimac police officer, Charles Sciacca, and an Amesbury police officer, Kevin Mulrenin, were the sole witnesses, the motion judge, who was not the trial judge, issued oral findings of fact and rulings of law. In reviewing a decision on a motion to suppress, \u201cwe accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error \u2018but conduct an independent review of his ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>440 Mass. 642, 646 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 218 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>The motion judge found the following. Sciacca was on patrol duty in a marked Merrimac police cruiser on August 26, 2009, working the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift. He crossed the town line into Amesbury in order to purchase a beverage at a convenience store on Route 110, and was returning to Merrimac when he saw a Chrysler sedan in front of him cross the double yellow line, return to the travel lane, and then cross the \u201cfog line\u201d on the right side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Sciacca followed the Chrysler for one-half mile, remaining in Amesbury throughout, and observed the vehicle \u201cweave[] around the road\u201d in light traffic, crossing significantly over the center line four times, and the fog line three times, within a twenty-second time frame. The vehicle made an abrupt stop, then turned into the parking lot of a restaurant and stopped without pulling into a parking space.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Sciacca pulled into the parking lot and used his cruiser to block the Chrysler from leaving. He then made a call over his radio to inform the Amesbury police, who use the same radio channel as Merrimac, that he had initiated a traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Sciacca shined his spotlight into the vehicle and observed the defendant and a female passenger. The defendant\u2019s eyes were visibly watery and bloodshot. The officer approached the defendant\u2019s vehicle and asked for identification. The defendant, who smelled noticeably of alcohol, \u201cfumble[d] with his wallet,\u201d but was unable to remove his license, and handed the entire wallet to Sciacca. The officer handed it back to the defendant and told him to get his license out of the wallet, which the defendant eventually did.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Amesbury police Officer Kevin Mulrenin and his partner arrived within approximately one minute of the stop.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Amesbury officers asked the defendant to get out of his vehicle and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>then administered sobriety tests; the defendant failed the tests and was arrested by the Amesbury officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">A mutual aid agreement between Amesbury, Merrimac, and two other municipalities was introduced as an exhibit. The judge concluded as a matter of law that, under the terms of the agreement, which provides that on-duty police officers of each municipality may exercise \u201cfull police powers\u201d in the other \u201c[wjhen circumstances arise dictating an immediate response or action for the good of public safety,\u201d Sciacca made a valid stop outside his jurisdiction. The agreement requires that when an officer exercises police powers in such a situation, \u201cthe primary community will notify the host community as soon as practically possible.\u201d The judge determined that the Merrimac police officer\u2019s conduct constituted an \u201cimmediate response or action for the good of public safety\u201d because the officer had a \u201cvery good basis\u201d to believe that the defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol. Nonetheless, the judge ultimately did not decide the motion to suppress based on the mutual aid agreement. Rather, the judge denied the motion after concluding that the extraterritorial stop was permitted under G. L. c. 37, \u00a7 13, because Sciacca was acting in \u201cpreservation of the peace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>Under common law, \u201ca police officer may lawfully act only within jurisdictional limitations except if specially authorized to act by statute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>430 Mass. 341, 343 (1999). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grise, </em>398 Mass. 247, 249 (1986). Several statutes recognize circumstances in which it may be desirable for a law enforcement officer to carry his authority outside his municipal boundaries. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>407 Mass. 70, 74-75 (1990). See, e.g., G.L. c. 41, \u00a7 98A (officer may arrest motorist outside his jurisdiction where officer has observed motorist commit arrestable offense in his jurisdiction, so long as officer is in \u201cfresh and continued pursuit\u201d); G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 95, 98 (power to execute arrest warrants is Statewide).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commonwealth maintains that Sciacca\u2019s stop was authorized by G. L. c. 37, \u00a7 13, which addresses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>when a law enforcement officer may request aid in carrying out his duties, as well as by G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 8G, which permits towns to form agreements for mutual aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the motion judge was correct in concluding that Sciacca\u2019s actions were authorized by G. L. c. 37, \u00a7 13. That statute provides that a law enforcement officer may \u201crequire suitable aid . . . in the preservation of the peace [or] in the apprehending or securing of a person for a breach of the peace.\u201d G. L. c. 37, \u00a7 13. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>435 Mass. 440, 442-443 (2001). The plain language of the statute, however, grants an extraterritorial officer the authority to act only when an official of the host jurisdiction has requested assistance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrissey, </em>422 Mass. 1, 6 (1996), quoting G. L. c. 37, \u00a7 13 (officer \u201chad statutory authority to request the assistance of any private person \u2018in the apprehending or securing of a person for a breach of the peace\u2019 \u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lahey, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 606, 610 n.5 (2011) (person receiving request from officer \u201cgains authority to stop the suspect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The motion judge found that Sciacca stopped the defendant\u2019s vehicle before contacting the Amesbury police. The Merrimac officer\u2019s actions were not authorized under G. L. c. 37, \u00a7 13, without a specific prior request for aid from an Amesbury officer. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Twombly, supra </em>at 441-442 (Salisbury officer instructed Amesbury officer to make stop in Salisbury), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Limone, </em>460 Mass. 834, 838 (2011) (Somerville officer would not have been entitled to arrest driver for misdemeanor under G. L. c. 37, \u00a7 13, where Woburn police did not request aid).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The motion judge, however, also considered the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the stop was permitted by the mutual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>aid agreement between Amesbury and Merrimac, pursuant to G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 8G. We may affirm the ruling on any grounds supported by the record and the findings of fact. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. 99, 102 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">General Laws c. 40, \u00a7 8G, authorizes municipalities to enter into so-called mutual aid agreements, which permit police departments to share personnel, supplies, and equipment in order to \u201cincrease the capability of such departments to protect the lives, safety, and property of the people in the area.\u201d Police officers acting under such agreements \u201chave all the immunities and powers granted to them in the municipalities that employ them, including, but not limited to, powers of arrest.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 8G.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The executive officers of the cities of Amesbury and Newburyport, and the towns of Salisbury and Merrimac, signed the mutual aid agreement at issue here in 2006. The agreement provides for \u201cmulti-jurisdictional police services\u201d among the neighboring municipalities, and grants officers acting under the agreement \u201cfull police powers\u201d in the participating jurisdictions. Under the terms of the agreement, therefore, Sciacca was authorized to exercise police powers in Amesbury only when \u201ccircumstances [arose] dictating an immediate response or action for the good of public safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The defendant\u2019s vehicle left its lane seven times during Sciacca\u2019s twenty-second observation, veering onto the shoulder three times and into the oncoming traffic lane four times. The motion judge characterized this driving as \u201cerratic.\u201d Based on these observations, Sciacca had reasonable suspicion that the defendant\u2019s driving presented an immediate danger to others and to public safety. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>464 Mass. 746, 756 (2013), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smigliano, 421 </em>Mass. 490, 493 (1998) (\u201c \u2018Erratic\u2019 driving that violates the civil motor vehicle code may give rise to a reasonable suspicion that a driver is impaired, permitting an investigatory stop\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blais, </em>428 Mass. 294, 298 (1998) (brief stop to administer sobriety tests allowed on reasonable suspicion driver is impaired because \u201c[a] drunk driver let loose on the highways is a deadly menace, not only to the officer, but also to anyone sharing the highways with him\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 88, 90-91 (2005) (anonymous report of erratic driver \u201csufficient to conclude that an emergency existed, requiring immediate action for the protection of life and property of both the operator and the general public\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Sciacca properly effectuated a stop in order to ensure that the defendant\u2019s erratic operation did not endanger other drivers, and in order to determine whether the defendant was operating while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. These actions were within the authority that the mutual aid agreement granted him. In addition, Sciacca\u2019s radio call to Amesbury shortly after effectuating the stop fulfilled the requirement in the agreement that he \u201cnotify the host community as soon as practically possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion to suppress affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\">We acknowledge the amicus brief of the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association, Inc., in support of the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The defendant was acquitted of possession of a class C substance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b132-9\">The defendant contends that this finding was erroneous, since there was a thirty-two minute discrepancy between the call times recorded in the officers\u2019 written reports. The motion judge considered the discrepancy, and Amesbury police Officer Kevin Mulrenin\u2019s testimony that the clocks used by the two departments are sometimes out of sync. The judge credited Officer Charles Sciacca\u2019s testimony that the Merrimac officer radioed immediately after making the stop, and that the Amesbury officers arrived quickly. This finding was not clearly erroneous. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>442 Mass. 485, 492 (2004) (we accept judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b133-7\">We have held that, under common law, an officer may make a warrantless arrest outside his jurisdiction if a private person would have been permitted to make a \u201ccitizen\u2019s arrest\u201d under the same circumstances.

L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(a) </em>(1). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Limone, </em>460 Mass. 834, 838 (2011).
