L. c. 258D.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We consider also whether a conviction that was overturned because the Commonwealth introduced evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s prearrest silence as purportedly establishing consciousness of guilt was overturned \u201con grounds which tend to establish\u201d his innocence, such that he is eligible to pursue his claim for compensation for an erroneous felony conviction pursuant to G. L. c. 258D, \u00a7 1 (B) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">Because the erroneous convictions statute provides only a limited waiver of the Commonwealth\u2019s sovereign immunity, we conclude that the doctrine of present execution applies to claims brought under that statute, and thus that interlocutory appeal is appropriate. While we conclude that \u201cgrounds which tend to establish\u201d an individual\u2019s innocence are not necessarily limited to the exclusion of exculpatory evidence at trial, we nonetheless conclude also that the plaintiff, John R. Irwin, is not eligible to pursue his compensation claim, because the grounds on which his conviction was reversed were not \u201cprobative of the proposition that [he] did not commit the crime.\u201d <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>458 Mass. 354, 362 (2010) <em>(Guzman), </em>quoting <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 466, 477 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\"><em>Background and prior proceedings. </em>We summarize the facts based on the detailed discussion in the Appeals Court\u2019s decision, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Irwin, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 643 (2008) <em>(Irwin),</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>reserving some facts for later discussion. The incident resulting in the overturned conviction occurred on July 26, 2003, at the home of Virginia Griffin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complainant, the daughter of a friend of Griffin, was six years old at the time of the alleged offense. On the evening of July 25, the complainant, her mother, and her brother were visiting Griffin, Griffin\u2019s then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>live-in boyfriend, Gary Closker,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Griffin\u2019s two sons, nine month old Brian and three year old Paul,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as was Irwin. The children were lying on the living room floor watching movies. Irwin left the apartment at some point during the movies.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">When the movies ended, the complainant had fallen asleep on the living room floor. In order not to wake her, the complainant\u2019s mother and Griffin agreed that the complainant would spend the night at Griffin\u2019s apartment, and the complainant\u2019s mother would pick her up the next morning. Her mother and her brother then left. Griffin moved the complainant to the large bed in the apartment\u2019s single bedroom,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and put Brian in the crib in that room.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Griffin and Closker then went to sleep on the living room floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The complainant testified on direct examination that she woke up the next morning and found Irwin in the bed with her. He was \u201cplaying with his penis\u201d and asked her to touch his \u201ctoy.\u201d She did so, at first not knowing what it was. When she realized what it was, because she had seen her younger brother\u2019s, she ran into the living room, woke up Griffin and Closker, and told Griffin what had happened. The child testified that Griffin telephoned the police because Irwin would not get out of the bed and that, when police arrived, Irwin left the bedroom.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Griffin testified<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that she woke up on the morning of July 26, when Irwin entered the apartment<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and went into the bedroom. She saw him take something from the bedroom closet, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>was next to the door into the bedroom, and then go into the bathroom. When Irwin came out of the bathroom, he and Griffin began arguing because he had not telephoned in advance and she had not given him permission to be there.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When Irwin refused to leave or to return the key to the apartment, she telephoned police. Police arrived and removed Irwin from the premises.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Several hours later, while the complainant was watching television, she told Griffin that there was a \u201cstrange guy\u201d in the bed who wanted the complainant to \u201ctouch his Charlie,\u201d but Griffin saw no one in the bedroom. Griffin thought that the statement did not \u201cmake sense\u201d and took no further action. The complainant\u2019s father contacted police later that afternoon, when the child told him what had happened at Griffin\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Irwin testified on his own behalf. He said that he had come to the apartment at approximately 7 a.m., after having been up all night, to get some money from his coat hanging in the closet there. He reached into the coat pocket and removed a twenty dollar bill while standing within a step of the bedroom door; he did not see the complainant or anyone else in the room, and did not see the complainant at any time that day. He and Griffin got into an argument when he refused to return the key to the apartment, and Griffin telephoned police. He returned the apartment key when police arrived, but kept the key to the storage bin. Later that day, he met Closker at a bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Detective Richard Potter, the officer assigned to the investigation after the complainant\u2019s father\u2019s report, testified concerning his interviews of Griffin in the days following the incident, and his interview of Irwin in January, 2004.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Potter testified further, without objection, that he had made numerous unsuccessful efforts to contact Irwin, through Griffin; that Irwin had failed to attend an interview scheduled for September, 2003, after Irwin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>and Potter had spoken by telephone; and that Irwin may have avoided contacting him for several months thereafter. In December, 2003, Potter was again able to reach Irwin, who met with police in January, 2004. There was no evidence that Irwin offered a reason for the three-month delay. On cross-examination, without objection, Griffin testified that she had informed Irwin of Potter\u2019s efforts to reach him and of the reasons for Potter\u2019s investigation. She testified further that Irwin had no telephone number and that she had informed Potter he could try to reach Irwin through his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Irwin\u2019s first trial, on October 18, 2005, ended in a mistrial when the jury were unable to reach a verdict. His second trial began on October 20. At this trial, the prosecutor emphasized in direct examination and cross-examination, again without objection, Irwin\u2019s delay in responding to police requests to speak to him and his failure to attend the scheduled interview in September, 2003; she argued in closing that an innocent person accused of such a crime would have wanted to come forward and speak to police right away. On October 21, Irwin was convicted of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen. He was sentenced to two and one-half years\u2019 incarceration, with fifteen months committed. Ultimately, due to parole violations, he served approximately twenty-seven months. On September 15, 2008, the Appeals Court vacated Irwin\u2019s conviction and granted him a new trial on the grounds that the use of Irwin\u2019s prearrest silence as evidence of consciousness of guilt was improper both under common-law evidentiary rules and as constitutionally impermissible comment on his privilege against self-incrimination. In August, 2009, the Commonwealth filed a nolle prosequi.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">In March, 2011, Irwin filed a complaint in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 258D, seeking compensation for an erroneous felony conviction. The Commonwealth moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that Irwin was not among the class of claimants eligible to pursue a claim for relief under the erroneous convictions statute. Concluding that Irwin is eligible to pursue his claim for compensation under that statute, a Superior Court judge denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint and for partial judgment on the pleadings, and allowed Irwin\u2019s cross motion for partial judgment on the plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>ings. The Commonwealth filed an interlocutory appeal in the Appeals Court, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>An individual who has been convicted by the Commonwealth of a felony resulting in incarceration,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> whose conviction has been vacated or reversed by a court of the Commonwealth, may seek compensation from the Commonwealth, where the indictment or complaint has been dismissed, a nolle prosequi has been entered, or the individual was found not guilty at a new trial, if the judicial relief was granted \u201con grounds which tend to establish the innocence of the individual.\u201d G. L. c. 258D, \u00a7 1 (B).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Once an individual has established that he or she is within the class of persons eligible to pursue a compensation claim, in order to prevail and recover damages at trial, he must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, inter alia, that he did not commit the charged offense.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> G. L. c. 258D, \u00a7 1 (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>1. <em>Doctrine of present execution. </em>As an initial matter, we consider whether the Commonwealth is entitled to pursue an interlocutory appeal of the denial of a motion to dismiss a G. L. c. 258D claim under the doctrine of present execution.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Ordinarily, the Commonwealth is immune from suit unless it waives its right to sovereign immunity and consents to being sued. See, e.g., <em>Brum </em>v. Dartmouth, 428 Mass. 684, 688 (1999). Where the Commonwealth does choose to waive its sovereign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>immunity, it can be sued \u201conly in the manner and to the extent expressed [by the] statute.\u201d <em>Boxford </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, </em>458 Mass. 596, 601 (2010), quoting <em>DeRoche </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>447 Mass. 1, 12 (2006). In short, sovereign immunity protects the Commonwealth from the burden of having to go to trial, unless the Commonwealth consents to do so. See <em>McArthur Bros. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>197 Mass. 137, 138 (1908).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">An interlocutory order may be appealed under the doctrine of present execution \u201cif the order will interfere with rights in a way that cannot be remedied on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Al Saud, </em>459 Mass. 221, 227 n.15 (2011), quoting <em>Benoit </em>v. <em>Frederickson, </em>454 Mass. 148, 151-152 (2009). The doctrine of present execution thus affords the Commonwealth the right to an immediate appeal where the Commonwealth maintains that it is immune from suit, and that to require it to litigate the issue of waiver of sovereign immunity at trial would vitiate such immunity, imposing on it the burden of proceeding to trial from which the doctrine of sovereign immunity affords it protection. See <em>Brum </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, supra, </em>citing <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Rakiey, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 490, 493 (1995) (right to immunity from suit \u201cwould be \u2018lost forever\u2019 if an order denying it were not appealable until the close of litigation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">The doctrine of present execution requires that the immunity defense be collateral to the rest of the controversy. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 527-529 (1985). See <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>AIG Domestic Claims, Inc., </em>460 Mass. 91, 106 n.12 (2011), citing <em>Elies </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Quincy, </em>450 Mass. 671, 673-674 (2008) (present execution permits appeal only from questions that are \u201ccollateral\u201d to merits of controversy). The doctrine does not apply to questions concerning a determination of actual liability. See <em>Brum </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, supra, </em>and cases cited. \u201c[T]he denial of a motion to dismiss on immunity grounds is always collateral to the rights asserted in the underlying action because it \u2018is conceptually distinct from the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim that his rights have been violated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>437 Mass. 312, 317 (2002), quoting <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Forsyth, supra. </em>See <em>Boxford </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">The erroneous convictions statute, which provides \u201cCompen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>sation for Certain Erroneous Felony Convictions,\u201d waives sovereign immunity \u201cfor an erroneous felony conviction,\u201d G. L. c. 258D, \u00a7 1 (A), then establishes the class of claimants \u201celigible to obtain relief.\u201d G. L. c. 258D, \u00a7 1 (B). While, unlike the exceptions to the waiver of sovereign immunity set forth in the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, see G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (waiver in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2, \u201cshall not apply,\u201d inter alia, when employee fails to exercise discretionary function or commits intentional tort), the waiver of sovereign immunity in the erroneous convictions statute is not limited explicitly by the statutory language, it is nonetheless clearly limited only to those individuals who can establish their membership in a particular class.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">General Laws c. 258D, \u00a7 1 (B) and (C), define the requirements for establishing that the conviction was erroneous. General Laws c. 258D, \u00a7 1 (C), sets forth the elements a claimant must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, in order to prevail and obtain compensation under the statute. The first of those elements is that a claimant must establish that \u201che is a member of the class of persons defined in [G. L. c. 258D, \u00a7 1 (B)].\u201d G. L. c. 258D, \u00a7 1 (C) (i). Thus, the Commonwealth has granted a limited waiver of its sovereign immunity under the erroneous convictions statute to that class of claimants who establish that they are eligible for relief. The threshold matter of eligibility as a member of the class of claimants eligible to pursue relief is a \u201ccollateral\u201d issue, separate and distinct from the merits of the claim for relief that a claimant must establish at trial. We conclude, therefore, that the Commonwealth may pursue its interlocutory appeal under the doctrine of present execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">2. <em>Eligibility for relief </em>We turn to the merits of the Commonwealth\u2019s claim that Irwin is not an eligible claimant under the erroneous convictions statute because his conviction was overturned on grounds that do not \u201ctend to establish [his] innocence.\u201d In reversing Irwin\u2019s conviction, the Appeals Court held that the Commonwealth \u201chad no basis for introducing\u201d the evidence concerning Irwin\u2019s prearrest silence other than \u201cin furtherance of the impermissible theory that [it] showed consciousness of guilt.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Irwin, supra </em>at 656. The Commonwealth characterizes the basis for the Appeals Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>reversal as the improper admission of \u201cinculpatory evidence\u201d of consciousness of guilt that would be admissible, pursuant to G. L. c. 258D, \u00a7 1 (F),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> at any trial for compensation under the erroneous convictions statute. The Commonwealth maintains that only those whose convictions are overturned based on the omission of exculpatory evidence are eligible claimants under the erroneous convictions statute, and that individuals such as Irwin, whose convictions are reversed because the Commonwealth introduced \u201cexcessive evidence\u201d of their guilt, are not among the class of eligible claimants to whom the Legislature intended to provide compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">Since the erroneous convictions statute was enacted in 2004, we have had few opportunities to construe the extent of its requirement that, to be eligible for relief, a claimant\u2019s conviction must have been overturned on \u201cgrounds which tend to establish the innocence\u201d of the plaintiff. G. L. c. 258D, \u00a7 1 (B) (ii). We have interpreted the word \u201cgrounds\u201d in that statute as meaning \u201cbasis.\u201d See <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 361-362, citing Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1002 (1993) (\u201cthe foundation or basis on which knowledge, belief, or conviction rests\u201d), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 772 (9th ed. 2009) (\u201c[t]he reason or point that something [as a legal claim or argument] relies on for validity\u201d). Thus, the requirement that judicial relief must have been granted on \u201cgrounds which tend to establish the innocence\u201d of a claimant does not limit the threshold question of eligibility for relief \u201cto individuals whose convictions were vacated or reversed strictly on the basis \u2018of compelling or overwhelming exculpatory evidence,\u2019 that is, on the grounds that they were actually innocent.\u201d <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 359, quoting <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 466, 477 (2009). Rather, \u201cgrounds which tend to establish\u201d a plaintiff\u2019s innocence require that a conviction be overturned \u201con grounds resting upon facts and circumstances probative of the proposition that the claimant did not commit the crime.\u201d <em>Guzman, supra, </em>quoting <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. at 477. We have cautioned, however, that such grounds must \u201ctend[] to do more than merely assist the defendant\u2019s chances of acquittal.\u201d <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">In both instances where we have decided that a plaintiff was eligible to pursue his claim for compensation, and underlying the Commonwealth\u2019s argument here that only the omission of such evidence establishes grounds for relief, the plaintiffs\u2019 convictions were overturned based on the omission of exculpatory evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">In <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 359-362, that evidence was direct testimony that someone other than the plaintiff had committed the crime. In that case, we considered whether a plaintiff whose trial counsel had failed to call two percipient witnesses, who would have testified that the plaintiff was not the individual who committed the crime, was eligible to pursue a claim for compensation. <em>Id. </em>at 359-360. We determined that the omission of such exculpatory testimony was crucial to the plaintiff\u2019s defense of misidentification, and thus that allowing the motion for a new trial based on the failure to call those witnesses was a reversal on grounds that tended to establish innocence. <em>Id. </em>at 363-365.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">On the same day as our decision in <em>Guzman, </em>we considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>the related circumstances in which a new trial was granted because of the failure to introduce evidence that would have challenged the credibility of two key prosecution witnesses. See <em>Drumgold </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>458 Mass. 367, 376-377 (2010) <em>(Drumgold). </em>Drumgold had been convicted of murder in the first degree in the shooting death of a young girl who was killed when several masked young men walked up to a group of other young men and began shooting into the group. The Commonwealth\u2019s theory at trial was that the intended victim \u2014 not the girl \u2014 had been targeted in revenge for an earlier shooting, and that Drumgold, a friend of the earlier victim, was one of the shooters. <em>Id. </em>at 370. The Commonwealth failed to disclose that a key prosecution witness, who testified that, prior to the shooting, he had seen Drumgold and another individual two blocks from the scene, carrying guns, and inquiring as to the whereabouts of the man identified as the intended target, had been afforded promises and inducements to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 370-371, 373-374. Moreover, posttrial, the Commonwealth learned that another critical percipient witness, who had testified at trial that, immediately after she heard gunshots, she saw Drumgold, less than a block from the scene, climbing over a fence and heading away from the scene, had been suffering from terminal brain cancer at the time of the shooting, and that the illness had resulted in blurred vision. <em>Id. </em>at 372-373.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">We concluded that, while not directly exculpatory, the omission of the credibility evidence was a reversal on grounds tending to establish innocence, as the omitted evidence, which tended to support Drumgold\u2019s defense of misidentification and alibi, was \u201cprobative of the central issue at trial\u201d and would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>cast doubt on the identifications by the two witnesses. Thus, it went to the ultimate determination of Drumgold\u2019s guilt or innocence. <em>Id. </em>at 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">On the other end of the spectrum, convictions that are reversed only because of \u201cprocedural or evidentiary errors or structural deficiencies at. . . trial[] that could well be \u2018consistent\u2019 with innocence without <em>any </em>tendency to establish it\u201d would not meet the statutory definition (emphasis in original). <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 358. See <em>id </em>at 358 n.6, citing, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>450 Mass. 894, 905-906 (2008) (conviction reversed on basis of misconduct by prosecutor during closing argument, including offering corroborating testimony and interjecting personal determinations of credibility); <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 209, 215-216 (2012) (where conviction reversed solely due to error in admission of nontestifying codefendants\u2019 statements, see <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123 [1968], claimant not eligible for relief under erroneous convictions statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">As the parties recognize, this case falls between the circumstances in <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 363-365, and <em>Drumgold, supra, </em>where clearly exculpatory evidence was not available to the jury, and situations such as those discussed in <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 358 &amp; n.6, in which convictions are reversed only because of \u201cprocedural or evidentiary errors or structural deficiencies at . . . trial[].\u201d Relying on the specific circumstances in <em>Guzman </em>and <em>Drumgold, </em>the Commonwealth is of the view that only individuals whose convictions are reversed due to the failure to introduce exculpatory evidence at trial, or to the later discovery of such exculpatory evidence, are eligible for relief under the erroneous convictions statute. The Commonwealth maintains that Irwin\u2019s conviction, by contrast, was reversed solely due to the erroneous inclusion of \u201cexcessive\u201d \u201cinculpatory\u201d evidence of consciousness of guilt, in violation of his right against self-incrimination, a ground requiring a new trial but not tending to establish his innocence under G. L. c. 258D, \u00a7 1 (B) (ii). See <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 358 &amp; n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Nothing in our decisions in those cases, however, compels such a result. That judicial relief must have been granted on \u201cgrounds which tend to establish the innocence\u201d of a claimant does not limit the threshold question of eligibility for relief to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>individuals whose convictions were vacated or reversed based on the failure to admit exculpatory evidence. Rather, an individual is eligible to pursue a claim for compensation if his conviction was reversed on \u201cgrounds resting upon facts and circumstances probative of the proposition that the claimant did not commit the crime.\u201d <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 362. \u201cWhile we agree that the eligibility requirements of [G. L.] c. 258D were intended to limit the class of persons entitled to pursue relief, and in this sense perform a screening function, and that the relief granted must be on grounds tending to do more than merely assist the defendant\u2019s chances of acquittal, we do not discern a legislative intent that the determination of eligibility be tantamount to a testing of the merits of a claimant\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 360-361.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Nor does the language of the erroneous convictions statute, \u201cgrounds which tend to establish the innocence of the individual,\u201d restrict compensation only to those whose convictions were overturned based on the deliberate exclusion of exculpatory evidence. To do so would be inconsistent with the legislative purpose in enacting the statute, that those erroneously convicted but factually innocent be afforded equal opportunities to obtain compensation.

A century ago, a seminal study of erroneous convictions identified the sources of such convictions as including erroneous eyewitness testimony, false confessions, faulty circumstantial evidence, and prosecutorial excesses. See Borchard, European Systems of State Indemnity for Errors of Criminal Justice, 3 J. Am. Inst. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 684 (1913). Notwithstanding the advent of deoxyribonucleic acid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>(DNA) testing, which brought the issue of false convictions to the fore,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> those factors continue to underlie many erroneous convictions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See Kahn, Presumed Guilty Until Proven Innocent: The Burden of Proof in Wrongful Conviction Claims Under State Compensation Statutes, 44 U. Mich. J.L. Reform 123, 128 (2010) (Kahn).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Known erroneous convictions in Massachusetts, where the person convicted has later been determined to be \u201cactually innocent,\u201d have arisen from the deliberate suppression of exculpatory evidence, but also from, inter alia, the admission of false inculpatory evidence. One study of thirty-three known erroneous convictions in Massachusetts showed that deliberate suppression of exculpatory evidence by police or prosecutors underlay twelve of the convictions. Fisher, Convictions of Innocent Persons in Massachusetts: An Overview, 12 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 1, 62-63 (2002). Perjury on the part of third-party witnesses, jailhouse informants, victims, or police also resulted in twelve erroneous convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 63.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Misidentification by eyewitnesses, whether mistaken or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>through perjury, continues to be a significant factor in a large number of erroneous convictions.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>460 Mass. 590, 604 n.16 (2011) (eyewitness testimony is \u201cgreatest source of wrongful convictions\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>447 Mass. 274, 293 &amp; n.4 (2006) (Cordy, J., dissenting) (\u201cThere is no longer any doubt that mistaken eyewitness identification is the primary cause of erroneous convictions, outstripping all other causes combined . . .\u201d).

Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 825, 829 n.20 (2010) (Gould), citing Gross, Jacoby, Matheson, Montgomery, &amp; Patil, Exonerations in the United States 1989 Through 2003, 95 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 523, 528-529 (2005). In twenty-five per cent of rape cases submitted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for DNA testing, the primary suspect identified by police was excluded as the perpetrator. Gould, <em>supra </em>at 830, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>citing E. Connors, T. Lundregan, N. Mill, &amp; T. McEwen, Convicted by Juries, Exonerated by Science: Case Studies in the Use of DNA Evidence to Establish Innocence After Trial (1996). Despite the evident appeal and relative certainty of exoneration based on DNA evidence, however, in many circumstances, such as in Irwin\u2019s case, DNA evidence will be unavailable.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In enacting the erroneous convictions statute, the Legislature clearly recognized this reality, and did not, unlike some other jurisdictions, provide for compensation only where a defendant was exonerated based on DNA evidence. See Kahn, <em>supra </em>at 138 &amp; n.62 (Missouri, Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 650.058 [2007]; Montana, Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 53-1-214 [2009]; and Vermont, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, \u00a7 5574 [2009], require exoneration by DNA evidence).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Clearly, in some circumstances, inclusion of false inculpatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>evidence, such as deliberately perjured testimony by an arresting officer, could be a ground tending to establish innocence. Moreover, and notwithstanding the Commonwealth\u2019s argument to the contrary, the presence of an error requiring reversal on procedural or structural grounds does not itself preclude a determination that a conviction was reversed on grounds tending to establish innocence.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Commonwealth\u2019s argument misconstrues our discussion in <em>Guzman </em>of circumstances that, without more, would require a new trial but would not tend to establish innocence. See <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 358 n.6. It would be absurd to conclude that, for instance, where exculpatory alibi evidence was deliberately omitted, and the prosecutor also argued improperly during closing argument that he believed one of the witnesses\u2019 stories, a claimant would be ineligible to pursue a claim for relief, or that any improprieties in the closing argument should be disregarded in evaluating the grounds on which the claimant\u2019s conviction was overturned.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> See <em>Drumgold, supra </em>at 377-378.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>We turn to the reasons for the reversal of Irwin\u2019s conviction. Irwin\u2019s conviction was overturned based on improperly introduced evidence of his prearrest silence, and emphasis by the prosecutor on that silence as evidence of consciousness of guilt. See <em>Irwin, supra </em>at 654-655. The Commonwealth insists repeatedly that evidence of Irwin\u2019s delay in communicating with police was \u201cinculpatory\u201d evidence of consciousness of guilt. An individual who has not been arrested or charged, however, may choose not to speak with police for a myriad of reasons. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>386 Mass. 54, 61-62 (1982); <em>Irwin, supra </em>at 649, and cases cited. Evidence of a defendant\u2019s prearrest silence may be introduced against him at trial to establish consciousness of guilt only where it would be reasonable to expect that an ordinary person would speak; a defendant\u2019s prearrest silence may be used for impeachment purposes only if it would have been \u201cnatural\u201d for a person in the circumstances to choose to speak. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, supra </em>at 62.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">\u201cConsciousness of guilt instructions are permissible when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>there is an \u2018inference of guilt that may be drawn from evidence of flight, concealment, or similar acts,\u2019 such as false statements to the police, destruction or concealment of evidence, or bribing or threatening a witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, </em>450 Mass. 449, 453 (2008), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. 575, 584 &amp; n.4 (1982). Here, there was no such evidence. \u201cThat the defendant said that he would call [the detective] back or have his attorney do so, and that [the detective] never heard again from anyone, is not a sufficient evidentiary foundation to support [a consciousness of guilt] instruction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, supra </em>at 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s argument that Irwin\u2019s prearrest silence is \u201cinculpatory evidence\u201d miscasts evidence that was simply not probative or relevant, see <em>id., </em>and should not have been admitted.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough pre-arrest silence may reflect negatively on a defendant\u2019s trial testimony, that silence may be entirely unrelated to the truth or falsity of his testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, supra </em>at 61 n.6. It is far from clear that, as the prosecutor argued, an innocent person would have been eager to speak with police in these circumstances. Any defendant who had watched a police crime drama on television would be likely to know that, whatever he told police, the trial would devolve into a question of the complainant\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s credibility. Indeed, when police attempted to speak with the uncharged Closker about the incident, he declined to meet with them. <em>Irwin, supra </em>at 647 n.9. Moreover, as a person who was then homeless and who had three prior convictions, for unrelated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>types of offenses, Irwin could well have had many reasons based on prior experience for his apparent reluctance to speak with police.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Thus, as the Appeals Court discussed, nothing in the evidence of Irwin\u2019s prearrest silence went toward establishing any element of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. See <em>Irwin, supra </em>at 656. The improperly admitted evidence, however, and the closing argument based thereon, went to the heart of Irwin\u2019s defense of misidentification and deprived the jury of the ability to weigh and consider fairly the evidence that Irwin committed the offense charged. Cf. <em>Drumgold, supra </em>at 377-379. Thus, Irwin was deprived of a fair trial, and a new trial was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">The power of the improperly admitted evidence is starkly demonstrated by the differing outcomes at Irwin\u2019s two trials, conducted two days apart, by the same attorneys and before the same judge. Irwin\u2019s first trial, on October 18, 2005, ended in a mistrial when the jury were unable to reach a verdict. His second trial began on October 20. Irwin again testified in his own defense. While evidence of his prearrest silence had been elicited at his first trial, it was emphasized at his second trial. On cross-examination, Irwin was asked repeatedly why he did not attend the scheduled interview in September, 2003; whether he was \u201cfrightened\u201d or \u201calarmed\u201d when he learned the reason Potter wanted to speak with him; and whether, on learning the nature of the allegations, he \u201cmust have wanted to speak with the detective right away.\u201d <em>Irwin, supra </em>at 652. The prosecutor emphasized the delay of three months between September and December, and suggested that it would have been natural (\u201cone would think that you must have wanted to speak with the detective right away. Yes?\u201d) to want to speak with police if one were innocent of the allegations. <em>Id. </em>at 652-653. Unlike Irwin\u2019s first trial, where this line of questioning was not mentioned during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, at his second trial, the prosecutor relied heavily on the argument that an innocent person would have spoken to police. See <em>id. </em>at 654 (argument was \u201ca theme of the closing\u201d). Irwin was convicted on October 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Nonetheless, because the improperly admitted evidence was not probative and not relevant to establish any fact at trial, its exclusion also did not change the weight of the properly admitted evidence. While we do not preclude the possibility of sit\u00faa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>tions where the improper admission of evidence of a defendant\u2019s silence, and closing argument based thereon, could also be grounds tending to establish a defendant\u2019s innocence, in the circumstances here, the exclusion of the improper evidence would not have tended to make it more likely that Irwin did not commit the offense charged. Without the improper evidence, the jury would have had before it the claimant\u2019s statements of accusation, and Irwin\u2019s statements of denial. Although the impermissible evidence could well have contributed to an unfair and erroneous weighing of Irwin\u2019s statements by the jury, the exclusion of the nonprobative and irrelevant evidence would have had no bearing on the weight of the remaining evidence, which would have been, as before, confined largely to the complainant\u2019s statements and Irwin\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">In many circumstances, as here, a conviction reversed because of the inclusion of nonprobative, but highly prejudicial, evidence related to a defendant\u2019s prearrest silence would not \u201crest[] upon facts and circumstances probative of the proposition that the claimant did not commit the crime.\u201d <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 362. The admission of Irwin\u2019s prearrest silence, while highly prejudicial, was not probative of any fact, but neither does the exclusion of this highly prejudicial evidence make the complaint\u2019s allegations more or less likely. In these circumstances, ordering a new trial based on the improper evidence of Irwin\u2019s prearrest silence was not a reversal of Irwin\u2019s conviction on grounds \u201cprobative of the proposition that [Irwin] did not commit the crime.\u201d <em>Guzman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We conclude that Irwin\u2019s conviction was not overturned on grounds tending to establish his innocence. Thus, he is not an eligible claimant under G. L. c. 258D, \u00a7 1 (B) (ii). The order denying the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss is vacated and set aside.

See Gross, <em>supra </em>at 530-531 (\u201c[A] detailed study analyzed all known cases of eyewitness misidentification in the United States from 1900 through 1983 .... That study found that misidentifications in robberies outnumbered those in rapes by more than two to one; in fact, robberies accounted for more than half of all known cases of proven misidentifications. The pattern in [a study of DNA exonerations] could hardly be more different. [Of the 121 DNA exonerations] in rape cases, ... in [eighty-eight per cent], the defendant was the victim of eyewitness misidentifications\u201d; of six DNA exonerations for robbery, all six included eyewitness misidentifications).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b868-7\">A majority of States have enacted erroneous compensation statutes in some form.

Nor is it necessary that the judge granting relief make any specific finding as to the likely innocence of the defendant in order for him to be eligible to bring an action under [G. L.] c. 258D. Implicit in the judge\u2019s allowance of the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for a new trial was her recognition that the newly discovered evidence relating to [one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses] and the undisclosed evidence related to [another witness] were probative of the central issue at trial: the reliability of the identification of Drumgold as one of the shooters and, correspondingly, the veracity of his alibi defense. Drumgold\u2019s guilt turned on the jury accepting the testimony of [those witnesses] as being credible and rejecting the testimony of the defendant and others as to the defendant\u2019s alibi.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\">In further support of this argument, the Commonwealth maintains that, at any trial pursuant to G.

The Commonwealth urges that the admissibility provisions of G.

This argument disregards the evidentiary rule that, at any trial, to be admissible, evidence must be relevant and probative. Irwin\u2019s prearrest silence was neither. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Irwin, </em>72 Mass.

Ct. 2174, 2180-2183 (2013), the United States Supreme Court upheld a conviction in which the defendant\u2019s prearrest silence was introduced in the government\u2019s case-in-chief as evidence of consciousness of guilt because the defendant had not explicitly invoked his rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. As we noted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>386 Mass. 54, 59 (1982), citing <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>447 U.S. 231, 239 (1980), however, the Court \u201chas held that a defendant\u2019s prearrest silence may be used to impeach him without denying fundamental fairness guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d but \u201chas left it to the States to determine their own rules of evidence when prearrest silence is so inconsistent with a defendant\u2019s testimony that impeachment by reference to that silence is probative.\u201d In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, supra, </em>a case in which the defendant made no claims under the Massachusetts Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>and which we decided on common-law grounds, we stated, \u201cBecause evidence of a defendant\u2019s pretrial silence may have a disproportionate impact upon the minds of the jurors and because the potential for prejudice inherent in such evidence outweigh(s) its marginal probative worth, we conclude that the use of such evidence for impeachment purposes cannot be justified in the absence of unusual circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Conyers, </em>52 N.Y.2d 454, 459 (1981).
