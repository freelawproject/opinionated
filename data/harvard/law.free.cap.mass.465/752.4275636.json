Smeaton, was operating a motor vehicle on West Street, a public way in the city of Northampton, in the vicinity of Smith College (college). A campus police officer, appointed as a special State police officer pursuant to G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 63 (\u00a7 63), observed him driving recklessly along the portion of West Street that intersects the college campus. Just beyond the heart of the campus, the officer stopped the defendant\u2019s vehicle. After the stop, the Northampton police arrived, placed the defendant under arrest, and charged him with operating while under the influence of alcohol in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(a) </em>(1); reckless operation of a motor vehicle in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) <em>(a); </em>and a marked lanes violation under G. L. c. 89, \u00a7 4A.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the traffic stop on the ground that the campus police officer did not have the authority to effectuate the stop beyond the boundaries of the college campus. The motion was denied, but the defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration, heard by a different judge, was allowed. In allowing the motion, the judge essentially concluded that the offense and the stop occurred off campus, and because the college buildings abutting West Street were largely unoccupied at the time, there was no \u201cspecial vigilance\u201d that permitted the stop to be made in the \u201cenvirons surrounding the campus.\u201d See <em>Young </em>v. <em>Boston Univ., </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 586, 588 (2005), cert, denied, 549 U.S. 832, and 549 U.S. 1072 (2006) <em>(Young). </em>Consequently, the stop was beyond the statutory power of arrest granted to special State police officers by \u00a7 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">A single justice of this court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for leave to file an interlocutory appeal in the Appeals Court. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We reverse, concluding that the campus police officer observed the defendant commit a criminal offense \u201cin or upon lands . . . used . . . by\u201d the college, see \u00a7 63, and that the traffic stop was either in or on those same lands or within the \u201cenvirons\u201d of the college, see <em>Young, supra, </em>and thus was permissible under \u00a7 63.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>1. <em>Background. </em>We consider the facts from the motion judge\u2019s findings, supplemented by uncontroverted facts adduced at the hearing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>433 Mass. 669, 670 (2001). At approximately 1:30 a.m. on October 11, 2010, campus police Officer John Wagner, patrolling in a marked cruiser, was stopped at a traffic light at the intersection of West, Main, and Elm Streets in Northampton. Each of these streets is a public way. They intersect at the edge of the college\u2019s campus closest to downtown Northampton. Both Elm and West Streets intersect the campus and Main Street runs perpendicular to it. Wagner was stopped on Elm Street and faced Main Street, which leads out of the campus area and into downtown Northampton. He observed a sport utility vehicle approach the intersection from Main Street. Wagner estimated that the vehicle was traveling at a speed of forty miles per hour, fifteen miles above the speed limit. Without decelerating, the vehicle went through the intersection and turned left onto West Street. As the vehicle made the turn, there was a pedestrian in the crosswalk. Wagner described the pedestrian as a \u201ccollege-aged female.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The vehicle just missed the pedestrian and, with its tires squealing, drove onto the sidewalk and grass near the intersection and in front of College Hall, an administrative building owned by the college. The vehicle then proceeded down West Street. Wagner turned his cruiser around and began to follow. Along the right side of the street, the defendant\u2019s vehicle passed several buildings as well as an on-campus indoor athletic facility, all either owned or occupied, or both, by the college. On the left side of the street, the defendant\u2019s vehicle passed an administrative building, a parking garage, a power plant, and a facilities management building, all owned and operated by the college. The parking garage is open twenty-four hours a day and available both to the public and to members of the college community. As the defendant\u2019s vehicle passed along this portion of West Street, Wagner estimated it to be traveling at a speed of fifty-five miles per hour \u2014 thirty miles over the speed limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">While following the vehicle, Wagner radioed the Northamp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>ton police department to inform them of his pursuit. Wagner stopped the defendant\u2019s vehicle on West Street, where it intersects with Paquette Avenue. That intersection is located between the main portion of the campus and several of its outlying facilities. Specifically, the college\u2019s athletic fields are reached by way of a road on the right, just past the intersection of West Street and Paquette Avenue; the entrance to the college\u2019s equestrian center is located just beyond the intersection on the left.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Next to the equestrian center are several buildings that are owned by the college but privately rented. The buildings immediately surrounding the vehicle at the location of the traffic stop were privately owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">After stopping the vehicle, Wagner conducted a \u201cthreshold inquiry\u201d and waited for a Northampton police officer to arrive. Once the Northampton police officer arrived, the defendant was arrested and charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">2. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>In allowing the motion to suppress, the judge concluded that Wagner \u201cexceeded his authority when he pulled the defendant over on West Street.\u201d Although the judge found that the defendant and Wagner were located \u201cin the vicinity of the College,\u201d she also found that the defendant was \u201cpassing by many privately owned buildings.\u201d Additionally, the judge found that the buildings on West Street that were associated with the college were not \u201coccupied\u201d at the time of the traffic stop because they were all closed at 1:30 a.m., with the exception of the parking garage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge opined that under <em>Young, supra </em>at 588, there was no need for \u201cspecial vigilance\u201d where the buildings surrounding Wagner\u2019s pursuit of the defendant were, \u201cfor the most part, unoccupied and closed,\u201d and where \u201cfoot and vehicle traffic [surrounding the defendant\u2019s route] was light.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>3. <em>Discussion. </em>An employee of a college, university, other educational institution, or hospital, who is appointed and sworn in as a special State police officer, has \u201cthe same power to make arrests as regular police officers for any criminal offense committed in or upon lands or structures owned, used or occupied by\u201d their employing institution. G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 63.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We have said that the authority to make an arrest may extend \u201cto the environs surrounding the campus when the \u2018special vigilance of an officer might be required to keep the peace and preserve order amongst those frequenting [the campus and] those carrying persons to and from it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>456 Mass. 528, 530 n.3 (2010), quoting <em>Young, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In deciding this case, we must first consider whether the campus police officer observed a criminal offense \u2014 reckless operation of a motor vehicle \u2014 and, if so, whether that criminal offense, committed on a public way intersecting the college campus, was committed on land \u201cowned, used or occupied\u201d by the college.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If it was, we must next consider whether the stop of the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle occurred either on such land or within the environs surrounding the campus in the circumstances that would justify it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Wagner observed the defendant drive through an intersection at a high rate of speed; make a left turn, tires squealing, without decelerating; nearly collide with a pedestrian in a marked crosswalk; drive up onto the sidewalk and grass adjacent to West <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Street and College Hall; and then continue down West Street at a speed far in excess of the speed limit. With these observations, we have little doubt that Wagner had probable cause to believe that the defendant was committing the crime of reckless operation of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">It is undisputed that the actions that constituted the \u201creckless operation of a motor vehicle\u201d were committed on West Street, a public way, and, therefore, were not committed \u201cin or upon lands or structures <em>owned </em>... or occupied\u201d by the college (emphasis added). See G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 63. The defendant suggests that our analysis ought to terminate here. That suggestion, however, ignores the Legislature\u2019s inclusion of the word \u201cused\u201d in \u00a7 63. Thus, the question becomes whether the portion of West Street from its intersection with Main and Elm Streets to its intersection with Paquette Avenue is \u201cused\u201d by the college within the meaning of \u00a7 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Wagner testified that West Street is one of the streets that intersect the campus and that campus buildings are located on either side of it. The twenty-four hour parking garage, used by persons visiting the college facilities, can be reached only from West Street, as is the college power plant and facilities management building. In addition, many of the college\u2019s private drives and pathways, located well within the heart of campus and leading to the college\u2019s academic, administrative, and residential buildings, are also accessed from West Street. Moreover, college vehicles and personnel must use West Street to travel to the equestrian center and the athletic fields, which are both located just beyond Paquette Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The term \u201cuse\u201d does not imply exclusive use, and \u00a7 63 does not indicate that an institution\u2019s \u201cuse\u201d of particular \u201clands or structures\u201d must be exclusive in order to trigger the operation of that section. We conclude that the portion of West Street where Wagner observed the defendant driving recklessly was land sufficiently \u201cused\u201d by the college to come within the meaning of \u00a7 63 and, consequently, that the defendant\u2019s criminal offense was committed on such land and Wagner had the authority to stop him just short of the equestrian center and the athletic fields, which was also land sufficiently \u201cused\u201d by the college.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Even if we were to conclude that the stop itself was effected beyond the portion of West Street most heavily used to access the campus\u2019s academic and administrative facilities, and therefore beyond land \u201cused\u201d by the college for \u00a7 63 purposes, we would still conclude that the stop was proper in the circumstances presented here. Because the location of the stop is within the environs of the college (if not on land \u201cused\u201d by the college) and because Wagner\u2019s special vigilance was required to preserve the peace amongst those frequenting the college, Wagner would have been justified in making an extraterritorial arrest of the defendant at this location.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Section 63 does not, on its face, confine the power of arrest to any particular geographic or spatial area, so long as the criminal offense was committed on lands or structures owned, used, or occupied by the college.* *******<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The question whether an arrest can be made beyond lands or structures owned, used, or oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>cupied by a university was confronted by the Appeals Court in the <em>Young </em>case, <em>supra. </em>The defendant in that case was observed on the Boston University campus in violation of a protective order obtained under G. L. c. 209A (a criminal offense). This was reported to the campus police, who later observed the defendant driving near the campus on Commonwealth Avenue, a public way. <em>Young, supra </em>at 588. A campus police officer, sworn in as a special State police officer under \u00a7 63, arrested him. The Appeals Court did not consider whether the portion of Commonwealth Avenue where the defendant was arrested was land \u201cused\u201d by Boston University but concluded that \u201cas a special State police officer, a [Boston University] police officer\u2019s authority [to arrest] extends to the environs surrounding the campus when the \u2018special vigilance of an officer might be required to keep the peace and preserve order amongst those frequenting the [university and] those carrying persons to and from it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hastings, 9 </em>Met. 259, 262 (1845).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>We recently indorsed this view of a special State police officer\u2019s authority in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>456 Mass. 528, 530 n.3 (2010), when we declined to \u201cdisturb the decision of the Appeals Court in <em>Young.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The geographic boundaries of this authority, described by the Appeals Court in <em>Young, supra </em>at 588, as the \u201cenvirons surrounding the campus,\u201d will vary somewhat depending on the configuration of the many universities and colleges operating in the Commonwealth. But surely the \u201cenvirons\u201d will include those areas where students, faculty, and visitors might be exposed to danger from the type of conduct exhibited by the defendant in this case. In the present case, the section of West Street stretching out from the center of the campus and providing access to its equestrian center and athletic fields would come within an area surrounding the college (if not on land \u201cused\u201d by it) and is therefore within its environs.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">In order to justify making an arrest in these environs, Wagner would be required to demonstrate that his \u201cspecial vigilance . . . might be required to keep the peace and preserve order amongst those frequenting [the college and] those carrying persons to and from it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>quoting <em>Young, supra. </em>Certainly, the defendant\u2019s erratic driving is the type of conduct that poses a threat to the peace and order of those who might frequent the campus. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>435 Mass. 440, 443-444 (2001) (excessive speed and erratic driving posed imminent danger of breach of the peace justifying an extraterritorial stop in Salisbury by an Amesbury police officer to \u201cpreserve the peace\u201d). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mekalian, </em>346 Mass. 496, 497-498 (1963) (registering of bets not breach of peace); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gorman, </em>288 Mass. 294, 298 (1934) (possession of short lobster and voluntary drunkenness in private not breaches of peace); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baez, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 565, 570 (1997) (driving without valid license not breach of peace).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The judge concluded that there was no need for \u201cspecial vigilance\u201d because the buildings surrounding Wagner\u2019s pursuit of the defendant were closed and because there was not much foot or vehicle traffic nearby at the time. The intentions of the defendant were unknown to Wagner. He may have intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>turn left into the equestrian center, to turn right into the athletic fields, or simply to proceed beyond them. We do not require a police officer to divine such things in the face of criminal conduct. Nor do we think it prudent or necessary to shrink or expand the boundary of an officer\u2019s authority depending on the time of day or the number of persons who may be placed at risk at any given moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">The order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is reversed. The case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\">We acknowledge the amicus brief filed by the Massachusetts Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators in support of the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b772-6\">In his testimony, Officer John Wagner did not indicate whether he knew the pedestrian to be a Smith College (college) student, but he did testify that he observed her continue to walk north on Elm Street toward the center of the campus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The college\u2019s equestrian center was closed at the time of the traffic stop. The tennis courts, a part of the athletic fields, were open. See note 4, <em>infra. </em>Wagner testified that he was unaware of any curfew to which the college students were subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b773-10\">The judge also found that neither \u201cthe athletic fields [n]or [the] buildings or the stables\u201d were open at the time of the traffic stop. But Wagner\u2019s uncontroverted testimony was that the tennis courts, a part of the athletic fields, were open at 1:30 a.m. Our decision does not depend on the resolution of this discrepancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b774-7\">General Laws c. 22C, \u00a7 63 (\u00a7 63), reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-8\">\u201cThe colonel [of the State police] may . . . appoint employees of [a] college, university, or other educational institution or hospital as special state police officers [who] . . . shall have the same power to make arrests as regular police officers for any criminal offense committed in or upon lands or structures owned, used or occupied by such college, university, or other institution or hospital.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b774-12\">The judge correctly found that a campus police officer has no authority to issue civil motor vehicle citations, such as one for a marked lane violation, and no authority to stop a vehicle for committing such a violation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mullen, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 404, 406-407 (1996). Accordingly, we focus on Wagner\u2019s observation of the defendant\u2019s reckless operation of his motor vehicle in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) <em>(a), </em>a criminal offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b774-13\">Officer Wagner would only have had the authority to \u201cstop\u201d the defendant if he had the authority to arrest him pursuant to \u00a7 63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>456 Mass. 528 (2010), is unavailing. The defendant relies on that case to argue that special State police officers, under \u00a7 63, have no authority to arrest an individual who never entered the campus\u2019s perimeter and when \u201cthere [is] \u2018absolutely no nexus between any of the [relevant] events\u2019 and [the college].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530. In that case, Boston University campus police \u201crandomly\u201d ran a check on the defendant\u2019s automobile registration plate after they observed him parked at a gasoline station located on a public way near the Boston Medical Center. <em>Id. </em>at 529. The check yielded an outstanding arrest warrant for the owner of the vehicle due to a misdemeanor motor vehicle violation. <em>Id. </em>The campus police officers then arrested the defendant. <em>Id. </em>We held that the campus police officers had no authority to arrest the defendant for an offense that was not \u201ccommitted in or upon lands or structures owned or used or occupied\u201d by Boston University. <em>Id. </em>at 530. Unlike in the <em>Hernandez </em>case, here the defendant was observed committing a \u201ccriminal offense\u201d along a portion of West Street, which was \u201cused\u201d by the college.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b776-14\">The requirement that there be a \u201cnexus\u201d between the \u201crelevant events,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra </em>at 530, and the educational institution in order for a special State police officer, sworn in under \u00a7 63, to make an arrest arises from the explicit requirement in \u00a7 63 that the criminal offense be \u201ccommitted in or upon lands or structures owned, used or occupied by\u201d the institution. In this case, that nexus requirement is satisfied because the \u201ccriminal offense [was] committed\u201d on land \u201cused\u201d by the college.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-15\">There is a further nexus requirement before a special State police officer can assert the authority to make an arrest beyond the lands or structures owned, used, or occupied by the college, i.e., in its \u201cenvirons.\u201d That nexus manifests in the required showing that \u201cspecial vigilance of an officer might be required to keep the peace and preserve order <em>amongst those frequenting the [campus and] those carrying persons to and from it\u201d </em>in order to justify an extraterritorial arrest (emphasis added). See <em>Young </em>v. <em>Boston Univ., </em>64 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>App. Ct. 586, 588 (2005), cert, denied, 549 U.S. 832, and 549 U.S. 1072 (2006), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hastings, </em>9 Met. 259,262 (1845). As discussed <em>infra, </em>that nexus requirement would be satisfied here because Wagner could have reasonably believed that his \u201cspecial vigilance\u201d was required in order to prevent the defendant from harming any college-affiliated individuals near the location of the traffic stop, as a result of his reckless driving.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hastings, </em>9 Met. 259, 260 (1845), we considered, inter alia, whether a special police officer, appointed to the National Theatre, had the authority to arrest an individual in a bar \u201cnear the theatre\u201d for the offense of being a disorderly person, which was committed within the theatre. We held that the special police officer\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">\u201cauthority would not be limited to the space within the walls of the theatre, but would extend to the passages and the environs, so far as the special vigilance of an officer might be required to keep the peace and preserve order amongst those frequenting the theatre, those carrying persons to and from it, and those supplying refreshments, and also to shops, stalls and stands, kept in the vicinity, for that purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 262. We thus indorsed the notion that a special police officer, entrusted to protect a certain area, may exercise his authority to make an arrest just outside the area which he is entrusted to protect, in order to \u201ckeep the peace and preserve order\u201d within that area.
