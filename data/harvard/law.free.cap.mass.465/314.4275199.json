L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(d) </em>(i), infringes on Mirko Chardin\u2019s right to keep and bear arms under the Second and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>because it precludes him from ever obtaining a license to carry firearms where, in 1995, he was adjudicated a delinquent child<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> after admitting to sufficient facts on a complaint charging him with one count of possession of a firearm without a license, and one count of unlawful possession of ammunition. We conclude that, consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570 (2008) <em>{Heller), </em>and <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>130 S. Ct. 3020 (2010) <em>{McDonald), </em>the challenged statute does not infringe on a right protected by the Second Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">1. <em>Statutory scheme. </em>An individual who lawfully wants to carry a firearm<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> within the Commonwealth either must obtain a license to do so pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, or be exempt from the statutory licensing requirements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See, e.g., G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 129C, 13IF, 131G. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seay, </em>376 Mass. 735, 739 (1978). \u201cThe historical aim of licensure generally is preservation of public health, safety, and welfare by extending the public trust only to those with proven qualifications.\u201d <em>Leduc </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>421 Mass. 433, 435 (1995), cert, denied, 519 U.S. 827 (1996). In Massachusetts, there are two categories of licenses to carry firearms \u2014 Class A and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Class B. See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 (a) &amp; <em>(b). </em>Each type of license may be issued by a \u201clicensing authority,\u201d defined as \u201cthe chief of police or the board or officer having control of the police in a city or town, or persons authorized by them,\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, or by the colonel of the State police, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(d). </em>The Class A license, which is the focus of this case, authorizes the holder to possess and carry \u201cfirearms, including large capacity firearms, and feeding devices and ammunition therefor, for all lawful purposes, subject to such restrictions relative to the possession, use or carrying of firearms as the licensing authority deems proper.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(a). </em>In the absence of a restriction, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(a), </em>does not prohibit the possession or carrying of a concealed firearm in public. See <em>Hightower </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>693 F.3d 61, 66 (1st Cir. 2012). Contrast G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(b) </em>(precluding holder of Class B license from possessing or carrying loaded firearm \u201cin a concealed manner in any public way or place\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The licensing authority or colonel of the State police may issue a Class A license to carry firearms \u201cif it appears that the applicant is a suitable person to be issued such license, and that the applicant has good reason to fear injury to his person or property, or for any other reason.\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>id). </em>The \u201csuitable person\u201d standard gives the licensing authority or colonel \u201cconsiderable latitude\u201d or broad discretion in making a licensing decision. <em>Ruggiero </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 256, 259 (1984). See <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Wakefield </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902 (2003). However, an applicant is statutorily disqualified from obtaining a license to carry firearms if, among other reasons, the applicant \u201chas, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>any state or federal jurisdiction, been convicted or adjudicated a youthful offender or delinquent child for the commission of <em>(a) </em>a felony . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(d) </em>(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Within forty days from the date of the application, the licensing authority shall \u201ceither approve the application and issue the license or deny the application and notify the applicant of the reason for such denial in writing.\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 (e). If an application is denied, the aggrieved party may file, within ninety days after receiving notice, \u201ca petition to obtain judicial review in the district court having jurisdiction in the city or town\u201d where the application was filed. G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 (/). A judge, after an evidentiary hearing, may direct that a license be issued to the petitioner if the judge finds that there was \u201cno reasonable ground\u201d for denying such license, and that the petitioner \u201cis not prohibited by law from possessing [the] same.\u201d <em>Id </em>See <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Wellesley, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 42, 44-45 (1993). The petitioner is entitled to relief only if the licensing authority\u2019s denial was \u201carbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46, quoting <em>Chief of Police of Shelburne </em>v. <em>Moyer, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 543, 546 (1983). Further judicial review is available to the petitioner by way of an action in the nature of certiorari. See G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. See also <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Chief Justice of the Dist.

In early 1995, when Chardin was fourteen years old, one of his best friends was shot and killed for the pair of sneakers that the friend had been wearing. Fearing for his personal safety, Chardin obtained a handgun for his own protection. He never used it to commit a crime or threaten anyone. On January 18, 1995, while Chardin was standing in front of a plain-clothed police officer, the handgun fell from the pocket of his pants onto the ground. Chardin was arrested and taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">On January 19, 1995, he was charged in the Juvenile Court with one count of possession of a firearm without a license, and one count of unlawful possession of ammunition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On April 18, 1995, Chardin admitted to sufficient facts and was adjudicated a delinquent child with respect to both charges. He received a suspended commitment to the Department of Youth Services, was released to his mother\u2019s custody, and was given probation until April 18, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In the years since this incident, Chardin has been a law-abiding citizen. He graduated from college, earned a master\u2019s degree in teaching, has been working toward a Ph.D. in education, became an ordained minister, and has done volunteer work in his community. Chardin currently is employed as the head of the Putnam Avenue Upper School in Cambridge. He also is a coowner and manager of a small used car dealership in the Roslindale area of Boston, JBI Auto Sales LLC (JBI). He works there part-time, at night and on the weekends, and he regularly attends car auctions to buy vehicles for JBI. At these auctions, purchases must be made in cash, so Chardin is required to carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>large amounts of money on his person, which has caused him to fear for his safety. In addition, JBI has a night deposit agreement with Citizens Bank whereby Chardin regularly makes large cash deposits for JBI, again raising personal safety concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">On April 26, 2010, Chardin submitted to the Boston police department an application for an unrestricted Class A license to carry firearms, which he stated that he was requesting for \u201call lawful purpose[s],\u201d together with a fee of $100.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On an attached worksheet, Chardin responded more specifically to a question about why he required such a license by stating that it was for \u201cclub use\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and for \u201cprotection as a used car dealer who is required to make large cash purchases/transactions. \u201d By letter dated July 26, 2010, the police commissioner, who is the licensing authority for the city of Boston under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 121 and 131, denied the application, stating: \u201c[Y]ou have a sealed record with a disqualifying conviction(s) as outlined in chapter 180 of the Acts of 1998.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">On October 15, 2010, Chardin filed a complaint for judicial review in the Boston Municipal Court pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(f).</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>He stated that he was seeking a Class A license to carry firearms \u201cdue to the dangers involved in his used car dealership business.\u201d In Count I of his complaint, Chardin alleged that the denial of his application was based on an error of law in that he did not have any convictions or adjudications on his juvenile record that would disqualify him under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(d) </em>(i), from obtaining a license because the charges on his record ultimately were dismissed. In Count H, Chardin alleged that the denial of his application was a mistake due to the absence of disqualifying factors. Finally, in Count III of his complaint, Chardin alleged that if his juvenile charges were deemed to be automatic disqualifiers under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(d) </em>(i), then the statute, as applied to Chardin, was unconstitutional because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>violated his fundamental right to keep and bear arms as guaranteed by the Second and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution pursuant to <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. at 635, and <em>McDonald, </em>130 S. Ct. at 3050.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">An evidentiary hearing was held on March 15, 2011. Although the judge agreed with the police commissioner that the only issue before her was the applicability of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(d) </em>(i), to Chardin\u2019s circumstances, she allowed Chardin to testify regarding his suitability for a license.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Chardin described the events leading up to his adjudication as a delinquent child, and the path his life had taken since that time. Among other things, he stated that he only would use a firearm in circumstances where he or a family member was in danger, and he responded \u201c[y]es\u201d when his attorney asked whether that would include \u201cat the auctions or at home.\u201d Testimony also was presented from Lieutenant Mark Harrington of the Boston police department who, on behalf of the police commissioner, had reviewed Chardin\u2019s application. He stated that once he received notice of Chardin\u2019s statutory disqualification, due to his adjudication as a delinquent child for possession of a firearm without a license, he did not go any further in the application process. On March 30, 2011, the judge found that Chardin was \u201cstatutorily disqualified from possessing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>a license to carry a firearm.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The following day, the judge entered a judgment of dismissal in favor of the police commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">On April 8, 2011, Chardin filed a notice of appeal in the Boston Municipal Court. Six months later, he filed an action in the nature of certiorari, pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County. He alleged that G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(d) </em>(i), as applied to his circumstances, violated his right to keep and bear arms under the Second and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The Attorney General, on behalf of the Commonwealth, was allowed to intervene to defend the constitutionality of the statute. On April 6, 2012, the single justice reserved and reported the case for decision by the full court.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">3. <em>Constitutional framework. </em>The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: \u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d To determine whether G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(d) </em>(i), impermissibly burdens Chardin\u2019s Second Amendment right, we begin with <em>Heller. </em>In that case, the United States Supreme Court considered whether \u201ca District of Columbia prohibition on the possession of usable handguns in the home\u201d violated the Second Amendment. <em>Heller, supra </em>at 573. Based on textual and historical analyses, the Court concluded that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to keep and bear firearms in one\u2019s home for the purpose of self-defense.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 635. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>The Court opined that the Second Amendment \u201csurely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Since <em>Heller, </em>\u201c[cjourts have consistently recognized that <em>Heller </em>established that the possession of operative firearms for use in defense of the home constitutes the \u2018core\u2019 of the Second Amendment.\u201d <em>Hightower </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>693 F.3d 61, 72 (1st Cir. 2012), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>644 F.3d 12, 25 n.17 (1st Cir. 2011), cert, denied, 132 S. Ct. 1538 (2012). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>464 Mass. 232, 235 (2013) <em>(Mc</em>Gowan), and cases cited. Two years after its decision in <em>Heller, </em>a plurality of the Supreme Court held in <em>McDonald, supra, </em>that an individual\u2019s Second Amendment right was fully applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Notwithstanding its articulation in <em>Heller </em>of an individual right to keep and bear arms in one\u2019s home for self-defense, the Supreme Court also recognized that the Second Amendment right is \u201cnot unlimited, just as the First Amendment\u2019s right of free speech . . . [does not] protect the right of citizens to speak for <em>any </em>purpose\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Heller, supra </em>at 595. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>pointed out that \u201c[fjrom Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626. As such, the Court continued, an individual\u2019s Second Amendment right does not prohibit laws regulating who may purchase, possess, and carry firearms, and where such weapons may be carried. See <em>id. </em>at 626-627. Although the Supreme Court did not undertake \u201can exhaustive historical analysis\u201d of the full scope of the Second Amendment, it identified an expressly nonexclusive list of \u201cpresumptively lawful regulatory measures,\u201d declaring that nothing in <em>Heller </em>\u201cshould be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 626-627 &amp; n.26. Notably, the Court reiterated in <em>McDonald </em>its recognition of these permissible limitations when it stated that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s incorporation of Second Amendment rights \u201cdoes not imperil every law regulating firearms.\u201d <em>McDonald, supra </em>at 3047.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">With regard to the regulation of firearms, the Supreme Court made clear in <em>Heller </em>that \u201ca law that infringes the right to bear arms in self-defense within the scope of the Second Amendment is subject to some level of heightened scrutiny, rejecting the notion that rational basis scrutiny would suffice.\u201d <em>McGowan, supra </em>at 237. See <em>Heller, supra </em>at 628 n.27. However, the Court declined to \u201cidentify precisely what level of heightened scrutiny is appropriate because it concluded that the District of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Columbia\u2019s outright ban on handguns would fail under any level of scrutiny.\u201d <em>McGowan, supra </em>at 237-238. See <em>Heller, supra </em>at 628-629. Nonetheless, we have \u201cdiscern[ed] meaning from the Supreme Court\u2019s willingness to characterize some long-standing limitations on the right to bear arms, such as the prohibition of the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, ... as \u2018presumptively lawful\u2019 without subjecting these laws to heightened scrutiny, or identifying the level of heightened scrutiny that would apply. These laws could be presumptively lawful without such heightened scrutiny only if they fell outside the scope of the Second Amendment and therefore were not subject to heightened scrutiny.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>McGowan, supra </em>at 238, quoting <em>Heller, supra </em>at 627 n.26. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marzzarella, </em>614 F.3d 85, 91 (3d Cir. 2010), cert, denied, 131 S. Ct. 958 (2011) (\u201cpresumptively lawful\u201d language in <em>Heller </em>intended to put certain recognized prohibitions outside ambit of Second Amendment right delineated in <em>Heller). </em>In other words, long-standing and \u201cpresumptively lawful\u201d regulations on the right to keep and bear arms \u201cdo not burden conduct that falls within the scope of the Second Amendment and therefore are not subject to the heightened scrutiny required where protected conduct within the scope of the Second Amendment is infringed.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>McGowan, supra </em>at 239. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, supra </em>at 23-24 (felony firearm disqualification is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>presumptively lawful and only burdens conduct outside scope of Second Amendment); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marzzarella, supra </em>(long-standing firearms prohibitions, such as possession by felons and mentally ill persons, are exceptions to right to bear arms); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rene E., </em>583 F.3d 8, 15-16 (1st Cir. 2009), cert, denied, 558 U.S. 1131 (2010) (Federal statute barring juveniles from possessing handguns, with limited exceptions, consistent with long-standing practice of prohibiting certain classes of individuals from possessing firearms and not offensive to Second Amendment right). Contrast <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chester, </em>628 F.3d 673, 681, 683 (4th Cir. 2010) (intermediate scrutiny of Federal firearms prohibition appropriate because court \u201cnot able to say that the Second Amendment, as historically understood, did not apply to persons convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">4. <em>Discussion. </em>In 1995, when Chardin was adjudicated a delinquent child for possession of a firearm without a license, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>provided that such an offense was punishable by \u201cimprisonment in the state prison for not less than two and one-half years nor more than five years, or for not less than one year nor more than two and one-half years in a jail or house of correction.\u201d St. 1990, c. 511, \u00a7 2. A crime punishable by imprisonment in the State prison is a felony. See G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 1. Therefore, possession of a firearm without a license was (and still is) a felony in Massachusetts.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See <em>Yanovitch </em>v. <em>United States, </em>985 F. Supp. 17, 21 (D. Mass. 1997). That Chardin could not be sentenced to the State prison, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor C., </em>432 Mass. 635, 641 (2000), does not change the nature of his offense, even though an \u201cadjudication\u201d of delinquency generally is not a \u201cconviction\u201d of a crime. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 646 (expressly adhering to long-standing jurisprudence governing delinquent children, notwithstanding narrow holding that adjudication of delinquency for possession of firearm without license constitutes prior \u201cconviction\u201d under second offense penalty provision of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 [cZ]). See <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>384 Mass. 784, 786 (1981). In other words, although the juvenile justice system did not treat Char-din as a \u201ccriminal\u201d for his possession of a firearm without a license, as evidenced by the disposition of the charges against him, he nonetheless committed an unlawful act that was a felony. See <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>368 Mass. 754, 772 (1975) (act committed by juvenile against laws of Commonwealth is criminal act).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">It has been a \u201clong-standing principle\u201d in Massachusetts that \u201cthe treatment of children who offend our laws are not criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor C., supra </em>at 641. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>461 Mass. 616, 629-630, cert, denied, 133 S. Ct. 433 (2012); <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, supra. </em>General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 53, sets forth a legislative policy that statutory provisions dealing with delinquent children shall be construed liberally such that children brought before court, \u201cas far as practicable, . . . shall be treated, not as criminals, but as children in need of aid, encouragement and guidance.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Magnus M., </em>461 Mass. 459, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>461, 466 (2012) (discussing underlying philosophy and goals of juvenile justice system); R.L. Ireland, Juvenile Law \u00a7 1.3, at 18-32 (2d ed. 2006) (same). This statutory provision has remained unchanged since the chapter\u2019s original enactment in 1906, see St. 1906, c. 413, \u00a7 2, entitled \u201cAn Act relative to delinquent children.\u201d Significantly, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 53, was firmly in place when the Legislature enacted G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(d) </em>(i). See St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 41. Given that the \u201cLegislature is presumed to be aware of existing statutes when it. . . enacts a new one,\u201d <em>Paquette </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>440 Mass. 121, 130 (2003), cert, denied, 540 U.S. 1150 (2004), we conclude that the Legislature intended to preclude an individual who has been adjudicated a delinquent child for the commission of a felony from obtaining a license to carry firearms, notwithstanding the policy enunciated in G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 53. If the Legislature had wanted to exclude this class of persons from the provisions of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(d) </em>(i), it would not have expressly disqualified such persons from licensure.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Given that the Legislature has determined, as is its purview, that an adjudication as a delinquent child for the commission of a felony is a categorical bar to obtaining a license to carry firearms, the question becomes whether G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(d) </em>(i), infringes on Chardin\u2019s Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms as articulated in <em>Heller, supra </em>at 635, and <em>McDonald, supra </em>at 3050. In conformity with our discussion of the constitutional framework of this case, we conclude that \u00a7 131 <em>(d) </em>(i) does not burden conduct that falls within the scope of the Second Amendment. To the contrary, the statute embodies a long-standing and well-recognized prohibition on the possession of firearms by a particular group of individuals \u2014 those who have committed a felony \u2014 and is clearly encompassed within the \u201cpresumptively lawful regulatory measures\u201d that <em>Heller </em>has declared to be outside the ambit of the Second Amendment. See <em>Heller, supra </em>at 626-627 &amp; n.26. Accordingly, we conclude that G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(d) </em>(i), passes constitutional muster. Chardin\u2019s challenge to the statute is unavailing, and the Commonwealth may continue to enforce its provisions to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Our interpretation of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(d) </em>(i), does not run <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>afoul of recent Supreme Court jurisprudence recognizing the reduced culpability of juveniles as compared to adults and declaring unconstitutional the imposition of the harshest criminal penalties on juvenile offenders. First, in <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>543 U.S. 551, 564, 569-570, 578-579 (2005), the Court held that, in light of a \u201cnational consensus against the death penalty for juveniles\u201d and the general immaturity and vulnerability of those under eighteen years of age, imposition of the death penalty on offenders who were under that age when they committed their crimes is contrary to the prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment in the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Next, in <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>130 S. Ct. 2011, 2030 (2010), the Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole on a juvenile offender who does not commit the crime of homicide. The Court stated that such a \u201ccategorical rule gives all juvenile nonhomicide offenders a chance to demonstrate maturity and reform.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2032. Most recently, in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>132 S. Ct. 2455, 2469 (2012), the Court concluded that sentencing a juvenile to mandatory life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (as required for a conviction of murder in the first degree) similarly violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. That decision reaffirmed the \u201cdiminished culpability and greater prospects for reform\u201d of juvenile offenders. <em>Id. </em>at 2464.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">These cases highlighted the draconian consequences flowing from the imposition of the most severe criminal penalties on juvenile offenders who, because of their age and immaturity, are deemed to have lesser culpability than their adult counterparts. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Alabama, supra </em>at 2463, quoting <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Simmons, supra </em>at 560, \u201c[t]he Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment \u2018guarantees individuals the right not to be subjected to excessive sanctions\u2019. . . . That right . . . \u2018flows from the basic \u201cprecept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned\u201d \u2019 to both the offender and the offense.\u201d The Court\u2019s Eighth Amendment jurisprudence \u201cmake[s] clear that the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment applies only to punishments. It does not apply to equally burden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>some regulatory measures that may be characterized as cruel and even unusual.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>423 Mass. 1201, 1238 (1996). It is axiomatic that G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, is a regulatory statute, and that its prohibition on the issuance of a license to carry firearms to an individual who has been adjudicated a delinquent child for the commission of a felony is not a criminal penalty. See <em>Dupont </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Pepperell, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 690, 694 (2003) (\u201cstatute governing who may carry firearms is not punitive\u201d). Therefore, the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment is not applicable to Chardin\u2019s circumstances.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(d) </em>(i), does not infringe on Chardin\u2019s right to keep and bear arms under the Second and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.

Nonetheless, with respect to the firearm offense, the docket indicates that the charge was possession of a firearm without a license. This reading of the docket is consistent with testimony given by Chardin at an evidentiary hearing on March 15, 2011; testimony given at the same hearing by Lieutenant Mark Harrington of the Boston police department, who reviewed Chardin\u2019s application for a license to carry firearms; and the parties\u2019 stipulation of the facts dated March 15, 2012. As discussed <em>infra, </em>in 1995, possession of a firearm without a <em>license </em>was an offense under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a). </em>See St. 1990, c. 511, \u00a7 2. In contrast, G.

At some point, Chardin\u2019s counsel filed in the Juvenile Court a request for clarification of his client\u2019s juvenile record.

The record was corrected on February 25, 2011, to reflect that Chardin\u2019s probation was terminated on April 18, 1996.
