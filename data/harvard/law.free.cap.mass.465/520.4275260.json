There was no dispute that the defendant had stabbed the victim to death, but the defendant contended that he did so in self-defense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Before trial, the judge ruled that, under our common-law rule of evidence established in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adjutant, </em>443 Mass. 649 (2005) <em>{Adjutant), </em>the defendant could offer evidence that the victim participated in a violent assault of a third person twenty-one months before the victim died in support of the defendant\u2019s claim that the victim was the first aggressor in the incident that resulted in the victim\u2019s death. In his opening statement, defense counsel promised to offer this evidence, but later in the trial the judge, sua sponte, reversed her ruling and found that this evidence was not admissible because there was no dispute that the victim was the first aggressor. The judge additionally refused defense counsel\u2019s request to inform the jury that she found the promised evidence of the victim\u2019s prior violent act inadmissible because there was no evidence that the defendant was the first aggressor. The primary issue on appeal is whether the judge erred in excluding this evidence on this ground where the evidence indicated that the victim was plainly the first to provoke a nondeadly altercation but where it was hotly disputed whether the defendant or the victim was the first to grab the knife that escalated the nondeadly conflict into a deadly one.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">We conclude that a judge in her discretion may admit so-called <em>\u201cAdjutant </em>evidence\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> where there is a dispute at trial as to who threatened or struck the first blow <em>or </em>as to who initiated the threat or use of deadly force. The judge here exercised her discretion to admit the proffered <em>Adjutant </em>evidence if the identity of the first aggressor was in dispute, but mistakenly understood that <em>Adjutant </em>evidence was admissible only where there was a dispute as to who threatened or struck the first blow. We conclude that this mistake infected her ruling, and caused evidence to be excluded that in her discretion otherwise would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>admitted. We also conclude that this mistake, when considered with defense counsel\u2019s unfulfilled promise of the <em>Adjutant </em>evidence to the jury, resulted in prejudice that requires the conviction to be vacated and the case to be remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\"><em>Background. </em>In light of the issues on appeal, we focus our summary of the facts on the evidence presented at trial as to the identity of the first aggressor. On February 10, 2008, the defendant was staying in a small apartment in Boston with James Ceurvels and Edward Quiles. All three men were regular drug users; Ceurvels used \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine, while the defendant and Quiles primarily used heroin. Prior to the night in question, Ceurvels had never seen any conflicts or problems arise between the defendant and Quiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Other than the defendant, Ceurvels is the only living percipient witness to the altercation between Quiles and the defendant that led to Quiles\u2019s death. Ceurvels testified that, sometime after 9 p.m. on February 9, the defendant and Quiles showed him a golf ball-sized bag of heroin, which Ceurvels described as the most heroin he had ever seen at one time in one place. Over the course of the night, the defendant and Quiles went into the apartment\u2019s bathroom several times for approximately thirty to forty-five minutes at a time to inject heroin. All three went to sleep at around 4 a.m. on February 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Sometime in the morning, Ceurvels awoke when Quiles yelled about \u201ca gram\u201d that he could not find. He told Quiles to shut up, the apartment got quiet again, and Ceurvels went back to sleep. Ceurvels did not know whether the defendant participated in that conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Sometime in the early afternoon, Ceurvels was again awakened by Quiles, who Ceurvels described as being \u201c[pjretty agitated.\u201d Ceurvels overheard Quiles telling the defendant, \u201cFind my shit. Where\u2019s my shit?\u201d Ceurvels testified that he heard the defendant respond in a \u201c[pjretty mild\u201d tone of voice, \u201cI don\u2019t have your shit. I\u2019ll help you find your shit. Why would I take your shit?\u201d A similar exchange continued over and over for approximately five minutes, along with \u201c[sjtuff moving around, doors opening and closing.\u201d When Ceurvels physically got up out of his bed, he observed Quiles and the defendant looking all over the apartment, and he understood them to be looking for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>large bag of heroin. At this time, he did not observe any physical contact between them. Ceurvels then left the apartment to scrounge outside for partially smoked cigarettes that still had some tobacco in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">After approximately ten minutes, Ceurvels returned to his apartment and saw Quiles and the defendant \u201chaving an all-out brawl, fistfight, wrestling brawl.\u201d He testified that he observed \u201carms swinging, both arms swinging. And it looked like a wrestling match after that . . . and then they fell . . . out of my view and onto my bed.\u201d He testified that he heard his bed and chair getting kicked \u201cfrom the feet hitting the chair,\u201d along with Quiles screaming at the top of his lungs. Before he got far enough into the apartment to regain his view of the combatants, he observed a large amount of blood on the floor that had not been there when he left. When he advanced far enough to see them again, Ceurvels observed the defendant on top of Quiles, with Quiles face down on the bed and with the defendant\u2019s arm over Quiles\u2019s head and back. At this point, Ceurvels heard Quiles say, \u201cYou stabbed me, you bastard. You stabbed me.\u201d After this, Ceurvels turned around immediately and ran out of the apartment. Ceurvels never saw any weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">After leaving the apartment, Ceurvels went downstairs to the building\u2019s concierge and asked him to call the police and an ambulance. Officer Renisha Silva of the Boston police arrived, and as she entered the building, Ceurvels observed that the defendant left the building, passed Officer Silva, and said, \u201cI\u2019m out of here, dude. I\u2019m bouncing.\u201d The concierge told Officer Silva, \u201cThat\u2019s the guy,\u201d and she chased after him. Officer Silva testified that she asked the defendant to show his hands, and the defendant ignored the instruction and kept walking away until Officer Silva pointed her gun at him and told him to stop and get down on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Ceurvels remained by the front door to the apartment building and soon witnessed the arrival of Juan Velasquez, who nodded his head at Ceurvels, but did not enter the apartment building. Ceurvels recognized the person later identified by the police as Velasquez because Quiles had brought Velasquez to Ceurvels\u2019s apartment two weeks earlier. After Velasquez looked at one of the police vehicles that had arrived on the scene, he took off running and was subsequently apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>After Velasquez was detained, Officer Frank Nogueira knocked on the door of the apartment but no one answered. He saw that the door was unlocked but could only open it slightly because something was blocking it from inside the apartment. He forced the door open, knocking over a metal cart inside the apartment. He found the lifeless victim lying face down on the bed, with a three-inch long laceration in his neck. He saw on the floor the metal blade of a steak knife that had broken off its handle, and a detective later found the knife handle on a table nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The forensic pathologist who conducted the autopsy, Dr. Faryl Sandler, found a stab wound on the left side of Quiles\u2019s neck that punctured the left carotid and subclavian arteries, and ended in Quiles\u2019s chest cavity, which caused his death, and an incised wound on the right side of his neck with a length of one and one-eighth inches and a depth of one-eighth inch. The knife collected at the scene was consistent with both wounds on Quiles\u2019s neck. Dr. Sandler testified that a person with his carotid artery cut could remain conscious for a minute to a couple of minutes, then would start to lose consciousness due to the lack of oxygen to the brain, and would ultimately die within a couple of minutes if the artery were not repaired. There was also a small contusion on the left side of Quiles\u2019s forehead, an abrasion on the bridge of his nose, and a small abrasion on his left leg, but there were no wounds on his torso.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The defendant was brought to the police station, where Sergeant William E. Doogan provided him with Miranda warnings and proceeded to interrogate him about the incident. After Sergeant Doogan informed the defendant that he could refuse to have the interview recorded, the defendant said that he wanted the sergeant to stop recording, and the sergeant complied. At trial, Sergeant Doogan testified that, while the recorder was off, the defendant stated that Quiles \u201cwas crazy on drugs and was accusing [the defendant] of having stolen his drugs\u201d before Quiles attacked him. \u201cHe defended himself and turned the knife back in on [Quiles].\u201d While the recorder was off, the defendant also stated that (1) \u201c[Quiles] had the knife. He got it out of the kitchen\u201d; (2) \u201c[Quiles] had called [Velasquez] to come down and shoot [the defendant]\u201d; and (3) Quiles had \u201cassaulted him\u201d by \u201cpunching] him in the head\u201d while he was calling the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>police. Eventually, Sergeant Doogan raised the issue of recording the interview again, the defendant agreed to have the rest of the interview recorded, and the recorder was turned back on.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">During the recorded portion of the interrogation, the defendant said that, in addition to using heroin and cocaine, Quiles had taken seven to ten pills of Klonopin earlier in the evening. He stated that he, Ceurvels, and Quiles were all awake until approximately 6 or 6:30 a.m. on February 10, when the defendant left the apartment to go to a McDonald\u2019s restaurant to bring back breakfast for himself and Quiles before they went to sleep. At some time after the defendant returned, Quiles woke the defendant up by accusing him of taking Quiles\u2019s \u201cgram.\u201d The defendant then grabbed his coat and left the apartment but stayed in the building to let Quiles cool off. Approximately one hour later, the defendant returned to the apartment and went back to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Several hours later, according to the defendant, Quiles ripped off the defendant\u2019s coat, which the defendant had been using as a blanket, and said, \u201cFuck you, I\u2019m gonna kill you, I\u2019m gonna stab you, you took my dope and I know you did, you junkie motherfucker.\u201d Quiles then telephoned Velasquez, and he heard Quiles say \u201csome Spanish stuff\u201d and then, \u201cGet over here, I wanna shoot this motherfucker, I wanna fill him full of holes. He took all my dope and . . . thinks I\u2019m stupid.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The defendant stated that Quiles would not let him go out the door to get away and blocked the doorway, telling the defendant, \u201cYou\u2019re not going nowhere, I\u2019m fucking you up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">While Quiles was on the telephone with Velasquez, the defendant called 911 and, according to the tape recording of that telephone call, reported that he was being threatened by \u201csome kid that\u2019s up in there in the apartment.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>called 911 again and reported that somebody was threatening to kill him. He said that Quiles, whom he stated that he knew only as \u201cRed,\u201d was \u201cflipping out.\u201d According to the defendant, when Quiles realized the defendant was calling the police, Quiles \u201ctried to smack the phone,\u201d punched the defendant in the head, and said, \u201cWhat are you fucking calling the police on me?\u201d The defendant stated that Quiles was \u201cjust hysteric, going crazy,\u201d and that he was \u201cscared to death.\u201d* **<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>6</p>\n<p id=\"A0_\">The defendant offered conflicting statements about how the knife entered the fray. In the beginning of the interrogation, the defendant stated that Quiles \u201cwent in the kitchen and grabbed a knife\u201d and put it in his back pocket. Later, he stated that he actually could not say where the knife came from, \u201ceither the pocket or he already had it in his \u2014 I don\u2019t know, it happened so quick, sir.\u201d Regardless of where the knife came from, the defendant stated that Quiles \u201cstarted swinging\u201d at him, and because Quiles was a \u201cyounger guy,\u201d the defendant was overpowered.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Quiles tossed the defendant on the bed, tried to stab him, and then, according to the defendant: \u201cThat\u2019s when I pushed the thing back at his \u2014 with all my might to push it. . . back at him. His hand with the knife in it. ... All my might to push it back at him.\u201d At another point in the interview, the defendant described the stabbing as follows: \u201cHe throws me and tried to stab me, . . . and I jerked his hand back the other way and I guess it hit his stomach or whatever, something like that, . . . because he fell and ... I said, \u2018oh my God, what the\u2019 \u2014 I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d The defendant stated that he thought Quiles only got stabbed once, that it was in the stomach, and that he thought he only held the knife there \u201ca second or so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The defendant appealed his conviction, and the Appeals Court affirmed the judgment, with one justice dissenting. <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 624 (2012). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Admissibility of evidence under </em>Adjutant. Prior to trial, defense counsel requested that the Commonwealth disclose evidence of specific acts of violence by the alleged victim. In response, the Commonwealth moved in limine to exclude \u201cso-called <em>Adjutant </em>evidence\u201d and requested that the judge conduct a voir dire of the potential witness Ismail Saasaa if the judge were considering allowing the defendant to offer <em>Adjutant </em>evidence of an assault and robbery of Saasaa in which Quiles allegedly participated. The judge conducted a voir dire, where Saasaa stated that he was assaulted and robbed by a group of individuals including Quiles in May, 2006, and the judge ruled that this evidence was admissible. However, on the fourth day of the five-day trial, after the Commonwealth had filed a motion requesting jury instructions regarding the anticipated <em>Adjutant </em>evidence, the judge reconsidered, sua sponte, her earlier ruling and precluded Saasaa from testifying \u201cbecause the identity of the first aggressor [was] not a live issue at trial,\u201d noting that \u201c[t]here is no evidence the defendant was the first aggressor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">We announced in <em>Adjutant, supra </em>at 664, that \u201cwhere the identity of the first aggressor is in dispute and the victim has a history of violence, ... the trial judge has the discretion to admit evidence of specific acts of prior violent conduct that the victim is reasonably alleged to have initiated, to support the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense,\u201d regardless whether the defendant knew of the victim\u2019s prior violent acts. We held that such evidence \u201cmay be admitted as tending to prove that the victim and not the defendant was likely to have been the \u2018first aggressor\u2019 \u201d because it may show \u201cthat the victim acted in conformance with his character for violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654. While in <em>Adjutant </em>we declared this evidence admissible where a defendant claims self-defense only to shed light on the disputed issue of who was the \u201cfirst aggressor,\u201d we did not define the term \u201cfirst aggressor.\u201d It is plain that the judge here understood that the \u201cfirst aggressor\u201d was the person who provoked or initiated the assault, and concluded that the proffered <em>Adjutant </em>evidence was not necessary because all of the evidence pointed to Quiles as the person who provoked or initiated the assault. We recognize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>that the judge could reasonably have reached this understanding of the meaning of \u201cfirst aggressor\u201d from our case law, but we conclude that this definition is too narrow and take this opportunity to clarify the term\u2019s meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">In our common law, a criminal defendant who is found to have been the first aggressor loses the right to claim self-defense unless he \u201cwithdraws in good faith from the conflict and announces his intention to retire.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>375 Mass. 768, 772 (1978). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>464 Mass. 425, 435 (2013) <em>(Harris), </em>and cases cited. In this context, we have defined the first aggressor as \u201ca person who provokes or initiates an assault,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, supra', </em>as \u201cthe person who initiates the fray,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrion, </em>407 Mass. 263, 268 (1990); and as \u201ca defendant who provokes or initiates an attack.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>461 Mass. 100, 110 (2011). In <em>Harris, supra </em>at 433-436 &amp; n.12, we recognized that, even though such language appears in many of our decisions, a jury instruction providing that a \u201cperson who provokes or initiates an assault ordinarily cannot claim the right of self-defense ... is potentially overbroad because it does not define what constitutes provocation of the type that results in the forfeiture of a self-defense claim,\u201d noting specifically that \u201cthe language does not differentiate between verbal and physical provocation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, in our recently revised Model Jury Instructions on Homicide 28-29 &amp; n.68 (2013), we addressed the potential overbreadth of our earlier definitions of \u201cfirst aggressor\u201d and clarified that, in the context of homicide, a defendant may lose the right to claim self-defense only if he \u201cwas the first to use or threaten deadly force.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Where a defendant claims self-defense and there is a dispute of fact whether the defendant or the victim was the first aggressor, <em>Adjutant </em>evidence is admissible to help the jury determine what happened during the altercation. It is important to note that, although <em>Adjutant </em>evidence may assist a jury to determine whether the defendant has lost the right of self-defense, it is not limited to this purpose. In the <em>Adjutant </em>case, as in this case, the jury were not instructed that a first aggressor loses the right to claim self-defense, so we reasonably may infer that the contested evidence was not admitted for the purpose of addressing that issue. Rather, it was admitted for the broader purpose of giving the jury relevant information regarding the victim\u2019s prior acts of violence that may help them to evaluate the conflicting evidence, to arrive at the truth regarding the events that led to the victim\u2019s death, and ultimately to determine whether the prosecution has met its burden of proving that the defendant did not act in self-defense. See <em>Adjutant, supra </em>at 658-659 (\u201cjury should have as complete a picture of the [often fatal] altercation as possible before deciding on the defendant\u2019s guilt\u201d). See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>104 Ill. 2d 194, 200 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">This is the first time that we have addressed whether <em>Adjutant </em>evidence is admissible where it is essentially undisputed that the victim provoked or initiated a nondeadly assault, but where it is disputed whether the defendant or the victim was the first to use or threaten deadly force.* ****<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Where a victim\u2019s prior act or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>acts of violence demonstrate a propensity for violence, we conclude that <em>Adjutant </em>evidence is as relevant to the issue of who initiated the use or threat of deadly force as it is to the issue of who initiated an earlier nondeadly assault, and such evidence may be admitted to assist the jury where <em>either </em>issue is in dispute, because the resolution of both issues may assist the jury in deciding whether the prosecution has met its burden of proving that the defendant did not act in self-defense. Here, the critical question in determining whether the Commonwealth proved that the defendant did not act in self-defense when he killed the victim was who first grabbed the kitchen knife that ultimately was the instrument of death, not who shouted first or who struck the first punch, because the grabbing of the knife was the act that transformed a relatively harmless fight among roommates into a deadly altercation. Therefore, in cases like this one, <em>Adjutant </em>evidence cannot serve its intended purpose if it is admissible only to help the fact finder determine who initially provoked the altercation rather than who unreasonably escalated it by initiating the use or threat of deadly force. While <em>Adjutant </em>evidence is clearly admissible in many cases to help determine who initiated or provoked a nondeadly assault, particularly in cases where no deadly force was ever threatened or used, it is equally admissible in homicide cases where, even if the initiator of the nondeadly assault is known, it is disputed whether the victim or the defendant was the first to use or threaten deadly force.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The judge here, after conducting a voir dire, impliedly determined that the probative value of Saasaa\u2019s proposed testimony in evaluating who was the first aggressor outweighed its potential prejudicial effect when she exercised her discretion to rule it admissible. See <em>Adjutant, supra </em>at 666 (judge retains discretion to determine whether probative value of evidence of prior violence outweighs prejudicial effect). Having made this finding, the judge erred in ruling that this evidence was no longer admissible because the identity of the first aggressor was \u201cnot a live issue at trial.\u201d Where the defendant was charged with man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>slaughter, and where the evidence was unclear as to which party first used or threatened deadly force, <em>Adjutant </em>evidence was still admissible for the purpose of helping the fact finder identify the first aggressor.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">2. <em>Defense attorney\u2019s broken promise. </em>Based on the judge\u2019s pretrial ruling that Saasaa\u2019s testimony would be admissible under <em>Adjutant, </em>defense counsel told the jury during his opening statement that they would hear from a witness about the victim\u2019s prior act \u201cof unprovoked violence.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> After the judge\u2019s sua sponte exclusion of this proffered <em>Adjutant </em>evidence, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>moved for reconsideration, arguing that the \u201cinability to deliver upon a promise to a jury can destroy an attorney\u2019s credibility.\u201d The defendant suggested in that motion that the problem might be avoided if the judge were to provide the following curative instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">\u201cYou recall that in his opening [defense counsel] indicated that he would produce a witness to testify about certain prior conduct of the victim .... That testimony would have been admissible if there was a question in the case of who was the first aggressor. It is a trial lawyer\u2019s job to consider all possibilities and therefore, if the question of who was the first aggressor was a live issue I would have allowed [defense counsel] to produce that witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">\u201cHowever, based upon the evidence actually submitted I have ruled that there is no question that the victim was the first aggressor. There is no evidence that the defendant was the first aggressor, and [you] must accept as fact that the decedent was the first aggressor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">\u201cTherefore, I have ruled as well that the calling of such a witness is unnecessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Instead, the judge provided the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">\u201cNow, you remember at the beginning of the case I read off a list which was very long of witnesses and many, if not at least some of those witnesses, were not called. That happens in every case. As I said in the beginning, we do it out of an abundance of caution to let you know anyone who may be called as a witness. So you are not to speculate on why certain witnesses were called and others were not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">We have not previously had occasion to address whether it is prejudicial error for a judge, after ruling pretrial that certain evidence is admissible, to preclude counsel from introducing such evidence after counsel has already promised the jury that such evidence would be presented. We have, however, previously held that, in some circumstances, an attorney\u2019s \u201cfailure to produce evidence that counsel has predicted in an opening\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>may constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>443 Mass. 409, 425 (2005); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duran, </em>435 Mass. 97, 109 (2001). There is no contention here that defense counsel was ineffective for promising in opening statement to offer evidence that the judge had ruled admissible in a motion in limine. But the possibility that, in other circumstances, an unkept promise in an opening statement may deny a defendant his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel and create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice reflects our recognition that \u201cfailure to present critical evidence that has been announced in an opening statement can have drastic ramifications\u201d for a defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McMahon, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit addressed a similar claim in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez-Maldonado, </em>115 F.3d 9, 15 (1st Cir. 1997). There, \u201c[hjaving obtained the assurance of the court that [an expert witness] would be allowed to testify, defense counsel stated as much to the jury. When the court later changed its mind and ruled that the expert would not be permitted to testify, defendants were unable to produce the promised testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14-15. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">\u201cA defendant\u2019s opening statement prepares the jury to hear his case. If the defense fails to produce promised expert testimony that is critical to the defense strategy, a danger arises that the jury will presume that the expert is unwilling to testify and the defense is flawed. That the defendant should suffer this presumption because he relied on a prior ruling of the trial court that the same court later reversed, rather than because of poor judgment on the part of his own counsel, in no way changes the fact that the presumption formed in the minds of the jury is prejudicial. . . . [W]e find that promising to admit this important evidence and then failing to produce it is prejudicial as a matter of law in the circumstances of this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 15. See <em>Sleeper </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>510 F.3d 32, 41 (1st Cir. 2007), cert, denied, 553 U.S. 1098 (2008), citing <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>858 F.2d 16, 17 (1st Cir. 1988) (\u201cbreached promise to present specific evidence can injure because it invites speculation that the omitted evidence would have harmed an otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>viable defense\u201d). But see <em>Yeboah-Sefah </em>v. <em>Ficco, </em>556 F.3d 53, 78 (1st Cir.), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Yeboah-Sefah </em>v. <em>Russo, </em>558 U.S. 1031 (2009) (fact that promise to jury was made \u201csix days before the end of trial\u201d weighs against finding of prejudice because promise could \u201chardly be considered contemporaneous with the jury\u2019s deliberations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">We conclude that, where the judge failed to explain to the jury why the defendant could not keep the promise he made in opening statement, the defendant was prejudiced by the judge\u2019s ruling that rendered the defendant unable to fulfil his promise to the jury that he would offer evidence of the victim\u2019s prior act \u201cof unprovoked violence.\u201d The judge\u2019s admonition to the jury not to speculate as to why certain persons on the witness list were not called to testify did not adequately cure the prejudice. We recognize that defense counsel\u2019s promise of testimony regarding the victim\u2019s prior act of violence occurred three days before the jury commenced deliberations, but we also recognize that, considering the importance defense counsel placed on this testimony in his opening statement and the fact that the defendant rested without calling a single witness, it is likely that its absence did not go unnoticed by the jury.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">If a judge precludes important evidence that defense counsel, in reliance on the judge\u2019s pretrial ruling, promises the jury he will offer, the judge should offer to cure the resulting prejudice by instructing the jury that counsel\u2019s promise was based on her prior ruling, and that counsel\u2019s apparent failure was the result of the judge\u2019s own legal determination either that the promised evidence was not admissible or that the issue on which the evidence bore relevance had been decided as a matter of law and therefore need not be decided by the jury. If a judge is unwilling to cure the prejudice by explaining to the jury why they should not make any adverse inference from defense counsel\u2019s failure to keep his or her promise in opening statement, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>judge should avoid the prejudice by allowing the evidence to be heard by the jury. Here, the judge precluded the sole witness promised by the defendant from testifying without providing a sufficient explanation to the jury for the witness\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The prejudice arising from this error added to the prejudice the defendant suffered from the judge\u2019s error in ruling that Saasaa\u2019s proffered testimony was inadmissible. Considering the prejudice arising from the two errors together, we cannot say with fair assurance that the errors \u201cdid not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, </em>428 Mass. 161, 163, cert, denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The combination of these errors may not have required a new trial had the evidence against the defendant been overwhelming, but this was a close case. Shortly before the killing, the defendant twice called 911 asking the police to come to Ceurvels\u2019s apartment. In the first call he stated that he was being threatened, and in the second call he stated that Quiles was threatening to kill him. In the second call, the defendant additionally said that Quiles was \u201cflipping out,\u201d and Ceurvels\u2019s testimony corroborated that, even prior to the 911 calls, Quiles was greatly agitated by his inability to locate a large bag of heroin that he had brought to the apartment the previous evening. Nobody other than the defendant and the victim saw how the deadly struggle commenced, who first grabbed the kitchen knife, or how the fatal blow occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Further, although the defendant during his interrogation admitted to being a \u201cbig guy,\u201d he was twenty-three years older than the victim, was receiving Social Security disability payments, and, according to Ceurvels\u2019s testimony, walked with a cane on multiple occasions. Finally, the jury did not find the defendant guilty of the more serious charge of voluntary manslaughter but instead convicted him of involuntary manslaughter. In these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>circumstances, we conclude that the judge\u2019s errors prejudiced the defendant such that a new trial is warranted.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">3. <em>Private opinion evidence of the defendant\u2019s character. </em>In this case, the defendant moved in limine to allow him to submit Ceurvels\u2019s opinion evidence of the defendant\u2019s nonviolent character. In his offer of proof, the defendant proffered that Ceurvels would testify that \u201che always knew [the defendant] to be quiet, nonviolent, \u2018laid back\u2019 and mellow,\u201d and that he had \u201cnever known [the defendant] to get angry or raise his voice.\u201d The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The defendant argues on appeal that, in light of our decision in <em>Adjutant, </em>we should revisit our common-law rule that allows a criminal defendant charged with a violent crime to offer evidence of his general reputation for nonviolence in his community or at his workplace, but not evidence of a witness\u2019s private opinion of the defendant\u2019s nonviolent nature. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>442 Mass. 185, 198-199 (2004) (\u201cdefendant in a criminal case may present evidence of a good reputation with respect to the elements of the crime charged,\u201d but not \u201cevidence in the form of private opinions .... Personal opinions, without more, simply cannot substantiate a defendant\u2019s good character\u201d); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 405(a) &amp; note (2013) (\u201cUnlike Federal law, general reputation cannot be proven by evidence of personal opinions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>or isolated acts\u201d). Because this issue is fully briefed and may arise on remand, we briefly address the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">In <em>Adjutant, supra </em>at 664, we addressed the admissibility of both reputation and private opinion evidence \u201cin the context of establishing who was the first aggressor.\u201d There, we noted that \u201c[w]e do not allow the admission of the private opinions of individual witnesses as character evidence\u201d; and we concluded that because \u201c[j]uries should have the ability to draw their own inferences in assessing the bearing of the victim\u2019s prior violent conduct on the probability that he was the first aggressor,\u201d \u201cwe favor the admission of concrete and relevant evidence of specific acts over more general evidence of the victim\u2019s reputation for violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664-665. Because we declared in <em>Adjutant </em>that private opinion evidence is not admissible \u201cin the context of establishing who was the first aggressor,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 664, we need not revisit our common-law rule in light of <em>Adjutant. </em>Ceurvels\u2019s personal opinion of the defendant\u2019s nonviolent character is not admissible at a new trial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We vacate the defendant\u2019s conviction of involuntary manslaughter and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-6\"><em>Adjutant </em>evidence constitutes evidence of \u201cspecific acts of prior violent conduct that the victim is reasonably alleged to have initiated,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adjutant, </em>443 Mass. 649, 664 (2005) <em>(Adjutant), </em>offered by the defendant \u201cfor the limited purpose of supporting the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim that the victim was the first aggressor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660.

There was also a dispute as to what happened after the victim and the defendant had armed themselves. The defendant testified that, when the persons who had earlier driven her to the victim\u2019s apartment returned and kicked in the door to rescue her, the victim advanced on her with a crowbar and she stabbed him in self-defense.

However, the prosecutor, in both opening statement and closing argument, repeatedly attacked the credibility of the defendant\u2019s entire version of events, which was presented at trial solely through the defendant\u2019s statement. The prosecutor specifically argued in closing argument that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s version of what he heard [the victim] say on the phone to Velasquez is fabricated.\u201d Moreover, the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of the case was wholly inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s statement. The prosecutor told the jury in opening statement that the defendant was on trial \u201cnot because he\u2019s a victim, but because he got fed up with somebody in that apartment. . . , stabbed him in the neck with a steak knife and removed him from this Earth.\u201d The prosecutor repeated this theory in closing argument, stating that the defendant was \u201cnot the victim, nor a victim,\u201d and that \u201che killed a man, he tried to cover his tracks, and he lied, and lied and hed about it.\u201d When we consider the prosecutor\u2019s arguments, as web as the uncertainty as to how the knife entered the fray, we conclude that the identity of the individual who first used or threatened deadly force was in dispute when the judge rendered her ruling and when the case was submitted to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Defense counsel told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-9\">\u201cNow, there\u2019s one fact, and as I told you probably the hardest part of my job is to speak ill of the deceased, and I apologize for that.
