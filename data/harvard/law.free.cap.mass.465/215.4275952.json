L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, was duplicative of his conviction of rape of a child under the age of sixteen years, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23 (statutory rape).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In an unpublished memorandum and order pursuant to its rule 1:28, the Appeals Court concluded that the charges were not duplicative, and affirmed the convictions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Suero, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 1108 (2012). Because we conclude that a judge must determine whether a defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes separate acts that are sufficiently distinct to support convictions of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen and statutory rape, and that here the defendant\u2019s actions underlying the two convictions were not separate and distinct, we vacate the defendant\u2019s conviction of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen and affirm his conviction of rape of a child under sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\"><em>Background facts. </em>We present the essential facts the jury could have found. In 2005, the defendant moved in with his girl friend and her four children, two boys and two girls. The victim, who was nine years old, shared a bed with her sister in one bedroom. The two boys also shared a bedroom down the hall from the girls\u2019 bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">On December 28, 2005, the victim watched television until 8 p.m., her usual bedtime. The defendant had just returned home. The victim, wearing shorts and a tank top, joined her sister, who was already in bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">While she slept, the victim felt someone hit her face and move her over to the edge of the bed. Although the bedroom light was off, the light coming from the kitchen and through the window illuminated her room so that she could see the defendant kneeling next to her side of the bed. When the defendant asked her to move over closer to him, the victim recognized his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>voice. Once she had moved closer to the edge of the bed, the defendant pulled her underwear and shorts to the side. He then put his mouth in her \u201cprivate\u201d and moved it around. She told him to stop, but he did not. After \u201cback[ing] away a little,\u201d the defendant \u201cslip[ped his fingers] closer to [her] private,\u201d \u201copened [it] with his fingers\u201d and started to \u201click [it].\u201d The victim told him to go to his room. He stated, \u201cJust wait,\u201d and left the girls\u2019 room.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The victim got out of bed and was making her way down the hall to her brothers\u2019 room when she saw the defendant in the bathroom. As she passed by, the defendant told her not to tell her family because they would \u201cput [him] in jail\u201d or \u201ckill [him].\u201d He also stated that he had two daughters of his own and that he would \u201cnever do that to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The victim continued down the hall to her brothers\u2019 room, then went with one of her brothers to the living room, where they began watching a movie to \u201cget [her] mom\u2019s attention.\u201d The mother, who was awakened by the defendant\u2019s coming to bed, saw the lights on in the dining room through the bottom of the door and got up to shut them off. When she saw the children in the living room, the victim told her something \u201creally, really serious\u201d had happened. After being told what had occurred, the mother telephoned 911. The victim was taken to a hospital for examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">On February 22, 2006, an Essex County grand jury returned indictments charging the defendant with rape of a child with force, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, and indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. The Commonwealth amended the two indictments to include the specific acts related to the charges. For the indictment alleging a violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, the charges stated, \u201chaving] sexual intercourse and/or unnatural intercourse with . . . a child under sixteen years of age, ... to wit: by means of oral penetration or digital penetration.\u201d For the indictment alleging a violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, the charges stated, \u201ccommit[ting] an indecent assault and battery on ... a child under fourteen years, to wit: by moving the child\u2019s shorts and underwear to the side.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to trial, the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>amended the indictment charging rape of a child with force to statutory rape. See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The defendant moved for required findings of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and the close of all evidence, and for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict after the jury\u2019s verdicts, arguing that his conduct was not separate and distinct because the moving of the clothing was necessary to the rape. Citing to the facts, the Superior Court judge denied the defendant\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The judge instructed the jury: \u201cThe alleged proof of [indictments] 1 and 2 must be based on proof of wholly separate acts. Stated another way, [indictments] 1 and 2 cannot be proven by a single act.\u201d He also instructed that the jurors \u201cmust be unanimous as to which specific act constitutes the offense charged.\u201d After the jury found the defendant guilty of both charges, the judge sentenced the defendant to from four to five years in State prison for the rape conviction, to be followed by ten years\u2019 probation for the indecent assault and battery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>The Commonwealth argues that the defendant\u2019s convictions should be upheld because the evidence supported convictions of both crimes, and the jury, after being properly instructed that the crimes \u201cmust be based on proof of wholly separate acts,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> found the defendant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The defendant asserts, as he did below, that his conviction of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen should be vacated because it is duplicative of his conviction of rape of a child under sixteen and violates his due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. He argues that his actions were \u201cso closely related in fact as to constitute in substance but a single crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Pierre, </em>377 Mass. 650, 662-663 (1979). He also argues that this case is more analogous to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howze, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>58 Mass. App. Ct. 147, 153 (2003) (charge of indecent assault and battery vacated because removal of victim\u2019s clothing was \u201csufficiently bound up with and necessary to\u201d rape), than to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>429 Mass. 502, 509-510 (1999) (convictions of assault and battery by means of dangerous weapon and murder upheld where defendant shot two victims, then made sure victims were dead by shooting each a second time). We conclude that, in these circumstances, the charges of assault and battery on a child under fourteen, and rape of a child under sixteen are duplicative. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 418 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>401 Mass. 109, 120 (1987) (noting distinction between situations where indecent assault and battery and rape constitute one crime and situations where offenses were \u201cseparate and incidental\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u201cUnder our long-standing rule derived from <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass. 433, 434 (1871), a lesser included offense is one whose elements are a subset of the elements of the charged offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porro, </em>458 Mass. 526, 531 (2010). \u201c[W]hether two offenses are \u2018so closely related in fact as to constitute in substance but a single crime,\u2019 . . . becomes pertinent in a single criminal proceeding where one crime is a lesser included offense of the other.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vick, </em>454 Mass. 418, 435 (2009), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Pierre, supra </em>at 662-663. Because the Fifth Amendment guarantees that \u201cno person may be twice placed in jeopardy for the same criminal offense,\u201d <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>461 Mass. 664, 670 (2012), \u201c[cjonvictions of both greater and lesser included acts are permitted only where they \u2018rest on separate and distinct acts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouse, </em>461 Mass. 787, 798 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 528, 529 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">We conclude, and the parties do not contest, that where a child is under the age of fourteen, the crime of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, is a lesser included offense of the crime of rape of a child under sixteen, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howze, supra </em>at 150 (\u201c[I]ndecent assault and battery of a child and statutory rape[] are cognate offenses; specifically, indecent assault and battery is a lesser included offense of statutory rape, at least as G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, is codified since its amendment by St. 1986, c. 187\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The parties disagree whether the defendant\u2019s actions were sufficiently separate and distinct to comprise more than one criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">We conclude that, in the circumstances here, convictions of the greater offense of statutory rape, and the lesser included offense of indecent assault and battery, were not based on separate and distinct acts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 225 (2005), cert, denied, 546 U.S. 1216 (2006), and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howze, supra </em>at 153 (where criminal act of indecent assault and battery necessary to act of rape, \u201cdue process forbids separating the conduct into discrete units for prosecution\u201d). Like the defendant\u2019s actions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howze, supra, </em>here, the moving of the victim\u2019s underwear to the side was \u201cnecessarily accomplished on the commission of the greater crime of rape.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amour, </em>428 Mass. 725, 748 (1999). Additionally, the defendant\u2019s actions occurred \u201cin a single stream of conduct\u201d that was \u201cgoverned by a single criminal design.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howze, supra. </em>Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neils N., </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 689, 697 (2009) (acts supporting assault and battery and rape indictments were \u201cseparate in time, the form of the conduct, and the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>ant\u2019s intent\u201d). To be sure, a defendant\u2019s actions underlying charges of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen and rape can lead to separate convictions and punishments.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, here, the conduct supporting the indecent assault and battery was incidental and necessary to the rape, and the two crimes were duplicative. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porro, </em>458 Mass. 526, 534 (2010) (because \u201celements in threatened battery are generally incidental to an intentional assault and battery,\u201d crimes are duplicative).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The prohibition against duplicative convictions ensures that \u201cthe court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for a single legislatively defined offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>384 Mass. 353, 360 (1981). In other criminal contexts, this court has determined whether the Legislature intended to punish conduct for two or more charges, where the conduct may have constituted one criminal act. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>382 Mass. 387, 394 (1981) (Legislature did not intend \u201cto punish a defendant for the two less serious motor vehicle offenses if [the defendant] is already being punished under the most serious offense of manslaughter\u201d); <em>Kuklis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>361 Mass. 302, 308 (1972) (\u201cit was not the legislative intent that a defendant should be punished for both possession of a drug and being present where the drug was kept, where the two charges involve the same time and place, and the identical mass of a single drug\u201d). We reach the same conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">We next address the issue whether a jury or a judge should decide whether a defendant, who has been charged with indecent assault and battery on a child and statutory rape, has committed actions that are sufficiently separate and distinct as to factually comprise different crimes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Pierre, 377 </em>Mass. 650, 662-663 (1979). The Commonwealth points out that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>a conflict exists in our case law regarding this issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keohane, </em>444 Mass. 563, 575 (2005) (\u201c[T]he judge may determine whether the actions of a defendant are so closely related in fact as to constitute in substance but one crime\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Maldonado, 429 Mass. 502, 509 (1999) (with judge\u2019s instruction, jury decide whether crimes are separate and distinct acts). The Commonwealth asserts that, in the circumstances here, there was no error because the jury, who had been presented with evidence to support both crimes and had been properly instructed, found the defendant guilty of two separate acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Whether the Commonwealth has presented facts to support each charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt is a matter for the jury, and the judge must instruct the jury on separate and distinct acts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Roderiques, 462 Mass. 415, 424-425 (2012); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, supra. </em>In addition, because the guarantee that \u201cno person may be twice placed in jeopardy for the same criminal offense,\u201d <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>461 Mass. 664, 670 (2012), and cases cited, applies to situations such as this one, a judge also must determine whether the convictions violate the defendant\u2019s rights under the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment and Massachusetts statutory and common law. See <em>id. </em>As a matter of first impression, we conclude that on the request of defense counsel for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a judge shall determine whether separate and distinct acts support convictions of both indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen and statutory rape. The standard of review for such a determination is an abuse of discretion or other error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">Our conclusion should not be interpreted to mean we wish to impinge on the Commonwealth\u2019s right to prosecute where a single criminal event may result in charges for a number of crimes. \u201cThe Commonwealth has broad discretion in deciding whether to prosecute a case; judicial review of these decisions must proceed circumspectly lest we intrude on a function constitutionally vouchsafed to another branch of government.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bernardo B., </em>453 Mass. 158, 161 (2009). Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>conclusion also does not suggest that the jury could not, as a matter of fact, find the defendant guilty of one or many crimes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, a judge has the discretion to conclude, as we do here, that convictions of indecent assault and battery of a child under fourteen and statutory rape are duplicative and violate a defendant\u2019s rights to due process. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Vick, 454 Mass. 418, 435 (2009). Here, because the defendant\u2019s actions did not constitute separate and distinct acts, his conduct cannot support the two sentences and convictions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howze, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 147, 153 (2003) (\u201cWhere the practical coincidence of the acts is sufficiently great, even where it is theoretically possible to parse them temporally, spatially, or otherwise, multiple convictions and punishments are not permissible\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>An appropriate remedy in a case such as this, in order \u201cto prevent multiple punishments, is to vacate both the conviction and sentence on the lesser included offense, and to affirm on the more serious offense.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valliere, </em>437 Mass. 366, 371-372 (2002). We therefore vacate the defendant\u2019s conviction of, and sentence for, indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen pursuant to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, affirm the conviction of statutory rape pursuant to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, and remand the case for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The docket incorrectly reflects the defendant\u2019s conviction of rape of a child under sixteen by force, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, and should be modified to show his conviction of statutory rape, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23. \u201cUnder Mass. R. Grim. P. 4 (d), 378 Mass. 849 (1979), a judge has discretion to allow an amendment of an indictment if the amendment is one of form, not substance, and if the amendment will \u2018not result in prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth, </em>v. <em>Roby, </em>462 Mass. 398, 403 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>441 Mass. 783, 787 (2004). Here, the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury regarding G.
