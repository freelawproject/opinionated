On this record, we conclude that the effect of the tie vote was that the initial decision of the hearing officer affirming the department\u2019s termination order became the final decision of the commission, which, in turn, is subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The plaintiffs, Benjamin McGuiness and Richard Mullen, were employees of the department, assigned to the Massachusetts Alcohol and Substance Abuse Center. In 2005, the department terminated the plaintiffs\u2019 employment because of allegations that they used excessive force against an inmate in violation of the internal rules of the department and 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 505 (2009). See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41 (just cause). The termination arose out of an incident in which Mullen was alleged to have punched and to have twisted an inmate\u2019s wrists, and McGuiness was alleged to have walked on the inmate\u2019s legs, after the inmate had been placed in wrist restraints following a fight with a fellow inmate. The plaintiffs appealed the termination order to the commission, where a hearing was held before a single commissioner. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43. Following the recommendation of the single commissioner, the commission voted three-to-two in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered that they be reinstated. The department sought judicial review under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44. A judge in the Superior Court reversed the commission\u2019s decision to reinstate the plaintiffs and remanded the case to the commission with instructions that the single commissioner who conducted the hearing no longer participate in the case. See A.J. Celia, Administrative Law and Practice \u00a7 312 (1986) (Celia). Conformably with G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43, which provides that \u201ca person aggrieved by a decision of an appointing authority . . . shall be given a hearing before a member of the commission or some disinterested person designated by the chairman of the commission,\u201d the plaintiffs then received a de novo hearing before an administrative magistrate of the Division of Administrative Law Appeals (DALA). See generally Celia, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 347, at 645-647 &amp; n.20. The DALA magistrate recommended that the commission affirm the department\u2019s decision to terminate the plaintiffs\u2019 employment. Because the Superior Court order precluded the participation of the single commissioner who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>conducted the plaintiffs\u2019 first hearing, only four of the five members of the commission voted on whether to adopt the DALA magistrate\u2019s findings of fact and recommended decision. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 1010. The vote resulted in a two-to-two tie. Consequently, the commission \u201cdismissed\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. The plaintiffs then sought review of the \u201cdismissal\u201d order in the Superior Court. The Superior Court judge likewise concluded that the tie vote had the effect of dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal and, therefore, upheld the department\u2019s termination order. Significantly, the judge also determined that, \u201c[wjithout a majority vote, the [commission] did not <em>adopt </em>the recommended decision of the DALA [magistrate]\u201d (emphasis supplied). Notwithstanding this view, the judge engaged in an alternative analysis in which she determined that the DALA magistrate\u2019s decision to affirm the plaintiffs\u2019 termination was supported by substantial evidence. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. The plaintiffs sought review of the Superior Court judgment in the Appeals Court, and we transferred their appeal to this court on our own motion to bring clarity to the issue of the effect of a tie vote of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 2, prescribes the powers and duties of the commission. Read together with G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 (\u00bf&gt;), states that the commission may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">\u201c[H]ear and decide appeals by a person aggrieved by any decision, action, or failure to act by the [appointing authority], . . . provided that <em>no decision or action of the [appointing authority] shall be reversed or modified </em>nor shall any action be ordered in the case of a failure of the [appointing authority] to act, <em>except by an affirmative vote of at least three members of the </em>commission\u201d (emphases supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The standard adjudicatory rules of practice and procedure (standard rules), 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1.00 (1998), which apply to adjudications before the commission, also are relevant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In pertinent part, 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(11) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>\u201c(b) <em>Initial Decisions. </em>A Presiding Officer<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> other than the Agency who presided at the reception of evidence shall render a decision as provided in [G. L.] c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (8). The decision of the Presiding Officer shall be called an initial decision. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">\u201c(c) <em>Tentative Decisions. </em>If the Agency elects to render a decision on the record without having presided at the reception of evidence, either by regulation or by statement in the notice scheduling the hearing, the initial decision shall also become a tentative decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">\u201c3. <em>Failure to Issue Final Decision. </em>If the Agency fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>issue a final decision within 180 days of the filing or refiling of the tentative decision, the initial decision shall become the final decision of the Agency, not subject to further Agency review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">\u201c(d) <em>Final Decisions. ... A </em>majority of the members constituting the Agency or the Agency panel authorized by the Agency to decide the case shall make direct Agency decisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Focusing on 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(ll)(d), the plaintiffs contend that a majority vote is required for the commission to adopt the DALA magistrate\u2019s decision affirming their terminations. A tie vote, according to the plaintiffs, rendered the DALA magistrate\u2019s decision a nullity, leaving them without a final decision by the commission regarding their employment status.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Focusing on G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 <em>(b), </em>the department counters that its decision to terminate the plaintiffs\u2019 employment stands because the plaintiffs did not receive the three votes necessary to reverse or modify it. As a point of commonality, the plaintiffs and the department agree with the Superior Court judge that, because there was no majority vote, the commission did not <em>adopt </em>the DALA magistrate\u2019s decision. In yet a third alternative, the commission suggests that 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(ll)(c)(3) \u2014 which provides that the \u201cinitial decision shall become the final decision of the Agency\u201d in the event that the commission fails to issue a final decision \u2014 governs here. \u201cOrdinarily an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rule is entitled to great weight.\u201d <em>Finkelstein </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Optom</em>etry, 370 Mass. 476, 478 (1976). See <em>Udall </em>v. <em>Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16-17 (1965), quoting <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 413-414 (1945). Although we acknowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>the commission\u2019s inability to take affirmative action, we agree with the commission that, on the narrow record here, the findings of fact and decision of the DALA magistrate affirming the department nevertheless became the final decision of the commission on account of the voting deadlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Title 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(ll)(d) states a commonsense principle that, as a general matter, a majority is required for the commission to take affirmative action. General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 2 <em>(b), </em>provides that a specific number of votes is required to \u201creverse[] or modif[y]\u201d the decision of an appointing authority.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In mandating three votes only to \u201creverse[] or modif[y],\u201d this provision implicitly establishes affirmance of the appointing authority\u2019s decision as the default position. That the decision of the appointing authority stands, absent three votes to the contrary, comports with the limited \u201cpurposes of the civil service system \u2014 to guard against political considerations, favoritism, and bias in governmental employment decisions. ... It is not within the authority of the commission ... to substitute its judgment about a valid exercise of discretion based on merit or policy considerations by an appointing authority.\u201d <em>Falmouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 796, 800 (2004), quoting <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 300, 304 (1997). Title 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(ll)(c)(3) fills the evidentiary gap left in the event of default, by transforming the initial decision of the hearing officer into the final decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Here, we have the rare circumstance of a tie vote that inhibited the commission\u2019s ability to act affirmatively in response to the DALA magistrate\u2019s initial decision recommending affirmance of the department\u2019s termination order. 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(ll)(d). In that sense, we agree with the parties that the commission did not adopt the DALA magistrate\u2019s recommenda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>tions by vote. However, we conclude that the voting deadlock in this case constituted a failure to act. 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(ll)(c)(3). Of course, the commission did not fail to act for want of effort; it did not act because it could not, given the voting deadlock. Regardless of the reason, and in accordance with G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 (b), and 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(ll)(c), the commission\u2019s failure to make a final decision resulted in the DALA magistrate\u2019s initial decision affirming the department\u2019s termination order becoming the final decision of the commission by default.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">That the DALA magistrate\u2019s findings of fact and initial decision became the final decision of the commission in this case reflects the expanded role of the hearing officer in modern administrative agency adjudications. See generally A.J. Celia, Administrative Law and Practice \u00a7\u00a7 341,349-353 (1986) (Celia).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">\u201c[A]s the institution of the hearing officer [or] examiner gained acceptance in the administrative process, the potentialities for broader utilization of the hearing officer or examiner came to be recognized. ... In time, the essentially passive function of receiving and organizing evidentiary submissions for the ultimate administrative determination of others charged with authority to make such decisions yielded to the significantly more active and far more important function of contributing to the ultimate administrative determination through the filing of a report summarizing the evidence, making findings of fact and conclusions of law, and recommending dispositive administrative action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-7\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 341, at 631-632. Certainly, the commission cannot (and did not) agree to a \u201ccomplete subdelegation of the entire adjudicatory function\u201d to a hearing officer. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 347, at 648 &amp; n.26. The commission undoubtedly holds the \u201cultimate adjudicatory decisionmaking authority\u201d and generally is \u201cnot bound by the ultimate conclusions of the hearing officer or examiner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 349, 350. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>379 Mass. 205, 209-210 (1979); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Roxbury Dist., </em>322 Mass. 566, 575-576 (1948). See also G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 (6), <em>(c); </em>G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43. That 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(11)(c) transforms a hearing officer\u2019s tentative decision into the final decision of the commission nevertheless reflects a \u201cwillingness to give increased dignity and weight to the decisions of the hearing officer or examiner,\u201d at least in the unusual event of the commission\u2019s failure to act. Celia, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 341, at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">At first blush, our conclusion that the effect of the tie vote was that the DALA magistrate\u2019s decision to <em>affirm </em>the department\u2019s termination order<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> became the final decision of the agency may appear no different from the Superior Court judge\u2019s conclusion that the effect of the tie vote was to <em>dismiss </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. As the Superior Court judge noted, the department\u2019s decision to terminate the plaintiffs\u2019 employment stands either way. The difference concerns what remains for a judge to review in the event of a tie vote. It is without dispute that the plaintiffs have a \u201cstatutory right or entitlement to judicial review\u201d of final decisions of the commission pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44, under the standards set forth in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. Celia, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 1542, at 90; <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 1756, at 318. A consequence of the Superior Court judge\u2019s analysis that a tie vote dismisses the plaintiffs\u2019 appeals without <em>adopting </em>the DALA magistrate\u2019s decision, however, is that the DALA magistrate\u2019s findings of fact had no continuing relevance on appeal. Under this rubric, the reviewing judge had no basis to determine whether there was substantial evidence to support the decision to terminate the plaintiffs\u2019 employment. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. We do not subscribe to this view. Our conclusion, that the DALA magistrate\u2019s initial decision affirming the department\u2019s termination order became the final decision of the commission, preserves the DALA magistrate\u2019s findings of fact for a substantial evidence review on appeal. A hearing officer\u2019s report is an essential component of the record of an administrative adjudicatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>proceeding. See Celia, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 351, at 657-658. \u201cMassachusetts has generally followed the trend in other jurisdictions in making the hearing officer\u2019s or examiner\u2019s report a part of the record for purposes of securing judicial review of [Sjtate administrative agency adjudications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In fact, reviewing judges may not focus on the evidence presented to the appointing authority, but instead must consider the evidentiary record as developed during the de novo proceeding before the hearing officer \u2014 here, the DALA magistrate. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Roxbury Dist., supra </em>at 572; <em>Leominster </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 726, 732 (2003). Anticipating that we would conclude that the DALA magistrate\u2019s findings of fact and decision would be subject to judicial review, the Superior Court judge, in an alternative analysis, determined that the DALA magistrate\u2019s decision satisfied the requirements of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. Likewise, we now consider whether the DALA magistrate\u2019s decision to affirm the department\u2019s termination order was supported by substantial evidence. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14; G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44; Celia, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 246, at 510 n.l, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">3. <em>Substantial evidence. </em>Pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44, \u201c[w]e shall uphold an agency\u2019s decision unless it is based on an error of law, unsupported by substantial evidence, unwarranted by facts found on the record as submitted, arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecomm. &amp; Energy, </em>440 Mass. 625, 631 (2004), quoting <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>425 Mass. 856, 867-868 (1997). As a general rule, we \u201cmust accept the factual determinations made by the agency if [we] find[] they are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>School Comm, of Boston </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>363 Mass. 125, 128 (1973). See <em>Leominster </em>v. <em>Stratton, supra </em>at 728, and cases cited. A reviewing judge may, however, take into account the fact that a hearing officer\u2019s initial decision became the final decision of the agency by default as opposed to by majority vote when conducting a substantial evidence analysis. See Celia, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 352, at 661-663 (reviewing court may afford reduced weight to hearing officer\u2019s report where agency rejected it in whole or in part). Irrespective of the commission\u2019s voting record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>we \u201cseek[] to uphold the findings of fact made by a hearing officer or examiner based upon the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses whose oral testimony he has personally observed and evaluated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660. See <em>Amherst-Pelham Regional Sch. Comm. </em>v. <em>Department of Educ., </em>376 Mass. 480, 498 (1978); <em>Leominster </em>v. <em>Stratton, supra </em>at 729. Even \u201cthe [commission] may not reject a [hearing officer\u2019s] tentative determinations of credibility of witnesses personally appearing.\u201d 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(ll)(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 principal contention is that the DALA magistrate erred in crediting the testimony of Sergeant Scott Nedley, an employee of the department who became involved in the altercation between the plaintiffs and the inmate on hearing the inmate\u2019s cries for help. Nedley testified that he heard several thuds that sounded like punches, and then heard Mullen say to the inmate that \u201cit hurts to get hit in the kidney.\u201d Nedley also testified that he saw McGuiness walk back and forth on the inmate\u2019s legs, and later saw Mullen put the inmate in a pressure hold and twist the inmate\u2019s restrained wrists. The plaintiffs argue that Nedley\u2019s testimony that Mullen punched the inmate was not credible because Nedley did not see, but only heard, Mullen punch the inmate. They also submit that Nedley would not have waited several days to report the incident if stepping on the inmate\u2019s legs truly amounted to excessive force, and that Mullen effectively refuted the allegation that he twisted the inmate\u2019s wrists with excessive force when he testified that he used no more force than was necessary. Moreover, the plaintiffs claim that Nedley\u2019s testimony regarding several details that were not included in the department\u2019s incident report demonstrated his lack of credibility as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The DALA magistrate found Nedley\u2019s testimony to be persuasive and credible. She made this determination after reviewing all the evidence in the case and observing Nedley\u2019s demeanor firsthand. See <em>Amherst-Pelham Regional Sch. Comm. </em>v. <em>Department of Educ., supra; Leominster </em>v. <em>Stratton, supra. </em>Her conclusion was justified. First, information obtained through the use of one\u2019s ears as opposed to one\u2019s eyes is not inherently unreliable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>417 Mass. 341, 347 (1994). Second, the DALA magistrate considered Nedley\u2019s delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>of several days in reporting the incident and found it reasonable, given his emotional distress following the incident and the fact that McGuiness was Nedley\u2019s superior. Third, Sergeant Stephen Kennedy, who was responsible for the department\u2019s investigation and whose testimony the DALA magistrate credited, testified that the plaintiffs gave inconsistent and contradictory accounts of their interaction with the inmate over the course of the department\u2019s investigation, which cast doubt on the plaintiffs\u2019 credibility as witnesses. What is more, the DALA magistrate determined that Nedley had no discernible reason to fabricate his testimony. In fact, reporting the incident was effectively discouraged, as evidenced by Nedley\u2019s thirty-day suspension for failing to prevent the abuse. Moreover, there was substantial evidence corroborating Nedley\u2019s account of the plaintiffs\u2019 use of excessive force against the inmate. Other inmates testified that they heard screams of pain during the altercation involving the plaintiffs, and Kennedy, a close friend of Mullen, testified to his conclusion following an extensive investigation that the plaintiffs violated the department\u2019s policy prohibiting the excessive use of force against inmates. Even McGuiness testified that the altercation caused the inmate to yell, \u201cYou\u2019re killing me. You\u2019re hurting me. Get off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In sum, even accepting that the commission did not adopt the DALA magistrate\u2019s findings of fact by majority vote, we nevertheless conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the DALA magistrate\u2019s findings of fact and decision affirming the department\u2019s termination order.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. The plaintiffs were not the victims of \u201cpolitical considerations, favoritism, [or] bias.\u201d <em>Falmouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 796, 800 (2004), quoting <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 300, 304 (1997). The department had \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate their employment. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>Where a hearing officer recommends affirmance of the decision of an appointing authority and the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>proceedings result in a tie vote, the initial decision of the hearing officer becomes the final decision of the commission. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 <em>(b), </em>(c); 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(ll)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Such a decision is then subject to judicial review. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14; G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44. In accordance with the Superior Court judge\u2019s alternative analysis, we conclude that the department\u2019s decision to terminate the plaintiffs\u2019 employment was fully supported and warranted by the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b680-7\">General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 2 (c), provides that \u201cadministrator shall be taken to mean the local appointing authority\u201d in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 <em>(b). </em>See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b680-8\">In the early stages of this case, it was unclear whether the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>adheres to the standard adjudicatory rules of practice and procedure (standard rules). 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1.00 (1998). There was ambiguity on this point of fact because the standard rules were promulgated pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, and the commission is expressly exempt from its provisions. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1. See AJ. Celia, Administrative Law and Practice \u00a7 13, at 46 (1986) (Celia). Therefore, the commission is not required to adhere to the standard rules. See <em>Falmouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>447 Mass. 814, 817 n.4 (2006). It may, however, adopt the standard rules voluntarily. <em>Id. </em>Initially, the commission submitted a memorandum stating that it does not adhere to the standard rules. Following the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion at oral argument that the commission\u2019s Web site provides just the opposite, the commission filed a letter pursuant to Mass. R. A. P. 16 (1), as amended, 386 Mass. 1247 (1982), acknowledging that it does, in fact, adhere to the standard rules. We now regard the applicability of the standard rules as a stipulated fact. To avoid similar confusion in the future, the commission should publish the fact of its compliance with the standard rules in the Code of Massachusetts Regulations. See <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 336, 341 n.5 (2001), <em>S.C., </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 1118 (2007). Such publication will allow subsequent courts to take judicial notice of the commission\u2019s choice to adhere to the standard rules. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 202 (2013). Moreover, we note that \u201ca [Sjtate administrative agency having promulgated a rule or regulation ... is bound to respect and enforce the rule as long as it remains extant.\u201d Celia, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 725, at 100-101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Title 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(2)(c) defines the \u201c[pjresiding [ojfficer\u201d as \u201c[t]he individual(s) authorized by law or designated by the [ajgency to conduct an [ajdjudicatory [proceeding.\u201d The presiding or hearing officer in this case was an administrative magistrate of the Division of Administrative Law Appeals (DALA). Because G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43, permits \u201ca hearing before a member of the commission or some disinterested person designated by the chairman of the commission,\u201d the fact that the hearing officer was a DALA magistrate as opposed to a member of the commission makes no difference to our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The plaintiffs also submit that the commission failed to make appropriate response to their objections to the DALA magistrate\u2019s initial decision as required by 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(ll)(d). In its decision, the commission acknowledged the plaintiffs\u2019 comments and gave them \u201ccareful review and consideration.\u201d In light of the circumstances of voting deadlock, we conclude that this constituted an \u201cappropriate response\u201d in satisfaction of 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(ll)(d). Moreover, the plaintiffs had an adequate opportunity to voice their objections to the DALA magistrate\u2019s decision in the Superior Court and before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Legislative statutes trump administrative agency regulations in the event that the two are in conflict. See <em>Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Council, </em>411 Mass. 183, 194 (1991). Therefore, a hearing officer\u2019s initial decision recommending modification or reversal of an appointing authority\u2019s decision that does not gamer the votes of three members of the commission cannot automatically become the final decision of the commission. G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 <em>(b). </em>Because that is not the circumstance of this case, we do not consider it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b684-8\">An initial decision becomes the final decision of the commission when the commission communicates its inability to act on account of a voting deadlock. Thereafter, an aggrieved party may seek judicial review under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44; it need not wait 180 days from the issuance of the initial decision. See 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(ll)(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Although admittedly an imperfect analogy, a tie vote on an appellate court generally affirms a lower court judgment. See, e.g., <em>Borden Ranch Partnership </em>v. <em>United States Army Corps ofEng\u2019rs, </em>537 U.S. 99 (2002) (per curiam); <em>Serino </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>397 Mass. 1051 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The DALA magistrate also concluded that the plaintiffs violated 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 505 (2009) in that they neither monitored the inmate while he was in restraints, sought approval to restrain the inmate for longer than two hours, nor arranged for medical examination of the inmate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
