Evans (Marie) died in 2002, at the age of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>fifty-four, from small cell lung cancer caused by smoking cigarettes. A jury found that the defendant, Lorillard Tobacco Company (Lorillard), the designer and manufacturer of Newport brand cigarettes, caused her wrongful death based on various theories of liability: breach of the implied warranty of merchantability because of design defect and inadequate warning of Newport cigarettes\u2019 health hazards and addictive properties; negligence in the design, marketing, or distribution of Newport cigarettes; negligent distribution by giving free samples of Newport cigarettes to minors; and negligent performance of a duty Lorillard voluntarily undertook in 1954 to research the health hazards of smoking and disclose accurate information regarding the results of that research to the smoking public. As to the negligence claims, the jury found Marie also to be negligent, and apportioned thirty per cent of the comparative negligence to her. The jury awarded $21 million to her son, Willie Evans (plaintiff), for the loss of his mother\u2019s companionship, comfort, and counsel; and $50 million to Marie\u2019s estate for her conscious pain and suffering.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury also found that Lorillard was grossly negligent and acted in a manner that was malicious, wilful, wanton, or reckless, and awarded punitive damages in the amount of $81 million. The judge found that Lorillard had violated G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, but did not award any additional compensatory or punitive damages for its violation, finding that any further award of damages would be \u201cduplicative\u201d of the jury\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Following trial, Lorillard moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a new trial, remittitur, and amendment of the G. L. c. 93A decision. The judge denied the posttrial motions except for the motion for remittitur, which she allowed in part, reducing the amount of compensatory damages to the plaintiff to $10 million, and to Marie\u2019s estate to $25 million, but denying any remittitur as to punitive damages. The plaintiff accepted the remittitur, Lorillard appealed from the judgment, and we granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">We affirm the judgment only in part. We conclude that the jury were adequately instructed regarding the claim of wrongful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>death based on the breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, that the evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict finding such a breach, that this breach alone supports the jury\u2019s finding of wrongful death, and that the errors at trial did not deny Lorillard a fair trial as to this claim. But we conclude that the jury were not adequately instructed regarding the claim of wrongful death based on the theories of negligent design and marketing, and that the jury\u2019s findings on these theories must be vacated. Because the verdict form asked the jury to determine whether Marie\u2019s wrongful death was caused by Lorillard\u2019s negligence, and did not request separate findings of causation based on each theory of negligence, we must also vacate the jury\u2019s finding that Marie\u2019s wrongful death was caused by Lorillard\u2019s negligence because the jury may have found that Marie\u2019s death was caused by negligent design or marketing, rather than negligent failure to warn or the negligent distribution of cigarettes to minors. We also conclude that, even if Lorillard did not honor its public commitment in 1954 to \u201caccept an interest in people\u2019s health as a basic responsibility, paramount to every other consideration in our business,\u201d Lorillard did not, by making this statement, voluntarily undertake a legal duty whose negligent breach provides a separate ground to find wrongful death. Because the jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages, as reduced by the remittitur, adequately rests on the finding of breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, we affirm that award. However, we vacate the award of punitive damages because it may have been tainted by the errors regarding the theories of negligent design and marketing and the breach of a voluntarily undertaken duty, and we remand the case for a new trial on the issue of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">We also vacate the judgment arising from the judge\u2019s finding that Lorillard committed unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of trade or commerce, in violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (\u00a7 2). We conclude that the judge erred in finding that Lorillard voluntarily undertook a legal duty through its public commitment in 1954, and that the judge improperly applied the doctrine of offensive collateral estoppel against Lorillard by adopting over thirty-eight findings from a Federal racketeering case against Lorillard and other cigarette manufacturers. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>addition, because the judge found that Lorillard \u201cwas negligent in the design, marketing, <em>and/or </em>distribution of Newport cigarettes\u201d (emphasis added), the judge\u2019s finding of negligence was potentially based exclusively on a theory of either negligent marketing or distribution, and not on a theory of negligent design. However, any negligence in Lorillard\u2019s marketing or distribution of its cigarettes to minors could not have caused injury to Marie after 1979, because she was an adult by 1979. Because these various errors, when considered cumulatively, may have affected the judge\u2019s ultimate determination that Lorillard caused injury to Marie after 1979 through its violation of \u00a7 2, we conclude that the prudent course is to vacate the judgment on the plaintiff\u2019s claim under c. 93A and remand the case to the judge. On remand, the judge shall determine whether, based solely on the relevant evidence presented at trial, Lorillard violated \u00a7 2, and, if liability is found under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, what actual damages should appropriately be awarded to Marie\u2019s estate for injury suffered by her that was caused by the \u00a7 2 violation. If the judge finds a violation of \u00a7 2, the judge shall also determine whether the violation was wilful or knowing and, if so, whether actual damages should be doubled or trebled in accordance with G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\"><em>Background. </em>Because Lorillard contends that the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict, we summarize the evidence at trial in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. We reserve our recitation of some of the evidence for our analysis of Lorillard\u2019s specific claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">1. <em>Marie\u2019s smoking history. </em>In 1960, when Marie was thirteen years old, she began smoking Newport cigarettes. She started smoking cigarettes because she saw other people smoking \u201cand they looked attractive doing it,\u201d and because \u201c[i]t made you grown up, made you feel like an adult.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She testified that, when she was a child, \u201cthere would be campaigns going on for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Newport\u201d; they had \u201cfree giveaways\u201d of cigarettes after school in a playground in the Orchard Park neighborhood of the Roxbury section of Boston, where she grew up. \u201cSo I would stand out there and get free cigarettes. That\u2019s how I started smoking.\u201d The \u201cfree giveaways\u201d occurred \u201cquite a bit; maybe about fifty times.\u201d She smoked Newport cigarettes because she \u201chad free access to them,\u201d \u201c[t]hey were pretty packaged,\u201d and \u201c[t]hey were always available.\u201d Marie testified that, at least in the early years of her smoking, she felt that she received certain benefits from cigarette smoking: she enjoyed the taste and aroma of the cigarette, smoking helped her relieve stress and anxiety, smoking helped keep her alert, smoking helped her keep her weight under control, and smoking helped her fit in socially with her friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">When she was a child and teenager, she heard people refer to cigarette smoking as an addiction. She remembered the 1964 United States Surgeon General\u2019s report describing cigarette smoking as habit forming and as a cause of lung cancer. However, she testified that she was not convinced by these statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">\u201c[I]t was, you know, one of those two sides to every story. It was like, one day it would come out saying it was bad for you. The next day it was good for you. And it was kind of always a debate going on whether or not it caused cancer or didn\u2019t, or if it was something else. And so it became something that you really didn\u2019t rely on anyone\u2019s opinion as to being the true cause of what causes cancer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">As an adult, Marie smoked an average of thirty Newport cigarettes each day \u2014 one and one-half packs of cigarettes. She was so addicted to cigarettes that she would smoke within five minutes of waking up each morning. At least ninety per cent of the cigarettes she smoked in her life were Newports. She once tried Merit, another brand of cigarette, because it was supposed to be less harmful, but she did not like the taste.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">In 1970, when Marie\u2019s father died from lung cancer, she drew a connection between her father\u2019s lung cancer and his having been a \u201clifelong smoker,\u201d but she \u201cgave no thought\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>to the cause of his lung cancer. She became convinced that smoking was bad for her health in 1985 when she had a heart attack. During the remainder of her life, she tried to quit smoking more than fifty times, but she never succeeded. In her own words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">\u201cI tried everything. Nothing worked. I tried to quit smoking certainly immediately. I was unable to. By then, it was too late; I was addicted to it. I went to several places, spent thousands of dollars trying to find a cure, tried to help myself, psychiatrists, hypnosis, I went to patches, went to \u2014 like I said, everything.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">In 1997, Marie quit smoking for four to five months. When she returned to smoking, she told her doctor she did so \u201cdue to social influences.\u201d In December, 2001, a medical oncologist informed her that she likely had metastatic small cell lung cancer. Within seven months of that diagnosis, she was dead. The parties stipulated that smoking caused the lung cancer that led to her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">2. <em>Health risks of smoking Newport cigarettes. </em>The plaintiff offered the testimony of three experts (Dr. Kenneth M. Cummings, Dr. William A. Farone,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Dr. Neal L. Benowitz) regarding the health risks that arise from smoking Newport cigarettes and the feasibility of an alternative cigarette design that would have reduced these risks. According to these experts, the particulate matter or \u201ctar\u201d in the smoke creates the \u201cflavor\u201d of the smoke and contains the carcinogenic chemicals that cause lung cancer. Nicotine is the substance in cigarette smoke that creates a pharmacological effect and causes addiction. Menthol, when added to cigarettes, affects the flavor of the smoke, masks the irritancy some smokers feel, and makes it easier for some people to start smoking. We will address the plaintiff\u2019s evidence regarding the effects of tar, nicotine, and menthol in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">a. <em>Tar. </em>The particulates that result from burning tobacco are collectively known as \u201ctar.\u201d \u201cThe tar is the taste in a cigarette,\u201d so a smoker would \u201chave a better taste experience from the product\u201d if the cigarette were designed to allow more of the tar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>through the filter. However, the tar is the element in cigarettes with the carcinogenic chemicals that, with repeated exposure, cause cancer. If a cigarette manufacturer designed the cigarette to reduce the amount of tar the consumer inhales when smoking a cigarette, the manufacturer would reduce the risk of the consumer developing cancer, unless the consumer were to compensate by inhaling harder on the cigarette or smoking more cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">b. <em>Nicotine. </em>Nicotine is a chemical that exists naturally in tobacco plants. When a cigarette is smoked, the nicotine in the tobacco is carried on the tar into the lungs. From there, the nicotine gets absorbed into the bloodstream and arrives at the brain within about seven to ten seconds. In the brain or in the lungs, nicotine binds to certain \u201cnicotinic receptors,\u201d which triggers the release of various hormones. The most critical hormone that is released by the binding of nicotine to its receptors is dopamine, a chemical that \u201chas the attribute of making you feel good.\u201d By triggering the release of dopamine, nicotine can partially satisfy the craving for food, which is why those who smoke have an easier time keeping their weight down. Nicotine also stimulates the release of norepinephrine, creating a stimulant effect that helps a smoker wake up and feel more alert. Nicotine can also enhance the release of acetylcholine, which can assist with arousal and cognitive function; stimulate the release of serotonin, which can modulate mood and potentially help with depressed feelings; and stimulate the release of endorphins and gamma amino butyric acid, which reduce anxiety and tension.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Nicotine is as or more addictive than any other drug of abuse, including heroin and cocaine. Even Lorillard\u2019s expert, Dr. Kathleen Brady, an addiction psychiatrist, agreed with the description of nicotine dependence as a \u201csevere illness.\u201d In an article Brady coauthored, nicotine is described as \u201camong the most addictive substances known,\u201d and the article asserted that \u201cthere\u2019s a greater likelihood that a person who starts smoking will become dependent than a person who starts using heroin,\u201d cocaine, or alcohol. As a smoker continues to expose herself to nicotine, the smoker\u2019s brain will develop new receptors to get the effect of the drug. This effect, known as \u201cdrug tolerance,\u201d results in the smoker needing more nicotine to get the same effect from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>smoking. Furthermore, repeated smoking of cigarettes with addictive levels of nicotine results in a physiological change known as neuroplasticity, \u201cwhich basically means that new brain circuits or connections are made with administration of nicotine,\u201d and these changes appear to last for months or years. The result of these physiological changes arising from the use of nicotine is that the addicted smoker begins to feel withdrawal symptoms when she does not have the nicotine level to which she is accustomed in her body. As Dr. Cummings testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">\u201cWithin about [twenty] minutes, for the typical smoker, the nicotine levels are beginning to plummet. And a lot of addicted smokers will find themselves . . . within [thirty] minutes, [forty] minutes [with] a little antsy feeling in the pit of their stomach. They are then looking to have a cigarette. . . . [P]eople begin to go into withdrawal, literally, within hours after they quit smoking and find it hard to stay off. . . . You take a drag on a cigarette, that goes away.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">While the strength of an individual\u2019s nicotine addiction will vary with the average number of cigarettes smoked each day, a young person smoking just one cigarette per day and an adult smoking five cigarettes per day will suffer from addiction. The addiction strengthens over time, and the earlier a person starts smoking, the harder it is to quit. Most smokers start early in life. The average age at which individuals begin to smoke is fourteen and one-half years, two-thirds start by the age of eighteen, and few start after the age of twenty-five.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The addictive power of nicotine is reflected in the testimony of Dr. Cummings that there are approximately 48 million smokers in the United States, of whom approximately seventy per cent want to quit, but only approximately 17 million actually try each year to quit. Of those who try to quit, only three per cent succeed in not smoking for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>c. <em>Menthol. </em>Menthol is a chemical derived from mint. Adding menthol to cigarettes makes the smoke less likely to cause a harsh sensation and trigger a gag reflex by anesthetizing the sensory organs in the throat. By making cigarette smoke milder and easier to inhale, menthol makes it easier for some young people to start to smoke. The addition of menthol also affects the flavor of the smoke; approximately thirty per cent of smokers in the United States prefer mentholated cigarettes. Apart from making it easier for some people to start smoking, menthol does not materially affect the delivery of tar or nicotine in the cigarette and is not itself either carcinogenic or addictive.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Implied warranty of merchantability. </em>Under the wrongful death statute, G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, Lorillard is liable if its negligence or wilful, wanton, or reckless act caused Marie\u2019s death, or if it \u201cis responsible for a breach of warranty arising under Article 2 of [G. L. c. 106]\u201d that caused her death. Under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314 (2) (c), of the Uniform Commercial Code, apart from exceptions not applicable here, a warranty that goods, such as cigarettes, are merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale, and goods are merchantable if they are \u201cfit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.\u201d \u201cA seller breaches its warranty obligation when a product that is \u2018defective and unreasonably dangerous\u2019 ... for the \u2018[ordinary purposes\u2019 for which it is \u2018fit\u2019 causes injury.\u201d <em>Haglund </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Inc., </em>446 Mass. 741, 746 (2006) <em>{Haglund), </em>quoting <em>Colter </em>v. <em>Barber-Greene Co., </em>403 Mass. 50, 62 (1988) <em>{Colter). </em>A product may be defective and unreasonably dangerous because of a manufacturing defect, a design defect, or a warning defect, that is, a failure reasonably to warn of the product\u2019s foreseeable risks of harm. See Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 2, at 14 (1998) (Third Restatement) (\u201cproduct is defective when, at the time of sale or distribution, it contains a manufacturing defect, is defective in design, or is defective because of inadequate instructions or warnings\u201d). Here, the plaintiff alleged, and the jury found, a design defect and a warning defect, with the warning defect limited to the period before 1970. While these defects are separate and distinct and may each be found to have caused Marie\u2019s death, the special verdict form asked the jury whether \u201cany breach of warranty\u201d caused Marie\u2019s death, and did not ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the jury to make separate findings of causation as to the design defect and the warning defect. Because we cannot know whether the jury found that one or both defects caused her death, the breach of implied warranty claim may survive only if the jury were properly instructed as to both theories and the evidence as to both theories is sufficient to support the verdict.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">On appeal, Lorillard claims various errors regarding these two theories of liability. First, Lorillard claims that the judge erred by instructing the jury that, in determining whether the product\u2019s design was reasonably safe, they <em>\u201cmay </em>also consider\u201d whether Newport cigarettes met consumers\u2019 reasonable expectations as to safety, rather than that they <em>\u201cmust\u201d </em>consider consumers\u2019 reasonable expectations. Lorillard contends that the plaintiff was required to prove that Newport cigarettes were more dangerous than consumers reasonably expected, and that the plaintiff offered no evidence to meet this required element of proof. Second, it argues that the plaintiff failed to prove a safer alternative design that would be an acceptable substitute to ordinary smokers, and that therefore the jury could not have found Newport cigarettes to be defective based on their levels of tar and nicotine without finding that <em>all </em>cigarettes are defective, thereby imposing categorical product liability on cigarettes. Third, it claims that the evidence is insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of a failure to warn, because the health risks from cigarettes were obvious to all before 1970 and there is no duty to warn of an obvious risk. We address each of Lorillard\u2019s claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">a. <em>Reasonable consumer expectations of product safety. </em>By arguing that the judge erred in instructing the jury that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>\u201cmay\u201d consider whether Newport cigarettes met consumers\u2019 reasonable expectations as to safety, rather than that they \u201cmust\u201d do so, Lorillard is effectively asking us to adopt the reasonable consumer expectations standard for design defect in comment i to \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, adopted in 1965 (Second Restatement), rather than the risk-utility balancing standard in \u00a7 2 of the Third Restatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Under \u00a7 402A of the Second Restatement, a seller is liable for physical harm caused to the ultimate user if it \u201csells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property.\u201d Second Restatement, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 402A, at 347. Comment i to \u00a7 402A recognizes that \u201c[m]any products cannot possibly be made safe for all consumption,\u201d and defines an \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d product as one that is \u201cdangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.\u201d Second Restatement, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 402A comment i, at 352. Comment i directly addresses when tobacco would be unreasonably dangerous: \u201cGood tobacco is not unreasonably dangerous merely because the effects of smoking may be harmful; but tobacco containing something like marijuana may be unreasonably dangerous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Under \u00a7 2 of the Third Restatement, \u201c[a] product ... is defective in design when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a reasonable alternative design . . . and the omission of the alternative design renders the product not reasonably safe.\u201d Third Restatement, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2(b), at 14. Under what the Third Restatement describes as its reasonableness or risk-utility balancing test, a plaintiff must prove that a reasonable alternative design \u201cwas, or reasonably could have been, available at time of sale or distribution,\u201d that would have reduced the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product at reasonable cost, and that the failure to adopt the safer alternative was unreasonable. See Third Restatement, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2 comment d, at 19. See also Third Restatement, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2 comment f, at 24. In determining whether a reasonable alternative design was practicable, a trier of fact may consider whether the alternative design is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>actual use and whether it is common practice in the industry, but if expert testimony establishes that \u201ca reasonable alternative design could practically have been adopted, a trier of fact may conclude that the product was defective notwithstanding that such a design was not adopted by any manufacturer, or even considered for commercial use, at the time of sale.\u201d Third Restatement, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2 comment d, at 20.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">\u201cA broad range of factors may be considered in determining whether an alternative design is reasonable and whether its omission renders a product not reasonably safe. The factors include, among others, the magnitude and probability of the foreseeable risks of harm[;] the instructions and warnings accompanying the product[;] the nature and strength of consumer expectations regarding the product, including expectations arising from product portrayal and marketing^] [t]he relative advantages and disadvantages of the product as designed and as it alternatively could have been designed[;] the likely effects of the alternative design on production costs; the effects of the alternative design on product longevity, maintenance, repair, and esthetics; and the range of consumer choice among products . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Third Restatement, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2 comment f, at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">While consumer expectations may be considered in the risk-utility balancing, the Third Restatement makes it clear that, in sharp contrast with the Second Restatement, \u201cconsumer expectations do not play a determinative role in determining defectiveness.\u201d Third Restatement, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2 comment g, at 27. \u201cThe mere fact that a risk presented by a product design is open and obvious, or generally known, and that the product thus satisfies expectations, does not prevent a finding that the design is defective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28. Thus, the Third Restatement recognizes the possibility that a product may be made significantly safer through a reasonable alternative design even when consumers, unaware of the alternative design, expect the product to be no safer than it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The vast majority of States have adopted the risk-utility balancing test of the Third Restatement rather than the consumer expectations test of the Second Restatement. See <em>Branham </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>Ford Motor Co., </em>390 S.C. 203, 220-222 &amp; nn.11-14 (2010), and cases cited (\u201cBy our count 35 of the 46 states that recognize strict products liability utilize some form of risk-utility analysis in their approach to determine whether a product is defectively designed\u201d); 1 D.G.

See <em>Back </em>v. <em>Wickes Corp., </em>375 Mass. 633, 642 (1978) <em>(Back) </em>(\u201cfitness\u201d of product \u201cand all others of the same design is a question of degree, depending largely, although not exclusively, on reasonable consumer expectations\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See also <em>Haglund, supra </em>at 748. Cf. <em>Colter, supra </em>at 57 (\u201cmanufacturer is in the best position to recognize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>and eliminate the design defects\u201d). Since 1978, we have also recognized that the determination whether a product is unreasonably dangerous depends on many factors, including \u201cthe gravity of the danger posed by the challenged design, the likelihood that such danger would occur, the mechanical feasibility of a safer alternative design, the financial cost of an improved design, and the adverse consequences to the product and to the consumer that would result from an alternative design.\u201d <em>Haglund, supra, </em>quoting <em>Back, supra. </em>And since 1978 we have recognized that a product may be found unreasonably dangerous even where all the products in the industry were designed with the alleged defect and where the product conformed to all safety standards in the industry. <em>Back, supra </em>at 643. In short, in determining whether a product\u2019s design is unreasonably dangerous, we have been applying a risk-utility balancing, standard, where consumer expectations are a factor but not necessarily the determinative factor, since well before the Third Restatement articulated this liability standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The defendant argues that we explicitly adopted the Second Restatement\u2019s consumer expectations test as the determinative standard of whether a product is unreasonably dangerous in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson Insulation, </em>425 Mass. 650, 660-661 (1997) <em>(Johnson Insulation). </em>There, quoting comment i to \u00a7 402A of the Second Restatement, we declared, \u201cAn article is not unreasonably dangerous merely because some risk of harm is associated with its use, but only where it is dangerous \u2018to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.\u2019 \u201d However, this assertion is dictum in the <em>Johnson Insulation </em>case, because the basis for finding the product unreasonably dangerous in that case was a warning defect, not a design defect. <em>Id. </em>at 661 (\u201cboth the Commonwealth and Johnson focused on the \u2018failure to warn\u2019 basis for finding a product unreasonably dangerous, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>therefore address only that issue\u201d). In addition, immediately after the assertion relied on by the defendant, we noted in the <em>Johnson Insulation </em>case that the fitness of a product is judged by its \u201csocial acceptability, considering such factors as consumer expectations, degree of danger, feasibility and cost of alternative designs, and adverse consequences of alternatives,\u201d <em>Johnson Insulation, supra, </em>citing <em>Back, supra </em>at 640-642. Thus, we do not interpret <em>Johnson Insulation </em>to hold that, under Massachusetts law, the reasonable expectations of the ordinary consumer constitute the sole, determinative factor in determining liability for a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability based on defective design. Rather, we continue to uphold the risk-utility balancing standard, where consumer expectations are one of many factors that may be considered in determining whether a product\u2019s design is defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Therefore, the judge did not err in instructing the jury that they \u201cmay,\u201d rather than that they \u201cmust,\u201d consider whether Newport cigarettes met consumers\u2019 reasonable expectations as to safety. And because reasonable consumer expectations are simply one of many factors that may be considered and not necessarily the determinative factor, the plaintiff was not obligated to prove that Newport cigarettes were more dangerous than consumers reasonably expected. See Third Restatement, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2 comment f, at 23 (\u201cplaintiff is not necessarily required to introduce proof on all of these factors; their relevance, and the relevance of other factors, will vary from case to case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">b. <em>Reasonable alternative design of a cigarette. </em>\u201cTo establish a prima facie case of defect, the plaintiff must prove the availability of a technologically feasible and practical alternative design that would have reduced or prevented the plaintiff\u2019s harm.\u201d Third Restatement, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2 comment f, at 24. See <em>Colter, supra </em>at 57, quoting <em>Uloth </em>v. <em>City Tank Corp., </em>376 Mass. 874, 881 (1978) (\u201cthere is a case for the jury if the plaintiff can show an available design modification which would reduce the risk without undue cost or interference with the performance of the machinery\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The plaintiff presented evidence at trial that cigarettes are a highly engineered product, that the defendant manipulated its product to give the smoker a particular dose of tar and nicotine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>that an addictive level of nicotine was approximately 0.4 to 0.5 milligrams of nicotine per cigarette, and that Lorillard never sold a cigarette with nicotine levels at or below 0.4 milligrams per cigarette.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Dr. Farone testified that there are \u201csome [fifty-seven] or [fifty-eight] different things that one takes into account in designing a cigarette to deliver a certain amount of tar and a certain amount of nicotine.\u201d The plaintiff proposed as a reasonable alternative a cigarette without menthol where the carcinogens in the tar are at a level that is relatively safe<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and where the level of nicotine is nonaddictive. Dr. Farone testified that this could be accomplished by using a \u201cfilter that has a very, very high efficiency\u201d and perforating the filter with holes \u201csuch that when you suck on it or draw on it, very little smoke comes out,\u201d or by using \u201cexpanded tobacco,\u201d which is tobacco that has had the nicotine removed and has become very light \u201cso when you bum it, you have very little tar.\u201d To avoid the complete loss of flavor, Dr. Farone testified that a cigarette manufacturer such as Lorillard could put a flavor on the filter, \u201cso when the air draws back in you get that flavor.\u201d He noted that, to design a cigarette with a nonaddictive level of nicotine, \u201cyou have to get virtually all of it out\u201d to avoid the risk that smokers will become addicted to the remaining nicotine, and maintain or increase their risk of cancer by puffing harder or smoking more cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">There was abundant evidence that this alternative was technologically feasible. Patents to extract nicotine from tobacco have existed since the 1920s, and Dr. Farone stated that \u201ccertainly by the [19]40s there was technology available to remove nicotine from tobacco.\u201d Dr. Cummings testified that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>is commercially feasible to design and manufacture cigarettes that have nonaddictive levels of nicotine. He gave as one example \u201cQuest 3,\u201d which he described as a nonaddictive cigarette with \u201cvery low levels of nicotine\u201d that has been available for sale in stores. When Dr. Farone was asked whether there are commercially successful products on the market with 0.03 milligrams of nicotine or lower, he testified that cigarettes at \u201cthe lowest end of the scale . . . have been sold for many years.\u201d As examples of cigarettes for sale in the market with extremely low nicotine and tar outputs, he cited \u201cCarlton, as developed by American Tobacco Company . . . ; the NOW cigarette from R.J. Reynolds; and the Cambridge from Philip Morris,\u201d each of which contained less than 0.05 milligrams of nicotine in the 1980s, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">\u201c[A] 11 we\u2019re saying is that the [safer] cigarettes would meet the criteria in that they wouldn\u2019t have nicotine at sufficient levels to addict you, and they wouldn\u2019t have chemicals in it at sufficient levels to cause cancer at a reasonable percentage. Every cigarette could meet that. You could have a Marlboro that meets it. You could have a Newport Menthol that meets it. You\u2019ve just got to reduce the level in the product using technology that we\u2019ve been talking about that Lorillard had available ... to achieve those numbers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">There was also evidence that a safer alternative cigarette was feasible as to cost. According to a 1977 Lorillard memorandum, the manufacturing costs for a hypothesized Lorillard cigarette with \u201cultra-low tar\u201d and 0.35 milligrams of nicotine per cigarette would be higher than usual, but \u201cthese costs [would] be more than offset by the reduction in the amount of tobacco used.\u201d Lorillard, however, contends that, even if a low tar, low nicotine cigarette were a technologically feasible alternative design that could be produced at comparable cost, it was not a reasonable alternative design because \u201ccarcinogenic levels of tar and addictive levels of nicotine ... are inherent in all ordinary cigarettes,\u201d and the \u201cinherent risks of smoking . . . cannot be removed without fundamentally altering the nature of the product.\u201d The jury rejected this argument through their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>verdict. Even though Lorillard pressed this point in closing argument, and the judge instructed the jury that in determining whether the product\u2019s design was reasonably safe they \u201cshould consider, among other factors, . . . any adverse consequences to the product and to the consumer that would result from an alternative design, and whether the proposed modification would cause undue interference with the performance of the product,\u201d the jury nonetheless found that Newport cigarettes were defective and unreasonably dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Having failed to persuade the jury, Lorillard contends on appeal that the evidence at trial was insufficient as a matter of law to support a finding of a reasonable alternative design. It essentially makes two arguments. First, it contends that the alternative design proffered at trial was not truly a cigarette, and that the jury essentially found that all cigarettes were defective, thereby imposing categorical product liability on all cigarettes. We agree with Lorillard that, in a case where the allegedly defective product is a cigarette, the reasonable alternative design must also be a cigarette, and that a jury may not impose categorical liability on all cigarettes. See <em>Kyte </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Inc., </em>408 Mass. 162, 172 (1990) (suggesting claim that \u201call cigarettes are bad\u201d would fail or be preempted). But the evidence was more than sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that the alternative design proffered by the plaintiff was a cigarette, especially where the plaintiff\u2019s experts identified brands of cigarettes that implement the alternative design that have long been sold commercially as cigarettes. We do not accept Lorillard\u2019s implicit suggestion that every cigarette, to be a cigarette, must contain levels of tar that cause a high risk of cancer and levels of nicotine that are addictive. The plaintiff in this case provided substantial evidence of cigarettes on the market that do not contain such levels of tar or nicotine.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Second, Lorillard contends that, even if the alternative design <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>proffered by the plaintiff were a cigarette, the reduced tar and nicotine in that alternative cigarette so fundamentally alters the nature of the product that no reasonable jury could find that it was a reasonable alternative to Newport cigarettes. Lorillard cannot prevail here merely by asserting that the alternative design is not an \u201cordinary cigarette,\u201d which Lorillard defines as a cigarette with carcinogenic levels of tar and addictive levels of nicotine. We have consistently held that a product may be defectively designed even if the characteristic that makes the product unreasonably dangerous is shared with every other competitive product on the market. See <em>Haglund, supra </em>at 748 (\u201cplaintiff need only convince the jury that a safer alternative design was feasible, not that any manufacturer in the industry employed it or even contemplated it\u201d); <em>Back, supra </em>at 636 (manufacturer of motor home found liable in design defect case even though \u201cvehicle conformed to all product safety standards prevailing in the industry\u201d when vehicle was manufactured). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u201cThus, warranty liability may be imposed even where the product . . . conformed to industry standards . . . and passed regulatory muster . . . .\u201d <em>Haglund, supra. </em>Here, Lorillard\u2019s claim that all \u201cordinary cigarettes\u201d have the same design flaws alleged by the plaintiff does not protect Lorillard from liability, and the judge did not err in declining to instruct the jury that the plaintiff had to prove that a defect was present in Lorillard\u2019s cigarettes that was not present in other cigarettes on the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The essential question is not whether the safer alternative design is an \u201cordinary cigarette\u201d but whether adoption of the safer alternative design would result in undue interference with the cost or performance of the product, thereby making the alternative unreasonable. See <em>Colter, supra </em>at 57; <em>Uloth </em>v. <em>City Tank Corp., supra </em>at 881. Whether any interference with the cost or performance of the product is \u201cundue\u201d is generally a question for the jury, because many safer alternatives may increase the cost of a product or interfere to some degree with its performance, such as where the addition of a safety shield to a machine tool makes it both more expensive and harder and slower to operate. But the question becomes one of law where, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the interference with the cost or performance of the product is so substantial that no reasonable jury could conclude that it offers a reasonable alternative to consumers of the product. For example, an automobile is not a reasonable alternative to a motorcycle, even if it were proven safer, solely because it has four wheels rather than two. To add two wheels to a motorcycle would create a fundamentally different product and destroy the product\u2019s distinct utility in the eyes of any potential consumer. See Third Restatement, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2 comment f, illustration 9, at 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Lorillard contends that the safer alternative cigarette proffered by the plaintiff is not a reasonable alternative as a matter of law because, as the plaintiff\u2019s experts conceded at trial, \u201cordinary smokers\u201d \u2014 meaning smokers who are addicted to the nicotine in tobacco \u2014 will not smoke cigarettes that will not provide them with the nicotine they crave to satiate their addiction, which is why the alternative cigarettes that are commercially sold have a small share of the market. Before we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>address this argument, we look first to the expert testimony offered at trial regarding what motivates people to smoke. Drs. Benowitz and Cummings testified that those who start smoking do so for social reasons, not for nicotine. Dr. Cummings noted that, at first, \u201c[m]ost people get a little light-headed, they may even get nauseous, and you overcome that usually because your friends are\u201d smoking. He added that when people start to smoke, they are freely making a choice to smoke, and the choice, especially for teenagers, is usually for \u201cpsychosocial reasons.\u201d However, once one goes beyond the experimentation phase and \u201cyou get into the daily use pattern, your choice to smoke becomes diminished by the physiological effects of nicotine on your brain. . . . It\u2019s the daily use pattern . . . that distinguishes somebody . . . smoking for nicotine from somebody who is not smoking for nicotine.\u201d Dr. Benowitz testified that, with continued exposure to nicotine, \u201csmoking changes from social smoking to drug-reinforced smoking or to pharmacologic smoking.\u201d Once people become regular, daily smokers, what keeps them smoking is nicotine addiction. The evidence at trial was that Lorillard manipulated the level of nicotine in its cigarettes to ensure that those who smoked would continue to be addicted to nicotine. The evidence at trial also showed that the addiction produced by \u201cordinary\u201d levels of nicotine in cigarettes is so powerful that, in a given year, approximately seventy per cent of cigarette smokers want to stop smoking, but only approximately one-half of those who wish to quit will attempt to quit and, of those who attempt to quit, only approximately three per cent will succeed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Therefore, the evidence at trial would adequately support a finding that a cigarette with low tar and nicotine was a reasonable alternative to an individual who retained the unimpaired ability to make a rational, informed choice whether to smoke, such as an individual who was considering whether to start smoking or an individual who smoked infrequently or in small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>quantities. However, the plaintiff\u2019s proposed alternative cigarette was not a reasonable alternative to one who already was addicted to nicotine, whose freedom of choice was physiologically impaired by the effects of the nicotine. In short, the evidence in this case is sufficient to support a finding that low tar, low nicotine cigarettes are a safer, reasonable alternative design to the design used by Lorillard in their Newport cigarettes for the subclass of cigarette consumers who are not yet addicted but is not sufficient to support a finding that such cigarettes are a reasonable alternative for the subclass of consumers who are already addicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The question, then, is which subclass of consumers should be considered in evaluating the reasonableness of the alternative design? Lorillard\u2019s argument, stripped to its essence, is that the chemical in a product that causes consumers to be powerfully addicted to the product can never be found to constitute an unreasonably dangerous defect because no alternative design that did not contain addictive levels of the chemical will satisfy addicts\u2019 craving for the chemical and therefore be purchased by those addicted. If this argument were to prevail, addictive chemicals would be the only substance whose presence in a product could not, as a matter of law, be found to constitute a defect in the product\u2019s design, because there could be no reasonable alternative design that did not include them. And the more powerfully addictive the chemical, the more it would be protected from product liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">We decline to place addictive chemicals outside the reach of product liability and give them special protection akin to immunity based solely on the strength of their addictive qualities. To do so would eliminate any incentive for cigarette manufacturers to make safer perhaps the most dangerous product lawfully sold in the market through reasonable alternative designs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Rather, we conclude that, in determining as a matter of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>whether the evidence presented at trial was sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s proposed design was a reasonable alternative to the defendant\u2019s product, we must determine whether the design alternative unduly interfered with the performance of the product from the perspective of a rational, informed consumer, whose freedom of choice is not substantially impaired by addiction. Applying that standard to the evidence in this case, we conclude that a reasonable jury could find from the evidence presented that a low tar, low nicotine cigarette constituted a safer reasonable alternative to Lorillard\u2019s Newport cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Few courts appear to have addressed this question, perhaps because the only legally sold product so addictive as to raise the question is nicotine, and the courts that have done so provide little relevant guidance. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in evaluating whether \u201cthe average consumer at the time in question\u201d fully appreciated the health risks of smoking, recognized that it needed to \u201cdefine this imaginary \u2018average consumer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Insolia </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Inc., </em>216 F.3d 596, 599 (7th Cir. 2000). Recognizing \u201c[njicotine\u2019s addictive grip,\u201d the court concluded that \u201cthe state of knowledge of the average consumer must be measured before the average person is hooked and is no longer capable of making a rational choice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The Florida Supreme Court affirmed a jury\u2019s finding that a cigarette manufacturer had committed a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability where an alleged defect in the cigarettes\u2019 design was the addictive level of nicotine, but the court did not set forth its reasons for affirming this finding. <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., </em>945 So. 2d 1246, 1276-1277 (Fla. 2006), cert, denied sub nom. <em>R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. </em>v. <em>Engle, </em>552 U.S. 941 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In contrast, in <em>Adamo </em>v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>11 N.Y.3d 545, 549 (2008), cert, denied, 558 U.S. 874 (2009), the New York Court of Appeals declared that the plaintiffs alleging the defective design of a particular brand of cigarettes were required to prove as \u201can essential element\u201d of their case \u201cthat regular cigarettes and Tight\u2019 cigarettes have the same utility.\u201d The court ruled that \u201c[t]he only \u2018utility\u2019 of a cigarette is to gratify smokers\u2019 desires for a certain experience, and plaintiffs did not prove, or try to prove, that light cigarettes perform this function as well as regular cigarettes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court did not address the issue of addiction and, therefore, did not discuss whether the gratification of \u201csmokers\u2019 desires for a certain experience\u201d was the gratification of a craving arising from nicotine addiction, or whether the utility of a cigarette to a non-addicted consumer is the same as to one who is addicted.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 549-551.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Because cigarettes are unique among lawfully sold products in being so powerfully addictive, it is doubtful that our ruling requiring a reasonable alternative design to be evaluated through the eyes of a rational, informed consumer, whose freedom of choice is not substantially impaired by addiction, will have any significant consequence on liability actions involving any other product. In <em>Haglund, supra </em>at 751-752, we recognized that cigarettes are unusual in that any reasonable use of the product is foreclosed by the dual risks of serious disease and addiction, and we therefore barred cigarette manufacturers in most circumstances from offering as a defense in a product liability action the plaintiff\u2019s unreasonable use of cigarettes, the so-called <em>Correia </em>defense. See <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. 342 (1983). Just as we needed in <em>Haglund </em>to adapt our product liability jurisprudence to the inherent danger of smoking, so too do we need here to adapt our product liability jurisprudence to the inherent addictive potency of certain cigarettes. And just as the defendants in that case argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>we had eviscerated the <em>Correia </em>defense, so too does the defendant here contend that we will be paving the way for product liability claims that nonalcoholic whiskey and beer are reasonable alternatives to whiskey and beer. Such fears are wholly unwarranted. In contrast with cigarette smokers, the vast majority of whiskey and beer drinkers are not addicted to alcohol, so limiting the risk-utility evaluation of a reasonable alternative design to the perspective of rational, informed consumers of these products would have no bearing on the risk of product liability for these beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Finally, even though the evidence was essentially undisputed that the tar and nicotine in Newport brand cigarettes caused Marie\u2019s lung cancer, Lorillard argues that no reasonable jury could have found that any design defect in Newport cigarettes caused her death because the evidence at trial was that she tried and rejected a brand of cigarettes with lower tar and nicotine. In making this argument, Lorillard misunderstands the meaning of causation in products liability. Where a plaintiff proves that a product is defective, she may establish causation by proving that the defect caused her injury; the plaintiff need not prove that she would have used a reasonable alternative design had one been available. <em>Colter, supra </em>at 63, quoting <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., supra </em>at 355 (\u201cBecause warranty liability focuses on whether the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous and not on the conduct of the user or the seller, \u2018the only duty imposed on the user is to act reasonably with respect to a product which he knows to be defective and dangerous\u2019 \u201d); Third Restatement, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 1, at 5 (product manufacturer \u201cwho sells or distributes a defective product is subject to liability for harm to persons or property <em>caused by the </em>defect\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Here, the plaintiff submitted sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the combined effect of the nicotine and tar consumed by smokers of Lorillard\u2019s Newport cigarettes was a substantial factor in bringing about Marie\u2019s addiction, lung cancer, and wrongful death, and that her injury would have been reduced or avoided had she smoked cigarettes with a reasonable alternative design that would have resulted in a nonaddictive level of nicotine and a reasonably safe level of carcinogenic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>tar being consumed by the smoker.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Lorillard does not escape liability for its defective product simply because an addicted smoker continued to use a product that sated her addiction rather than switch to a safer product that would not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">c. <em>Warning defect for the period before 1970. </em>As noted earlier, the jury found that Lorillard violated the implied warranty of merchantability not only because of a design defect, but also because of a warning defect arising from its failure to provide Marie an adequate warning of the health hazards or addictive properties of Newport cigarettes before 1970. Lorillard contends that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support this finding because the risks of smoking were widely reported before Marie started smoking in 1960 and there is no common-law duty to warn of a known or an obvious risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u201cEven if a product is properly designed, it is unreasonably dangerous and, therefore, it is not fit for the purposes for which such goods are used, if foreseeable users are not adequately warned of dangers associated with its use.\u201d <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., </em>391 Mass. 407, 413 (1984). \u201cHowever, we have recognized that, \u2018where the danger presented by a given product is obvious, no duty to warn [exists] because a warning will not reduce the likelihood of injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bavuso </em>v. <em>Caterpillar Indus., Inc., </em>408 Mass. 694, 699 (1990), quoting <em>Colter, supra </em>at 59. This is consistent with the Third Restatement, which provides, in \u00a7 2 comment j, at 31: \u201cIn general, a product seller is not subject to liability for failing to warn or instruct regarding risks and risk-avoidance measures that should be obvious to, or generally known by, foreseeable product users.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Marie began to smoke in 1960. In 1965, the United States Congress enacted the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, Pub. L. 89-92, \u00a7 4, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 79 Stat. 282, 283 (Labeling Act), which required all cigarette packages to bear the warning, \u201cCaution: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous to Your Health.\u201d Before this requirement took effect in 1966, there were no warnings on retail packages of Newport <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>cigarettes, on free sample packages of Newport cigarettes, or in any advertising materials for Newport cigarettes. Marie testified that she remembered seeing the warning when it first appeared on cigarette packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In 1967, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a report stating that the warning label on cigarette packages had \u201cnot succeeded in overcoming the prevalent attitude toward cigarette smoking created and maintained by the cigarette companies through their advertisements, particularly the barrage of commercials on television, which portray smoking as a harmless and enjoyable social activity that is not habit forming and involves no hazards to health.\u201d The report concluded that \u201c[cjigarette commercials continue to appeal to youth and continue to blot out any consciousness of the health hazards.\u201d In 1970, Congress amended the mandated warning label on cigarette packages to state: \u201cWarning: The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous To Your Health,\u201d with the warning becoming effective on November 1, 1970. Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-222, \u00a7 4, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 84 Stat. 87, 88, 90 (1969 Act). The 1969 Act also declared that, apart from this warning, \u201c[n]o requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because the 1969 Act preempts any State law claim imposing liability based on a showing that a cigarette manufacturer\u2019s \u201cpost-1969 advertising or promotions should have included additional, or more clearly stated, wam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>ings,\u201d <em>Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., </em>505 U.S. 504, 524 (1992) (Stevens, J., plurality opinion), the plaintiff limited the failure to warn claims to the period ending in 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we conclude that a reasonable jury could find that the risks of cigarette smoking were certainly not obvious before 1966, when the warning on cigarette packages ordered by Congress provided only that \u201ccigarette smoking <em>may </em>be hazardous to your health,\u201d and were still not obvious before 1970, when the warning was stiffened to declare that \u201cthe Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking <em>is </em>dangerous to your health\u201d (emphases added). As the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit declared in <em>Tompkin </em>v. <em>American Brands, </em>219 F.3d 566, 572 (6th Cir. 2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">\u201cThe pertinent issue here is not whether the public knew that smoking was hazardous to health at some undifferentiated level, but whether it knew of the specific linkages between smoking and lung cancer. Public awareness of a broad-based and ambiguous risk that smoking might be tenuously connected to lung cancer does not suggest \u2018common knowledge\u2019 of the known scientific fact that cigarette smoking is a strong precipitant of lung cancer. ... It is one thing to be aware generally that a product might have an attenuated and theoretical connection with a deadly disease like lung cancer; it is another altogether to comprehend that it is the cause of an overwhelming majority of lung cancer cases. . . . The \u2018common knowledge\u2019 requirement is emasculated if a defendant may show merely that the public was aware that a product presented health risks at some vague, unspecified, and undifferentiated level.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">See <em>Burton </em>v. <em>R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>884 F. Supp. 1515, 1526 (D. Kan. 1995) (rejecting assertion \u201cthat because there is general common knowledge that cigarettes are dangerous, users of cigarettes are therefore imputed with knowledge of the extent and nature of all dangers relating to cigarettes\u201d). While the general public may have understood before 1970 that cigarettes posed a general risk to health, the plaintiff presented considerable evidence that Lorillard, along with other cigarette manu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>facturers, engaged in a calculated effort through advertising and public statements to raise doubts whether the causative link between cigarettes and cancer was scientifically proven, and that the FTC in 1967 acknowledged the success of these efforts. In fact, Lorillard has a bit of chutzpah to claim that it was obvious to the general public by 1960 that cigarettes were addictive and caused cancer when, in 1994, during sworn testimony before a congressional subcommittee, Andrew H. Tisch, Lorillard\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer, declared that he did not believe that cigarette smoking was addictive or caused cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Lorillard also argues that there is no duty to warn one who is aware of the risk, and that Marie knew cigarettes were dangerous when she started smoking in 1960. \u201cThe duty to warn . . . does not attach where . . . the plaintiff appreciated the danger substantially to the same extent as a warning would have provided.\u201d <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Lynn Ladder &amp; Scaffolding Co., </em>427 Mass. 1003, 1004 (1998). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a reasonable jury could conclude that Marie was not aware of the health risks of smoking when she started to smoke in 1960 at the age of thirteen and that, in 1964 when she became aware of the publicity surrounding the Surgeon General\u2019s report, she did not appreciate the danger of smoking Lorillard\u2019s Newport cigarettes to the same extent as a warning would have provided. Her deposition testimony evidenced the extent to which the cigarette manufacturers\u2019 efforts to raise doubts as to whether cigarettes caused cancer succeeded: \u201cyou really didn\u2019t rely on anyone\u2019s opinion as to being the true cause of what causes cancer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Finally, Lorillard argues that there was no evidence that its failure to warn of the foreseeable dangers arising from the use of Newport cigarettes caused Marie\u2019s injury because she did not heed the warnings placed on Lorillard\u2019s cigarette packages since 1966. We are not persuaded by this argument. In Massachusetts, \u201c[t]he law permits an inference that a warning, once given, would have been followed.\u201d <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Chin, </em>405 Mass. 697, 702-703 (1989). Once a plaintiff establishes that a warning should have been given, the burden is on \u201cthe defendants to come forward with evidence tending to rebut such an inference.\u201d <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 346, 352 (1978). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>There was substantial evidence that, by 1966, Marie was addicted to cigarettes. Evidence that an addicted smoker failed to heed a warning that was given to her after she was already addicted is insufficient to rebut the presumption that, had she received adequate warning before she started smoking, she would have heeded the warning and avoided the addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In conclusion, the jury were appropriately instructed as to both a design defect and a warning defect and, although we do not know whether the jury found causation as to one or both defects, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding on either theory.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">2. <em>Negligence. </em>The jury found that Lorillard was \u201cnegligent in the design, marketing and/or distribution of Newport cigarettes,\u201d that Lorillard was \u201cnegligent in failing to warn Marie Evans of the health hazards and/or addictive properties of Newport cigarettes at any time prior to 1970,\u201d and that Lorillard \u201cnegligently distribute[d] Newport cigarettes by giving samples of such cigarettes to minors, including Marie Evans.\u201d However, as with breach of the implied warranty, the jury were not asked to find causation as to each theory of negligence but instead were asked whether \u201cany negligence\u201d of Lorillard was \u201ca substantial factor in causing Marie Evans\u2019s lung cancer.\u201d Therefore, because we cannot know on which theory or theories the jury found causation, the jury\u2019s finding of liability for negligence may stand only if the jury were correctly and adequately instructed on each theory of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">As to negligent design, the judge instructed the jury that they \u201cmay\u201d but were \u201cnot required to consider whether there was a safer alternative design available.\u201d This instruction was timely objected to by the defendant at trial and constituted prejudicial error. In claims alleging negligence in the design of a product, as with claims of a design defect in breach of the implied war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>ranty of merchantability, the plaintiff must show \u201can available design modification which would reduce the risk without undue cost or interference with the performance of the [product],\u201d and the jury must consider whether a safer alternative design was available in deciding whether the defendant was negligent for failing to adopt that design. <em>Colter, supra </em>at 57, quoting <em>Uloth </em>v. <em>City Tank Corp., supra </em>at 881. See <em>Kotler </em>v. <em>American Tobacco Co., </em>926 F.2d 1217, 1225 (1st Cir. 1990), vacated on other grounds, 505 U.S. 1215 (1992) (in Massachusetts, \u201c[i]n a design defect case premised on negligence, the existence of a safer alternative design is a sine qua non for the imposition of liability\u201d). We have already declared that a reasonable alternative design must be shown before a defendant may be found liable for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability based on a design defect, and \u201c[a] defendant cannot be found to have been negligent without having breached the warranty of merchantability.\u201d <em>Haglund, supra </em>at 747 n.9, quoting <em>Colter, supra </em>at 61. Therefore, we conclude that the jury were incorrectly instructed on the law regarding the plaintiff\u2019s claim of negligent design.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">As to negligent marketing, the judge provided the jury with no guidance as to the duty a cigarette manufacturer would owe in the marketing of its products, which, if breached, could give rise to a cognizable claim of negligence. Presumably, the plaintiff\u2019s theory of negligent marketing was that Lorillard had marketed cigarettes to minors when Marie was a minor, because the plaintiff offered evidence to support this claim. See <em>Kyte </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Inc., </em>408 Mass. 162, 170 n.8 (1990), citing <em>Killeen </em>v. <em>Harmon Grain Prods., Inc., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 20, 28 (1980) (observing that Appeals Court noted in dicta that \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s liability might be based on the marketing of a product in a manner calculated to induce direct purchases by children whose use would involve unreasonable risk of injury\u201d). But the plaintiff also offered substantial evidence that Lorillard marketed its Newport cigarettes to African-American adults. Some of this evidence may have been relevant to show that Lorillard marketed its products to African-American children at a time when Marie, who was African-American, was a child, but the jury were not limited in the use of this evidence. Lorillard timely objected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the imprecise marketing instruction and asked that it be limited to the \u201cgive-aways\u201d of cigarettes when Marie was a minor, but the jury were not instructed as to any limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">We conclude that the absence of guidance as to the meaning of negligent marketing and of any limitation as to its scope was prejudicial because we cannot know what marketing duty the jury found Lorillard to have breached. Specifically, we cannot know whether the jury found that Lorillard engaged in negligent marketing by targeting African-American adults, which would not constitute a breach of any legal duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Where we cannot ascertain on which theory the jury relied in finding causation, the jury\u2019s finding of liability as to negligence cannot stand. See <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard </em>College, 432 Mass. 107, 119 (2000). See also <em>Blackstone </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>448 Mass. 255, 271 (2007). Therefore, we must vacate the jury\u2019s finding of liability for wrongful death based on the theory of negligence because we conclude that the jury were incorrectly instructed as to negligent design and inadequately instructed as to negligent marketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">3. <em>Breach of a voluntarily assumed duty. </em>In 1954, Lorillard joined most of the major cigarette manufacturers in issuing \u201cA Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers\u201d (Frank Statement), a full-page advertisement in major newspapers reaching over 40 million people. In this statement, the cigarette manufacturers stated that they would \u201caccept an interest in people\u2019s health as a basic responsibility, paramount to every other consideration in our business,\u201d that they believed the products they made were \u201cnot injurious to health,\u201d and that they \u201calways have and always will cooperate closely with those whose task it is to safeguard the public health.\u201d Finally, the cigarette manufacturers pledged \u201caid and assistance to the research effort into all phases of tobacco use and health.\u201d Lorillard was a member of both the Tobacco Industry Research Committee (TIRC), which was formed as a result of the Frank Statement, and the Tobacco Institute (TI), which was founded in 1958. The pledge made in the Frank Statement was reaffirmed by the TIRC in 1958 and by the TI in 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The plaintiff submitted substantial evidence at trial that, despite this pledge, Lorillard and its fellow members of the TIRC and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the TI executed an intentional strategy of \u201ccreating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it.\u201d Even though Dr. Cummings testified that, by the end of the 1950s, \u201cthere was really no doubt\u201d that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer, and that by 1955 the nicotine in cigarettes was known to be addictive, Lorillard\u2019s public statements from the 1950s through at least the 1990s were that cigarettes were not addictive and that it was not proven that cigarettes were injurious to human health. As noted earlier, this deception culminated in 1994 with Tisch\u2019s sworn testimony before a congressional subcommittee that he did not believe smoking causes cancer and that he believed nicotine was not addictive. Lorillard\u2019s expert witness as to marketing and sales practices testified that Tisch\u2019s statement adequately represented the company\u2019s position at that time, and that it was not until 2000 that Lorillard publicly acknowledged that cigarettes cause cancer and other diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">At trial, the plaintiff alleged, and the jury found, that by joining in the 1954 Frank Statement, Lorillard voluntarily undertook a duty to research the health hazards of smoking and to disclose accurate information regarding the results of that research to the general public, including Marie. \u201cIf a person voluntarily assumes a duty or undertakes to render services to another that should have been seen as necessary for her protection, that person may be liable for harm caused because of the negligent performance of his undertaking.\u201d <em>Cottam </em>v. <em>CVS Pharmacy, </em>436 Mass. 316, 323-324 (2002) <em>{Cottam), </em>quoting <em>Thorson </em>v. <em>Mandell, </em>402 Mass. 744, 748 (1988). See Second Restatement, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 323, at 135. \u201cDefining the scope of the duty assumed is a fact-specific inquiry\u201d that focuses on the totality of a company\u2019s communications with its customers and customers\u2019 reasonable understanding, based on those communications, of what, if any, obligation, the company has undertaken to assume. <em>Cottam, supra </em>at 324, 326. In the <em>Cottam </em>case, for instance, we noted that \u201c[wjhen a pharmacy\u2019s communication with a patient concerning a drug is limited to a single label warning of only one side effect, the pharmacy has undertaken a duty to warn correctly as to that specific side effect but has not undertaken a broader duty to warn of all potential side effects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325. But where \u201cthe patient could reasonably interpret the warning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>form as a complete and comprehensive list of all known side effects, it is appropriate to impose on the pharmacy a duty commensurate with what it appeared to have undertaken.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Numerous courts have considered whether cigarette manufacturers voluntarily assumed a legal duty by joining the Frank Statement, and to our knowledge, all have concluded that they did not. See <em>Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Welfare Fund </em>v. <em>Philip Morris, Inc., </em>171 F.3d 912, 936 (3d Cir. 1999), cert, denied, 528 U.S. 1105 (2000) (\u201cConverting a company\u2019s marketing into a special undertaking to inform the public about the known risks of its products would subject every manufacturer that advertises its products to liability for a \u2018special duty\u2019 created by such marketing, and that duty would be violated by every material omission in such advertising\u201d); <em>Baryo </em>v. <em>Philip Morris USA, Inc., </em>435 F. Supp. 2d 961, 970 (W.D. Mo. 2006) (\u201cPlaintiffs cannot possibly prove that [cigarette manufacturer defendants] undertook such a special duty through advertisements aimed at the general public,\u201d and that \u201csame conclusion has been reached in every other cigarette case alleging breach of a special duty of which this Court is aware\u201d); <em>Massachusetts Laborers\u2019 Health &amp; Welfare Fund </em>v. <em>Philip Morris, Inc., </em>62 F. Supp. 2d 236, 245-246 (D. Mass. 1999) (plaintiff\u2019s claims that cigarette manufacturer defendant committed breach of voluntarily assumed duty created by Frank Statement \u201cfail to state viable claims under Massachusetts law\u201d); <em>Kentucky Laborers Dist. Council Health &amp; Welfare Trust Fund </em>v. <em>Hill &amp; Knowlton, Inc., </em>24 F. Supp. 2d 755, 774 (W.D. Ky. 1998) (although cigarette manufacturer defendants \u201cmay have made vaguely promissory statements to the general public,\u201d this claim \u201cfailed to allege that [defendants undertook to do anything specific for any particular person or entity, much less that they assumed a duty to render services of any sort to the [plaintiffs]\u201d); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Brooke Group Ltd., </em>652 N.W.2d 159, 178 (Iowa 2002) (\u201cWe do not think the defendants\u2019 statements that they would report on the results of their research into the health effects of cigarette smoking was an undertaking to render a service to its customers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">We, too, conclude that, by joining the Frank Statement, Lorillard did not voluntarily undertake a legal duty it otherwise did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>not have to research the health risks of smoking and disclose to the public the results of that research. In contrast with a pharmacy\u2019s detailed warning of side effects on a prescription label, where any voluntarily assumed duty is either met or breached at the time of sale, the allegedly assumed duty in this case was indefinite and potentially permanent in duration. The plaintiff asks us to characterize the commitments made in this advertisement as an enforceable eternal promise to the public at large to research the health effects of smoking and provide full disclosure of its research findings for all time. We do not think a duty so broad in scope and duration can properly arise from a pledge in an advertisement to \u201caid and assist[]\u201d a research effort. Because we conclude that Lorillard did not voluntarily undertake a special duty, we reverse the jury\u2019s findings on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">4. <em>Punitive damages. </em>Because we have vacated the finding of negligence liability and reversed the finding of breach of a voluntarily undertaken duty, we must also vacate the jury\u2019s findings that Lorillard was grossly negligent and that Lorillard acted in a manner that was malicious, wilful, wanton, or reckless. We cannot be confident that the jury\u2019s findings on these issues were untainted by the aforementioned errors. Consequently, we must also vacate the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages for wrongful death under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">5. <em>Statute of limitations. </em>Lorillard argues that the plaintiff\u2019s claims are time barred because they accrued in 1985, when Marie realized that Lorillard\u2019s alleged misconduct had caused her harm after she suffered a heart attack, but the complaint was not filed until 2004. Lorillard waived its right to a jury trial on this defense by not requesting that the jury make a factual finding regarding the accrual of the claim in the special verdict, see Mass. R. Civ. R 49 (a), 365 Mass. 812 (1974), but preserved its legal claim that the statute of limitations period should have commenced in 1985. The judge impliedly found that the complaint was timely filed by issuing the judgment in favor of the plaintiff on the special verdict, and we review the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>implied finding for clear factual error or error of law. See <em>Hawco </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>398 Mass. 1006, 1006 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Generally, under our discovery rule, a claim accrues and the statute of limitations clock commences when a plaintiff knows, or reasonably should have known, \u201cthat she has been harmed or may have been harmed by the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>408 Mass. 204, 205-206 (1990).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However, where, as here, the plaintiff alleges that toxic substances in the defendant\u2019s unreasonably dangerous and defective product caused the decedent to die from a particular disease (lung cancer), the claim does not accrue until that particular disease is manifested. See <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Philip Morris USA, Inc., </em>455 Mass. 215, 228 (2009). See also <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Bell Tel. Labs., Inc., </em>388 Mass. 171, 176 (1983), citing <em>Fearson </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>525 F.

See <em>id. </em>at 792 n.l. See also <em>Cigna Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Oy Saunatec, Ltd., </em>241 F.3d 1, 9-10 (1st Cir. 2001) (\u201cunder Massachusetts law, the fact that there is only one negligent act . . . does not mean that there was only a single cause of action that accrued at the time of the first injury. Instead, if there are multiple injuries, there will be multiple causes of action with multiple dates of accrual if the injuries are \u2018separate and distinct\u2019 \u201d); <em>Fearson </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Sales Corp., supra </em>at 673-674 (where plaintiff was diagnosed with one disease in 1973 and separate disease in 1979, both arising from exposure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>to asbestos, claim for injuries arising from latter disease did not accrue until 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Thus, Marie\u2019s cause of action for injuries resulting from her lung cancer accrued when she knew or reasonably should have known that she had developed lung cancer from smoking Lorillard\u2019s Newport cigarettes. This occurred when she was diagnosed with metastatic small cell lung cancer in December, 2001. See <em>Nicolo </em>v. <em>Philip Morris, Inc., </em>201 F.3d 29, 36 (1st Cir. 2000) (\u201cUnlike impairments to breathing, cancer does not lend itself to lay identification. It is most dependent upon medical diagnosis\u201d). The plaintiff\u2019s claims in this case are not time barred by the three-year statute of limitations in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A, because his complaint was filed on June 28, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">6. <em>Alleged trial errors. </em>Lorillard argues that the judge made numerous errors that denied it a fair trial. We address separately each claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">a. <em>Jury selection. </em>Lorillard contends that the judge conducted insufficient voir dire of the venire because she denied Lorillard\u2019 s request for the use of a jury questionnaire, refused to ask Lorillard\u2019s proposed voir dire questions, and asked only the mandatory questions under G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, and Mass. R. Civ. P. 47 (a), 365 Mass. 812 (1974). The judge provided each day\u2019s venire with a brief summary of the facts of the case clearly indicating that the case would involve determining the liability of a cigarette company for allegedly misleading conduct and for the design of its cigarettes. Among other questions, she asked whether any prospective juror had \u201cany personal interest in this case,\u201d whether any prospective juror had \u201cformed or expressed any opinion with regard to this case,\u201d and whether any prospective juror was \u201caware of any reason\u201d why he or she could not or did not \u201cstand indifferent, impartial, with respect to this case.\u201d If any prospective juror answered any of these questions affirmatively, the judge conducted an individual examination of that juror at sidebar, and as a result of this process, many prospective jurors were excused because they identified some reason why they could not be impartial. We conclude that this process satisfied the requirements of G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, and Mass. R. Civ. P. 47 (a), and that the judge did not abuse her discretion in conducting the voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Lorillard also argues that the judge denied Lorillard its right to peremptory challenges in violation of Mass. R. Civ. R 47 (b), as amended, 450 Mass. 1402 (2008), and Rule 6 of the Rules of the Superior Court (2012). Lorillard was given the six peremptory challenges to which it was entitled when fifteen jurors are seated in a civil case. See G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 29; Mass. R. Civ. R 47 (b). However, it had used its final peremptory challenge believing that only fourteen jurors would be seated, and it only thereafter learned that the judge intended to seat a fifteenth juror. We agree with Lorillard that, when a judge represents that fourteen jurors will be chosen and a party exercises all its peremptory challenges based on that representation, a judge should not seat a fifteenth juror without giving the parties an additional peremptory challenge. However, Lorillard has failed to show that, had it been given an additional peremptory challenge, it would have exercised it by striking the fifteenth juror. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leahy, </em>445 Mass. 481, 496 (2005) (denial of right to exercise peremptory challenge is reversible error where defendant shows that he would have exercised challenge had it been available); <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>428 Mass. 555, 560 (1998), quoting <em>Tamburello </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>392 S.W.2d 114, 116 (Tex. 1965) (\u201cIn a civil case, \u2018a refusal to allow the proper number of peremptory challenges [is] regarded as immaterial in the absence of a showing that the party affected was required to accept one or more jurors whom he wished to challenge\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">b. <em>Trial judge\u2019s impartiality. </em>Lorillard argues that it was denied its due process right to an impartial judge based on two statements made by the judge during trial. We conclude that neither of these statements reasonably suggests that the judge was partial.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The first statement relied on by Lorillard occurred when the judge informed the parties that she thought that the findings or the judgment in <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., </em>945 So. 2d 1246 (Fla. 2006) <em>{Engle), </em>could be used by the plaintiff for offensive collateral estoppel. The context of the judge\u2019s remarks was that the plaintiff did not appear to seek to use the findings in <em>Engle </em>for that purpose, and the judge was not sure for what purpose the plaintiff sought to use these findings if not for offensive collateral estoppel. These remarks did not affect the verdict, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the findings in <em>Engle </em>were not communicated to the jury, the judge denied the plaintiff\u2019s request for a directed verdict based on the theory of offensive collateral estoppel, and the jury\u2019s verdict obviated the need for the issue to be addressed in a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Lorillard also claims that the judge demonstrated her partiality when she considered the defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict. The context of her challenged remark is that the defendant had just filed its motion for a directed verdict, and the judge was reading the defendant\u2019s reference in its brief to Second Restatement, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 402A comment i, at 352, which states that \u201c[gjood tobacco is not unreasonably dangerous merely because the effects of smoking may be harmful.\u201d The judge said that this was the first time she had seen something in a Restatement that she did not agree with. Defense counsel noted that knives, dynamite, and guns were products that were inherently dangerous but not unreasonably dangerous. The judge responded, \u201cWell, if they have a use that is reasonable. What\u2019s the use of cigarettes but to cause cancer in their present form?\u201d The judge\u2019s question was poorly framed, but it offered defense counsel an opportunity, which defense counsel used, to explain to the judge the benefits people obtain from smoking and the need to avoid categorical liability. We conclude that the question does not reflect partiality of the judge. The judge was familiar with our decision in <em>Haglund, supra </em>at 751, where we declared that cigarettes are distinct from other inherently dangerous products because \u201cany reasonable use of the product whatsoever [is] foreclosed by the nature of the product itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aq_\">c. <em>Characterization of judicial findings in another case as an expert\u2019s conclusion. </em>Lorillard argues that the judge denied the defendant a fair trial by directing the plaintiff to misrepresent findings from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Philip Morris USA, Inc., </em>449 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2006), aff\u2019d in part and rev\u2019d in part, 566 F.3d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 2009), cert, denied s\u00fcb nom. <em>Lorillard Tobacco Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>130 S. Ct. 3502 (2010) <em>(Philip </em>Morris), as the findings of an \u201cexpert\u201d to impeach Leonard H. Jones, Lorillard\u2019s director of direct marketing and market research. On direct examination, Jones testified that \u201cLorillard does not market Newport cigarettes or any of its cigarettes to youth or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>kids.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel informed the judge that he wanted to impeach Jones with findings to the contrary made by the trial judge in <em>Philip Morris. </em>The judge would not let him refer to the Federal judge\u2019s findings but instead suggested that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney \u201cphrase it in terms of an expert,\u201d and refer to the judge\u2019s findings as the findings of an \u201cexpert.\u201d Over objection, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney asked Jones questions in this format, such as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">\u201cWould it affect your opinion if an expert concluded the following after studying Lorillard\u2019s market practices: For several decades Lorillard has falsely denied that its marketing efforts target young people. Lorillard falsely claimed that all of its marketing is aimed only at encouraging the brand loyalty of adult smokers. Lorillard also falsely states that marketing has no effect on youth initiation and smoking behaviors? . . . Knowing that an expert, after studying Lorillard\u2019s marketing practices, reached that conclusion, would that affect your opinions with respect to Lorillard\u2019s marketing?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Lorillard argues that the judge erred in allowing the judge in <em>Philip Morris </em>to be characterized in this cross-examination as an \u201cexpert.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>413 Mass. 387, 396 (1992) <em>{Sneed), </em>we adopted Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 803 (18), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">\u201cTo the extent called to the attention of an expert witness upon cross-examination, statements contained in published treatises, periodicals, or pamphlets on a subject of history, medicine, or other science or art, established as a reliable authority by the testimony or admission of the witness or by other expert testimony or by judicial notice . . . may be read into evidence but may not be received as exhibits.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>By suggesting that the findings in <em>Philip Morris </em>be phrased as the conclusions of a hypothetical expert, the judge intended to allow the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to confront the witness with the Federal judge\u2019s findings regarding Lorillard\u2019s marketing practices but avoid the prejudice that might result from the jury learning that these were findings made by a Federal judge. The problem with this solution is that a judge\u2019s findings of fact, which must be based on the evidence presented in a specific case, do not have the same indicia of reliability as statements in a published treatise, periodical, or pamphlet, and a judge does not become a reliable authority on the subject of cigarette marketing by virtue of making judicial findings on the subject. Because a judicial opinion is not capable of being established as a reliable authority, portions from it may not be read into evidence under Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 803 (18). See <em>Brusard </em>v. <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>429 Mass. 597, 602-603 (1999) (\u201crule contemplates that an authored treatise, and not the statements contained therein, must be established as a reliable authority\u201d). Accord W.G. Young, J.R. Pollets, &amp; C. Poreda, Evidence \u00a7 803.18, at 188 (2d ed. 1998) (\u201cparty seeking to admit the learned treatise [on cross-examination] must first lay a foundation that the treatise is a reliable authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">While the judge erred in allowing the Federal judge\u2019s findings to be read in evidence as the hypothetical conclusions of an unnamed \u201cexpert,\u201d the error was not consequential. In answer to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s question whether his opinion as to Lorillard\u2019s allegedly negligent marketing practices would be affected if an unidentified expert had made the stated conclusions, Jones answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know that it would, because I don\u2019t believe that to be true.\u201d Not only was Jones\u2019s opinion unaffected by this line of questioning, but the jury were unlikely to be swayed by the hypothetical opinions of an unidentified \u201cexpert.\u201d In any event, the challenged line of cross-examination focused solely on the plaintiff\u2019s claims of negligent marketing and distribution, and we have already vacated the jury\u2019s liability findings as to these claims on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">d. <em>Admission of evidence regarding African-American and youth marketing. </em>Lorillard argues that the judge erred in admitting \u201cracially-charged and inflammatory\u201d and \u201centirely ir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>relevant\u201d evidence, which was likely to inflame the jury\u2019s emotions, that Lorillard marketed cigarettes to the African-American community, and that she therefore denied Lorillard a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Because the plaintiff alleged that Lorillard\u2019s negligent distribution of Newport cigarettes to minors was a substantial factor in causing Marie\u2019s lung cancer and death and because Marie was an African-American child in the 1950s and early 1960s, the judge did not err in admitting evidence that Lorillard marketed cigarettes to the African-American community, and to African-American children, when Marie was a minor. Because the plaintiff alleged negligent failure to warn and a warning defect in breach of the implied warranty of merchantability before 1970, and because Lorillard\u2019s cigarette advertising before 1970 was relevant to these claims to the extent it tended to show whether the risks of smoking were obvious to everyone (and to Marie) and, if not, whether such risks were adequately warned of during that time period, the judge did not err in admitting evidence that Lorillard marketed cigarettes to the African-American community before 1970. But Lorillard is correct that, over objection, the judge also admitted evidence of Lorillard\u2019s marketing of cigarettes to the African-American community after 1970, and did not limit the jury\u2019s consideration of this evidence. We conclude that the admission of this evidence was error, because it was irrelevant to any of the claims in this case. However, we also conclude that we have eliminated any material risk of prejudice arising from the admission of this evidence by vacating the jury\u2019s finding of negligence liability, because the risk posed by the admission of this evidence was that a jury might mistakenly understand that a cigarette manufacturer could be found negligent simply for marketing to the African-American community. We see no material risk that the admission of this evidence prejudiced the jury\u2019s finding of a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The defendant also claims that the judge erred in admitting evidence that Lorillard marketed and distributed cigarettes to minors after Marie became an adult. The admission of such evidence would not be error if the judge were to instruct the jury that they could consider this evidence only to the extent they found it relevant to whether Lorillard marketed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>distributed cigarettes to Marie when she was a minor, such as if such evidence reflected a continuing policy, pattern, or practice of Lorillard that began when Marie was a minor. No such limiting instruction was given, but here, too, we have eliminated any material risk of prejudice by vacating on other grounds the jury\u2019s finding of negligence liability. Again, we see no material risk that the admission of this evidence without a limiting instruction prejudiced the jury\u2019s finding of a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">e. <em>Admission of 1994 congressional testimony of Lorillard\u2019s then chairman and chief executive officer. </em>Lorillard contends that the judge erred in admitting portions of the 1994 testimony of Andrew H. Tisch, then chairman and chief executive officer of Lorillard, to a congressional subcommittee where he stated under oath that he did not believe cigarette smoking caused cancer, and that he believed nicotine was not addictive. Lorillard argues that this evidence was irrelevant because there was no evidence that Marie actually heard or learned of this testimony. We have already noted the relevance of this testimony \u2014 it strongly rebuts Lorillard\u2019s assertion that the risks of smoking were so well known before 1970 that it had no duty to warn.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Lorillard also argues that, under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine, the 1994 testimony \u201ccannot be used as a basis for liability.\u201d See <em>United Mine Workers of Am. </em>v. <em>Pennington, </em>381 U.S. 657 (1965) <em>{Pennington)-, Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference </em>v. <em>Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., </em>365 U.S. 127 (1961) <em>{Noerr). </em>In <em>Noerr, </em>the Court declared that the antitrust laws should not be interpreted to prohibit private parties from petitioning Congress to take legislative action, even if the motivation of such petitioning efforts was to accomplish a restraint of trade. <em>Id. </em>at 137-138 (\u201cTo hold that the government retains the power to act in this representative capacity and yet hold, at the same time, that the people cannot freely inform the government of their wishes would impute to the Sherman Act a purpose to regulate, not business activity, but political activity, a purpose which would have no basis whatever in the legislative history of that Act\u201d). In <em>Pennington, supra </em>at 670, the Court extended this principle to the petitioning of executive officials, declaring that \u201c[jjoint efforts to influence public officials do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>violate the antitrust laws even though intended to eliminate competition.\u201d \u201cWhile the doctrine originated as a limit on antitrust liability, <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>has been extended by analogy to protect petitioning activity challenged under other [F]ederal statutes,\u201d although \u201c[t]he extent of Noerr-Pennington\u2019s application to [S]tate common law torts such as negligence and product liability is largely unresolved.\u201d <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Accu-tek, </em>935 E Supp. 1307, 1317 (E.D.N.Y. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Here, the plaintiff did not allege at trial that Tisch\u2019s testimony before the congressional subcommittee was the basis of any of the plaintiff\u2019s claims. Rather, portions of Tisch\u2019s testimony were offered as evidence in support of these claims.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Supreme Court in <em>Pennington </em>specifically declared that the doctrine did not bar the admission in evidence of petitioning efforts, provided that it was clear to the jury that petitioning efforts to influence public officials is not itself illegal. See <em>Pennington, supra </em>at 670 n.3 (\u201cIt would of course still be within the province of the trial judge to admit this evidence, if he deemed it probative and not unduly prejudicial\u201d). Here, there was no risk of juror confusion. The judge did not err in admitting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">f. <em>Exclusion of testimony regarding the color of cigarette packages and market share. </em>Lorillard contends that the judge erred by precluding Jones\u2019s testimony regarding the color of packages of Kool and Salem brand cigarettes, products not manufactured by Lorillard, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Lorillard sought to offer this evidence to show that the packages of cigarettes that Marie and other witnesses recalled being distributed to children in Orchard Park when Marie was a child were not Newport brand cigarettes, but were more likely Kool or Salem brand cigarettes, which were also mentholated.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The judge did not abuse her discretion in precluding this evidence. Jones could not testify as a fact witness on the issue because he lacked personal knowledge of the colors of cigarette packages during the relevant time period. He could not testify as an expert witness because the observable color of a cigarette package is not a proper subject matter for expert opinion. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number><em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 105 (1982); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 702 (2013). Although his testimony on this issue was not admissible, the judge correctly allowed Lorillard to submit documentary exhibits tending to show the color of the packages of Newport, Kool, and Salem cigarettes during the relevant time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Lorillard also contends that the judge erred by precluding Jones\u2019s testimony about the proportional market shares of Newport, Kool, and Salem cigarettes in the relevant time period. Lorillard argues that this testimony was admissible to rebut Marie\u2019s testimony that part of the reason she started smoking Newports was because they were \u201cwhat [she\u2019d] see everybody else smoking,\u201d and to prove it unlikely that the sample packages Marie received actually contained Newport cigarettes. We conclude that the judge acted within her discretion in precluding Jones from answering the questions of Lorillard\u2019s counsel as to his opinion on \u201chow well Newport sold compared to Kool and Salem in the late 1950s\u201d and \u201cwhat the market share of menthol cigarettes was in the year 1960.\u201d These questions asked Jones to give his opinion on the over-all, nationwide market share of each of the brands of menthol cigarettes. The judge did not abuse her discretion in sustaining the objections to these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">g. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s suggestion that defense counsel intended to deceive the jury. </em>One of Lorillard\u2019s primary defenses during trial to the plaintiff\u2019s claim of negligent marketing and distribution was that the free sample packages of cigarettes that Marie and some of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses remembered receiving could not have been Newport cigarette packages because such witnesses described the packages as being a \u201cpretty green color,\u201d \u201cKelly greenish,\u201d or \u201cbright green\u201d when the actual color of Newport packages was turquoise blue. During the direct examination of Jones by Lorillard\u2019s counsel, the witness was shown exhibit no. 914, a color photocopy of an advertisement for Newport cigarettes in the August, 1965, issue of Ebony Magazine, and was asked to state the color of the package of Newport cigarettes contained in the image. He described the color as turquoise blue; we have examined the advertisement depicted in this photocopy and find the color of the package to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>be closer to a navy blue. In his cross-examination of Jones, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel showed the witness exhibit no. 914A, an actual August, 1965, issue of Ebony Magazine, where the color of the Newport cigarette package was closer to green than it was in exhibit no. 914. Counsel then asked the witness whether the cigarette package depicted in exhibit no. 914, the photocopy, was \u201ca fair representation of the color of the Newport package,\u201d when compared to exhibit no. 914A. Jones answered, \u201cIt is not because a copy will never match the original ad.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked: \u201cHow do you know? How do you know that your lawyers were not trying to deceive this jury?\u201d Lorillard\u2019s counsel objected, and the judge sustained the objection. Later, Lorillard moved for a mistrial on the ground that this last question impugned the integrity of Lorillard\u2019s attorneys in the eyes of the jury. The judge denied the motion but offered to consider a written request for a limiting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">We review a judge\u2019s decision not to declare a mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>Fialkow </em>v. <em>DeVoe Motors, Inc., </em>359 Mass. 569, 572 (1971). We find no abuse of discretion here. The question was improper as phrased, but the inquiry itself was not improper. The Newport cigarette package in the actual advertisement was far closer to green than the dark blue package depicted in the photocopy of the advertisement. The witness essentially attributed the difference solely to a poor color photocopier, but it was fair game for the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to challenge that explanation. The judge sustained the objection in front of the jury and invited defense counsel to suggest a limiting instruction. In her final instructions to the jury, the judge stated that \u201ca question which is not answered[] is not to be considered by you at all.\u201d In a long, hard-fought trial, the judge acted within her discretion in deciding that the jury\u2019s impartiality would not be tainted by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s single question suggesting that Lorillard\u2019s counsel had knowingly put in evidence a photocopy of an advertisement where the Newport cigarette package appeared more blue and less green than it actually was.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">h. <em>Admission of contested exhibits. </em>Lorillard contends that it was denied a fair trial because the judge admitted over 150 of the plaintiff\u2019s exhibits \u201cen masse\u201d without ruling on objections to them and denied Lorillard the chance to raise specific objections to them. The truth is more complicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The parties proposed to offer more than 1,000 exhibits in evidence, and agreed on the admissibility of few of them. The plaintiff proposed, and the judge accepted, a procedure in which all proposed exhibits would be marked for identification by a number followed by \u201cID\u201d and, when an exhibit was admitted in evidence, the \u201cID\u201d would be struck. To address the huge volume of exhibits, the judge directed the parties to sort the proposed exhibits into categories, and she conducted a hearing to rule on the admissibility of the various categories. Lorillard\u2019s counsel agreed with this procedure, stating, \u201cI understand that, given the bulk of the documents, that\u2019s an efficient way to do it.\u201d He said he understood the judge was ruling on the admissibility of these categories of documents but asked if he was precluded from later raising an objection as to a specific document if, for example, he were to contend that its prejudicial value far outweighed any probative value. The judge said that counsel was not precluded from renewing a specific objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">During trial, Lorillard\u2019s counsel informed the judge of his understanding that each proposed exhibit was \u201cagreed,\u201d \u201cadmitted over an objection,\u201d or \u201cmarked for ID.\u201d Only the last category of documents would continue to have \u201cID\u201d written on the sticker, reflecting that the parties had yet to agree on the admissibility of such documents and the judge had not yet ruled on their admission. The judge and the plaintiff understood that, once a document was admitted over objection, it was admitted in evidence, regardless of whether it was shown to a witness. After trial began, however, Lorillard articulated its understanding that no document admitted over objection would go to the jury unless it was shown to a witness and Lorillard had an opportunity to make a specific objection. The judge, in essence, ruled that, once a document was admitted over objection, it was admitted in evidence, regardless of whether it was shown to a witness at trial, but she offered Lorillard the opportunity to renew its objection to any specific exhibit, saying, \u201cWe can do that all day long if you want.\u201d The next day, rather than offer any argument that specific exhibits should not have been admitted, Lorillard rested on its general position that \u201c [i]f exhibits were admitted over objection and not offered through a witness,\u201d such exhibits were not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>To be admissible in evidence, a document must be both relevant and authentic. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7\u00a7 401, 901 (2013). \u201cAuthenticity is usually proved by testimony of a witness either \u2018(1) that the thing is what its proponent represents it to be, or (2) that circumstances exist which imply that the thing is what its proponent represents it to be.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>456 Mass. 857, 868 (2010), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, </em>452 Mass. 379, 396 (2008). \u201cThe foundational requirement of authentication is a preliminary question of fact for the trial judge.\u201d Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 901 note, at 256 (2013), citing <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>311 Mass. 278, 281-282 (1942). Authenticity may \u201cbe stipulated or else proved like any other fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaCorte, </em>373 Mass. 700, 704 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">A judge reasonably may determine the relevance of documents by category, but the authenticity of a document, if not stipulated, generally must be decided individually based on the evidence at trial. If authenticity is truly at issue, the document should not be admitted in evidence until the judge has made a preliminary finding of fact that the document is authentic, generally based on the evidence at trial. Therefore, if authenticity were truly at issue, Lorillard is correct that a document should not have been admitted until its authenticity was established. But the judge reasonably understood that Lorillard\u2019s objections to the vast majority of these documents were not based on authenticity. Before the judge ruled on the admissibility of the various categories of documents, Lorillard\u2019s attorney stated, \u201cWe have stipulated to the authenticity of exhibits that we can in good conscience stipulate to, which means there are only a few that we didn\u2019t stipulate to.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> When Lorillard later filed a \u201cStatement Concerning Objections to Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit List,\u201d along with an attached \u201cspreadsheet showing the status of Lorillard\u2019s objections to [pjlaintiff\u2019s exhibits,\u201d it noted that, unless otherwise indicated on the exhibit spreadsheet, it did \u201cnot have authenticity objections to documents on [pjlaintiff\u2019s [ejxhibit list.\u201d After reviewing the exhibit spreadsheet in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>entirety, we have identified only two exhibits that Lorillard marked as \u201c[a]dmitted over objection\u201d to which Lorillard raised objections based on authenticity: exhibits nos. 307 and 432. Even though the judge provided Lorillard with multiple opportunities to raise and argue specific objections, the only notice Lorillard gave of its objections as to the authenticity of these two documents was in two cells of a thirty-nine page spreadsheet. Therefore, we conclude that Lorillard waived its objection to the authenticity of these two documents. In any event, we have examined these two documents and conclude that there is no reasonable risk that the jury\u2019s verdict regarding the implied warranty of merchantability claim or the judge\u2019s ruling on the G. L. c. 93A claim was affected by the admission of these two exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">i. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s voluntary dismissal of the civil battery claim. </em>The plaintiff alleged that Lorillard committed a civil battery by distributing free Newport cigarettes to Marie when she was a minor, and the claim reached the jury, with question five of the special verdict form asking whether Lorillard committed a civil battery and question six asking whether such a civil battery was a substantial factor in causing Marie to develop lung cancer. After several days of deliberation, the jury submitted the following question to the judge: \u201cIf we are at a 10 to 4 impasse on Question 6, how would you advise us to proceed, or can you give us more information/direction?\u201d The judge responded to the jury: \u201cIf and when you are at an impasse and tell me that, then I will have some further instructions for you.\u201d The jury then sent out a note saying: \u201cWe are at an impasse, and can you give us further instructions.\u201d The plaintiff then orally moved to dismiss with prejudice the civil battery claim, and after argument, the judge allowed the motion over the objection of the defendant and informed the jury that \u201cthe claim of civil battery has been withdrawn from consideration\u201d and that the jury need not answer questions five and six.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Lorillard contends that allowing the dismissal of the claim and informing the jury that they need not decide the questions pertaining to that claim was prejudicial error. We conclude that it was neither error nor prejudicial. The judge acted within her discretion under Mass. R. Civ. R 41 (a) (2), 365 Mass. 803 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>(1974),<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> in allowing the plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss the claim, and once allowed, there was no reason for the jury to devote their time in deliberations to deciding questions that had been rendered moot by the dismissal. Nor do we see how the defendant reasonably could have been prejudiced as to the remaining claims by the jury learning during deliberations that the civil battery questions had been \u201cwithdrawn from consideration.\u201d Finally, allowing the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s civil battery claim did not result in the jury improperly considering evidence no longer relevant to any claim before them, as all the evidence supporting the civil battery claim was also relevant to the plaintiff\u2019s claim of negligence on the theory of negligent distribution. Both claims were premised on Lorillard\u2019s distribution of free samples of its Newport cigarettes to Marie.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">7. <em>Compensatory damages. </em>The defendant contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>award of compensatory damages, even after being reduced by the remittitur, was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The judge granted Lorillard\u2019s motion for remittitur in part, finding that, \u201c[gjiven the extent of [Marie\u2019s] pain, suffering and death,\u201d a compensatory award of $25 million for Marie\u2019s conscious pain and suffering would be \u201cappropriate, reasonable and just,\u201d and that \u201cthe largest reasonable compensatory award for [the plaintiff\u2019s] significant loss is $10 million.\u201d \u201c[A]n award of damages must stand unless to make it or to permit it to stand was an abuse of discretion on the part of the court below, amounting to an error of law.\u201d <em>Mirageas </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>391 Mass. 815, 822 (1984), quoting <em>Bartley </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>317 Mass. 35, 43 (1944). \u201cIt is an error of law if \u2018the damages awarded were greatly disproportionate to the injury proven or represented a miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. 813, 824 (1997), quoting <em>doCanto </em>v. <em>Ametek, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 776, 787 (1975). We find no abuse of discretion; the judge\u2019s remittitur award was not disproportionate to the injuries suffered and did not represent a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">8. <em>The judge\u2019s decision under G. L. c. 93A. </em>On at least two separate grounds, the judge found that Lorillard committed unfair or deceptive acts or practices in trade or commerce in violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, and that Lorillard was liable to Marie\u2019s estate under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, because such acts or practices caused her injury. First, the judge found that Lorillard committed a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability and was negligent in the \u201cdesign, marketing, and/or distribution\u201d of its cigarettes. The unfortunate phrasing of this finding of negligence makes the judge\u2019s decision as unclear as the jury\u2019s verdict on this issue, and prevents us from being certain that the judge found Lorillard negligent in the design of its cigarettes. Further, because \u201cthis c. 93A action is limited to events after 1979, when c. 93A was amended, see <em>Hershenow </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Boston, Inc., </em>445 Mass. 790, 797-798 (2006),\u201d the judge could not properly have found that Lorillard\u2019s negligent marketing or distribution of cigarettes to minors caused injury to Marie after 1979, because she was an adult by 1979. Because the judge\u2019s finding of negligence is so unclear, and because a finding of causation arising from negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>marketing or distribution is not supported by the evidence if \u201climited to events after 1979,\u201d we must vacate her negligence finding in its entirety.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Second, the judge found that Lorillard violated G. L. c. 93A because it committed a breach of a duty that it voluntarily assumed when it joined the Frank Statement to research the health hazards of smoking cigarettes and to provide accurate information to its consumers regarding that research. Because we hold that no such duty was voluntarily assumed, see part 3 <em>supra, </em>we conclude that the judge\u2019s finding of a violation of c. 93A cannot rest on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">In addition, the judge found that the application of offensive collateral estoppel was fair and adopted certain findings of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in the case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Philip Morris USA, Inc., </em>449 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2006), aff\u2019d in part and rev\u2019d in part, 566 F.3d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 2009), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Lorillard Tobacco Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>130 S.Ct. 3502 (2010) <em>(Philip Morris).</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Lorillard argues that the judge erred in applying offensive collateral estoppel because she \u201cnot only failed to recognize the fundamental unfairness of ignoring Lorillard\u2019s many trial victories,\u201d but also never addressed the requirement that the determination of the issues in question be \u201cessential\u201d to the judgment in the prior case.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u201cWhen a State court is faced with the issue of determining the preclusive effect of a Federal court\u2019s judgment, it is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Federal law of res judicata which must be examined.\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Phoenix Inv. Counsel of Boston, Inc., </em>387 Mass. 444, 449 (1982), and cases cited. Here, since the preclusive effect of a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia is at issue, we turn to the Federal law of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In this case, the type of res judicata applied by the judge was issue preclusion in the form of offensive collateral estoppel. \u201cThe offensive use of collateral estoppel \u2018occurs when a plaintiff seeks to prevent a defendant from litigating issues which the defendant has previously litigated unsuccessfully in an action against another party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matter of Cohen, </em>435 Mass. 7, 15 (2001), quoting <em>Bar Counsel </em>v. <em>Bar Overseers, </em>420 Mass. 6, 9 (1995). Under Federal law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201cA party seeking to invoke the doctrine of collateral estoppel must establish that (1) the issue sought to be precluded in the later action is the same as that involved in the earlier action; (2) the issue was actually litigated; (3) the issue was determined by a valid and binding final judgment; and (4) the determination of the issue was essential to the judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-7\"><em>Ramallo Bros. Printing, Inc. </em>v. <em>El D\u00eda, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 86, 90 (1st Cir. 2007), citing <em>Keystone Shipping Co. </em>v. <em>New England Power Co., </em>109 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir. 1997). Further, \u201cin cases where . . . the application of offensive [collateral] estoppel would be unfair to a defendant, a trial judge should not allow the use of offensive collateral estoppel.\u201d <em>Parklane Hosiery Co. </em>v. <em>Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 331 (1979). See <em>Haran </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>398 Mass. 571, 577 (1986), quoting <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Niziolek, </em>395 Mass. 737, 745 (1985) (\u201cWhen determining whether the offensive use of collateral estoppel has afforded a defendant due process, \u2018[f] airness is the decisive consideration\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">We conclude that the first requirement for offensive collateral estoppel was not met in this case: the issues decided in this case are not the same as those decided in the <em>Philip Morris </em>case. As the judge stated, the plaintiff alleged that Lorillard violated G. L. c. 93A in three ways: \u201c(1) it breached the implied warranty of merchantability; (2) it breached a duty, which it voluntarily assumed, to research the health hazards of smoking and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>provide accurate information of the research to the public; and (3) it failed to make a reasonable settlement offer upon receiving [the plaintiff\u2019s] c. 93A demand letter.\u201d The third theory was rejected by the judge and is not contested on appeal. The second theory we reject as a matter of law. See part 3, <em>supra. </em>Thus, the only legally viable theory rests on Lorillard\u2019s allegedly negligent design of Newport cigarettes that were sold in breach of the implied warranty of merchantability.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The issue litigated in <em>Philip Morris </em>was whether the cigarette manufacturer defendants, including Lorillard, \u201cha[d] violated, and continue [d] to violate, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u2018RICO\u2019), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968, by engaging in a lengthy, unlawful conspiracy to deceive the American public about the health effects of smoking and environmental tobacco smoke, the addictiveness of nicotine, the health benefits from low tar, \u2018light\u2019 cigarettes, and their manipulation of the design and composition of cigarettes in order to sustain nicotine addiction.\u201d <em>Philip Morris, supra </em>at 26-27. In short, the issue in <em>Philip Morris </em>was deception, <em>not </em>whether the defendants\u2019 cigarettes as designed were defective and unreasonably dangerous when compared to a reasonable alternative design, or whether the defendants were negligent in designing those cigarettes. Because the claim in <em>Philip Morris </em>was racketeering rather than product liability or negligence, \u201cthe issue sought to be precluded in the later action\u201d is not \u201cthe same as that involved in the earlier action,\u201d <em>Ramallo Bros. Printing, Inc. </em>v. <em>El D\u00eda, Inc., supra, </em>and the application of offensive collateral estoppel is not appropriate.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Considering these errors cumulatively, we conclude that the prudent course is to vacate the judgment on the c. 93A count and remand the case to the judge. We simply are not confident that the judge\u2019s errors regarding Lorillard\u2019s alleged breach of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>voluntarily assumed duty and offensive collateral estoppel did not materially affect her ultimate finding that Lorillard is liable to Marie\u2019s estate under \u00a7 9 for committing an unfair or deceptive act or practice in trade or commerce in violation of \u00a7 2. Moreover, the ambiguity of the judge\u2019s negligence finding and the possibility that the judge found that Marie suffered injury from Lorillard\u2019s negligence after 1979 based on theories of negligence that would not support a causation finding strengthen our prudential conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">On remand, the judge shall determine whether, based solely on the relevant evidence presented at trial, Lorillard violated G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, and, if liability is found under \u00a7 9,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> what actual damages should be awarded to Marie\u2019s estate for injury suffered by her that was caused by the violation of \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> If the judge on remand finds a violation of \u00a7 2 supporting liability under \u00a7 9, the judge shall also determine whether the violation-was wilful or knowing and, if so, whether actual damages should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>be doubled or trebled in accordance with G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the jury\u2019s finding of liability on the claim of wrongful death caused by breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, and affirm the award of compensatory damages, as reduced by the remittitur. We reverse the finding of liability on the claim of wrongful death based on the theory of voluntary undertaking of a duty, and order judgment for the defendant on this claim. We vacate the jury\u2019s findings as to the claim of wrongful death on the theory of negligence and their findings that Lorillard was grossly negligent and acted in a manner that was malicious, wilful, wanton, or reckless, and therefore vacate the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages. We remand the case for a new trial on the issue whether Lorillard is liable for any conduct that would give rise to punitive damages under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, and if so, the amount of punitive damages that should be awarded.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We vacate the judge\u2019s finding of liability on the plaintiff\u2019s claim that Lorillard violated G. L. c. 93A and remand the case to the judge for further action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Because Willie Evans, in his capacity as executor of his mother\u2019s estate, is the plaintiff, we refer to him as the plaintiff, and we refer to Marie R.

Dr. Farone also testified that the level of carcinogenic chemicals in the smoke produced by Lorillard\u2019s cigarettes was \u201cexcessive,\u201d in that the increased risk of cancer to an individual who smoked two packages of these cigarettes per day (forty cigarettes per day) vastly exceeds what the State of California views as an acceptable cancer risk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Because our case law does not permit a jury to impose categorical product liability on all cigarettes, and because we conclude that the jury here did not do so, we need not dwell on Lorillard\u2019s argument that Federal law preempts any State law claim that would impose such categorical liability. In <em>Food &amp; Drug Admin, </em>v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>529 U.S. 120, 139 (2000), the United States Supreme Court declared that \u201c[a] ban of tobacco products by the [United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)] would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>. . . plainly contradict congressional policy.\u201d We have just stated that, in a product liability action alleging that a brand of cigarettes was defective in its design, the plaintiff must identify a reasonable alternative design that itself is a cigarette. Therefore, product liability law may not be used in this Commonwealth to categorically impose liability on all cigarette manufacturers. See <em>Kyte </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Inc., </em>408 Mass. 162, 171-172 (1990) (plaintiffs\u2019 claim that cigarette manufacturer committed breach of implied warranty of merchantability by selling cigarettes that were \u201cinherently carcinogenic and addictive\u201d not preempted when, rather than claiming that \u201call cigarettes are bad,\u201d plaintiff relied on \u201cdefect or defects specific to\u201d certain brands produced by defendant).

Parker Co., </em>394 Mass. 534, 544-545 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b471-9\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>413 Mass. 387, 396 (1992), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">\u201cAdmission in evidence of a statement from a treatise of the kind referred to in proposed rule 803 (18), whose authenticity and reliability are shown, which was not written for use in litigation, and which expresses an expert opinion on a subject relevant to the case on trial, will tend to enhance, rather than detract from, the truth-finding function.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\">We therefore need not resolve here whether the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine applies to negligence and product liability torts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Before trial, Lorillard specifically challenged the authenticity of two documents in a motion in limine, and the judge ruled that neither document could be referenced in opening statements, reflecting her understanding that the admissibility of these documents depended on evidence at trial demonstrating their authenticity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Rule 41 (a) (2) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, 365 Mass. 803 (1974), provides in relevant part that \u201can action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff\u2019s instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.\u201d When viewed in context with Mass. R. Civ. P. 41 (a) (1), 365 Mass. 803 (1974), which allows a plaintiff to dismiss his or her action \u201cby filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action,\u201d rule 41 (a) (2) is clearly intended to allow the plaintiff to dismiss his own claim despite a defendant\u2019s opposition to the dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">We find similarly meritless Lorillard\u2019s argument that the judge coerced the jury to return with a verdict rather than a deadlock by instructing the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">\u201cBefore the jury sends me any more notes or asks me any more questions, I plan to take a partial verdict if, and only if, the jury [have] reached a final answer to any of the special verdict questions. So if you have reached a final answer by at least 12 out of the 14 of you on any of the special verdict questions, please so advise the court officer before you send me another note or any other question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">\u201cNow, my advising you of my intention to take a partial verdict of any answers that you have reached a final decision on by 5/6 of you before you send me any more questions or notes is not intended in any way to influence your verdict or to signal <em>whether or how </em>you should decide this case\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Reviewing this instruction in its entirety, it is clear that the judge was cognizant of the risk that her words could have a coercive effect on the jury, and she took precautions to address such a risk. Therefore, we conclude that the judge\u2019s instruction was not coercive and did not result in any prejudice to Lorillard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b483-7\">In <em>Maillet </em>v. <em>ATF-Davidson Co., </em>407 Mass. 185, 190 (1990), we concluded that joint findings of breach of the implied warranty of merchantability and negligence are legally sufficient to constitute a violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2. Because we are remanding the case, we decline, as we did in <em>Maillet, </em>to decide whether liability should be \u201cimposed automatically under G. L. c. 93A whenever a defendant has violated the warranty of merchantability,\u201d even where there is no finding of negligence. See <em>id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\">It is not clear from the judge\u2019s decision whether the adopted findings constitute a separate ground of liability under G. L. c. 93A or simply facts that support the other two grounds. The judge initially declared that these findings \u201cfurnish an independent basis for liability in this case,\u201d but later declared that she adopted these findings as \u201can additional basis in support of [her] conclusions of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">The judge also adopted certain findings of the Florida Supreme Court in <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., </em>945 So. 2d 1246 (Fla. 2006), but the judge later withdrew these findings from her decision regarding the G. L. c. 93A claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\">In addition, the judge did not address whether the findings she adopted were essential to the judgment in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Philip Morris USA, Inc., </em>449 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2006), aff\u2019d in part and rev\u2019d in part, 566 F.3d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 2009), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Lorillard Tobacco Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>130 S. Ct. 3502 (2010). Where the Federal judge\u2019s decision in that case was over 900 pages in length, we cannot assume that the adopted findings were essential. Because we conclude that the offensive use of collateral estoppel was inappropriate here because there was no identity of the issues, we need not decide whether the adopted findings were essential to the racketeering conspiracy judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b486-6\">We note that the plaintiff\u2019s claim under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, survives Marie\u2019s death under G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1, because it is premised on a contractual claim (alleged breach of implied warranty of merchantability) combined with a tort claim \u201cthat is substantively akin to the types of torts within the scope of G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1\u201d (negligence in design causing Marie\u2019s lung cancer and death). <em>Klairmont </em>v. <em>Gainsboro Restaurant, Inc., ante </em>165, 179 (2013) (Klairmont). See <em>Kraft Power Corp. </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>464 Mass. 145, 150 (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Because statutory wrongful death damages under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, do not apply to actions brought under G. L. c. 93A, the judge may award compensatory damages to the plaintiff only in his capacity as executor of Marie\u2019s estate for injuries suffered by Marie that were caused by Lorillard\u2019s actions in violation of c. 93A. See <em>Klairmont, supra </em>at 181. As in <em>Klairmont, </em>the plaintiff filed the instant action in his capacity as executor of his mother\u2019s estate and not in his individual capacity. Therefore, \u201c[w]e do not address whether the plaintiff!] would have a claim under c. 93A if [he] had filed the claim!] as [an] individual!].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180 n.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Further, because the judge has already determined in ordering remittitur that the compensatory award of $25 million \u201cfor all of the harm Marie suffered ... is appropriate, reasonable and just,\u201d we recognize that the judge is unlikely to award compensatory damages under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, in an amount greater than the amount awarded to Marie\u2019s estate by the jury as reduced by the order of remittitur. Unless the judge were to award a greater amount, the award of compensatory damages under G. L. c. 93A cannot affect the total amount owed to Marie\u2019s estate for compensatory damages, because damages may not be duplicative. See <em>Canal Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>406 Mass. 369, 379 n.10 (1990) (\u201cplaintiff suing both for breach of warranty and under c. 93A would be entitled, if successful, to actual damages plus attorneys\u2019 fees, but not to double recovery plus fees\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b487-7\">We note that \u201cthe representatives of a decedent\u2019s estate asserting a claim under c. 93A are entitled to seek, and if successful, recover, multiple damages under c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 11.\u201d <em>Klairmont, supra </em>at 183 n.23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\">To prevail on remand as to Lorillard\u2019s liability for punitive damages, the plaintiff will need to prove that Lorillard committed \u201cgross negligence\u201d or engaged in \u201cmalicious, willful, wanton or reckless conduct,\u201d and that this misconduct caused Marie Evans\u2019s death, before the new jury will even reach the issue of the amount of punitive damages to be awarded. See G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2. The only jury finding we now affirm is that Lorillard is hable for the wrongful death of Marie Evans caused by breach of the implied warranty of merchantability. A new jury would be bound by this finding, but this finding alone does not justify an award of punitive damages under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2 (punitive damages available in wrongful death action if \u201cdecedent\u2019s death was caused by the malicious, willful, wanton or reckless conduct of the defendant or by the gross negligence of the defendant\u201d). Therefore, if the plaintiff seeks to use the first jury\u2019s affirmed finding against Lorillard in the trial on remand, the plaintiff will still need to prove that, in committing a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, Lorillard comitted gross negligence, or malicious, wilful, wanton, or reckless conduct, that caused Marie Evans\u2019s death. In addition, the plaintiff in the trial on remand may also seek to prove that Lorillard is liable for punitive damages for the wrongful death of Marie Evans based on his theories of negligence, provided that he also establishes that the specific negligent conduct that caused Marie Evans\u2019s death also constitutes gross negligence or malicious, wilful, wanton, or reckless conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
