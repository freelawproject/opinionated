Following First American\u2019s denial of coverage, Deutsche Bank instituted this action seeking a judgment declaring that First American has a duty to defend it in Brown\u2019s lawsuit and seeking statutory damages. We transferred the case here on our own motion following Deutsche Bank\u2019s appeal from a Superior Court judge\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of First American.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">On appeal, Deutsche Bank argues that the policy is susceptible to an interpretation that it covers the claims alleged in Brown\u2019s complaint and that two exclusions contained within the policy do not preclude coverage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based on these arguments, Deutsche Bank contends that First American is under a contractual duty to defend it in the Brown lawsuit. In addition, Deutsche Bank renews its claim for damages under G. L. c. 93A due to First American\u2019s alleged violation of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In response, First American argues that the allegations in Brown\u2019s complaint do not trigger its duty to defend because they relate to a predatory lending scheme concerning the validity of the underlying note and not the enforceability of Deutsche Bank\u2019s mortgage interest. Alternatively, First American argues that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>need not defend Deutsche Bank because Brown\u2019s claims are excluded by the policy. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the allegations in Brown\u2019s complaint did not trigger First American\u2019s duty to defend under its title insurance policy, and therefore we affirm the judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\"><em>Background. </em>On June 6, 2006, Accredited Home Lenders, Inc. (Accredited), issued a loan, secured by a first mortgage, to Brown in the amount of $374,400 to purchase her home in the Dorchester section of Boston. Prior to the closing on Brown\u2019s home, Accredited purchased a title insurance policy from First American, which provided coverage to Accredited and its successors and assigns.* **<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thereafter, Accredited sold Brown\u2019s loan and mortgage to Morgan Stanley ABS Capital Incorporated, which then assigned the loan and mortgage to the Morgan Stanley IXIS Real Estate Capital Trust 2006-2, of which Deutsche Bank is the trustee. As trustee, Deutsche Bank is covered by the title insurance policy, a fact that is undisputed by the parties in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In May, 2009, Brown filed an action against Accredited; Deutsche Bank; Saxon Mortgage Services, Inc., the loan servicer; HSBC Mortgage Service, Inc., the servicer of a second loan; GMAC Mortgage Corp., the mortgage broker; Philip Brown, the mortgage broker\u2019s agent; and Barrando Butler, the closing attorney, seeking to void the indebtedness under the promissory note and rescind the mortgage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Her complaint asserts claims for misrepresentation; unconscionability; breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing; tortious interference with contract; violations of G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 63; legal malpractice; intentional infliction of emotional distress; and violations of G. L. c. 93A.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In support of her request for relief, Brown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>alleges that she was \u201cthe victim of a predatory lending scheme,\u201d perpetrated by the named defendants, which involved \u201cunderwriting predatory \u2018stated income\u2019 loans to families in low-income neighborhoods.\u201d She further alleges that the defendants \u201cunilaterally misrepresented [Brown\u2019s] income to justify higher interest rates and higher monthly payments\u201d and coerced her into accepting loans that she could not afford.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Following the institution of Brown\u2019s lawsuit, Deutsche Bank contacted First American to provide notice of the lawsuit and to request that it defend Deutsche Bank\u2019s mortgage interest pursuant to the terms of the title insurance policy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> First American refused coverage because \u201cBrown does not challenge that she granted the mortgage, rather she claims that she was misinformed as to the terms of the note,\u201d and thus the lawsuit did not trigger its duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cThe standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991). There are no material factual disputes in this case, and the only issue is the interpretation of the title insurance policy, which is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Chenard </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., </em>440 Mass. 444, 445 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">2. <em>The scope of a title insurer\u2019s duty to defend. </em>The determinative issue is whether the allegations set forth in Brown\u2019s complaint trigger First American\u2019s duty to defend under the terms of the title insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">In Massachusetts, a general liability insurer has a broad duty to defend an insured in litigation. <em>GMAC Mtge., LLC </em>v. <em>First Am. Title Ins. Co., </em>464 Mass. 733, 738 (2013) <em>(GMAC Mtge.). </em>See <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>460 Mass. 352, 357 (2011) (Metropolitan), quoting <em>A.W. Chesterton Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>445 Mass. 502, 527 (2005). A liability insurer\u2019s duty to defend is determined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>comparing the allegations in the third-party complaint against the provisions of the insurance policy. See <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg. Co., </em>391 Mass. 143, 146 (1984) <em>(Continental). </em>See also <em>Simplex Techs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>429 Mass. 196, 197 (1999). \u201c[I]f the allegations of the complaint are \u2018reasonably susceptible\u2019 of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms, the insurer <em>must </em>undertake the defense\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Continental, supra, </em>quoting <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 318 (1983). See <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., </em>458 Mass. 194, 200 (2010) <em>(Billings), </em>citing <em>Ruggerio Ambulance Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>National Grange Mut. Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass. 794, 796 (2000). Any uncertainty as to whether the pleadings include or are reasonably susceptible to an interpretation that they include a claim covered by the policy terms is resolved in favor of the insured, and the insurer must undertake the defense until it obtains a declaratory judgment of no coverage. <em>Metropolitan, supra </em>at 358-359.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">In the present dispute, the parties assume that this standard for determining a general liability insurer\u2019s duty to defend is equally applicable in the context of title insurance. Because this bears on the outcome of the dispute, we take the opportunity to determine whether that assumption is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Our analysis is guided by our recent decision in <em>GMACMtge., supra. </em>There, we concluded that the \u201cin for one, in for all\u201d rule applicable in the context of general liability insurance does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>apply to title insurance.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 739. That is, a title insurer <em>does not </em>have a duty to defend claims outside the scope of the title insurance policy simply because the insurer has an obligation to defend a claim that is covered by the policy. <em>Id. </em>Significantly, our conclusion was predicated oh the unique purpose of title insurance as compared to general liability insurance. <em>Id. </em>at 740. As we explained, \u201c[A] title insurance policy is not an agreement to guarantee or a warranty of the state of the title. ... It is, rather, an agreement to indemnify the policyholder . . . against loss through defects in title.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739, quoting B. Burke, Title Insurance \u00a7 2.01 [A], at 2-5 (3d ed. Supp. 2012). \u201c[It] narrowly covers defects in, or encumbrances on, titles that are in existence when a policy issues.\u201d <em>GMAC Mtge., supra </em>at 740, citing B. Burke, Title Insurance \u00a7 2.01 [C], at 2-22 to 2-22.1 (3d ed. Supp. 2008). In light of this purpose, we stressed that title insurance is \u201cfundamentally different\u201d from general liability insurance, see <em>id., </em>citing B. Burke, Title Insurance \u00a7 2.01 [B], at 2-16 (3d ed. Supp. 2011), which is \u201cdirected at future risks,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> see <em>id., </em>quoting B. Burke, Title Insurance \u00a7 2.01 [C], at 2-22 (3d ed. Supp. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Based on our reasoning in <em>GMAC Mtge., supra, </em>and the limited purpose of title insurance, we conclude that the broadly applied standard for determining whether a general liability insurer has a duty to defend is inapplicable in the context of title insurance. More precisely, a title insurer <em>does not </em>have a duty to defend simply because the allegations in the underlying complaint are \u201c \u2018reasonably susceptible\u2019 of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms.\u201d <em>Continental, supra </em>at 146, quoting <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., supra </em>at 318, and citing <em>Vappi &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty Co., </em>348 Mass. 427, 431 (1965). Application of this standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>threatens to sweep a whole host of uncontemplated risks into the ambit of title insurance. See <em>GMAC Mtge., supra </em>at 740-741. To avoid such an aberration, we conclude that a title insurer\u2019s duty to defend is triggered only where the policy specifically envisions the type of loss alleged. See <em>Billings, supra </em>at 201, quoting <em>Herbert A. Sullivan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>439 Mass. 387, 394-395 (2003) (\u201cwhen the allegations in the underlying complaint \u2018lie expressly outside the policy coverage and its <em>purpose, </em>the insurer is relieved of the duty to investigate\u2019 or defend the claimant\u201d [emphasis added]). See also <em>Bank of Miami Beach </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. of N.Y., </em>239 So. 2d 97, 99 (Fla. 1970) (holding that in order for claim to be within scope of coverage of title insurance policy, it must be \u201cspecifically\u201d provided for); <em>Pacific Am. Constr. </em>v. <em>Security Union Title, </em>987 P.2d 45, 47-48 (Utah 1999) <em>(Pacific Am.) </em>(losses sustained \u201cdid not result from a failure of the insured lien; they resulted instead from the failure of the underlying debt\u201d). Cf. <em>Somerset Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co., </em>420 Mass. 422, 430 (1995) (\u201ctitle insurance company\u2019s duty to the insured is governed by the terms of the policy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">3. <em>First American\u2019s duty to defend. </em>With this standard in mind, we turn to whether the terms of the title insurance policy specifically envision the type of claims and loss set forth in Brown\u2019s complaint. Deutsche Bank argues that the policy provides coverage insofar as the complaint asserts that \u201cthe entire mortgage transaction \u2014 note and mortgage included \u2014 is voidable because of fraud in the inducement\u201d and seeks to \u201crescind the security interest.\u201d In response, First American argues that the policy does not extend coverage because Brown\u2019s action concerns the invalidity or unenforceability of a third party\u2019s underlying mortgage debt, rather than the security interest. Resolution of the issue requires that we compare the terms of the policy against the allegations in the complaint. See <em>Continental, supra </em>at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">We begin by ascertaining the scope of the insurance policy. \u201cThe interpretation of language in an insurance contract \u2018is no different from the interpretation of any other contract, and we must construe the words of the policy in their usual and ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Metropolitan, supra </em>at 362, quoting <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Century Indem. Co., </em>454 Mass. 337, 355 (2009) <em>{Boston Gas). </em>\u201cEvery word . . . \u2018must be presumed to have been employed with a purpose and must be given meaning and effect whenever practicable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Metropolitan, supra, </em>quoting <em>Boston Gas, supra. </em>If the meaning of the contract language is unclear, we \u201cconsider what an objectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be covered.\u201d <em>Metropolitan, supra, </em>quoting <em>A.W. Chesterton Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>445 Mass. 502, 518 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Here, the pertinent provision of the title insurance policy provides coverage against \u201closs or damage . . . sustained or incurred by the insured by reason of . . . [t]he invalidity or unenforceability of the lien of the insured mortgage upon the title.\u201d This statement of coverage is expressly subject to the policy\u2019s \u201cConditions and Stipulations,\u201d which state, in relevant part, that First American \u201cshall provide for the defense of [Deutsche Bank] in litigation in which any third party asserts a claim adverse to the title or interest as insured, but only as to those stated causes of action alleging a defect, hen or encumbrance or other matter insured against. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These unambiguous provisions are consistent with the limited purpose of title insurance discussed above, namely to provide \u201cprotection against defects in, or hens or encumbrances on, <em>title\u201d </em>(emphasis added). <em>Somerset Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co., supra </em>at 428. Accord <em>Private Lending &amp; Purch., Inc. </em>v. <em>First Am. Title Ins. Co., </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 532, 536 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">In contrast to the protections of the policy, all eight counts in Brown\u2019s complaint are marshaled around her contention that the underlying debt should be voided because she was the \u201cvictim of a predatory lending scheme\u201d perpetrated by the defendants.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Count 1 asserts that the defendants \u201cknowingly or negligently misrepresented material facts of the loan transaction\u201d; count 2 asserts that disparity in bargaining power resulted in \u201cunconscionable loans\u201d; count 3 asserts that the defendant committed a breach of its duty of good faith and fair dealing by \u201crefusing to modify the loan\u201d; count 4 asserts that GMAC and Philip Brown tortiously interfered with the loan contract; count 5 asserts that GMAC and Philip Brown received an undisclosed loan fee due to falsification of Brown\u2019s income; count 6 asserts legal malpractice against Butler because he incorrectly advised Brown that she \u201cqualified for a loan\u201d and \u201cfailed to review the loan documents\u201d; count 7 asserts that the defendants\u2019 predatory scheme caused Brown emotional distress; and count 8 asserts that the transaction was unfair and deceptive because the defendants coerced Brown into accepting an \u201cunaffordable loan.\u201d The substance of her complaint is thus plainly an attack on the underlying debt. Even so, following each count, Brown states that she is entitled to <em>\u201crescind the security interest, </em>void the loan indebtedness and recover actual, consequential, statutory and punitive damages, costs and attorney\u2019s fees\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In her order granting summary judgment in favor of First American, the judge concluded that Brown\u2019s complaint did not trigger First American\u2019s duty to defend because \u201cBrown asserts defects with the underlying mortgage debt . . . rather than defects concerning the execution of the mortgage lien.\u201d In so concluding, the judge relied heavily on the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Bank of Miami Beach </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. of N.Y., </em>239 So. 2d 97 (Fla. 1970). In that case, the court similarly held that a title insurer was not obligated to defend a third-party lawsuit challenging the validity of the promissory note on the basis that it was procured by fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 98-99. In support of its conclusion, the court drew an important distinction between a mortgage lien and a mortgage debt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">\u201c[A] mortgage lien and a mortgage debt are two entirely different legal concepts or \u2018species.\u2019 A provision guaranteeing that the mortgage constituted a \u2018valid mortgage lien\u2019 might be held to cover a loss resulting from fraud, mistake, duress, or misrepresentation in the procurement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>mortgage \u2014 a point that is not presented nor decided here; but such a guarantee of the validity of the mortgage lien cannot and should not be construed as guaranteeing that the insuror has made a careful investigation of the origin of the mortgage debt and guarantees its payment or validity. If such coverage is contemplated, the policy should specifically so provide.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 99. Other courts have also adopted this distinction and held that title insurance does not cover defects in the underlying note. See, e.g., <em>Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>JDC (Am.) Corp., </em>52 F.3d 1575, 1583 (11th Cir. 1995) (\u201cGenerally stated, the provision [at issue] insures against defects in the mortgage itself, but not against problems arising from or related to the underlying debt\u201d); <em>Pacific Am., supra </em>at 47 (losses sustained \u201cdid not result from a failure of the insured lien; they resulted instead from the failure of the underlying debt claim\u201d). See also <em>First Am. Title Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>XWarehouse Lending Corp., 177 </em>Cal. App. 4th 106, 117-118 (2009). We find this authority persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Where the substance of Brown\u2019s complaint is concerned with the validity of the underlying loan and whether it was procured by a \u201cpredatory lending scheme,\u201d not whether the mortgage was improperly executed, improperly recorded, or otherwise procured by fraud,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we conclude that its claims were <em>not </em>specifically envisioned by the terms of the title insurance policy. Consequently, the allegations of the complaint fall outside the scope of the policy. See, e.g., <em>Somerset Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co., </em>420 Mass. 422, 428 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">We also agree with First American that Brown\u2019s attempt to \u201crescind the security interest\u201d is only a collateral consequence of the main relief sought, voiding the loan indebtedness. We are aware that, if Brown prevails and her underlying debt is extinguished, this would have the practical effect of dissolving Deutsche Bank\u2019s mortgage interest, insofar as there would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>no debt to secure. However, given that Deutsche Bank and its predecessors in interest, rather than First American, were in the best position to ensure that the underlying debt was valid, it is for them to bear the burden of any loss. It would be unreasonable to expect First American to \u201cinsure a debt about which it typically would have only limited knowledge and over which the lender would have sole control.\u201d <em>Pacific Am., supra </em>at 47-48. Where, as here, the claims asserted and the losses alleged are not of the type specifically envisioned by the policy, they fall outside the scope of its coverage, and First American does not have a duty to defend Deutsche Bank in the Brown lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The underlying lawsuit also names the following defendants: Accredited Home Lenders, Inc.

There are also instances where, although the allegations in the complaint are susceptible to an interpretation that they are covered by the insurance policy, there is no duty to defend either because (1) \u201cthere is \u2018undisputed, readily knowable, and publicly available information\u2019 in court records that demonstrates that the insurer has no duty to defend,\u201d or (2) \u201cthere is \u2018an undisputed extrinsic fact that takes the case outside the coverage and that will not be litigated at the trial of the underlying action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas.

Co., </em>260 F.3d 54, 63 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Given that title insurance is concerned solely with \u201cdefects in, or encumbrances on, titles that are in existence when a policy issues, title insurers attempt to eliminate or reduce risks prior to the issuance of a title insurance policy.\u201d <em>GMAC Mtge., supra </em>at 740, citing B. Burke, Title Insurance \u00a7 2.01[C], at 2-22 to 2-22.1 (3d ed. Supp. 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\">We read the phrase \u201cother matter[s] insured against\u201d as referring to the other items of coverage enumerated in the general statement of coverage, none of which is relevant to the current lawsuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Although Brown uses the terms \u201cloan\u201d and \u201cmortgage\u201d interchangeably throughout her complaint, the substitution has no substantive effect on the nature of her action. It is clear from context that Brown frequently uses the word \u201cmortgage\u201d in the colloquial sense to refer to the underlying loan, not the security interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b768-8\">We do not construe the complaint to allege that the mortgage instrument itself was forged or that its execution was the product of fraud. Assuming such a claim had been made in the present dispute, it might have been specifically excluded by Exclusion 3(a), which denies coverage to defects created by the insured.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
