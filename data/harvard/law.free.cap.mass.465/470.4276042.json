In doing so, we must consider the extent to which the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>AT&amp;T Mobility LLC </em>v. <em>Concepcion, </em>131 S. Ct. 1740 (2011) 0Concepcion), abrogates our earlier decision in this case, <em>Feeney </em>v. <em>Dell Inc., </em>454 Mass. 192 (2009) <em>(Feeney I), </em>which invalidated the same class action waiver after concluding that the requirement of individual arbitration was \u201ccontrary to the fundamental public policy of the Commonwealth favoring consumer class actions under [the Massachusetts consumer protection statute,] G. L. c. 93A.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">In <em>Concepcion, </em>the Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide whether the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. (2006), \u201cprohibits States from conditioning the enforceability of certain arbitration agreements on the availability of classwide arbitration procedures.\u201d <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1744. In answering that question, the Supreme Court identified two situations in which the FAA will preempt a State law rule: (1) where a State law \u201cprohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim,\u201d and (2) where a State law \u201cdoctrine normally thought to be generally applicable ... is alleged to have been applied in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>a fashion that disfavors arbitration,\u201d and such an application \u201cstand[s] as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the FAA\u2019s objectives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1747, 1748. Because the State rule being challenged in <em>Concepcion </em>\u201cclassified] most collective-arbitration waivers in consumer contracts as unconscionable,\u201d it stood \u201cas an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of [the FAA]\u201d and was therefore preempted. <em>Id. </em>at 1746, 1753, quoting <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Davidowitz, </em>312 U.S. 52, 67 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that <em>Concepcion </em>precludes the invalidation of class waiver provisions in arbitration clauses in consumer contracts, such as the one at issue here, where the reason for invalidation is that such waivers are contrary to the fundamental public policy of the Commonwealth. Because that was our primary reason in <em>Feeney I </em>for invalidating the class waiver provision in the arbitration agreement, <em>Concepcion </em>undoes the principal rationale for our decision in <em>Feeney I. </em>However, we also conclude that the intent of Congress in enacting the FAA was to preserve the availability of an arbitral forum and remedy for the resolution of disputes between parties to a commercial contract, and that it would be contrary to Congressional intent to interpret the FAA to permit arbitration clauses that effectively deny consumers any remedy for wrongs committed in violation of other Federal and State laws intended to protect them. We do not interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Concepcion </em>as indorsing such a result. Accordingly, we conclude that a court is not foreclosed from invalidating an arbitration agreement that includes a class action waiver where a plaintiff can demonstrate that he or she effectively cannot pursue a claim against the defendant in individual arbitration according to the terms of the agreement, thus rendering his or her claim nonremediable. Finally, we conclude that the plaintiffs have met their burden of demonstrating that, in light of the complex nature of their claims and the modest amount of their individual damages, they cannot pursue their statutory claim under the individual claim arbitration process required by the arbitration agreement. Consequently, the arbitration agreement was properly invalidated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>1. <em>Factual and procedural background. </em>A thorough recitation of the facts and procedural history can be found in our earlier opinion in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Feeney I, supra </em>at 193-198.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The plaintiffs, John A. Feeney and Dedham Health and Athletic Complex (Dedham Health), commenced a putative class action against Dell in 2003 alleging that its \u201cdeliberate and systematic practice\u201d of charging and collecting from the plaintiffs and other Massachusetts residents monies falsely characterized as a lawful sales tax on the purchase of optional service contracts for computers constituted \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices\u201d in violation of G. L. c. 93A and regulations issued by the Attorney General of Massachusetts. Dell collected sales tax on the plaintiffs\u2019 respective optional service contracts, totaling $13.65 from Feeney and $215.55 from Dedham Health. Asserting that they and other Massachusetts customers had suffered damages because Dell caused them to pay monies for a \u201ctax\u201d that had not been imposed by any Massachusetts taxing authority, the plaintiffs sought relief under provisions of the consumer protection act providing for class actions, G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9 (2) and 11.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In response, Dell moved to stay the proceedings and to compel arbitration according to the \u201cDell Terms and Conditions of Sale\u201d (terms) and pursuant to the FAA, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4. The terms in effect at the time of the plaintiffs\u2019 purchases contain an arbitration clause compelling arbitration of any claim against Dell (but not binding Dell in connection with any claims it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>have against a customer) and mandating that any such claims be arbitrated on an individual basis. Specifically, the terms provide that claims against Dell \u201carising from or relating to this Agreement\u201d shall be resolved \u201cexclusively and finally\u201d by arbitration, and that the arbitration \u201cwill be limited solely to the dispute or controversy between Customer and Dell.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The effect of these provisions is to prohibit a Dell customer from participating in a class action \u2014 whether by litigation or arbitration \u2014 against Dell.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The plaintiffs responded that the prohibition on class actions in the arbitration clause was unconscionable and undermined \u201cthe very purpose of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act.\u201d The motion to compel arbitration should have been denied, they argued, because, inter alia, the terms unilaterally preclude class actions. A judge in the Superior Court allowed Dell\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and the plaintiffs sought interlocutory review pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par. A single justice of the Appeals Court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Unable to appeal from the decision of the single justice, see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number><em>Ashford </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>421 Mass. 563, 566 567 (1995), Feeney and Dedham Health each filed a claim of arbitration \u201cunder protest\u201d in November, 2004. Their requests for class certification were denied by an arbitrator of the National Arbitration Forum (NAF). Relying on the provisions of the Dell terms and on \u201c[c]lear rules of contract interpretation and construction,\u201d the arbitrator concluded that \u201cclass action relief has been waived, by the parties,\u201d and was not available in the arbitration despite the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201ccompelling arguments in favor of this relief.\u201d The arbitrator conducted a consolidated hearing on the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 individual claims, ruled in favor of the defendants on the merits, and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 respective claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In February, 2008, the plaintiffs moved in the Superior Court to vacate the arbitration award and to reconsider the orders allowing the defendants\u2019 motion to compel arbitration. In turn, the defendants moved to confirm the arbitration award and to dismiss the case. A different judge denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motions, allowed the defendants\u2019 motion, and dismissed the case with prejudice. The plaintiffs appealed, and we granted their application for direct appellate review and issued our first opinion in this case. See <em>Feeney I, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In <em>Feeney I, </em>we reversed the order compelling arbitration and invalidated the arbitration clause, but ordered the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint dismissed without prejudice for failure to state a claim under G. L. c. 93A.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Feeney I, supra </em>at 213-214. Following dismissal on remand, the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint in which they allege facts that, if proved, could constitute a violation of G. L. c. 93A.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>(suggesting plaintiffs\u2019 allegations on appeal could conceivably state claim under G. L. c. 93A if properly pleaded).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>While the case was on remand, the United States Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Concepcion. </em>The defendants filed a renewed motion to confirm the arbitration award of dismissal with prejudice, arguing that <em>Concepcion </em>abrogated our decision in <em>Feeney I. A </em>judge in the Superior Court denied the defendants\u2019 motion, and we granted direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">2. Feeney I. We invalidated the arbitration clause in <em>Feeney I </em>because we concluded that the class action prohibition \u201ccontravenes Massachusetts public policy.\u201d <em>Feeney I, supra </em>at 199, quoting <em>Beacon Hill Civic Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Ristorante Toscano, Inc., </em>422 Mass. 318, 321 (1996) (noting that \u201cit is \u2018universally accepted\u2019 that public policy sometimes outweighs the interest in freedom of contract, and in such cases the contract will not be enforced\u201d). We premised our conclusion in part on \u201cexpressions of three branches of Massachusetts government indicatting] that the public policy of the Commonwealth strongly favors G. L. c. 93A class actions.\u201d <em>Feeney I, supra </em>at 200. Perhaps most importantly, the Legislature expressly provided for class actions in G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9 (2) and 11, and the legislative history of those enactments indicates that the Legislature intended to provide for the vindication of small-value claims. <em>Id., </em>and cases cited. See <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., </em>366 Mass. 688, 697-700 (1975) (Legislature amended c. 93A to allow for private remedies as result of large number of complaints lodged with Attorney General).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Examining the legislative history of G. L. c. 93A, we remarked that on recognizing that \u201ccauses for which advocates cannot be obtained are, in effect, not adjudicadle, \u201d <em>Feeney I, supra </em>at 201, quoting <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., supra </em>at 699, the Legislature amended c. 93A in 1969, see St. 1969, c. 690, to include \u201cprovisions for a minimum recovery, attorney\u2019s fees, treble damages in certain cases, and most relevant to <em>[Feeney I], </em>class actions.\u201d <em>Feeney I, supra, </em>citing <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., supra </em>at 699-700. In doing so, the Legislature recognized that \u201c[t]he right to a class action in a consumer protection case is of particular importance where, as here, aggregation of small claims is likely the only realistic option for pursuing a claim.\u201d <em>Feeney I, supra </em>at 202, citing <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 151, 164 (1985) (\u201cone of the basic purposes\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>of G. L. c. 93A was to provide \u201ca device for vindicating claims which, taken individually, are too small to justify legal action but which are of significant size if taken as a group\u201d). See <em>Amchen Prods., Inc. </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 617 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Dell\u2019s class action prohibition, we concluded, \u201cundermines this policy and, in so doing, defeats \u2018the presumption\u2019 that arbitration provides \u2018a fair and adequate mechanism for enforcing statutory rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Feeney I, supra, </em>quoting <em>Kristian </em>v. <em>Comcast Corp., </em>446 F.3d 25, 54 (1st Cir. 2006). See <em>Feeney I, supra </em>at 203, citing <em>Carnegie </em>v. <em>Household Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 656, 661 (7th Cir. 2004), cert, denied sub nom. <em>H&amp;R Block, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carnegie, </em>543 U.S. 1051 (2005) (\u201crealistic alternative to a class action is not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits, as only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30\u201d). See <em>Dale </em>v. <em>Comcast Corp., </em>498 F.3d 1216, 1224 (11th Cir. 2007) (\u201cCorporations should not be permitted to use class action waivers as a means to exculpate themselves from liability for small-value claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In conclusion, we summarized our holding in <em>Feeney I </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">\u201cWe decline to enforce a prohibition on class actions in a consumer contract where to do so would in effect sanction a waiver of the right to proceed in a class action under G. L. c. 93A. Allowing companies that do business in Massachusetts, with its strong commitment to consumer protection legislation, to insulate themselves from small value consumer claims creates the potential for countless customers to be without an effective method to vindicate their statutory rights, a result clearly at odds with our public policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">In order to assess the extent to which the <em>Concepcion </em>decision undoes our reasoning in <em>Feeney I </em>regarding the validity of class waivers in arbitration clauses of consumer agreements, and whether any of our conclusions in that case have continuing viability, it is first necessary to place <em>Concepcion </em>in the context of six decades of the United States Supreme Court jurisprudence expanding the scope and preemptive effect of the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>3. <em>The Federal Arbitration Act before </em>Concepcion. Congress enacted the FAA in 1925 \u201cin response to widespread judicial hostility to arbitration agreements.\u201d <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1745, citing <em>Hall St. Assocs., LLC </em>v. <em>Mattel, Inc., </em>552 U.S. 576, 581 (2008). Section 2, the \u201cprimary substantive provision of the Act,\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 24 (1983), provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">\u201cA written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In its efforts over time to define the limits of the FAA, the United States Supreme Court has generally expanded the scope and preemptive effect of the statute. In one of its earliest decisions interpreting the FAA, the Supreme Court held in <em>Wilko </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>346 U.S. 427, 437 (1953), overruled by <em>Rodriguez de Quijas </em>v. <em>Shearson/American Express, Inc., </em>490 U.S. 477, 480 (1989), that claims under the Securities Act of 1933 were not subject to arbitration because \u201cthe protective provisions of the Securities Act require the exercise of judicial direction to fairly assure their effectiveness.\u201d Unlike the types of disputes frequently submitted to arbitration at that time, the Court noted that \u201c[djetermination of the quality of a commodity or the amount of money due under a contract is not the type of issue here involved,\u201d and remarked that \u201c[ejven though the provisions of the Securities Act, advantageous to the buyer, apply [in arbitration], their effectiveness in application is lessened in arbitration as compared to judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Wilko </em>v. <em>Swan, supra </em>at 435. See <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1759 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (\u201cInsofar as Congress considered detailed forms of arbitration at all, it may well have thought that arbitration would be used primarily where merchants sought to resolve disputes of fact, not law, under the customs of their industries, where the parties possessed roughly equivalent bargaining power\u201d). Therefore, the Court concluded, a prospective agreement to arbitrate claimed violations of the Securities Act constituted a \u201ccondition, stipula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>tion, or provision binding any person acquiring any security to waive compliance with any provision\u201d of the Securities Act, which the Securities Act itself declared \u201cvoid.\u201d <em>Wilko </em>v. <em>Swan, supra </em>at 430. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77n (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In its next major decision interpreting the FAA, <em>Scherk </em>v. <em>Alberto-Culver Co., </em>417 U.S. 506, 515 (1974), the Supreme Court distinguished <em>Wilko </em>v. <em>Swan, supra, </em>and concluded that disputes under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are subject to arbitration where international conflict-of-laws problems would foreseeably arise in a judicial forum and could be avoided by submitting the dispute to arbitration. The Supreme Court reached this conclusion despite \u201c[ajccepting the premise . . . that the operative portions of the language of the 1933 Act relied upon in <em>Wilko </em>are contained in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Mercury Constr. Corp., supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that the FAA was applicable in both Federal and State courts, stating, \u201cSection 2 [of the FAA] is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary. The effect of the section is to create a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability, applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the Act.\u201d Accordingly, the Court concluded, \u201cCongress can hardly have meant that an agreement to arbitrate can be enforced against a party who attempts to litigate an arbitrable dispute in federal court, but not against one who sues on the same dispute in state court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26 n.34.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">In <em>Southland Corp. </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>465 U.S. 1, 10 (1984), the Court considered whether the FAA preempted a provision of the California Franchise Investment Law that stated, \u201cAny condition, stipulation or provision purporting to bind any person acquiring any franchise to waive compliance with any provision of this law or any rule or order hereunder is void,\u201d insofar as the California Supreme Court had interpreted that provision to require a judicial resolution of a dispute arising under the law. The Court stated, \u201cIn enacting \u00a7 2 of the [FAA], Congress declared a national policy favoring arbitration and withdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>482 U.S. 483 (1987) (holding FAA preempted section of California wage law that mandated judicial forum for resolution of disputes under that law). The Court continued that \u201cthe purpose of the [FAA] was to assure those who desired arbitration and whose contracts related to interstate commerce that their expectations would not be undermined by federal judges, or ... by state courts or legislatures.\u201d <em>Southland Corp. </em>v. <em>Keating, supra </em>at 13, quoting <em>Metro Indus. Painting Corp. </em>v. <em>Terminal Constr. Co., </em>287 F.2d 382, 387 (2d Cir.) (Lumbaid, C.J., concurring), cert, denied, 368 U.S. 817 (1961). In no uncertain terms, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">\u201cWe discern only two limitations on the enforceability of arbitration provisions governed by the [FAA]: they must be part of a written maritime contract or a contract \u2018evidencing a transaction involving commerce\u2019 and such clauses may be revoked upon \u2018grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u2019 We see nothing in the Act indicating that the broad principle of enforceability is subject to any additional limitations under state law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\"><em>Southland Corp. </em>v. <em>Keating, supra </em>at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Next, in <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 614 (1985) <em>{Mitsubishi Motors), </em>the Supreme Court considered whether an antitrust claim under the Sherman Act is properly subject to arbitration where the parties\u2019 contract arises from an international transaction. In ruling that the antitrust claim must be arbitrated according to the agreement, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">\u201cBy agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum. It trades the procedures and opportunity for review of the courtroom for the simplicity, informality, and expedition of arbitration. We must assume that if Congress intended the substantive protection afforded by a statute to include protection against waiver of the right to a judicial forum, that intention will be deducible from text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>or legislative history. . . . Having made the bargain to arbitrate, the party should be held to it unless Congress itself has evinced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Mitsubishi Motors, supra </em>at 635, also rejected the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the function of an award of treble damages under the Clayton Act as a \u201cchief tool in the antitrust enforcement scheme,\u201d see <em>Brunswick Corp. </em>v. <em>Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., </em>429 U.S. 477, 485-486 (1977), \u201ccompel[s] the conclusion that it may not be sought outside an American court.\u201d <em>Mitsubishi Motors, supra. </em>The Court concluded that an award of treble damages, \u201c[njotwithstanding its important incidental policing function,\u201d constituted a private remedy intended to compensate a plaintiff and that there was no reason the plaintiff\u2019s claim for such an award could not be arbitrated. <em>Id. </em>at 635-636.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Importantly, the Court went on to state that \u201cin the event the choice-of-forum and choice-of-law clauses operated in tandem as a prospective waiver of a party\u2019s right to pursue statutory remedies for antitrust violations, we would have little hesitation in condemning the agreement as against public policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637 n.19. However, the Court reasoned that \u201cso long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate its statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum, the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">In <em>Shearson/American Express Inc. </em>v. <em>McMahon, 482 U.S. 220 </em>(1987), the Supreme Court again considered the arbitrability of claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The Court extended its holding in <em>Scherk </em>v. <em>Alberto-Culver Co., supra, </em>to securities claims arising from domestic agreements, reasoning that Congress did not intend to exempt such claims from the FAA. The Court also rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, as it had in <em>Mitsubishi Motors, </em>that the availability of treble damages under RICO served a public purpose and made RICO claims nonarbitrable. It concluded that the plaintiffs \u201cmay effectively vindicate their RICO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>claim in an arbitral forum, and therefore there is no inherent conflict between arbitration and the purposes underlying [the provision authorizing treble damages].\u201d <em>Shearson/American Express Inc. </em>v. <em>McMahon, supra </em>at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s demonstrated reluctance to hold Federal statutory claims to be nonarbitrable, it was only a matter of time before the Court overruled its decision in <em>Wilko </em>v. <em>Swan, supra, </em>which held claims under the Securities Act of 1933 to be nonarbitrable. In <em>Rodriguez de Quijas </em>v. <em>Shearson/American Express, Inc., </em>490 U.S. <em>All, </em>480 (1989), the Court did just that, remarking that the reasoning in <em>Wilko </em>v. <em>Swan </em>was pervaded by \u201cthe old judicial hostility to arbitration.\u201d <em>Rodriguez de Quijas </em>v. <em>Shearson/American Express, Inc., supra, </em>quoting <em>Kulukundis Shipping Co., S/A </em>v. <em>Amtorg Trading Corp., </em>126 F.2d 978, 985 (2d Cir. 1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., </em>500 U.S. 20 (1991) <em>(Gilmer), </em>the Supreme Court continued its practice of holding Federal statutory claims arbitrable, this time ruling that an employee\u2019s claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) may be subject to arbitration. In response to the plaintiff\u2019s argument that \u201cthe ADEA is designed not only to address individual grievances, but also to further important social policies,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 27, the Court remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">\u201cThe Sherman Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, RICO, and the Securities Act of 1933 all are designed to advance important public policies, but . . . claims under those statutes are appropriate for arbitration. \u2018[S]o long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate [his or her] statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum, the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 28, quoting <em>Mitsubishi Motors, supra </em>at 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Addressing for the first time the issue of the availability of class proceedings in arbitration, the Court remarked that \u201ceven if the arbitration could not go forward as a class action or class relief could not be granted by the arbitrator, the fact that the [ADEA] provides for the possibility of bringing a collective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>action does not mean that individual attempts at conciliation were intended to be barred.\u201d <em>Gilmer, supra </em>at 32, quoting <em>Nicholson </em>v. <em>CPC Int\u2019l Inc., </em>877 F.2d 221, 241 (3d Cir. 1989) (Becker, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In <em>Green Tree Fin.

In 2002, Vincent and Liza Concepcion purchased AT&amp;T service, which was advertised as including free cellular telephones. <em>Id. </em>at 1744. After being charged $30.22 in sales tax on the supposedly \u201cfree\u201d telephones, the Concepcions initiated a class action lawsuit in Federal District Court alleging that AT&amp;T had engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>false advertising and fraud.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In response, AT&amp;T moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause in its standard service agreement, which included a class action waiver. Significantly, the arbitration clause provided that in the event the parties proceeded to arbitration and the customer received an award greater than AT&amp;T\u2019s last written settlement offer,</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">AT&amp;T was required to pay the customer a $7,500 minimum recovery and twice the amount of the customer\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Relying on the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Discover Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>36 Cal. 4th 148 (2005) <em>{Discover Bank), </em>the District Court had found that the arbitration provision was \u201cunconscionable because AT&amp;T had not shown that bilateral arbitration adequately substituted for the deterrent effects of class actions,\u201d and accordingly denied AT&amp;T\u2019s motion to compel individual arbitration, instead directing classwide arbitration. <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1744, 1745.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari. <em>Concepcion, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">According to the Supreme Court\u2019s formulation, \u00a7 2 of the FAA \u201cpermits agreements to arbitrate to be invalidated by \u2018generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability,\u2019 but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1746, quoting <em>Doctor\u2019s Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Casarotto, </em>517 U.S. 681, 687 (1996). See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>482 U.S. 483, 492 n.9 (1987). According to the Court, \u201cThe question in this case is whether \u00a7 2 preempts California\u2019s rule classifying most collective-arbitration waivers in consumer contracts as unconscionable.\u201d <em>Concepcion, supra </em>(\u201cWe refer to this rule as the <em>Discover Bank </em>rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The <em>Discover Bank </em>rule, which the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit characterized as \u201ca refinement of the unconscionability analysis applicable to contracts generally in California,\u201d <em>Laster </em>v. <em>AT&amp;T Mobility LLC, </em>584 F.3d 849, 857 (9th Cir. 2009), rev\u2019d sub nom. <em>Concepcion, supra, </em>quoting <em>Shroyer </em>v. <em>New Cingular Wireless Servs., Inc., </em>498 F.3d 976, 987 (9th Cir. 2007), was expressed by the California Supreme Court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201c[W]hen the [class action] waiver [in an arbitration agreement] is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages, and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money, then. . . the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party \u2018from responsibility for [its] own fraud, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>or willful injury to the person or property of another.\u2019 . . . Under these circumstances, such waivers are unconscionable under California law and should not be enforced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><em>Discover Bank, supra </em>at 162, quoting Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1668. The Supreme Court in <em>Concepcion </em>noted that \u201cCalifornia courts have frequently applied this rule to find arbitration agreements unconscionable.\u201d <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1746, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In analyzing whether \u201cthe <em>Discover Bank </em>rule, given its origins in California\u2019s unconscionability doctrine and California's policy against exculpation, is a ground that \u2018exist[s] at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract\u2019 under FAA \u00a7 2,\u201d <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1746, quoting 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and thus saved from FAA preemption, the Supreme Court set forth the following framework for evaluating issues of preemption under the FAA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">\u201cWhen state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA. . . . But the inquiry becomes more complex when a doctrine normally thought to be generally applicable, such as duress or, as relevant here, unconscionability, is alleged to have been applied in a fashion that disfavors arbitration. In <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Thomas, [supra </em>at 492 n.9,] for example, we noted that the FAA\u2019s preemptive effect might extend even to grounds traditionally thought to exist \u2018at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u2019 . . . We said that a court may not \u2018rely on the uniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate as a basis for a state-law holding that enforcement would be unconscionable, for this would enable the court to effect what ... the state legislature cannot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\"><em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1747, quoting <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The Court then began its analysis, noting by way of analogy that the FAA would preempt a hypothetical State rule holding unconscionable or unenforceable as against public policy consumer contracts that restrict the consumer\u2019s right to full discovery \u2014 on the ground that such contracts \u201cenable companies to hide their wrongdoing\u201d and are therefore unlawfully exculpatory \u2014 because \u201c[i]n practice, of course, the rule would have a disproportionate impact on arbitration agreements\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>even though \u201cit would presumably apply to contracts purporting to restrict discovery in litigation as well.\u201d <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1747. The Court offered, as similar examples, State rules \u201cclassifying as unconscionable arbitration agreements that fail to abide by the Federal Rules of Evidence, or that disallow an ultimate disposition by a jury (perhaps termed \u2018a panel of twelve lay arbitrators\u2019 to help avoid preemption).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court rejected the notion that such rules would be \u201capplicable to \u2018any\u2019 contract and thus preserved by \u00a7 2,\u201d even if such rules were at least nominally applicable to both arbitration and litigation. <em>Id. </em>The Court defended such examples as \u201cnot fanciful, since the judicial hostility towards arbitration that prompted the FAA had manifested itself in \u2018a great variety\u2019 of \u2018devices and formulas\u2019 declaring arbitration against public policy.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Robert Lawrence Co. </em>v. <em>Devonshire Fabrics, Inc., </em>271 F.2d 402, 406 (2d Cir. 1959), cert, dismissed, 364 U.S. 801 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Rejecting the Concepcions\u2019 contention that the foregoing examples are \u201ca far cry from this case,\u201d the Court countered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">\u201cThe overarching purpose of the FAA, evident in the text of \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, and 4, is to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms so as to facilitate streamlined proceedings. <em>Requiring the availability of classwide arbitration interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration and thus creates a scheme inconsistent with the </em>FAA\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\"><em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1748. According to the Court in <em>Concepcion, </em>the <em>Discover Bank </em>rule impermissibly interfered with arbitration for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">\u201cAlthough the rule does not require classwide arbitration, it allows any party to a consumer contract to demand it ex post. The rule is limited to adhesion contracts . . . but the times in which consumer contracts were anything other than adhesive are long past. . . . The rule also requires that damages be predictably small, and that the consumer allege a scheme to cheat consumers. . . . The former requirement, however, is toothless and malleable (the Ninth Circuit has held that damages of $4,000 are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>sufficiently small), and the latter has no limiting effect, as all that is required is an allegation. Consumers remain free to bring and resolve their disputes on a bilateral basis under <em>Discover Bank, </em>and some may well do so; but there is little incentive for lawyers to arbitrate on behalf of individuals when they may do so for a class and reap far higher fees in the process. And faced with inevitable class arbitration, companies would have less incentive to continue resolving potentially duplicative claims on an individual basis.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1750.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u201cThe conclusion follows [from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stolt-Nielsen] </em>that class arbitration, to the extent it is manufactured by <em>Discover Bank </em>rather than consensual, is inconsistent with the FAA.\u201d <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1750-1751. \u201cArbitration is a matter of contract, and the FAA requires courts to honor parties\u2019 expectations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1752, citing <em>Rent A Center, West, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>130 S. Ct. 2772, 2774 (2010). While parties may of course agree to class arbitration, class arbitration \u201cis not arbitration as envisioned by the FAA, lacks its benefits, and therefore may not be required by state law.\u201d <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1753.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Finally, in response to an argument made in the dissenting opinion that \u201cclass proceedings are necessary to prosecute small-dollar claims that might otherwise slip through the legal system,\u201d the Court remarked that \u201cStates cannot require a procedure that is inconsistent with the FAA, even if it is desirable for unrelated reasons.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>id. </em>at 1760-1761 (Breyer, J., dissenting). The Court further noted that due in part to the $7,500 plus doubled attorney\u2019s fees \u201cbounty clause\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> provision, \u201cthe claim here was most unlikely to go unresolved,\u201d and the consumers bound by the agreement were \u201c \u2018essentially guarantee^]\u2019 to be made whole,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1753, quoting <em>Laster </em>v. <em>AT&amp;T Mobility LLC, supra </em>at 856 n.9, and that \u201cthe Concepcions were <em>better off </em>under their arbitration agreement with AT&amp;T than they would have been as participants in a class action\u201d (emphasis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>original). <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1753, citing Laster vs. T-Mobile USA, Inc., <em>supra </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Based on the foregoing rationale, the Supreme Court ultimately concluded that \u201c[b]ecause it \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of the Congress,\u2019 . . . California\u2019s <em>Discover Bank </em>rule is preempted by the FAA.\u201d <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1753.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">5. <em>Class waivers after </em>Concepcion. We begin by noting that <em>Concepcion </em>did not render the savings clause in \u00a7 2 a dead letter. While application of the savings clause has been significantly constrained by <em>Concepcion, Stolt-Nielsen, </em>and their predecessors, there must remain circumstances where \u201cgrounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract\u201d may be properly invoked to void an arbitration agreement containing a class waiver. The question we seek to answer today, one that courts across the country have struggled with in the wake of <em>Concepcion, </em>is under what conditions a State court may still invalidate an arbitration agreement containing a class waiver as unconscionable or against public policy without running afoul of the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">We accept that following <em>Concepcion, </em>the inability to aggregate claims does not always mean that the plaintiff has no remedy for a wrong. However, an arbitration clause cannot operate in practice to deny a willing plaintiff any and all practical means of pursuing a claim against a defendant. As the Supreme Court acknowledged in <em>Randolph, supra </em>at 90:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">\u201cIt may well be that the existence of large arbitration costs could preclude a litigant such as [the plaintiff] from effectively vindicating her federal statutory rights in the arbitral forum [thus rendering it unenforceable]. \u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">And as commentators have pointed out, <em>Concepcion </em>did not even cite <em>Randolph, </em>so \u201c[i]t would be quite a stretch to argue that <em>Concepcion </em>cuts off a claimant\u2019s ability to avoid an arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>tion clause by making the sort of case-by-case showing prescribed in <em>Randolph.\u2019'\u2019 </em>Gil\u00edes &amp; Friedman, After Class: Aggregate Litigation in the Wake of <em>AT&amp;T Mobility </em>v. <em>Concepcion, </em>79 U. Chi. L. Rev. 623, 642 &amp; n.92 (2012) (Gil\u00edes &amp; Friedman), citing <em>Shalala </em>v. <em>Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc., </em>529 U.S. 1, 18 (2000) (\u201cThis Court does not normally overturn, or so dramatically limit, earlier authority sub silentio\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">We assume <em>Randolph </em>remains good law on this point, so the question is whether a <em>Randolph-type </em>factual demonstration survives <em>Concepcion </em>where the claims at issue arise under State law rather than Federal law. In <em>Randolph, supra </em>at 83, the plaintiff asserted claims under the Truth in Lending Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and Dell is correct that the \u201cvindication of statutory rights\u201d doctrine advanced in dicta in that case, <em>Mitsubishi Motors, </em>and others, and invoked in <em>In re Am. Express Merchants\u2019Litig., </em>667 F.3d 204 (2d Cir.), cert, granted sub nom. <em>American Express </em>v. <em>Italian Colors Restaurant, </em>133 S. Ct. 594 (2012) <em>(Amex III), </em>and <em>Sutherland </em>v. <em>Ernst &amp; Young LLP, </em>847 F. Supp. 2d 528, 537 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) <em>{Sutherland II), </em>applies only when the rights being asserted arise under a <em>Federal </em>statute. See <em>Kilgore </em>v. <em>KeyBank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n, </em>673 F.3d 947, 961 (2012), aff\u2019d on rehearing, Nos. 09-16703, 10-15934 (9th Cir. 2013) (en banc); Orman vs. Citigroup, Inc., U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 11 Civ. 7086 (DAB), slip op. at 7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 12, 2012) (\u201cUnfortunately for [pjlaintiffs, the entire line of case law in which the vindication of statutory rights analysis was developed deals with federal, as opposed to state, statutory rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">As the court explained in Orman vs. Citigroup, Inc., <em>supra </em>at 8:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">\u201cIndeed, the vindication of statutory rights doctrine has its origins in principles of statutory interpretation and is derived from an inference that Congress did not intend to preempt rights it had created in other federal statutes when it passed the FAA. Thus there is no principled reason to apply the doctrine to bar arbitration of claims grounded in state laws which were not created by Congress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Accordingly, so it is argued, the FAA must be harmonized with conflicting Federal statutes but not conflicting State statutes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>and a properly enacted Federal statute will always trump a conflicting State statute regardless of the intent of the State Legislature to avoid preemption.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Kilgore </em>v. <em>KeyBank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 961; Orman <em>vs. </em>Citigroup, Inc., <em>supra. </em>See also Gil\u00edes &amp; Friedman, <em>supra </em>at 641 (explaining difference between preemption analysis and Federal harmonizing principle).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">This argument, however, misses the point. Harmonization is plainly not the issue. The real issue is whether a State court\u2019s invalidation of an arbitration agreement that effectively precludes consumers from obtaining a remedy to which they are lawfully entitled \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Concepcion, supra </em>(considering likelihood that plaintiffs\u2019 State law claim can be resolved in individual arbitration); <em>In re Checking Account Overdraft Litig. MDL No. 2036, </em>685 F.3d 1269, 1281-1282 (11th Cir. 2012) (concluding FAA did not preempt invocation of State unconscionability doctrine to sever fee-shifting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>provision from arbitration agreement where effect of provision was to prevent bringing of claims).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We do not interpret the FAA so broadly as to deny a consumer any remedy, nor do we discern any such congressional intent. A State court\u2019s invalidation on these grounds survives not because it can be harmonized with the FAA, but because the FAA does not conflict with such a ruling and therefore does not preempt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Even in light of <em>Concepcion, </em>we do not conclude that there is an irreconcilable conflict between the FAA\u2019s interest in ensuring the enforceability of agreements to arbitrate and a State\u2019s interest in voiding contracts that create de facto immunity from private civil liability for violations of State law merely because that immunity was procured through the device of an arbitration clause. A case-specific factual showing of the kind envisioned in <em>Randolph, </em>demonstrating that a particular arbitration agreement would effectively deny a consumer a remedy, would allow a court to conclude that invalidating the agreement would not offend the FAA. If we are wrong, then \u00a7 2\u2019s savings clause is truly a dead letter. See <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1761-1762 (Breyer, J., dissenting), quoting <em>Prima Paint Corp. </em>v. <em>Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </em>388 U.S. 395, 404 n.12 (1967) (\u201cwe have recognized that \u2018[t]o immunize an arbitration agreement from judicial challenge\u2019 on grounds applicable to all other contracts \u2018would be to elevate it over other forms of contract\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Dell understandably focuses its argument on <em>Concepcion's </em>admonition that although, in the absence of class proceedings, \u201csmall-dollar claims . . . might otherwise slip through the legal system,\u201d \u201cStates cannot require a procedure that is inconsistent with the FAA, even if it is desirable for unrelated reasons.\u201d <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1753. Dell argues that this language effectively forecloses the ability of States to refuse to enforce agreements to arbitrate even where such agreements have the effect of completely immunizing a party from private civil liability for wrongdoing. We do not read that statement from <em>Concepcion </em>so broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>A reasonable reading of that statement suggests that it was aimed at the reality, sanctioned in <em>Concepcion, </em>that, without class arbitration, the \u201cclass action waiver will be exculpatory, because most of these small-value claims will go undetected and unprosecuted.\u201d <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Cingular Wireless LLC, </em>648 F.3d 1205, 1214 (11th Cir. 2011) <em>(Cruz). </em>While this result is regrettable, and undercuts one of the primary purposes of class action lawsuits, see <em>Feeney I, supra </em>at 203, <em>Concepcion </em>did not go so far as to say that an arbitration clause may be used as an artifice to create de facto immunity from liability for small claims even where an individual plaintiff recognizes the injury and attempts to bring a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"><em>Concepcion </em>goes to great length to demonstrate the overall fairness of that agreement and the Court\u2019s belief that a consumer could successfully pursue a remedy under the regime it established. See <em>id. </em>at 1753. We agree with the Supreme Court of Missouri that \u201c[tjhis discussion would be superfluous if the majority intended to establish a rule completely preempting all state law unconscionability defenses.\u201d <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Missouri Title Loans, </em>364 S.W.3d 486, 490-491 (Mo.), cert, denied, 133 S. Ct. 191 (2012). This view is further supported by the clear inference that a majority of the Supreme Court did not share the view expressed in Justice Thomas\u2019s concurring opinion that only State law contract defenses \u201cconcerning the formation of the agreement to arbitrate\u201d survive FAA preemption. <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1755 (Thomas, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">As the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit opined in <em>Coneff v. AT&amp;T Corp., </em>673 F.3d 1155, 1159 (9th Cir. 2012), the acknowledgment in <em>Concepcion </em>that some small claims may \u201cslip through the legal system\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">\u201cfocused on a related but different concern [than nonredressability of injury] \u2014 even if the arbitration agreements guaranteed (via fee-shifting provisions) that complaining customers would be made whole with respect to damages and counsel fees, most customers would not bother filing claims because the amounts are too small to be worth the trouble.. . .

This difference is the difference between the situation faced by the Concepcions and that faced by [the plaintiff]. The terms of the arbitration agreement at issue in <em>Concepcion </em>ensured that the Concepcions could bring their claim in arbitration on an individual basis, either representing themselves or with counsel. The fact that a plaintiff in the same situation as the Concepcions might choose not to make a claim for such a small overcharge is not the Court\u2019s concern, even if a class-action lawyer might be eager to bring the case on behalf of all similarly situated plaintiffs, but for the class-action waiver. By contrast, the terms of the arbitration agreement and the cost of discovery in [the plaintiff\u2019s] case preclude her from redressing alleged [Fair Labor Standards Act] violations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\"><em>Sutherland II, supra </em>at 537. Finally, a District Court of Appeal of California reached a similar conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">\u201cPut another way, preemption under <em>Concepcion </em>occurs if the arbitration process would make a prevailing claimant whole, but the amount in dispute is so small that a claimant does not think it worth the effort to pursue relief; preemption does not occur under <em>Concepcion </em>if a claimant lacks the means to pursue a claim in arbitration because the cost of pursuing relief on an individual basis \u2022 \u2014 \u2022 whether in arbitration or court \u2014 exceeds the potential recovery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-9\"><em>Franco </em>v. <em>Arakelian Enters., Inc., </em>211 Cal.

Other courts however, particularly the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, reject even this notion, concluding that <em>Concepcion </em>prohibits a court from invalidating a class waiver provision in an arbitration agreement even where every indication points to claims being nonremediable in the absence of class proceedings.

See <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1746, 1753. Accordingly, the theory that a plaintiff can avoid FAA preemption by \u201cshowing that the invocation of the arbitration clause in a specific case would be exculpatory or would confer de facto immunity upon the defendant\u201d has gained some traction as courts have endeavored to define the scope of <em>Concepcion. </em>See Gil\u00edes &amp; Friedman, <em>supra </em>at 647-648, 651.

There is no disputing that <em>Concepcion </em>represents a watershed moment in FAA jurisprudence, or that it casts doubt on the continued viability of <em>Feeney I </em>as it was written. However, as we have discussed, <em>Concepcion </em>did not completely foreclose the ability of courts to invalidate a class waiver provision where the plaintiff can demonstrate that he or she lacks the ability to pursue a claim against the defendant in individual arbitration according to the terms of the agreement, or put differently, where the class waiver provision has conferred on the defendant de facto immunity from private civil liability for violations of State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">As an initial matter, in rendering our decision in <em>Feeney I, </em>we rejected the notion that a prohibition on class proceedings is \u201cinherent\u201d in an agreement to arbitrate. See <em>Feeney I, supra </em>at 205 (\u201cMoreover, a majority of the Justices of the United States Supreme Court has, at least implicitly, indorsed class arbitrations as consistent with the FAA\u201d). That assumption has proved incorrect. Critical to the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Concepcion </em>is. its belief that \u201c[Requiring the availability of class wide arbitration interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration and thus creates a scheme inconsistent with the FAA.\u201d <em>Concepcion, supra </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>at 1748. In denouncing classwide arbitration and declaring it \u201cinconsistent with the FAA,\u201d the Supreme Court was building on its decision in <em>Stolt-Nielsen, </em>which held that class arbitration may not be compelled where an arbitration agreement does not contemplate it, because the \u201c \u2018changes brought about by the shift from bilateral arbitration to class-action arbitration\u2019 are \u2018fundamental.\u2019 \u201d <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1750, quoting <em>StoltNielsen, supra </em>at 1776. Put simply, in the Court\u2019s view, class arbitration \u201cis not arbitration as envisioned by the FAA, lacks its benefits, and therefore may not be required by state law.\u201d <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1753.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Other than as to its indorsement of class arbitration, <em>Concepcion </em>abrogates <em>Feeney I </em>only insofar as <em>Feeney I </em>held that a prohibition on class actions in a consumer contract will not be enforced \u201cwhere to do so would in effect sanction a waiver of the right to proceed in a class action under G. L. c. 93A.\u201d <em>Feeney I, supra </em>at 205. It is clear, in light of <em>Concepcion, </em>that the FAA preempts a State rule that mandates class proceedings, even where one of the rights being vindicated <em>is </em>the State statutory right to a class proceeding, such as the right set forth in G. L. c. 93A. See <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1753; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>482 U.S. 483 (1987); <em>Southland Corp. </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>465 U.S. 1, 10 (1984); Emilio vs. Sprint Spectrum L.P., U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 11 Civ. 3041 (BSJ) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 2012), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, U.S. Ct. App., No. 12-1223-CV (2d Cir. Jan. 18, 2013) (\u201cTo the extent that ... the [Kansas Consumer Protection Act (KCPA)] creates a non-waiveable right to bring a class action in certain consumer contexts, [Concepcion] dictates that the KCPA is preempted by the FAA\u201d). Essentially, because the FAA prohibits a State from requiring a judicial forum for a particular type of dispute, <em>Concepcion, supra; Marmet Health Care Ctr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>132 S. Ct. 1201, 1203-1204 (2012) (per curiam), and because <em>Stolt-Nielsen </em>prohibits a court from compelling nonconsensual class arbitration, any State law rule guaranteeing class proceedings effectively guarantees a judicial forum, and is preempted by the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">However, where a court determines, following an individualized factual inquiry, that class proceedings are the only viable way for a consumer plaintiff to bring a claim against a defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ant, as may be the case where the claims are complex, the damages are demonstrably small and the arbitration agreement does not feature the safeguards found in the <em>Concepcion </em>agreement, a court may still invalidate a class waiver. In such circumstances, a class waiver may be declared invalid pursuant to the FAA\u2019s savings clause not because the clause violates a public policy favoring class actions (e.g., G. L. c. 93A), but because it violates the public policy against agreements that immunize business defendants from private civil liability for consumer injuries. As we said in <em>Feeney I, </em>\u201cCorporations should not be permitted to use class action waivers as a means to exculpate themselves from liability for small-value claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203, quoting <em>Dale </em>v. <em>Comcast Corp., </em>498 F.3d 1216, 1224 (11th Cir. 2007). That statement remains as true today as it was then. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Mitsubishi Motors, supra </em>at 637 n.19, \u201cin the event the choice-of-forum and choice-of-law clauses operated in tandem as a prospective waiver of a party\u2019s right to pursue statutory remedies for antitrust violations, we would have little hesitation in condemning the agreement as against public policy.\u201d Even though Federal statutory rights were at stake in <em>Mitsubishi Motors, </em>and thus the Court was not speaking in terms of preemption, there is no principled reason to conclude that Congress in enacting the FAA had even the remote intention to prevent a State court from invalidating such an egregiously exculpatory agreement in an adhesive consumer contract merely because it took the form of an arbitration agreement.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The FAA does not confer on businesses carte blanche immunity from private civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>liability for violations of State law, and accordingly, State law efforts aimed at prohibiting such complete immunity are not preempted by the FAA simply because an arbitration agreement is involved. The FAA may be a powerful tool for consumer businesses, but it is not a trump card.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Of course, a plaintiff must prove that a class waiver provision effectively prohibits him from bringing a claim against the defendant. As it did in <em>Feeney I, </em>Dell argues that the plaintiffs \u201chave not made a sufficient showing that the class action mechanism is necessary for them to obtain relief for their statutory rights under G. L. c. 93A.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203. On this point, we said in <em>Feeney I, supra </em>at 204:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">\u201cThe claimed damages here are small (Feeney claims damages of $13.65, and Dedham Health claims damages of $215.55), and we need not engage \u2018in an exhaustive analysis\u2019 to determine that the costs of bringing such claims are \u2018prohibitive.\u2019 <em>Fiser </em>v. <em>Dell Computer Corp., </em>144 N.M. 464, 469 (2008). It is sufficient that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are of a class of disputes that \u2018predictably involve small amounts of damages.\u2019 <em>Discover Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>36 Cal. 4th 148, 162 (2005).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">We continued in a footnote: \u201cIt is therefore not dispositive whether, as the defendants claim, the plaintiffs did not present the motion judge in the Superior Court with proof that their claims were not individually viable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204 n.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">It is clear that following <em>Concepcion\u2019s </em>repudiation of the <em>Discover Bank </em>rule, it is decidedly <em>not </em>sufficient that the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s claims are of a class of disputes that \u2018predictably involve small amounts of damages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Feeney I, supra </em>at 204, quoting <em>Discover Bank, supra </em>at 162. See <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1746, 1750. Nor was our statement correct in <em>Feeney I, supra </em>at 204 n.29, that it was not \u201cdispositive\u201d whether the plaintiffs presented proof that their claims were not individually viable. Even prior to <em>Concepcion, </em>it appeared relatively clear that the party seeking to avoid arbitration bore the burden of proving that his or her claims are nonarbitrable. See <em>Randolph, supra </em>at 90-92 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>(party that \u201cseeks to invalidate an arbitration agreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive\u201d bears burden of \u201cshowing the likelihood of incurring such costs\u201d).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In cases where the prohibitive expense and nonredressability come as a result of a class waiver, <em>Concepcion </em>suggests that a plaintiff can only succeed in avoiding that class waiver where he or she can prove as a matter of fact that the class waiver provision (in conjunction with the other terms of the agreement) effectively prohibits him or her from pursuing a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">We thus must determine whether the plaintiffs here have met the burden on remand of proving that, on the facts of this case, the arbitration agreement and class waiver provision contained in Dell\u2019s terms of service render their claims nonremediable. The judge in the Superior Court who denied Dell\u2019s renewed motion to compel individual arbitration in light of <em>Concepcion </em>apparently placed the burden on Dell to demonstrate that the FAA preempted the order denying its motion to compel individual arbitration that we affirmed in <em>Feeney I. </em>While it may be correct that a party claiming preemption generally bears the burden of proving preemption, see <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Southwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., </em>429 Mass. 478, 491 (1999), and cases cited, it is equally clear that a party seeking to avoid an arbitration agreement must prove that his claims are nonarbitrable. See <em>Randolph, supra </em>at 90-92, citing <em>Gilmer, supra </em>at 26; <em>Shearson/American Express Inc. </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>482 U.S. 220, 227 (1987) (\u201cWe have held that the party seeking to avoid arbitration bears the burden of establishing that Congress intended to preclude arbitration of the statutory claims at issue\u201d). Particularly in light of the foregoing discussion, it is clear that agreements to arbitrate falling within the scope of the FAA are presumptively enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Nevertheless, we are entitled to conclude on appeal that the motion judge was \u201cright for the wrong reason,\u201d <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas Co., </em>413 Mass. 730, 734-735 (1992), and \u201cwe may consider any ground apparent on the record that supports the result reached in the lower court.\u201d <em>Gabbidon </em>v. <em>King, </em>414 Mass. 685, 686 (1993), and cases cited. As the motion judge explained at some length, the record contains more than adequate support for the conclusion that the arbitration agreement in this case confers on Dell de facto immunity from private civil liability for violations of State law, and that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are nonremediable in individual arbitration pursuant to the terms of the agreement. In the words of the motion judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">\u201c[Dell\u2019s] arbitration agreement stands in stark contrast to the AT&amp;T agreement in <em>Concepcion, </em>which had so many pro-consumer incentives that an individual consumer might be better off in arbitration than in class litigation. The Dell Arbitration Clause provides no incentives and simply requires arbitration of all disputes, even those that could not possibly justify the expense in light of the amount in controversy. Dell itself acknowledged that, \u2018it is doubtful that the plaintiffs will pursue the suit if the denial of class action status is sustained on appeal.\u2019 Here, based upon facts \u2014 not unsupported hypothesis \u2014 there is no realistic individual claim arbitration process that the FAA could promote. The Dell Arbitration Clause serves only as an effective prohibition upon class actions involving individual claims in the tens or hundreds of dollars. The facts here differ markedly from those in <em>Concepcion.\u201d </em>(Citations omitted.)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The voluminous record in this case speaks to the complex nature of the claims involved. Unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Concepcion, </em>who made relatively straightforward claims of false advertising and fraud stemming from the collection of sales tax on telephones advertised as \u201cfree,\u201d <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1744, in order to prevail on the merits, the plaintiffs here must prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>that Dell was collecting a facially valid tax from the consumer as part of an improper scheme to shift the burden on repair parts from Dell to the consumer, thus increasing the profits on the optional service contracts. See <em>Feeney I, supra </em>at 213-214. The underlying merit of these claims has been hotly contested over the decade since this litigation began, and their prosecution understandably requires advanced knowledge of the tax codes. That reality, in conjunction with the nominal claimed damages and the absence of any mandatory fee-shifting or bounty provisions, persuades us to conclude that the plaintiffs have met their burden of demonstrating that they cannot pursue their claims in individual arbitration. Compare <em>Amex III, supra </em>at 218, quoting <em>In re American Express Merchant\u2019s Litig., </em>554 F.3d 300, 319 (2d Cir. 2009) (\u201cWe again find \u2018Amex has brought no serious challenge to the plaintiffs\u2019 demonstration that their claims cannot reasonably be pursued as individual actions, whether in federal court or in arbitration\u2019 \u201d), and <em>Sutherland II, supra </em>at 536 (\u201cIn contrast to the facts in <em>Concepcion, </em>[the plaintiff] has demonstrated that she would not be able to obtain representation or vindicate her rights on an individual basis\u201d), and <em>Brewer, supra </em>at 494 (\u201cA claim such as [the plaintiff\u2019s] would require significant expertise and discovery, and it would not be financially viable for an attorney because of the complicated nature of the case and small damages at issue\u201d), with <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1753 (\u201cMoreover, the claim here was most unlikely to go unresolved. . . . Indeed, the District Court concluded that the Concepcions were <em>better off </em>under their arbitration agreement with AT&amp;T than they would have been as participants in a class action . . .\u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Finally, we disagree with the notion that because <em>Stolt-Nielsen </em>prohibits a court from compelling class arbitration where the agreement does not contemplate its availability, a court is powerless to fashion an order that allows for class <em>litigation </em>in the limited circumstances outlined in this opinion. See <em>Homa </em>v. <em>American Express Co., </em>494 Fed. Appx. 191, 197 (3d Cir. 2012), quoting <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1748 (such a result would be \u201cabsolutely inconsistent\u201d with FA A); <em>Cruz, supra </em>at 1213 (\u201cIt would be anomalous indeed if the FAA \u2014 which promotes arbitration \u2014 were offended by imposing upon arbitration non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>consensual procedures that interfere with arbitration\u2019s fundamental attributes, but not offended by the nonconsensual elimination of arbitration altogether\u201d). An arbitral forum may be ill suited to class proceedings, but a judicial forum is not. It is hardly unreasonable to force nonconsensual class litigation on a business defendant where the need for that nonconsensual class litigation stems directly from the defendant\u2019s attempt at absolving itself from liability by promulgating an unconscionable, exculpatory arbitration agreement that denies the right to proceed on a class basis while at the same time providing none of the mitigating features found in the <em>Concepcion </em>agreement. A doctrine that denies enforcement of an agreement to arbitrate in such limited circumstances does not \u201cstand[] as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of Congress\u201d in enacting the FAA. <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 1753. Accordingly, we invalidate the arbitration agreement entirely.

An arbitrator chosen according to an agreed-upon procedure ... no longer resolves a single dispute between the parties to a single agreement, but instead resolves many disputes between hundreds or perhaps even thousands of parties. Under the [American Arbitration Association\u2019s Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations (as effective Oct. 8, 2003)], \u2018the presumption of privacy and confidentiality\u2019 that applies in many bilateral arbitrations \u2018shall not apply in class arbitrations,\u2019. . . thus potentially frustrating the parties\u2019 assumptions when they agreed to arbitrate. The arbitrator\u2019s award no longer purports to bind just the parties to a single arbitration agreement, but adjudicates the rights of absent parties as well. And the commercial stakes of class-action arbitration are comparable to those of class-action litigation . . . even though the scope of judicial review is much more limited. We think that the differences between bilateral and class-action arbitration are too great for arbitrators to presume, consistent with their limited powers under the FAA, that the parties\u2019 mere silence on the issue of class-action arbitration constitutes consent to resolve their disputes in class proceedings.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-12\"><em>Stolt-Nielsen, supra </em>at 1776.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Pursuant to California Rule of Court 8.1105(e)(1), <em>Franco </em>v. <em>Arakelian Enters., Inc., </em>211 Cal.
