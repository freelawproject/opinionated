L. c. 254, \u00a7 14, as amended through St. 2002, c. 400, \u00a7 2 (\u00a7 14), which sets forth procedures for execution and enforcement of bonds to dissolve mechanic\u2019s liens. The plaintiff, NES Rentals, Inc. (NES Rentals), filed an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>in the Superior Court to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien recorded pursuant to G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4, as amended through St. 1996, c. 364, \u00a7 5 (\u00a7 4), on land owned by Berkshire Wind and Power Cooperative Corporation (Berkshire Wind). More than a year later, Maine Drilling and Blasting, Inc. (Maine Drilling), acting as principal debtor, and the surety, Berkley Regional Insurance Company (Berkley), executed and recorded a surety bond to dissolve the lien pursuant to \u00a7 14. The bond named NES Rentals as an obligee. Within ninety days of receiving notice of the bond, NES Rentals served on Maine Drilling and Berkley a motion to amend its original complaint, seeking to include them as defendants in its underlying complaint and to add a claim to enforce the bond against them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">After NES Rentals filed the amended complaint with leave of court, a judge in the Superior Court denied Maine Drilling\u2019s motion to dismiss the amended complaint, explaining that although NES Rentals had not filed the amended complaint within ninety days of receipt of notice of the bond, service of the motion on the defendants within that ninety-day period provided the defendants with actual notice of the action to enforce the bond, and satisfied the \u00a7 14 requirement that a claimant have \u201ccommenced\u201d a civil action within that period in order to enforce the bond. The defendants sought leave to appeal, which was allowed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">We affirm the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, but for reasons different from those relied on by the judge. We conclude that the term \u201ccommenced\u201d as used in \u00a7 14 contemplates the filing of an action in court in accordance with Mass. R. Civ. P. 3, as amended, 385 Mass. 1215 (1982), and that the commencement requirement in \u00a7 14 is satisfied on the facts of this case because the amendment to the complaint relates back to the date on which NES Rentals filed its original action against Berkshire Wind under Mass. R. Civ. P. 15 (c), 365 Mass. 761 (1974) (rule 15 [c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">1. <em>Background and prior proceedings. </em>NES Rentals alleges that McManus Excavating, Inc., contracted with it to rent equipment for construction use on property owned by Berkshire Wind. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>On April 26, 2010, NES Rentals perfected a mechanic\u2019s lien on the Berkshire Wind property by recording a notice of its contract with McManus, as required by \u00a7 4,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a sworn statement of account that claimed $89,101 as the amount due for the rental equipment, as required by G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 8, as amended by St. 1996, c. 364, \u00a7 9 (\u00a7 8).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On May 25, 2010, NES Rentals filed and recorded its complaint against Berkshire Wind in the Superior Court, seeking to enforce the lien. See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 5, as amended by St. 1996, c. 364, \u00a7 9 (\u00a7 5) (setting forth procedures for enforcement of mechanic\u2019s lien by civil action).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">On April 29, 2011, Maine Drilling<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Berkley recorded a bond in the penal sum of $89,101, thereby dissolving the lien pursuant to \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> NES Rentals received notice of recording <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>of the bond on June 13, 2011, and on August 23, 2011, NES Rentals served on Maine Drilling and Berkley a motion for leave to amend its complaint against Berkshire Wind by adding them as defendants, and asserting against Maine Drilling and Berkley a new claim to enforce the bond. On October 3, 2011, NES Rentals filed its motion to amend with the Superior Court, and Berkshire Wind filed a cross motion to dismiss the lien enforcement action.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">On November 2, 2011, a judge of the Superior Court allowed both the motion of NES Rentals to amend the complaint and Berkshire Wind\u2019s cross motion to dismiss the underlying complaint against it; NES Rentals then filed its amended complaint with the court. Thereafter, Maine Drilling filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on the ground that it was not timely filed in accordance with the terms of \u00a7 14, because the amended complaint, which constituted the action to enforce the bond, was not filed within ninety days after NES Rentals received notice of recording of the bond, that is, by September 11, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The judge denied Maine Drilling\u2019s motion to dismiss the amended complaint. He explained that \u201ceven though the amended complaint was actually not \u2018filed\u2019 within the 90 day period, the defendants had actual notice of it well within that period,\u201d where NES Rentals had served the motion to amend on Maine Drilling and Berkley within that time, and that, therefore, \u201cthe purpose of the statute, i.e., notice to the issuer of the bond within 90 days, was satisfied.\u201d* ***<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Maine Drilling filed an application for leave to prosecute an interlocutory appeal with a single justice of the Appeals Court. That motion was allowed, and we subsequently transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>2. <em>Discussion. </em>In reviewing the denial of a motion to dismiss, we consider the matter de novo, <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Herb Chambers 1-95, Inc., </em>458 Mass. 674, 676 (2011), accepting as true \u201cthe factual allegations in the plaintiff[\u2019s] complaint, as well as any favorable inferences reasonably drawn from them.\u201d <em>Ginther </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 319, 322 (1998), citing <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98 (1977), abrogated on other grounds, <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 635 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">In this case we consider whether amendment of a complaint, originally brought as an action to enforce a lien, by adding a claim to enforce a lien dissolution bond constitutes timely commencement of an action to enforce the bond within the meaning of \u00a7 14. We begin our discussion of the applicable provisions of G. L. c. 254 (mechanic\u2019s lien statute) with the observation that it is the primary purpose of the mechanic\u2019s lien statute \u201cto provide security to contractors, subcontractors, laborers, and suppliers for the value of their services and goods provided for improving the owner\u2019s real estate\u201d through perfection of a mechanic\u2019s lien on the owner\u2019s real estate. <em>Hammill-McCormick Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>399 Mass. 541, 542-543 (1987), citing <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>168 Mass. 467, 469 (1897).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">\u201cAt the same time, the statute contains filing and notice requirements to protect the owner and others with an interest in the property.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>543, and cases cited. The mechanic\u2019s lien statute is \u201cdesigned to ensure that a person searching the land records in a registry of deeds can determine with certainty whether or not title to a particular parcel of land is encumbered by a mechanic\u2019s lien.\u201d <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>LeFrancois Constr. Corp., </em>430 Mass. 663, 668 (2000) <em>(.National Lumber I), </em>citing <em>Pratt &amp; Forrest Co. </em>v. <em>Strand Realty Co., </em>233 Mass. 314, 317-318 (1919). Additionally, because a perfected lien is an encumbrance on the owner\u2019s property, the statute provides for prevention of future liens and dissolution of existing liens by the giving of a bond, see G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 12, as amended through St. 2002, c. 400, \u00a7 1 (\u00a7 12), and \u00a7 14, which benefits \u201can owner of land (or anyone possessing an interest in that land) by furnishing means to keep his title free from liens\u201d and preventing the sale of the land to satisfy a lien.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Warren Bros. Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number><em>Peerless Ins. Co., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 719, 722 (1979), citing <em>Rockwell </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>190 Mass. 439, 440 (1906). Thus, the mechanic\u2019s lien statute both \u201cgoverns the creation, perfection, and dissolution of a mechanic\u2019s lien,\u201d <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>United Cas. &amp; Sur. Ins. Co., </em>440 Mass. 723, 726 (2004) <em>(National Lumber II), </em>citing <em>Ng Bros. Constr. </em>v. <em>Cranney, </em>436 Mass. 638, 644 (2002), and sets forth the procedures for execution and enforcement of a lien dissolution bond. <em>National Lumber II, supra </em>at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">We look to the specific provisions governing creation and perfection of a mechanic\u2019s lien, and the procedures for enforcement of a lien dissolution bond, to decide whether NES Rentals has fulfilled the requirements for enforcement of the bond by timely commencing a civil action. Under \u00a7 4 of the mechanic\u2019s lien statute, a subcontractor furnishing rental equipment for use on land may record a lien on that property, but under G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11, as amended through St. 1996, c. 364, \u00a7 11 (\u00a7 11), \u201c[t]he lien shall be dissolved unless a civil action to enforce it is commenced within ninety days after the filing of the statement required by section eight,\u201d and thereafter \u201cfiled in the registry of deeds and recorded.\u201d G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 5 (delineating procedures for lien enforcement action). There is no question that NES Rentals recorded its lien and timely commenced and recorded a civil action to enforce it in the Superior Court, after recording a \u00a7 8 statement setting forth the amount due for the rental equipment it had furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Section 14 dictates how such a perfected lien may be dissolved by the posting of a bond, and what a subcontractor must do to maintain his security. \u201cAny person in interest may dissolve a lien ... by recording ... a bond ... in a penal sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>equal to the amount of the lien sought to be dissolved,\u201d and a claimant, such as NES Rentals, \u201cmay enforce the bond by a civil action commenced within ninety days after the later of the filing of the statement required by section 8 or receipt of notice of recording of the bond . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 14. The question before us, then, is whether, under this framework, NES Rentals has \u201ccommenced\u201d a civil action by amending its original complaint, and whether the date of commencement, for purposes of \u00a7 14, is the date on which the amended complaint was filed, or whether it relates back to the date of the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">\u201cBecause a mechanic\u2019s lien is purely a creation of statute, we have consistently required exact compliance with the statute in order to create, perfect, and enforce such a lien.\u201d <em>Golden </em>v. <em>General Bldrs. Supply, </em>441 Mass. 652, 654 (2004) <em>(Golden), </em>and cases cited. See <em>National Lumber II, supra </em>at 729, <em>citing National Lumber I, </em>430 Mass, at 666 (just as strict compliance with provisions of statute is required to perfect lien, person in interest may dissolve lien by strictly adhering to statute); <em>Ng Bros. Constr. </em>v. <em>Cranney, supra </em>at 644, citing <em>Mullen Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Lore, </em>404 Mass. 750, 752 (1989) (\u201cThe [mechanic\u2019s lien] statute is strictly construed against the party claiming the lien\u201d). Relying on these rules of strict compliance, Maine Drilling argues that mere service of an unfiled motion to amend a complaint within ninety days of receipt of notice of a lien dissolution bond does not constitute \u201ccommence[ment] \u2019 \u2019 of a civil action to enforce the bond under \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">According to Maine Drilling, NES Rentals did not \u201ccommence []\u201d an action <em>on </em>the bond within <em>ninety </em>days from the date on which it received notice of the recording of the bond, because NES Rentals did not file its amended complaint until November 2, 2011, or even file its motion to amend until October 3, 2011, well beyond ninety days after NES Rentals was served with notice of the bond on June 13, 2011.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">The mechanic\u2019s lien statute does not define the phrase \u201ccivil action commenced,\u201d but its meaning may be discerned from the legislative history of the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number><em>ton, </em>459 Mass. 422, 433 (2011), citing <em>81 Spooner Rd. LLC </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>452 Mass. 109, 115 (2008) (where statute unclear, appropriate to look to statute\u2019s prior versions, development, and progression through Legislature). The phrase \u201ccivil action commenced,\u201d replacing the phrase \u201cpetition in equity filed,\u201d was added by legislation dated November 30, 1973, entitled \u201cAn Act improving the procedure in civil trials and appeals.\u201d St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 320. This act derived from 1973 House Doc. No. 7236, a bill intended \u201cto conform the General Laws of Massachusetts to the Massachusetts rules of civil procedure and the Massachusetts rules of appellate procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">We adopted the Massachusetts rules of civil procedure earlier that year, see <em>National Lumber I, </em>430 Mass, at 670-671; Introduction to Mass. R. Civ. &amp; Mass. R. App. R, 365 Mass. 730 (1974), and we assume that the Legislature was aware of the recently adopted rules when it amended \u00a7 14 in 1973. See <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>AIG Domestic Claims, Inc., </em>461 Mass. 486, 501 (2012), quoting <em>CFM Buckley/North LLC </em>v. <em>Assessors of Greenfield, </em>453 Mass. 404, 412 (2009) (\u201cit. . . must be presumed that the Legislature knew preexisting law and the decisions of this court\u201d). It is apparent from this history that the Legislature intended the meaning of \u201ccivil action commenced\u201d as used in \u00a7 14 of the mechanic\u2019s lien statute to be interpreted consistently with the meaning of those terms in the Massachusetts rules of civil procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">As provided by Rule 3 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, \u201cA civil action is commenced by (1) mailing to the clerk of the proper court... a complaint and an entry fee . . . or (2) filing such complaint and an entry fee with such clerk.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 3, as amended, 385 Mass. 1215 (1982).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See Zobel, The Massachusetts Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure, 59 Mass. L.Q. 115, 115 (1974) (\u201cA civil action is commenced under the new Rules in a very simple manner. A document called a complaint is prepared, which is analogous to the present day declaration or bill in equity .... When the complaint is completed, it may be either filed directly in court or. . . mailed ... to the clerk of court\u201d). We therefore agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>with Maine Drilling that service of a motion to amend the complaint, although providing notice that an amended complaint may be filed upon approval of the court, see Mass. R. Civ. R 15 (a), 365 Mass. 761 (1974), does not constitute commencement of an action within the meaning of \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">However, this conclusion does not end our inquiry. When Maine Drilling and Berkley recorded the lien dissolution bond and provided notice of the bond to NES Rentals, NES Rentals had already commenced a civil action to enforce its lien against Berkshire Wind, in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 5 and ll.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To determine whether NES Rentals has timely commenced an action within the meaning of \u00a7 14, therefore, we must consider whether its amended complaint (seeking enforcement of the bond) relates back to the original complaint (seeking enforcement of the lien) under Mass. R. Civ. P. 15 (c), such that it may enjoy the benefit of the original complaint\u2019s filing date, even though the amended complaint was filed outside the time frames set forth in the mechanic\u2019s lien statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Our adherence to principles of strict statutory construction applicable to the mechanic\u2019s lien statute, \u201cand our insistence on precise compliance with those statutory terms, do[] not mean that the rules of civil procedure are inapplicable to proceedings concerning mechanic\u2019s liens .... Absent some incompatibility between a specific procedural rule and the provisions of the [mechanic\u2019s lien] statute, we will apply and enforce both.\u201d <em>Golden, supra </em>at 655, citing <em>National Lumber I, supra </em>at 670-672.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Under ordinary application of the Massachusetts rules of civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>procedure, the time of filing of an amended complaint relates back to the date the original complaint was filed. See Mass. R. Civ. R 15 (c) (\u201cWhenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment [including an amendment changing a party] relates back to the original pleading\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cMassachusetts practice is more liberal than other jurisdictions in allowing amendments adding or substituting defendants after expiration of a period of limitations.\u201d <em>National Lumber I, supra </em>at 671, citing Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Civ. R 15, Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Civil Procedure at 426 (Lexis 1999). \u201cIn Massachusetts, \u2018where an action has been commenced before the statute of limitations has run, a plaintiff may be allowed to substitute one defendant for another after the statute of limitations has ran against the proposed substitute defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 671-672, quoting <em>Wadsworth </em>v. <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>352 Mass. 86, 89 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">The language of rule 15 (c) has remained unchanged since the enactment of the Massachusetts rales of civil procedure in 1973, which prompted the amendment of the mechanic\u2019s lien statute to conform to the newly adopted rules. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 15 (c), 365 Mass. 761 (1974); 1973 House Doc. No. 7236. Although we assume that the Legislature was aware of the relation back provisions of rale 15 (c) and knew those provisions generally would apply when it added the language \u201ca civil action commenced\u201d to \u00a7 14, see <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>AIG Domestic Claims, Inc., supra </em>at 501, citing <em>CFM Buckley/North LLC </em>v. <em>Assessors of Greenfield, supra, </em>we will not apply the ordinary relation back provisions of rale 15 (c) in circumstances where application of the rale conflicts with the terms or purpose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>mechanic\u2019s lien statute. As we said in <em>Golden, supra </em>at 660-661, and cases cited, \u201cWhere. . . application of the otherwise customary rules of relation back would compromise one of the objectives of a statutory scheme, relation back is not allowed.\u201d We conclude that the objectives of the statutory scheme would not be undermined by permitting ordinary operation of the relation back rule to render NES Rental\u2019s amended complaint timely filed against Maine Drilling and Berkley.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">In <em>National Lumber I, supra </em>at 671-672, we held that a plaintiff who had timely commenced an action to enforce a \u00a7 4 lien against a former property owner could amend the complaint to add the present property owner, even after the statutory period for bringing an enforcement action under \u00a7 11 had expired. As we explained in that case, under rule 15 (c), the action relates back to the date of the commencement of the complaint, and \u00a7 11 does not bar application of rule 15 (c) because \u00a7 11 is not a statute of repose blocking later claims against successive property owners. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">By comparison, in <em>Golden, supra, </em>we held that a counterclaim to enforce a hen, filed after the \u00a7 11 deadline to commence an action on that lien, does not relate back to the date of the complaint filed by the property owner, <em>id. </em>at 661, because \u201callowing for reinstatement of a dissolved lien by later filing of a counterclaim \u2018would effectively give the contractor a period greater than that intended by the Legislature\u2019 in which to enforce the lien.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, quoting <em>Tremont Tower Condominium, LLC </em>v. <em>George B.H. Macomber Co., </em>436 Mass. 677, 684 (2002). As we noted in <em>Golden, supra </em>at 659-660, quoting <em>National Lumber I, supra </em>at 669, relation back in such a case would \u201cwreak havoc with one of the statute\u2019s important purposes, namely, the provision of \u2018an accurate system for recording and identifying encumbrances secured under the mechanic\u2019s lien statute,\u2019 \u201d because a title examiner who found no complaint recorded on a lien within 120 days<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of recording of the \u00a7 8 statement would not be able to rely on the absence of a recorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>complaint at that point in time to establish that the hen had been dissolved and no longer encumbered the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The text and purpose of \u00a7 14 and the mechanic\u2019s hen statute support ordinary application of the relation back provisions of rule 15 (c) to the circumstances of this case. Section 14 states in general terms that \u201c[t]he claimant may enforce the bond by a civil action commenced within ninety days after the later of the filing of the statement required by [\u00a7] 8 or receipt of notice of recording of the bond.\u201d First, as discussed above, the phrase \u201ccivil action commenced,\u201d read in hght of the circumstances of its addition to the statute, permits relation back of an amended complaint to the date of a timely filed original complaint. Moreover, the language \u201ccommenced within ninety days after\u201d does not bar commencement of an action before the ninety-day period, as would result from application of the relation back rules in this case. See <em>Mullen Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Lore, </em>404 Mass. 750, 754-756 (1989) (under \u00a7 11, which provides that hen dissolves unless civil enforcement action is \u201ccommenced within [ninety] days after\u201d filing of \u00a7 8 statement, ninety-day period establishes \u201clatest time at which a hen could be enforced and does not preclude . . . enforcement\u201d prior to filing of \u00a7 8 statement).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Additionally, nothing in the language of \u00a7 14 requires that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>the action to enforce the bond be filed as a new, separate action, rather than as an amendment to an existing action to enforce the lien. Indeed, the statute emphasizes the interconnectedness of the two claims: the bond must itself be \u201cconditioned for the payment of any sum which the claimant may recover on his claim for labor or labor and materials\u201d and the bond \u201cshall not create any rights which the claimant would not have had, or impair any defense which the obligors would have had, in an action to enforce a lien.\u201d G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 14. Furthermore, \u00a7 5, which provides detailed procedural requirements for commencement of an action to enforce a lien, by its terms contemplates amendment of lien enforcement actions, as it includes a provision for adding any \u201cparties in interest,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> a term that is broad enough to include a \u201cperson in interest\u201d who records a \u00a7 14 bond.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> G.

Here, relation back under rule 15 (c) clearly serves this purpose as it permits contractors, subcontractors, laborers, and suppliers to recover on a lien dissolution bond in an amended action to enforce a lien, without having to initiate an entirely new case to determine the same underlying amount due on the lien or to pay duplicative filing fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Permitting bond enforcement actions to relate back to the date of a timely-filed lien enforcement action does not frustrate the statutory objective of ensuring a reliable recording system.

R 15 (c), 365 Mass. 761 (1974) (rule 15 [c]), to permit this claimant to file its amended complaint outside of the ninety-day period within which, under \u00a7 14, a claimant is to enforce a lien dissolution bond,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court today overlooks this well-established rule of strict compliance and renders this statutory deadline largely superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">As the court recognizes, an amendment to the complaint that the claimant originally brought to enforce the then undissolved lien may constitute the \u201ccivil action\u201d contemplated in \u00a7 14; the parties agree that an entirely new case need not be brought by a claimant in order to enforce the lien dissolution bond. <em>Ante </em>at note 9. The issue, then, is not \u2014 as the court\u2019s statutory analysis, <em>ante </em>at 867-869, would suggest \u2014 <em>whether </em>an amended complaint will suffice, but <em>when </em>the amended complaint must be filed. In reliance upon the relation-back provisions of rule 15 (c), the court concludes that it need not be filed within the ninety-day period mandated by \u00a7 14. To the extent that the court justifies this result by suggesting that it permits claimants to recover on a lien dissolution bond \u201cwithout having to initiate an entirely new case,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 869, it answers a question that has not really been asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The question that is before us is whether the claimant\u2019s amended complaint must be \u201ccommenced,\u201d i.e., filed with the court, see <em>Nett </em>v. <em>Bellucci, </em>437 Mass. 630, 643-644 (2002), and Mass. R. Civ. P. 3, as amended, 385 Mass. 1215 (1982), within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>ninety days after the claimant receives notice of the bond.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In applying rule 15 (c) in these circumstances, the court permits an amended complaint, at whatever vague and uncertain point beyond the ninety-day deadline it may ultimately be filed with the court, to take on the date of the original complaint. The court does so because it discerns no incompatibility between the rule and the statute\u2019s express ninety-day requirement. I think otherwise, and conclude that the statute must supersede the rule. See <em>Hermanson </em>v. <em>Szafarowicz, </em>457 Mass. 39, 45 (2010) (\u201cWhere there is such an irreconcilable conflict between a court rule and a statute, the statute supersedes the rule\u201d); <em>Golden, supra </em>at 655 (procedural rules apply \u201c[a]bsent some incompatibility\u201d with statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The upshot of the court\u2019s decision is to render the ninety-day period set forth in the statute largely superfluous, a result that is ordinarily to be avoided. See <em>Trace Constr, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dana Barros Sports Complex, LLC, </em>459 Mass. 346, 352 (2011), quoting <em>Bynes </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Boston, </em>411 Mass. 264, 268 (1991) (\u201cIt is [an] elementary rule of statutory construction that a statute should not be read in such a way as to render its terms meaningless or superfluous\u201d). The ninety-day deadline to enforce a lien dissolution bond will now apply only when a new civil action must be initiated by the claimant, e.g., when a bond is filed in the period after the filing of a lien and before the commence<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>ment of an original civil action to enforce it, or when the dissolution bond is filed before the lien attaches. See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 12, as amended through St. 2002, c. 400, \u00a7 1. As to everyone else,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the date by which such claimants must file an amended complaint is left essentially indeterminate, dependent as it is upon whether leave to amend, whenever sought, will ultimately be granted by a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">It is hard to imagine that this is what the Legislature intended in a statute otherwise replete with precise statutory deadlines with which we have routinely required exact compliance. See <em>Gale </em>v. <em>Blaikie, </em>129 Mass. 206, 209 (1880) (\u201cThe lien is not a common-law right, but a creature of the statute. It can be preserved and enforced only by a strict compliance with the requirements of the statute. There are no equities to be involved in aid of it.\u201d). Certainly, nothing in the language of \u00a7 14 itself suggests that the Legislature intended the ninety-day period to apply only to a limited class of claimants seeking to enforce a lien dissolution bond; it does not on its face exempt from the category of claimants, as the court does, those who previously filed civil actions to enforce a hen. Had the Legislature wished to do so, it could easily have said as much. See <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>421 Mass. 344, 348 (1995) (\u201cwhere the statute is detailed and precise, we regard [an] omission as purposeful\u201d). In the absence of such a provision, the procedural rule regarding relation back of an amended complaint cannot nullify the clear and contradictory statutory deadline. Cf. <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>414 Mass. 663, 665 (1993) (where \u201cthere is a statutory appeal period\u201d it \u201ccannot be overridden by a contrary rule of court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Strict compliance with the express language of the mechanic\u2019s lien statute promotes certainty, uniformity of application, and predictability for all whose interests are affected by it; the vagueness, imprecision and uncertainty introduced by the court\u2019s novel and relaxed approach does those interests no favors. Given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>this, I conclude that rule 15 (c) does not \u201cpeaceably coexist,\u201d <em>Golden, supra </em>at 658, with the express language of \u00a7 14 and the former must yield to the latter. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-6\">\u201cThe claimant may enforce the bond by a civil action commenced within ninety days after the later of the filing of the statement required by section 8 or receipt of notice of recording of the bond.\u201d G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 14, as amended through St. 2000, c. 400, \u00a7 2 (\u00a7 14).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b890-6\">I agree with the court that the mere service of a motion to amend a complaint on an opposing party does not constitute commencement of an action within the meaning of \u00a7 14. <em>Ante </em>at 864.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b890-7\">If the amended complaint is not itself filed with the court within the ninety-day period, the filing with the court in that ninety-day window of the motion to amend the complaint should be deemed to commence the \u00a7 14 civil action. See <em>Nett </em>v. <em>Bellucci, </em>437 Mass. 630, 643-644 (2002). Doing so relieves the claimant from dependence on the speed with which a court may address the motion to amend and leaves in the claimant\u2019s hands the obligation and ability timely to commence the \u00a7 14 civil action. While the claimant must of course factor into the ninety-day window the brief period of time within which an opposing party may serve any opposition papers pursuant to Rule 9A of the Rules of the Superior Court (2012), it remains the case that, by filing the amended complaint or the motion to amend, there is an ascertainable date that is within the statutory timeframe. This is quite unlike the indeterminate date, outside the statutory period, when an amended complaint may be filed in the wake of today\u2019s decision. Here, the claimant did not file either the motion to amend the complaint or the amended complaint itself until well after the ninety-day deadline had passed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Since the statute requires claimants seeking to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien to commence a civil action within a narrow timeframe lest the lien be dissolved, G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11, as amended through St. 1996, c. 364, \u00a7 11, most claimants later seeking to enforce a lien dissolution bond, G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 14, will already have brought a civil action and will likely seek to amend that original complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
