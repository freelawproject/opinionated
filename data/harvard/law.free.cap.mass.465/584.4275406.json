In 2003, Jail Officers and Employees of Suffolk County (union) was formed and is now the union to which all jail officers employed by the sheriff of Suffolk County (sheriff) belong. This union is the appellee in the present case. See <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County </em>v. <em>Jail Officers &amp; Employees of Suffolk County, </em>451 Mass. 698, 698 n.l (2008) <em>{Sheriff of Suffolk County I).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b603-7\">Cordy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsI\">This appeal arises from an action in the Superior Court to enforce an arbitrator\u2019s award of back pay to a jail officer employed and wrongfully discharged by the sheriff of Suffolk County (sheriff). The sheriff appeals from the judge\u2019s ruling that the jail officer, Joseph Upton, had no duty to mitigate his damages by seeking comparable employment. The Jail Officers and Employees of Suffolk County (union), on behalf of Upton, cross appeals from the judge\u2019s decision not to assess statutory postjudgment interest on the arbitrator\u2019s award. Although we conclude that Upton did have a duty to mitigate his damages, we affirm the judgment on the grounds that the sheriff waived this issue by failing to raise it earlier in the proceedings, and that, regardless, she failed to meet her burden of proof on the issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We also affirm the judge\u2019s decision not to assess postjudgment interest on sovereign immunity grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">1. <em>Background. </em>This appeal represents the putative final chapter in a case that, at the time of an earlier decision in 2008, already had a \u201clong and tortuous procedural history.\u201d <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County </em>v. <em>Jail Officers &amp; Employees of Suffolk County, </em>451 Mass. 698, 699 (2008) <em>(Sheriff of Suffolk County I). </em>On December 29, 1999, Upton was discharged from his position as a jail officer at the Nashua Street jail in Boston (jail) following an incident in which Upton allegedly \u201cfiled untimely and then false reports\u201d concerning an assault of an inmate that he witnessed. <em>Id. </em>On Upton\u2019s behalf, the union grieved the termination pursuant to the applicable collective bargaining agreement, and ultimately sought an arbitrator\u2019s review. <em>Id. </em>Following two days of hearings in November and December, 2000, the arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>tor found, inter alia, that Upton had filed \u201cincomplete, misleading or false reports\u201d concerning the assault, but ruled that although the sheriff had \u201cjust cause\u201d to discipline Upton, Upton should not have been discharged. <em>Id. </em>The arbitrator ordered that Upton was to be suspended for six months without pay and then reinstated \u201cwith full back pay and benefits, less any outside earnings and/or unemployment compensation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The sheriff filed an appeal in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11, seeking to vacate the award on the ground that the order reinstating Upton exceeded the arbitrator\u2019s authority because it was contrary to \u201cwell-defined public policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 699-700. The Superior Court confirmed the award. <em>Id. </em>at 700. The sheriff appealed the confirmation to the Appeals Court, which also affirmed the judgment. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County </em>v. <em>Jail Officers &amp; Employees of Suffolk County, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 915 (2004). We denied the sheriff\u2019s application for further appellate review without prejudice, remanding the case to the Appeals Court for reconsideration in light of our decision in <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>443 Mass. 813 (2005), regarding public policy grounds for setting aside arbitration awards. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County I, supra </em>at 700. On remand, the Appeals Court again affirmed the Superior Court judgment confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award, <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County </em>v. <em>Jail Officers &amp; Employees of Suffolk County, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 903 (2007). We then granted the sheriff\u2019s application for further appellate review. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County I, supra </em>at 700. Although we determined that \u201cthe ambiguous record [did] not permit us to answer [the] question [whether public policy requires vacation of the award],\u201d we concluded that \u201ca remand of the case for clarification of the record [was] not possible, and that in the particular circumstances presented, a remand for a new arbitration proceeding would [have been] inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 698-699. By the time of our decision, the arbitrator had died, and it would have been impractical to remand the matter for rehearing before a different arbitrator due to the \u201cunavailability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>of several critical witnesses\u201d almost nine years after Upton had been discharged. <em>Id. </em>at 702 n.5, 703. Accordingly, because it was \u201cobviously necessary to resolve [the] case,\u201d we affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award. <em>Id. </em>at 703. Following our affirmance in a decision released on June 23, 2008, judgment entered in the Superior Court on July 25, 2008, and Upton was reinstated and returned to work in August, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">2. <em>Dispute over back pay award. </em>On his return to work, Upton executed a document under the pains and penalties of perjury declaring that his offset earnings in the nearly nine years since his discharge totaled $14,943. As of August, 2009, the sheriff had not paid Upton any back pay pursuant to the arbitrator\u2019s award. Consequently, on August 24, 2009, the union filed a complaint for contempt in the Superior Court asking that the sheriff be held in contempt for failing to pay back pay pursuant to the 2008 Superior Court judgment confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award. In the unique procedural circumstances of this case, the judge determined to hold an evidentiary hearing, not on the matter of contempt, but rather on the proper calculation of back pay (minus offsets) that Upton was entitled to receive under the terms of the arbitrator\u2019s award, which had continued to accrue during the approximately eight-year period between the time of the award and the date on which Upton was reinstated. Following the hearing, the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and rulings of law. The judge issued a decision on April 12, 2011, ruling that Upton had no duty to mitigate his damages or that, alternatively, the sheriff had failed to meet her burden of proof on the issue of mitigation, such that Upton was owed the full amount of back pay due less only actual earnings and unemployment compensation. The judge further mled that Upton was not entitled to postjudgment interest on the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In addition to recounting the procedural history detailed above, the judge made the following findings of fact. Upton did not work regularly following his discharge from the jail. He did not actively look for a new job due to his belief that he would be reinstated when he continually prevailed at every stage of the litigation. During his period of unemployment, Upton received significant amounts of money from his parents in order to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>bills and take care of his children. In 2000, Upton received $12,930 in unemployment compensation. In January, 2004, Upton represented on an automobile loan application that he was employed at a restaurant in Charlestown where he earned $2,000 per month and had worked for eighteen years. However, in reality, Upton had not worked at that restaurant since before 1991. Upton had trained as a carpenter, and in 2006 and 2007, he worked as a self-employed carpenter earning $5,000 per year. In January, 2007, Upton applied for another automobile loan, stating on the application that he had worked continuously as a carpenter since 2000 and earned $2,400 per month. The judge found that Upton had lied on both loan applications in order to ensure that he received the loans, and that his only earnings in 2006 and 2007 were the $10,000 he made as a carpenter. In January, 2008, Upton worked for two weeks as a bouncer, earning $1,280. He was injured on the job and later received $10,500 in workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">From those findings, the judge identified six items of offset totaling $36,723,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which, when subtracted from the gross back pay due ($431,447.67), meant Upton was owed $394,724.67 in back pay.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge concluded that Upton \u201creasonably believed that he would be returning to work after the [arbitrator\u2019s] award was issued [and,] [therefore, [he had] no duty to mitigate his damages, and must subtract only his actual interim earnings from his gross back pay award.\u201d Alternatively, the judge held that the sheriff had \u201cfailed to show at trial what [Upton] could have earned in a substantially similar full-time position elsewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">3. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Mitigation of damages. </em>Following a bench trial, we review a judge\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard and his conclusions of law de novo. <em>Casavant </em>v. <em>Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd., </em>460 Mass. 500, 503 (2011). <em>City </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>Rentals, LLC </em>v. <em>BBC Co., </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 559, 560 (2011). On appeal, the sheriff challenges the judge\u2019s ruling that Upton had no duty to mitigate his damages or, in the alternative, that the sheriff failed to meet her burden of proof on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">As an initial matter, it is not entirely clear on what basis the judge concluded that Upton \u201c[had] no duty to mitigate his damages,\u201d or what exactly the judge intended that statement to mean. In their briefs before this court, the parties have focused a great deal on the significance of the arbitral award\u2019s silence on the mitigation of damages issue, but it does not appear that the judge considered this fact in reaching his conclusion that no duty existed. While we ultimately agree with the judge\u2019s conclusion that the sheriff failed to meet her burden of proof on the mitigation of damages issue, and also conclude that the sheriff waived the issue, we disagree that Upton had no duty to mitigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">It is a well-established rule that \u201c[w]here one is under contract for personal service, and is discharged, it becomes his duty to dispose of his time in a reasonable way, so as to obtain as large compensation as possible, and to use honest, earnest and intelligent efforts to this end. He cannot voluntarily remain idle and expect to recover the compensation stipulated in the contract from the other party.\u201d <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Royal Worcester Corset Co., </em>200 Mass. 1, 6 (1908) <em>(Maynard). </em>See <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schs. of Quincy, </em>374 Mass. 670, 672 (1978) <em>(Ryan); Mc-Kenna </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Mental Health, </em>347 Mass. 674, 675-676 (1964) <em>(McKenna); </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 350, at 126 (1981). It is further recognized that \u201c[tjhis general principle is applicable to public employees who are reinstated after having been unlawfully discharged.\u201d <em>Ryan, supra </em>(public school teacher). See <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Ciccolo, </em>356 Mass. 555, 559 (1969) (police officer); <em>McKenna, supra </em>(State hospital employee). We see no reason why, as a general matter, this principle should not apply in Upton\u2019s case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">We also disagree with the union\u2019s contention that the arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>tion award\u2019s silence on the mitigation issue necessarily means that no such duty applied to Upton. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the issue of mitigation of damages was raised or contested before the arbitrator, or that he considered or decided the issue in granting the award. The arbitrator\u2019s award simply reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">\u201cUpton\u2019s discharge is revoked and he is suspended for six months with no pay or benefits and without accumulation of seniority during that period of time effective from the original date of discharged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">\u201cThereafter he will be reinstated with full back pay and benefits, less any outside earnings and/or unemployment compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">While there are no reported decisions from courts in the Commonwealth addressing the precise situation where an arbitrator\u2019s award is silent on the duty to mitigate, two cases from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit are instructive. In <em>Automobile Mechanics Local 701 </em>v. <em>Joe Mitchell Buick, Inc., </em>930 F.2d 576 (7th Cir. 1991) <em>(Joe Mitchell Buick), </em>the court held that an arbitrator has the discretion to decide whether an award of reinstatement and repayment for loss of earnings includes in it a duty to mitigate damages. In a case <em>where the employer expressly raised mitigation before the arbitrator, </em>the court reasoned, \u201c[i]t is settled that arbitrators have discretion to decide whether lost earnings should be offset by interim earnings or a failure to mitigate, so that their silence on such issues means that no such offsets are to be made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">However, a slightly different case is presented where neither party raised the issue before the arbitrator. In <em>International Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs, Local No. 841 </em>v. <em>Murphy Co., </em>82 F.3d 185, 186 (7th Cir. 1996) <em>{Murphy Co.), </em>the court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>faced with an arbitrator\u2019s award ordering that a group of union employees who had been fired \u201cbe reinstated to the employment and made whole.\u201d Neither party raised the issue of damages at the arbitration proceeding, which instead \u201cfocused exclusively on the propriety of the firings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The employer argued that the phrase, \u201cmade whole,\u201d was ambiguous and imposed what the employer deemed to be appropriate offsets for interim earnings. <em>Id. </em>at 186-187. While not agreeing with the employer that the award was necessarily ambiguous, the court acknowledged that, \u201c[g]iven the lack of evidence, the arbitrator\u2019s decision to rule on the damages issue is certainly questionable,\u201d and the arbitrator may have exceeded his authority by issuing \u201can award based \u2018upon a matter not submitted\u2019 to the arbitrator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187, quoting 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 11(b) (1994). Nevertheless, the court held the employer waived the offset issue because the employer failed to raise it before the arbitrator, or in the alternative, to challenge the arbitration award within the three-month time period provided by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 12 (1994) (FAA). <em>Murphy Co., supra </em>at 188-190. Although we take no position on the rule of the Seventh Circuit that silence on the issue of mitigation is to be considered an unambiguous statement that no such duty exists, see <em>Murphy Co., supra </em>at 189, citing <em>Joe Mitchell Buick, supra </em>at 578, we agree with the holdings in both <em>Joe Mitchell Buick </em>and <em>Murphy Co. </em>insofar as they take into consideration whether the issue was explicitly raised before the arbitrator, as in <em>Joe Mitchell Buick, supra </em>at 578, or whether any challenge to the award was waived by a failure to raise the issue of mitigation before the arbitrator or, in a timely fashion, to challenge the award as having exceeded the arbitrator\u2019s authority, as in <em>Murphy Co., supra </em>at 188-190.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">Here, the sheriff failed to raise the issue of mitigation of damages before the arbitrator. And, despite the fact that the arbitrator\u2019s award clearly contemplated to a certain extent the question of damages \u2014 as evidenced by its provision for offsets for outside earnings and unemployment compensation \u2014 yet was silent on the issue of mitigation, the sheriff did not raise the mitigation issue as part of her initial challenge to the award pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11, that ultimately culminated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>our decision in <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County I, supra. </em>Like their Federal counterpart, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 12, which requires that challenges to arbitral awards be commenced within three months from the date of the award, G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 12, require that actions to vacate, modify, or correct an arbitral award be commenced within thirty days of the issuance of the award. While the sheriff timely filed her action to vacate the award on the ground that the order to reinstate Upton was contrary to public policy, see <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County I, supra </em>at 699-700, the sheriff raised the mitigation issue for the first time in response to the union\u2019s motion for contempt in the Superior Court, which the union filed in August, 2009, more than eight years after the issuance of the arbitrator\u2019s award. \u201cUnless grounds are urged for vacating, modifying or correcting the award within [the thirty-day period set forth in G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 12], the award becomes virtually impregnable.\u201d <em>Derwin </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>719 F.2d 484, 489 (1st Cir. 1983). Accordingly, the issue is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Even if the mitigation issue were not waived, the union would still prevail. The employer bears the burden of proof on the issue of mitigation of damages. <em>McKenna, supra </em>at 677, and cases cited. An employer meets this burden of proof by proving the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">\u201c(a) one or more discoverable opportunities for comparable employment were available in a location as convenient as, or more convenient than, the place of former employment, (b) the improperly discharged employee unreasonably made no attempt to apply for any such job, and (c) it was reasonably likely that the former employee would obtain one of those comparable jobs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\"><em>Black </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Malden, </em>369 Mass. 657, 661-662 (1976) <em>(Black). </em>Additionally, the employer must show what the employee \u201ccould have earned in other similar work.\u201d <em>Mc-Kenna, supra. </em>This court has not articulated a clear definition of \u201ccomparable employment\u201d in the context of mitigation of damages, apart from opining that comparable employment for a tenured art teacher who had been wrongfully discharged included both tenured and nontenured art teacher positions. See <em>Ryan, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number><em>supra </em>at 676. Accordingly, we turn to other jurisdictions for guidance. In <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Comm\u2019n, </em>458 U.S. 219, 231 (1982), the United States Supreme Court reasoned that an \u201cunemployed or underemployed claimant need not go into another line of work, accept a demotion, or take a demeaning position.\u201d Other jurisdictions have similarly defined comparable employment as employment that offers similar long-term benefits and opportunities for promotion as compared to the original position. See <em>Greenway </em>v. <em>Buffalo Hilton Hotel, </em>951 F. Supp. 1039, 1061 (W.D.N.Y. 1997), aff\u2019d as modified, 143 F.3d 47 (2d Cir. 1998) (\u201cIn order for the work to be comparable or substantially similar, the new position must afford a plaintiff virtually identical promotional opportunities, compensation, job responsibilities, working condition, and status as the former position\u201d). See also <em>Rasimas </em>v. <em>Michigan Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>714 F.2d 614, 624 (6th Cir. 1983), cert, denied, 466 U.S. 950 (1984); <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>United Air Lines, Inc., </em>950 F. Supp. 874, 876 (N.D. Ill. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The sheriff relies on a single case, <em>McKenna, supra, </em>for its statement that \u201c[the discharged employee] is entitled to recover his back salary less what he did in fact earn following his discharge or in the exercise of proper diligence might have earned in another employment,\u201d to argue that she met her burden of proof by \u201cdemonstrating] what Upton actually earned, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence would have earned elsewhere.\u201d This argument is without merit. While that lone excerpt from <em>McKenna </em>does not use the term \u201ccomparable employment,\u201d it is beyond dispute that an employer must demonstrate the availability of \u201ccomparable employment,\u201d not just any employment. See, e.g., <em>Ryan, supra; Black, supra. </em>Given Upton\u2019s occupation as a correction officer, it is simply irrelevant to the issue of mitigation that he may have been able to further offset his lost earnings by working on a more permanent basis as a restaurant employee, carpenter, or bouncer. It is quite clear that the three positions identified by the sheriff are not comparable or remotely similar to Upton\u2019s employment as a correction officer. Further, employment as a restaurant employee, carpenter, or bouncer does not offer the same stability, benefits, or potential for promotion. Accordingly, the judge correctly concluded that the sheriff had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>failed to demonstrate the availability of comparable employment opportunities, or what Upton could have earned in an available comparable position elsewhere.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Presumably recognizing that she has not met her burden of proof of comparable employment opportunities, the sheriff urges this court to adopt the rule set forth in <em>Quint </em>v. <em>A.E. Staley Mfg. Co., </em>172 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir. 1999), that \u201cwhere an employee has remained completely idle following her discharge,\u201d the employer \u201cshould be relieved of any burden to prove the existence of substantially equivalent positions.\u201d The stated rationale behind this rule is that where a discharged employee has declined to seek other employment, it is \u201creasonable to presume that she did so for an articulable reason,\u201d such as her belief \u201cthat a job search would have been futile,\u201d and that she \u201cis likely to be in the better position to explain her preemptive decision to take no action to obtain employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We decline to adopt this rule. First, the <em>Quint </em>decision does not make entirely clear whether the burden shifts from the employer to the employee where the employee \u201chas remained completely idle,\u201d <em>id., </em>and sought <em>no </em>employment of any kind, or instead where the employee has failed to seek <em>comparable employment. </em>See <em>id. </em>(noting employer bears burden \u201c[a]s long as the claimant has made some effort to secure <em>other </em>employment,\u201d but variously stating burden shifts \u201conce an employer has shown that the claimant sought <em>no jobs,\u201d </em>and \u201conce it has been shown that the former employee made no effort to secure <em>suitable </em>employment\u201d [emphases added]). Second, and more importantly, we concur in the view expressed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit that \u201cbasic principles of equity and fairness mandate that the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>of proof must remain on the employer because the employer\u2019s illegal discharge of the employee precipitated the search for another job.\u201d <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Westin Hotel, </em>758 F.2d 1126, 1130 (6th Cir. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">b. <em>Postjudgment interest. </em>The union cross-appeals from the part of the judge\u2019s order denying its request for postjudgment interest. The judge declined to assess postjudgment interest, reasoning that the sheriff is an agency of the Commonwealth entitled to sovereign immunity following the sheriff department\u2019s transfer to the Commonwealth on January 1, 2010, by St. 2009, c. 61, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 26, and postjudgment interest is not available against the Commonwealth in contract claims. <em>C &amp; M Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>396 Mass. 390, 391-392 (1985) <em>(C &amp; M Constr. Co.). </em>The judge did not consider whether the sheriff enjoyed immunity from postjudgment interest prior to the transfer to the Commonwealth. In its brief before this court, the union states without citation that the sheriff did not enjoy sovereign immunity prior to the transfer, and that, because the obligation to pay interest arose prior to the transfer, the sheriff must pay interest from the date of the arbitration award until the date of the transfer on January 1, 2010. See St. 2009, c. 61, \u00a7 6 (\u201cNotwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, all valid liabilities and debts of the office of a transferred sheriff, which are in force on the effective date of this act, shall be obligations of the commonwealth as of that date . . .\u201d). Alternatively, the union argues that two exceptions to the application of sovereign immunity should apply in this case: that even if sovereign immunity would otherwise bar an award of postjudgment interest, the sheriff has waived that immunity by submitting the dispute to arbitration; and that equitable considerations require the awarding of postjudgment interest here, where the sheriff\u2019s continued pursuit of appeals over the better part of one decade has \u201cunduly delayed the proceedings\u201d and resulted in Upton being unreasonably denied his back pay. The sheriff counters that the union\u2019s claim for postjudgment interest is barred because it did not arise until 2011, more than one year after the transfer, when the union first requested postjudgment interest as part of its proposed findings of fact and rulings of law following the bench trial. The sheriff also disputes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>applicability of either of the \u201cexceptions\u201d to immunity against postjudgment interest advanced by the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">In their briefs, neither party addresses at any length or with any citation whether the sheriff actually possessed sovereign immunity prior to the 2010 transfer, and neither party was prepared to argue the matter at oral argument. In a postargument submission, the sheriff takes the position that she was entitled to sovereign immunity at all times relevant to the present litigation, and has not waived her immunity from postjudgment interest. In its response, the union effectively concedes that, absent waiver, the sheriff was indeed entitled to sovereign immunity, and chooses instead to readvance its argument that the sheriff waived immunity from postjudgment interest by agreeing to submit the dispute to arbitration as part of the collective bargaining agreement. Accordingly, we assume without deciding that the sheriff was, as a general matter, entitled to sovereign immunity prior to 2010, see <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 234, 245 (1995), and take up the union\u2019s waiver arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">\u201c[A]n action for interest after judgment is a separate action based upon a statutory right and is not part of the underlying claim on which the judgment is based.\u201d <em>C &amp; M Constr. Co., supra </em>at 391-392. See G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 8. A public entity\u2019s consent to suit on a contract by virtue of entering into that contract does not thus constitute a waiver of immunity from postjudgment interest. <em>C &amp; M Constr. Co., supra. </em>Accordingly, the question becomes \u201cwhether there is any other source of waiver of sovereign immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392. This court has already held that perhaps the most likely potential source, the postjudgment interest statute itself, G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 8, does not effect such a waiver.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>C &amp; M Constr. Co., supra </em>at 393. <em>Broadhurst </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>373 Mass. 720, 726 (1977) (enactment of statute awarding postjudgment interest against Commonwealth in eminent domain cases evidenced legislative intent that G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 8, not be applied to claims against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Commonwealth). Nor does \u201c[t]he primary statutory basis for the waiver of sovereign immunity,\u201d the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258, impose liability on the Commonwealth for postjudgment interest. <em>C &amp; M Constr. Co., supra </em>at 392. See <em>Onofrio </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Health, </em>411 Mass. 657, 658 (1992). Therefore, the general rule is that \u201cthe Commonwealth ... is not liable for postjudgment interest in the absence of a clear statutory waiver of sovereign immunity in that regard.\u201d <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>University of Mass. Med. Ctr., </em>423 Mass. 584, 586 (1996) <em>{Chapman).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The union principally argues that the sheriff waived any immunity from postjudgment interest by agreeing to arbitrate the dispute under the collective bargaining agreement. It cites to only one case on point, <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>Perini Corp., </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 430 (2011), which affirmed the confirmation of an arbitrator\u2019s award of postjudgment interest over a public entity\u2019s<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> claim of sovereign immunity, on the ground that the public entity did not need to specifically consent to postaward interest where it \u201cconsented to be bound by the [arbitrator\u2019s] resolution of the claims involved,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 442, pursuant to a postdispute agreement to arbitrate certain identified claims. <em>Id. </em>at 432. The court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">\u201c[I]n light of the broad authority given to the [arbitrator] in the parties\u2019 [postdispute agreement to arbitrate], and the narrow scope of review provided by the Legislature . . . we believe that [the public entity\u2019s] waiver of sovereign immunity to arbitrate these claims included an implicit waiver from paying interest as part of the relief to be granted by the [arbitrator].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 444. The remainder of the cases cited by the union in support of its .waiver argument do not discuss sovereign immunity at all, and presumably the issue was not raised. See <em>Watertown Firefighters, Local 1347, I.A.F.F., AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Watertown, 316 </em>Mass. 706, 710, 717-718 (1978) (affirming judge\u2019s imposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>of interest on arbitrator\u2019s award against town); <em>Marlborough Firefighters, Local 1714, I.A.F.F., AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Marlborough, </em>375 Mass. 593, 600-601 (1978) (same); <em>Coughlan Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Rockport, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 994, 997-998 (1987) (same); <em>Blue Hills Regional Dist. Sch. Comm. </em>v. <em>Flight, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 459, 471-473 (1980), <em>S.C., </em>383 Mass. 642 (1981) (affirming confirmation of arbitrator\u2019s award of postjudgment interest against school committee); <em>Arlington </em>v. <em>Local 1297, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Firefighters, AFL-CIO, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 874, 875 (1978) (finding error in Superior Court judge\u2019s failure to award interest on judgment confirming arbitrator\u2019s award). Of those cases, the only one that discussed the award of interest in any depth noted that the arbitrator\u2019s award of interest was \u201cnot subject to the statutory provisions which apply to court-awarded interest on contract claims,\u201d and \u201cthe fact that \u2018the award . . . grants relief such that it could not grant or would not be granted by a court . . . shall not be ground for vacating or refusing to confirm the award.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blue Hills Regional Dist. Sch. Comm. </em>v. <em>Flight, supra </em>at 472-473, quoting G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (a) (5). See <em>Superadio Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Winstar Radio Prods., LLC, </em>446 Mass. 330, 339 (2006), quoting <em>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. </em>v. <em>Intel Corp., 9 </em>Cal. 4th 362, 376 (1994) (\u201carbitrators, unless expressly restricted by the agreement or the submission to arbitration, have substantial discretion to determine the scope of their contractual authority to fashion remedies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Here, we need not consider whether or the extent to which the arbitrator legitimately may have awarded postaward interest, or whether such an award would survive a sovereign immunity challenge by the sheriff, since the arbitrator made no such award. See <em>M. O\u2019Connor Contracting, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brockton, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 278, 283-286 (2004) (vacating on sovereign immunity grounds confirmation of arbitrator\u2019s award of multiple damages on G. L. c. 93A claim against municipality). The union indicates in its brief that it seeks a judicial award of postjudgment interest pursuant to G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 8. As our cases clearly indicate, entities entitled to sovereign immunity are not liable for interest under G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 8, absent an unequivocal statutory waiver not present here. See, e.g., <em>Chapman, supra </em>at 586; <em>C &amp; M Constr. Co., supra </em>at 391-393. Accordingly, the union\u2019s waiver argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Alternatively, the union argues that equitable considerations require an award of postjudgment interest where, as they contend occurred here, the employer \u201chas unduly delayed the proceedings such that the employee is deprived of his back pay for an unreasonable length of time.\u201d The cases on which the union relies in support of this argument, <em>Perkins Sch. for the Blind </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>383 Mass. 825 (1981) <em>{Perkins), </em>and <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>359 Mass. 206 (1971), are inapposite. As this court has already recognized, <em>\u201cPerkins </em>did not involve a claim for interest on a judgment [pursuant to G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 8], but rather was a case of unreasonable detention of money due under a contract,\u201d with the difference being \u201cthat in a <em>Perkins </em>situation the interest held to be due is \u2018a remedy based on a contractual obligation of the Commonwealth.\u2019 \u201d <em>C &amp; M Constr. Co., supra </em>at 394, quoting <em>Sargeant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>383 Mass. 808, 814 (1981). Similarly, <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, supra </em>at 208-209, addressed a situation where a department of the city of Boston wrongfully failed to pay medical bills on behalf of patients receiving public assistance despite the fact that \u201c[i]n no instance [was] the Boston department\u2019s obligation to pay for the care in dispute.\u201d Therefore, these two cases have no application here, where the delay in paying money due under an arbitrator\u2019s award owes to the sheriff\u2019s \u201clegitimate appeal\u201d of that award, cf. <em>Chapman, supra </em>at 588, and the interest sought is statutory postjudgment interest. See <em>C &amp; M Constr. Co., supra </em>at 393-394.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-9\">At the time this matter was litigated in the Superior Court, the sheriff of Suffolk County was a woman. Currently, the sheriff of Suffolk County is a man. As a matter of convenience, we will refer to the sheriff of Suffolk County as \u201cshe\u201d in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b604-5\">By the time of the arbitrator\u2019s award in March, 2001, well over six months had elapsed since Upton\u2019s discharge in December, 1999. The effect of the award was thus to provide for Upton\u2019s immediate reinstatement and receipt of back pay. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County I, supra </em>at 699 n.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\">This figure was achieved by adding Upton\u2019s unemployment compensation, his earnings as a carpenter and a bouncer, his worker\u2019s compensation payment, and payments from the city of Boston and the City of Boston Credit Union, of $1,034 and $979, respectively. These two payments were drawn from the sworn statement of offset earnings made by Upton on his return to work at the jail, although their exact nature is unclear from the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Per stipulation of the parties, the gross back pay due to Upton totals $431,447.67 before any offsets are applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b607-8\">In concluding that Upton had no duty to mitigate, the judge relied, at least in part, on language from <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Mental Health, </em>347 Mass. 674, 676-677 (1964) <em>(McKenna), </em>stating that \u201cthere is no judicial penalty\u201d for failure to make an effort to find substitute employment. <em>Id. </em>at 676, quoting Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1039. However, the court in <em>McKenna </em>went on to explain that \u201cif [the employee] fails to make the reasonable effort [to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>find substitute employment] with the result that his injury is greater than it would otherwise have been . . . [t]he law does not penalize his inaction; <em>it merely does nothing to compensate . . . for the loss that he helped to cause by not avoiding it\" </em>(emphasis added). <em>McKenna, supra. </em>The statement that there is no \u201cjudicial penalty\u201d for failing to mitigate one\u2019s damages is thus largely semantic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In addition to the fact the three employment opportunities advanced by the sheriff cannot be considered comparable in any way to Upton\u2019s employment as a correction officer, we reject the sheriff\u2019s attempt to offer Upton\u2019s falsified automobile loan applications as evidence of what Upton could have earned had he worked as a restaurant employee or carpenter on a more permanent, full-time basis. Although the judge considered those loan applications in the context of determining the amount of Upton\u2019s offset earnings, the judge was well within his discretion in finding that the automobile loan applications did not reflect the defendant\u2019s actual income during the relevant period, and the sheriff presented no evidence that the earnings claimed on the applications reasonably approximated what Upton actually would have earned at those jobs if he had held them for the periods that he claimed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b614-6\">General Laws c. 235, \u00a7 8, generally provides for postjudgment interest on judgments \u201crendered upon an award of . . . a committee or referees, or upon the report of an auditor or master, or upon the verdict of a jury or the finding of a justice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The public entity was a joint venture between the Massachusetts Highway Department and the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, formed in connection with the Central Artery/Tunnel project. <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>Perini Corp., </em>79 Mass.
