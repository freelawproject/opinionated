L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, for the killing of John Falcone.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant raises four issues on appeal. First, he argues that the judge erred in permitting statements of the victim to be introduced in evidence for the purpose of establishing the defendant\u2019s motive to kill where the evidence failed to show that the defendant knew of these statements. Second, he contends that his attorney\u2019s failure to request that the jury be specifically instructed on issues relating to eyewitness identification constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Third, the defendant claims that the prosecutor made various improper and prejudicial statements in his closing argument. Fourth, he argues that this court should exercise its authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and order a new trial because the weight of the evidence does not support the verdict, or else reduce his conviction to either murder in the second degree or manslaughter. For the reasons detailed below, we affirm the convictions and, after a complete review of the record, decline to exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial or to reduce the murder conviction to a lesser degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\"><em>Background. </em>The defendant does not challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence at trial, but he does contend that the \u201cverdict was against ... the weight of the evidence,\u201d G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, so we summarize the relevant evidence rather than present the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">1. <em>Before the shooting. </em>In the early morning of August 23, 2004, the victim, a thirty year old white male, along with Anthony Robinson and Mary Beth Hagopian, decided to purchase a \u201ctwenty rock\u201d of \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine. Although a \u201ctwenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>rock\u201d would generally cost twenty dollars, they were able to pool together only fourteen dollars, most of which was contributed by the victim. At 8:08 a.m., according to cellular telephone records, Robinson telephoned the defendant, whom Robinson knew as \u201cG,\u201d and asked to purchase the crack cocaine, telling him he was \u201cshort\u201d the full price. The defendant told Robinson to give him a few minutes and meet him in front of a pizza restaurant that was across the street from a gasoline station on North Main Street in Brockton. Approximately ten minutes later, the defendant arrived at the parking lot in front of the restaurant on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Robinson gave him the fourteen dollars, and the defendant placed an item on the ground that Robinson believed to be crack cocaine. Robinson retrieved the item from the ground, and he, Hagopian, and the victim drove to a park to smoke it with a pipe.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The victim smoked it first and immediately became \u201cvery upset\u201d and said, \u201c[I]t\u2019s not real.\u201d Robinson then smoked it and agreed that the substance was not crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Robinson attempted to telephone the defendant, but the defendant did not answer despite approximately ten to twelve attempts. The defendant answered only when Robinson called him from a different telephone. Robinson explained what had happened, and the defendant said he would \u201cmake it right.\u201d At this point, the victim grabbed the telephone from Robinson and began \u201ccursing\u201d and \u201cthreatening\u201d the defendant, telling him, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to fuck me over. You don\u2019t know who I am.\u201d Robinson, Hagopian, and the victim then returned to the parking lot in front of the pizza restaurant, and waited \u201c[a] half hour, maybe more\u201d for the defendant to arrive and provide them with real crack cocaine. The defendant never arrived. While they were waiting, the victim \u201cgot more upset, more angry,\u201d and started accusing Robinson of \u201cscrew[ing] him.\u201d Their argument became so loud that the police arrived, told Hagopian to go home, and separated Robinson and the victim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The police asked Robinson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>to go north and the victim to go south on North Main Street, and they both complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">At approximately 9:30 a.m., Troy Edmondson was behind an abandoned building on North Main Street between Farrington Street and Prospect Street when he saw the victim, whom he had known for about one week. The victim appeared \u201cpretty mad\u201d and told him that \u201che had got ripped off,\u201d that \u201csomebody beat [him] for fourteen dollars,\u201d and that \u201csome guy named G\u201d \u201csold him soap.\u201d Edmondson told the victim that \u201cG\u201d lived on Prospect Street, but he did not know where. The victim then walked off in the direction of Prospect Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Kirsha Hilliard was living on the third floor of 28 Prospect Street, a \u201ctriple decker\u201d house owned by her parents, who lived on the second floor; Wanda Franklin, the defendant\u2019s mother, lived on the first floor. At approximately 9:45 a.m., Kirsha<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was walking toward her house when she noticed the victim walking \u201cpretty quickly\u201d behind her. After he passed her, she saw him stand right in front of 28 Prospect Street. \u201cHe was just pacing, like, kind of back and forth, looking around. ... He just had this look like he was mad at something.\u201d Kirsha asked the victim why he was standing in front of her house, and he told her that \u201che was looking for G,\u201d and \u201c[h]e said that he wanted his money back.\u201d When she asked him what the money was for, \u201che told [her] that [the defendant] had beat him for some drugs.\u201d Kirsha testified that the victim \u201cthreatened to destroy my mom\u2019s property\u201d by \u201c[a]ny way possible: throwing rocks, whatever he had to do.\u201d In response, Kirsha \u201ctold him that he wasn\u2019t going to do that, and that [the defendant] didn\u2019t live there.\u201d The victim \u201ccalmed down\u201d and asked where he could find the defendant. Kirsha told him to go next door, and he did so. After he was \u201cshooed\u201d away by Kirsha\u2019s neighbors, she saw him walk \u201cdown towards Main Street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">Immediately after her conversation with the victim, Kirsha went inside 28 Prospect Street and spoke with Wanda.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Kirsha <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>testified that she told Wanda that \u201cthis guy came up and was looking for [the defendant] and he wanted his money. And he said that he had just beat him for drugs.\u201d She also told Wanda \u201cthat he said he was going to destroy the house, throwing rocks, \u2018cause he needed to get his money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">According to Wanda\u2019s testimony, \u201c[Kirsha] said that [the defendant] had allegedly sold this white gentleman some fake crack and I had to stop him from throwing rocks at . . . the windows. And I told her . . . I\u2019ll handle that.\u201d Wanda \u201cwent straight to the kitchen\u201d to find her son, where he was sitting with headphones on. Wanda \u201cplucked the earphones [he was wearing] to get his attention.\u201d Wanda asked the defendant, \u201cWhat are you doing outside?\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cWhat do you mean, Ma?\u201d Wanda then gave her son \u201ca look\u201d indicating that she was \u201cnot happy,\u201d and she went to get ready to go to work. Wanda testified that at no point during her conversation with the defendant did she mention any specific information she had obtained from Kirsha.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Moments later, the defendant walked past Kirsha on the front porch and headed down Prospect Street toward Main Street.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At 10:07 a.m., according to cellular telephone records, the defendant telephoned Robinson. Robinson testified that the defendant \u201cwas pretty much yelling,\u201d and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s that white boy you were with? Where the fuck\u2019s that white boy.\u201d Robinson then told the defendant that the victim was \u201cprobably down by\u201d the gasoline station on North Main Street that was across the street from the pizza restaurant where the defendant had provided the fake \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine. Robinson asked the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>ant what happened with \u201cthat thing that we did earlier,\u201d and the defendant told Robinson to \u201close [his] number.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Meanwhile, the victim returned to where Edmondson was sitting behind the abandoned building on North Main Street,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and told Edmondson that he had knocked on the door of the defendant\u2019s house \u201cand said if he didn\u2019t get his money back, he was going to throw a brick through the window.\u201d While they were talking, the defendant walked over to them and loudly asked the victim, \u201cWho the fuck came by my house?\u201d Between the victim and the defendant \u201ca few words were said back and forth,\u201d and this argument lasted for about \u201ctwo or three minutes.\u201d The argument ended when the defendant said something like \u201cyou don\u2019t want none of this, or you don\u2019t want to fuck with this,\u201d and then \u201cwalked around the corner\u201d on North Main Street toward Prospect Street. After four or five minutes, the victim was \u201c[s]till pretty mad,\u201d and Edmondson observed him walk off in the same direction as the defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Edmondson testified that, approximately five minutes after the victim departed, he saw the defendant and the victim from \u201cthe shoulders up,\u201d behind a large mound of dirt that partially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>obstructed his view, running in a yard from Prospect Street toward Farrington Street. However, he could not remember who was running in front or behind. The next thing he heard was gunshots.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">2. <em>The shooting. </em>At 10:18 a.m. on the date in question, Officer Mark Noone of the Brockton school police department received a dispatch for shots fired on Farrington Street. On his arrival, he was pointed to the backyard of 24 Farrington Street, which adjoins some backyards on Prospect Street, where he discovered the victim lying on his back on top of a bicycle. The victim was still alive, but soon died from his wounds. The medical examiner opined that the cause of the victim\u2019s death was a single gunshot wound in which a projectile entered through the victim\u2019s back and exited through his chest, traveling in an upward trajectory through the victim\u2019s body.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Commonwealth\u2019s ballistics expert testified that five discharged nine millimeter cartridge casings were recovered from the area on or near a black automobile parked on the street in front of 18 Farrington Street. He opined that all five shots were fired from the same semiautomatic weapon from that general area. He also testified that he observed five holes in the siding of 24 Farrington Street, four of which were consistent with gunshot damage, and that the angle of these holes was consistent with someone shooting from the area where the spent cartridge casings were recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">The testimony at trial from civilian witnesses to the events immediately leading up to and following the shooting was convoluted, and several of the details appear to contradict each other. Nina Hall, who lived on the first floor of 24 Farrington Street, testified that she was talking on the telephone when she heard three voices, two male and one female, but she was unsure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>whether the female voice came from the telephone or from outside her house. The persons outside were \u201cspeaking loudly,\u201d and she heard one of the men say, \u201cYou came to my house being disrespectful,\u201d and then heard someone say \u201csomething about fifteen dollars and then it was shots fired.\u201d She did not see the shooting itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Robert Fuqua was fourteen years old at the time of the shooting, and he lived at 18 Farrington Street on the second floor with his older brother, Willie. Robert\u2019s bedroom was on the side of the house closest to the driveway of 24 Farrington Street, near where the victim was found. Robert testified that, at approximately 10:15 a.m., he heard two men arguing behind the rear porch of 24 Farrington Street. He heard one man say \u201c[W]here\u2019s my money,\u201d and when he looked out his bedroom window, he saw a man with \u201c[l]ight brown\u201d skin,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cwearing a black hat, a black coat, and blue jean shorts,\u201d who he recalled at trial to be approximately six feet, two inches tall.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Approximately ten minutes later, he heard gunshots coming from \u201cright next to 24 Farrington.\u201d About one minute after he heard the gunshots, he looked out the window and saw the same man described above, who was bent over and moving his arms around. Robert could not identify what was on the ground beneath the man. Robert then saw the man run towards the back fence, \u201ctowards Prospect Street,\u201d holding a black handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">After the first man ran away, Robert saw a second man come up and \u201clook[] over to where the body was laying. And he took off in the same direction as the [first] man.\u201d Robert testified that he believed this second man was shorter than the first man, and that he was \u201cwearing a red shirt and blue jeans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">Willie Fuqua, Robert\u2019s older brother, was about sixteen years old at the time of the shooting, and he lived with his brother on the second floor of 18 Farrington Street. Willie testified that, on that particular morning, his attention was drawn to the back of the house, where he saw through a window that two men were arguing in the backyard of 24 Farrington Street. Willie described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>one of the men as \u201cblack, almost Hispanic-looking,\u201d and wearing a black hat, a black jacket, and blue jean shorts. He recalled this man saying that he wanted $1,000, something about the other man taking his girl, and something about five more dollars. He later heard this man say, \u201cYou\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d \u201c[Ajfter a few\u201d minutes, he heard four to five gunshots.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Erika Luyo was the only eyewitness who actually saw the shooting. At about 10:15 a.m. on the day of the shooting, she was putting some dishes in the sink at 16 Farrington Street when she got a \u201cquick glimpse\u201d through her kitchen window of a young \u201c[bjlack\u201d man walking up Farrington Street from the direction of North Main Street. A few seconds later, as she opened the door to her enclosed porch to go shopping, she heard gunshots. She looked outside through a window, and she saw the same African-American man standing about twenty to twenty-five yards away, near the driveway of 18 Farrington Street, wearing black gloves, black pants, and \u201ca black outer something.\u201d He was holding a gun with both hands, firing it in a direction away from 16 Farrington Street, toward the houses further down Farrington Street. After the shooting, she saw the shooter run up the driveway between 18 and 24 Farrington Street, towards Prospect Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Later, Luyo met with police officers, including State Trooper Ruben Colon, who showed her a photographic array and \u201cinformed her . . . that the suspect may or may not [have been] in the photos [the officers] presented to her.\u201d According to Trooper Colon\u2019s testimony, Luyo stated that the shooter \u201clooked like No. 2 but he had hair like No. 4.\u201d The individual in photograph number 2 was the defendant; the individual in photograph number 4 had tighter braids than the defendant\u2019s as depicted in photograph number 2. Luyo explicitly said in her testimony, during both direct and cross-examination, that she told the officers that she \u201cwas not sure\u201d about her identification of the defendant from the photographic array.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>3. <em>After the shooting. </em>Josiah Bell-Hilliard, the son of Kirsha Hilliard, was about thirteen or fourteen years old at the time of the shooting, and he lived at 28 Prospect Street on the third floor with his younger sister, Imani, who was about ten or eleven years old. That morning, Josiah and Imani were painting a bedroom when Josiah heard a fence moving in the yard outside the house\u2019s rear window. At trial, Josiah agreed that the transcript from his grand jury testimony reflected that he told the grand jury that, when he looked outside, he \u201csaw Lewis hopping over the fence,\u201d and that he recognized the defendant at that time. He further testified at trial that he had known the defendant for years, and that \u201cback then, we called him G.\u201d Josiah\u2019s grand jury testimony reflected that he asked the defendant where he was going, but the defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t respond\u201d; instead, he \u201cput his hands up and just looked sideways\u201d and then \u201che just kept on running.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Imani testified that, on the date of the shooting, she heard approximately five gunshots, and then two to three minutes later, she heard the backyard fence rattle. She, too, saw the defendant jump over the backyard fence, and put his hand up and continue \u201cjogging\u201d after she or her brother asked where he was going.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">Daniel Sweeting, a retired firefighter, lived at 50 Prospect Street on the day of the shooting. He testified that, when the gunshots were fired, he was in his basement, but he immediately ran upstairs and was outside looking down Prospect Street toward where he thought the shots were fired within \u201c[pjrobably half a minute.\u201d At this point, he saw a black male walking from between the houses on the north side of Prospect Street, from the direction of Farrington Street. The man was \u201clooking back . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>[o]ver his left shoulder,\u201d and he was wearing \u201cdark clothing,\u201d consisting of a \u201cdark\u201d baseball cap and a \u201cdark\u201d short sleeved shirt. On cross-examination, Sweeting admitted that he told the police on the day after the shooting that the person he saw appeared to be about five feet, eight inches tall.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Adam Thayer, who was about twenty-five or twenty-six years old at the time of the shooting, lived at 17 Prospect Street, where his backyard bordered the backyards of several houses on Farrington Street, including 24 Farrington Street to the left. Because there were two large holes in the fence that separated his backyard from the Farrington Street backyards, one on the left and one on the right, he saw people crossing through his yard \u201c[e]very day\u201d as a shortcut to get from Prospect Street to Farrington Street. Thayer testified that, at about 10:15 a.m. on the morning of the shooting, he saw an African-American \u201ckid\u201d wearing a white hat cut through his yard and cross through the left side of the fence. After the \u201ckid\u201d crossed through the hole in the fence, Thayer heard the gunshots and saw the \u201ckid\u201d immediately running back through his yard, heading in the direction of North Main Street. Thayer estimated that the \u201ckid\u201d had gone into the hole in the fence and come back in a matter of five to ten seconds.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">4. <em>The confession. </em>Carlos Hill, the defendant\u2019s cousin, first testified before a grand jury on October 1, 2004, and testified before a second grand jury in October, 2007, after having been \u201cpicked up on charges.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Before the second grand jury, Hill testified that the defendant told him in the fall of 2004 that he had gone to Florida after the victim died \u201cbecause of the shooting.\u201d Hill told the grand jury that the defendant told him that \u201che had played the dude for rum and the dude realized it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>and ... the dude told him he was going to throw rocks at my aunt\u2019s house,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and I guess they bumped heads again on Farrington [Street].\u201d Hill testified before the second grand jury that the defendant told him that he went to go get a gun, that the altercation between the defendant and the victim \u201cgot heated up,\u201d and the defendant shot the victim four times.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">However, at trial, Hill repeatedly testified that he did not remember making any of the statements read to him from the minutes of his 2007 grand jury testimony, and that his entire 2007 testimony was incorrect. At trial, Hill testified that all the defendant had said to him in the fall of 2004 was that he had gone to Florida \u201cbecause he was on the run for probation. He owed them a fine or whatever,\u201d and that he had returned to Massachusetts \u201cto pay off the fine.\u201d Hill explained that in 2007 he \u201csmoked a lot of crack,\u201d and that his grand jury testimony at that time was based on a mistaken but honest belief that the defendant had actually confessed to the shooting. He claimed at trial that he did not learn anything about the shooting from the defendant, but instead learned it from others, including a coworker. He also testified that, apart from the allegations by the Commonwealth, he had never heard that the defendant was involved in the shooting, but he simply heard \u201cthat someone shot someone four times in the chest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">The relevant portions of Hill\u2019s sworn description of the defendant\u2019s confession before the 2007 grand jury were properly admitted as substantive evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt because they were inconsistent with his testimony at trial, the defendant had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine Hill at trial, and Hill\u2019s prior grand jury testimony was in his own words and was not coerced. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55, 72-75 (1984), as modified by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Due Le, </em>444 Mass. 431, 432 n.3 (2005); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 801(d)(1)(A) &amp; note (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Evidence of the victim\u2019s threats. </em>The defendant contends that the judge erred in allowing the Commonwealth\u2019s motion in limine to admit the testimony of Kirsha Hilliard and Troy Edmondson that the victim threatened to throw rocks at or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>otherwise destroy what he believed to be the defendant\u2019s house if he did not get his money back. Because the defendant objected to the admission of this evidence at trial, \u201cwe review under the prejudicial error standard.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>454 Mass. 135, 141 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">The threatening remarks the victim made to Kirsha and Edmondson are admissible only if there was also evidence presented to the jury that the defendant learned of such remarks before the killing and that the victim\u2019s threat provided a motive for the defendant to kill the victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Qualls, </em>425 Mass. 163, 167-168 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>440 Mass. 576 (2003) <em>{Qualls). </em>As we stated in <em>Qualls, </em>supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-6\">\u201cThe state-of-mind exception to the hearsay rule calls for admission of evidence of a murder victim\u2019s state of mind as proof of the defendant\u2019s motive to kill the victim when and only when there also is evidence that the defendant was aware of that state of mind at the time of the crime and would be likely to respond to it. ... A murder victim\u2019s attitude of contempt or hostility toward the defendant, when it is known to the defendant, would constitute some evidence which, augmented by other evidence, might warrant a fact finder\u2019s determination that the defendant responded by killing the victim. However, a victim\u2019s contempt for the defendant or hostile attitude toward him, unknown to the defendant, would be irrelevant and inadmissible at the defendant\u2019s trial for murder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">There need not be direct evidence that the defendant learned of the victim\u2019s state of mind, so long as \u201cthe jury could have reasonably inferred\u201d that he did learn of it. <em>Id. </em>at 170, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>390 Mass. 62, 74 (1983), cert, denied, 465 U.S. 1032 (1984). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sharpe, supra </em>at 142-143; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Purcell, </em>423 Mass. 880, 882-883 (1996) (\u201cWhere ... the jury were warranted in inferring that the defendant knew of the victim\u2019s state of mind, evidence of the victim\u2019s statement was admissible ... to show both the victim\u2019s state of mind and the defendant\u2019s motive to kill her\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">Although Wanda Franklin denied communicating the victim\u2019s threat to her son, there was abundant evidence in the record to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>allow a jury to infer that the defendant learned of this threat and that it was a motive in the killing. The jury were entitled to credit the 2007 grand jury testimony of Hill that the defendant told him that he knew the victim had threatened to throw rocks at his mother\u2019s house, and that the defendant suggested to him that this threat was a motive in the shooting. The jury reasonably could also infer that the defendant telephoned Robinson to ask him, \u201cWhere\u2019s that white boy you were with?\u201d because he knew that the victim had just come to his house and made threats. Moreover, soon after his mother confronted him about what he was \u201cdoing outside,\u201d the defendant confronted the victim when he was with Edmondson behind the abandoned building and asked, \u201cWho the fuck came by my house?\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Finally, just before the shots were fired, Nina Hall heard someone outside her house say, \u201cYou came to my house being disrespectful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">We conclude that the judge did not err in admitting either Kirsha\u2019s or Edmonson\u2019s descriptions of the threats made by the victim because, from the totality of the evidence presented, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the defendant knew of the victim\u2019s hostile threats against his mother\u2019s house when the shooting occurred and that the killing was motivated at least in part by these threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">2. <em>Absence of eyewitness identification instruction. </em>On the fifth day of the trial, the judge asked counsel to let him know \u201cas soon as possible\u201d if they thought \u201cthat any additional [jury] instructions [would be] necessary.\u201d The judge specifically asked defense counsel if he was going to request an instruction on eyewitness identification. Defense counsel replied that he wanted to \u201cthink about that.\u201d The next day, during the charge conference, defense counsel did not request such an instruction, and the judge gave no specific instruction on eyewitness identification evidence in his final instructions to the jury. The judge, however, did instruct the jury that, \u201c[i]n evaluating the credibility of a witness,\u201d they could \u201cconsider the ability, the op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>portunity, and the reliability of a witness to see or hear something in the past and then remember and later testify.\u201d The defendant made no objection to the judge\u2019s instructions. On appeal, the defendant contends that his attorney\u2019s failure to request a specific instruction on eyewitness identification, and his failure to object to the absence of such an instruction, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel resulting in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">\u201cWhere, as here, the defendant has been convicted of murder in the first degree, \u2018we consider his claim of ineffectiveness of counsel to determine whether there exists a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, as required under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, which is more favorable to a defendant than the constitutional standard for determining ineffectiveness of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>460 Mass. 590, 598 (2011) <em>(Walker), </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>443 Mass. 799, 808 (2005). Under this more favorable standard of review, where defense counsel is claimed to be ineffective because he failed timely to object to an alleged trial error, we need not consider whether the failure to object fell measurably below the conduct expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer, but determine instead \u201cwhether there was error and, if so, whether the error was \u2018likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walker, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, supra. </em>Here, the defendant contends that defense counsel erred both in failing to request an identification instruction and in failing to object to what the defendant characterizes as the judge\u2019s error in failing to give such an instruction even in the absence of a request. We need not address the alleged inadequacy of counsel\u2019s conduct, because we conclude that the absence of a specific eyewitness identification instruction, including an instruction on the possibility of a good faith error in identification, was not \u201clikely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Walker, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">\u201cWe have long recognized that \u2018[ejyewitness identification of a person whom the witness had never seen before the crime or other incident presents a substantial risk of misidentification and increases the chance of a conviction of an innocent defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, </em>453 Mass. 782, 796 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>(2009), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>423 Mass. 99, 109 (1996). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>420 Mass. 458, 465 (1995) (\u201cmistaken identification is believed widely to be the primary cause of erroneous convictions\u201d). We have also long recognized that, where the reliability of a positive eyewitness identification is an important issue at trial, a judge should instruct the jury regarding the evaluation of eyewitness identification testimony, including the possibility of a good faith error in identification, where such an instruction is requested by the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pressley, </em>390 Mass. 617, 619 (1983) (error for judge to refuse to give instruction regarding good faith error in identification after request by defendant unless \u201cthe parties are so well known to each other or so closely related that under sufficient lighting and with appropriate physical proximity, the identification by the victim is either true or the victim is lying\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 482-484 (1980). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>86 N.J. 281, 292 (1981) (where reliability of eyewitness identification witness is \u201ccrucial issue,\u201d defendant is entitled, on request, to jury instruction on identification that provides guidance to jury \u201con how to analyze and consider the factual issues with regard to the trustworthiness of [alleged victim\u2019s] in-court identification\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>721 P.2d 483, 492 (Utah 1986) (\u201cin cases tried from this date forward, trial courts shall give such an instruction whenever eyewitness identification is a central issue in a case and such an instruction is requested by the defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">The identification instruction we have approved was crafted to assist a jury in evaluating the reliability of a positive identification of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime by a witness.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>421 Mass. 90, 99 (1995), quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 106, 110 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>(1984) (\u201cThe [instruction approved in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>378 Mass. 296, 310-311 (1979) (Appendix),] addresses the question, \u2018Is the identification of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime free of unnecessarily suggestive influences and compelling enough to support a verdict of guilty?\u2019 \u201d). We now recognize that eyewitness identification may be an important issue at trial even where no eyewitness made a positive identification of the defendant as the perpetrator, but where eyewitnesses have provided a physical description of the perpetrator or his clothing, or have identified a photograph in an array as someone who looks like the perpetrator. Further, we now recognize that in such cases, where requested by the defendant, a judge should provide specific guidance to the jury regarding the evaluation of such eyewitness testimony through some variation of the approved identification instruction. Cf. Jury Instructions Issued by New Jersey Supreme Court, Identification: Out-of-Court Identification Only, at 1 (effective Sept. 4, 2012) (providing that instruction should be given where \u201c[defendant], as part of [his/ her] general denial of guilt, contends that the State has not presented sufficient reliable evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that [he/she] is the person who committed the alleged offense\u201d). However, in the circumstances of this case, we are not persuaded that an identification instruction, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>an instruction on good faith error in identification, would have been \u201clikely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d See <em>Walker, supra </em>at 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">The defendant specifically contends that, \u201c[b]y failing to request an identification instruction, the jury [were] left to make judgments about the testimony of Ms. Luyo and Mr. Edmond-son without any instruction to educate and guide their analysis.\u201d We note first that the jury <em>were </em>provided an instruction \u201cto guide their analysis\u201d of the reliability of each witness\u2019s testimony, in that they were informed that they could \u201cconsider the ability, the opportunity, and the reliability of a witness to see or hear something in the past and then remember and later testify.\u201d We conclude that it is not likely that the guidance provided by the identification instruction approved by this court at the time of trial, or some variation thereof, would have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion regarding the reliability of either Luyo\u2019s or Edmond-son\u2019s contested testimony, and that it is even less likely that such an instruction would have affected the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Although Luyo suggested, when she was presented with the photographic array, that the shooter looked similar to the defendant, she explicitly testified, both on direct and cross-examination, that she told the officers that she \u201cwas not sure\u201d of her identification. Even the prosecutor admitted in his closing argument that Luyo, by this equivocal statement, \u201cdidn\u2019t ID the defendant.\u201d In view of the prosecutor\u2019s concession and Luyo\u2019s expressed uncertainty, we do not find it likely that the jury\u2019s evaluation of the reliability of her eyewitness testimony would have been substantially influenced by an identification instruction had one been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">As to Edmondson\u2019s testimony that he identified the defendant and the victim running through a yard toward Farrington Street shortly before the shooting, defense counsel on cross-examination elicited many reasons why the jury should not credit his account. Edmondson admitted at trial that he had at least ten prior criminal convictions, that he was an alcoholic, that he was under the influence of alcohol that morning, and that he had been drinking most of the previous evening. He further admitted that his view was partially obstructed by a dirt mound, and that he testified at the grand jury that he had only seen the defendant run<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>ning, not the victim, and that he had only glimpsed the defendant \u201c[o]ut of the comer of [his] eye.\u201d Considering the information elicited in his cross-examination, we doubt that an instruction on identification would have substantially influenced the weight, if any, the jury ascribed to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">It is even less likely that the standard instruction on identification would have influenced the jury\u2019s verdicts, because the evidence was overwhelming that the defendant had sold the victim fake crack cocaine earlier that morning, that the victim was outraged by the fraud and threatened to damage the defendant\u2019s residence if the money was not returned, and that the defendant was angered by the victim coming to his mother\u2019s home and making this threat. None of these facts turned on identification testimony. The strongest evidence that the defendant was the perpetrator of the crime did not come from Luyo\u2019s identification of the defendant\u2019s photograph in the array as a person who \u201clooked like\u201d the shooter, but from Nina Hall\u2019s testimony that, immediately before the gunshots were fired, she heard a man outside 24 Farrington Street say, \u201cYou came to my house being disrespectful,\u201d and that she heard someone say something about fifteen dollars. An identification instruction would not have affected the jury\u2019s evaluation of Hall\u2019s testimony. Further, even absent Luyo\u2019s and Edmondson\u2019s contested testimony, the jury were entitled to credit Carlos Hill\u2019s 2007 grand jury testimony that the defendant had confessed to him that he shot the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that the absence of a specific identification instruction was not likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s verdicts and, therefore, did not result in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">3. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant claims that the prosecutor made three improper statements in his closing argument. Because defense counsel made no objection to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, we review this claim to determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s argument was improper and whether any impropriety therein resulted in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>460 Mass. 12, 21 (2011), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 681 (1992). We conclude that the prosecutor made only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>one improper statement in his closing argument and that it created no such substantial likelihood.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">First, the defendant correctly notes that the prosecutor told the jury that Edmondson testified that \u201cthe defendant said, \u2018You fucking came to my house,\u2019 \u201d when Edmondson actually testified that the defendant said, \u201cWho the fuck came by my house?\u201d We conclude that this error was inconsequential because it was plain from Edmondson\u2019s testimony that the defendant confronted the victim as if he knew that the victim had come to his house, and that he was not asking the identity of the person who had come.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Second, the defendant contends that the prosecutor erred when, in arguing that the \u201ckid\u201d Adam Thayer observed cutting through his backyard just before and just after the shooting was not the defendant, he told the jury that \u201cthe only person who said anything about a whitish hat was Adam Thayer.\u201d The defendant argues that this was an erroneous factual assertion because both Anthony Robinson and Imani Bell-Hilliard identified the defendant\u2019s hat as at least partially white. We find no error because a \u201cwhitish\u201d hat is different from a hat with several colors that is partially white, and Thayer was the only witness who testified to a person wearing a white hat.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Third, the defendant argues that the prosecutor created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice when he agreed with the judge at the charge conference that no instruction on the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt was necessary and then suggested in his closing argument that Carlos Hill\u2019s 2007 grand jury testimony was more \u201cplausible\u201d than his trial testimony because it was more likely that the defendant went to Florida \u201cbecause he had shot somebody on Farrington Street\u201d than \u201cbecause he had to pay probation some fines.\u201d Where the jury had to choose whether to credit Hill\u2019s 2007 grand jury testimony or his inconsistent testimony at trial, this was fair argument. Moreover, even if the jury understood from the prosecutor\u2019s statement that he was suggesting that the defendant\u2019s travel to Florida after the shooting reflected his consciousness of guilt, there was no impropriety because the prosecutor did not promise not to make such a suggestion and a jury instruction on consciousness of guilt is not a precondition to a prosecutor arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>evidence suggesting a defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>419 Mass. 426, 435-436 (1995) (in absence of request, judge may exercise discretion not to instruct on consciousness of guilt; \u201c[cjounsel at the trial might wish only to discuss evidence suggesting consciousness of guilt in closing arguments or simply to leave it for the jury\u2019s reflection unadorned by comment either by them or the judge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">4. <em>Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>The defendant argues that this court should exercise its authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to grant him a new trial because the large number of inconsistencies in the testimony of various witnesses shows that \u201cthe verdict was against the weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Section 33E \u201cgive[s] us the power and the duty exercised by a trial judge upon a motion for a new trial ... to set aside a verdict when in his [or her] judgment it is so greatly against the weight of the evidence as to induce in his [or her] mind the strong belief that it was not due to a careful consideration of the evidence, but that it was the product of bias, misapprehension or prejudice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>416 Mass. 258, 265 (1993) (Jefferson), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gricus, </em>317 Mass. 403, 406 (1944) <em>(Gricus). </em>Section 33E, however, \u201cdoes not . . . convert this court into a second jury, which must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of a defendant by reading the reported evidence, without the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses.\u201d <em>Jefferson, supra, </em>quoting <em>Gricus, supra. </em>\u201cFor a trial judge, or for this court under the statute ... to grant a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, it must appear that the verdict, if allowed to stand, would work a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Jefferson, supra </em>at 266, quoting <em>Gricus, supra </em>at 407. \u201cIt is not enough that the judge or judges, if on the jury, would have felt a reasonable doubt which the jury did not share.\u201d <em>Jefferson, supra, </em>quoting <em>Gricus, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">In this case, we recognize that the Commonwealth did not eliminate the theoretical possibility that, while the defendant and the victim were in the midst of an angry dispute over the defendant\u2019s sale of fake crack cocaine and the victim\u2019s subsequent threats to damage the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s home, an unidentified third person fired five shots at the victim, shooting him in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>the back. There was evidence that a third person was nearby when the shots were fired: Adam Thayer saw a \u201ckid\u201d wearing a white hat walk through a hole in a fence leading to the backyard of 24 Farrington Street seconds before the shooting and run back through that hole seconds after the shooting, and Robert Fuqua, shortly after the shooting, saw a second man approach the victim and flee the scene moments after an armed man had done the same. But, as this court originally announced in 1850, \u201creasonable doubt .... is not mere possible doubt,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Webster, 5 Cush. 295, 320 (1850), and the great weight of the evidence established that the defendant was the shooter, not this unidentified third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">The defendant was outraged by the victim having come to his mother\u2019s home and threatening to throw rocks at it unless he was repaid. Nina Hall heard this dispute articulated outside 24 Farrington Street moments before the shots were fired. The jury were entitled to credit the evidence that the victim admitted to his cousin, Carlos Hill, that he committed the shooting. While Hill claimed at trial that the defendant never confessed the crime to him and that he mistakenly had attributed information to the defendant that he had learned from others, the confession he described provided details that closely conformed with, and were corroborated by, the other evidence in the case. The defendant\u2019s conduct after the shooting also supported the inference that he was the shooter, because he did not flee to his mother\u2019s home after the shooting but instead fled past his mother\u2019s home and did not return for at least several weeks. While there was inconsistent testimony regarding the clothing worn by the defendant and by the shooter, the weight of the evidence was that the shooter wore a dark baseball cap consistent with a Boston Celtics hat that the defendant was wearing that morning, not the white cap worn by the \u201ckid\u201d who walked into the scene of the shooting through the hole in the fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Having carefully reviewed the trial record, we are convinced that the weight of the evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict of murder in the first degree, and we therefore decline to exercise our extraordinary authority to grant relief under G. L. c. 278, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>\u00a7 33E, either to order a new trial or to reduce the severity of the verdict.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>None of the defendant\u2019s claims on appeal warrants reversal of the convictions, and the interests of justice do not require the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt or a new trial pursuant to G.

Josiah Bell-Hilliard stated that after the defendant jumped over the fence behind his house, he saw the defendant run west on Waverly Street (which is south of Prospect Street) and then south on Falmouth Avenue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b922-8\">Josiah admitted at trial th\u00e1t the grand jury transcript reflected that he had previously testified that the defendant \u201chad a green hat on with short braids,\u201d and wore \u201ca type of Jamaican shirt that had green, yellow, red on it,\u201d and light blue \u201cregular jeans.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b922-9\">Imani Bell-Hilliard testified that the defendant was wearing a Celtics hat and a tannish colored jersey shirt, white sneakers, and jeans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b923-7\">During his closing argument, the prosecutor argued that the person wearing the white hat was not the shooter, but simply a passerby who happened to walk into the scene of a shooting, and who fled when he realized what had happened. He argued that it \u201cwould have been humanly impossible\u201d for this person to have gone from the hole in the fence to the location where the shell casings were recovered and then back out the hole in the fence in a matter of seconds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b923-8\">Carlos Hill did not testify at trial as to what he said in his 2004 grand jury testimony, and the minutes of that testimony were not read to Hill as a witness at the trial. No evidence was offered that Hill received any promises, rewards, or inducements in return for any of his grand jury or trial testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b924-8\">The defendant\u2019s mother is Hill\u2019s aunt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b926-7\">The defendant argues that, because he questioned the identity of the individual who came to his house, this statement constituted \u201ca demonstration that he did not even know the person\u2019s identity, much less the details of what was said.\u201d However, we conclude that the jury could reasonably infer from the course of events leading up to this question, and the defendant\u2019s aggressive tone, that this statement was more of an accusation than a question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The instructions on eyewitness identification approved in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>378 Mass. 296, 310-311 (1979) (Appendix), as modified in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cuffie, </em>414 Mass. 632, 640-641 (1993) (Appendix), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santoli, </em>424 Mass. 837, 845 (1997), are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-6\">\u201cOne of the most important issues in this case is the identification of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime. The Government has the burden of proving identity beyond a reasonable doubt. It is not essential that the witness himself be free from doubt as to the correctness of his statement. However, you, the jury, must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the accuracy of the identification of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>before you may convict him. If you are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the person who committed the crime, you must find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARUi\">\u201cIdentification testimony is an expression of belief or impression by the witness. Its value depends on the opportunity the witness had to observe the offender at the time of the offense and to make a reliable identification later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADDk\">\u201cIn appraising the identification testimony of a witness, you should consider the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMu\">\u201cAre you convinced that the witness had the capacity and an adequate opportunity to observe the offender?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuQX\">\u201cWhether the witness had an adequate opportunity to observe the offender at the time of the offense will be affected by such matters as how long or short a time was available, how far or close the witness was, how good were lighting conditions, whether the witness had had occasion to see or know the person in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALH\">\u201cIn general, a witness bases any identification he makes on his perception through the use of his senses. Usually the witness identifies an offender by the sense of sight \u2014 but this is not necessarily so, and he may use other senses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AINN\">\u201cAre you satisfied that the identification made by the witness subsequent to the offense was the product of his own recollection? You may take into account the circumstances under which the identification was made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQA\">\u201cIf the identification by the witness may have been influenced by the circumstances under which the defendant was presented to him for identification, you should scrutinize the identification with great care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV8\">\u201cYou may also consider the length of time that lapsed between the occurrence of the crime and the opportunity of the witness, some time after the occurrence of the crime, to see and identify the defendant as the offender, as a factor bearing on the reliability of the identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATSk\">\u201cYou may also take into account that an identification made by picking the defendant out of a group of similar individuals is generally more reliable than one which results from the presentation of the defendant alone to the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAH\">\u201cYou may take into account any occasions in which the witness failed to make an identification of defendant, or made an identification that was inconsistent with his identification at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asf\">\u201cFinally, you must consider the credibility of each identification witness in the same way as any other witness, consider whether he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>truthful, and consider whether he had the capacity and opportunity to make a reliable observation on the matter covered in his testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amq\">\u201cI again emphasize that the burden of proof on the prosecutor extends to every element of the crime charged, and this specifically includes the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the identity of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime with which he stands charged. If after examining the testimony, you have a reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of the identification, you must find the defendant not guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUl\">Further, as we held in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pressley, </em>390 Mass. 617, 620 (1983), \u201cFairness to a defendant compels the trial judge to give an instruction on the possibility of an honest but mistaken identification when the facts permit it and when the defendant requests it.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pires, </em>453 Mass. 66, 71-72 (2009) (\u201cbetter course is to include in the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction the language set forth in the <em>Pressley </em>case,\u201d because \u201c[t]here is no harm in including such language, when the evidence so warrants and when a defendant requests the instruction, and it will help to ensure that the jury understand \u2018the thrust\u2019 of the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction \u2014 i.e., that a witness might simply be mistaken\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Just as we conclude that the jury were justified in finding that the defendant was the man who shot the victim to death, we also conclude that their verdict that he did so with deliberate premeditation was consonant with justice. In so concluding, we note that there was no evidence presented suggesting that, when the shooter killed the victim, he was acting in self-defense or on sudden provocation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
