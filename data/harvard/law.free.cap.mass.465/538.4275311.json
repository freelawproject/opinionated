L. c. 272, \u00a7 29A <em>(b).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The case was tried under the \u201clive performance\u201d prong of the statute. Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant argues that the judge erroneously denied his motion for a required finding because the Commonwealth did not prove that the victim\u2019s conduct satisfied the statutory definition of a \u201clive performance.\u201d The defendant also maintains that expert testimony was required to aid the jury in understanding how the alleged \u201clive performance\u201d had occurred. We transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion. We reject the defendant\u2019s arguments, affirm the judge\u2019s order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty, and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>Based on the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, considered under the standard set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), the jury could have found the following facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The conduct occurred in 2008, when the victim, a boy, was ten years of age. The defendant was thirty-four years of age. The victim and the defendant each owned \u201cXbox\u201d video game consoles that allowed them to connect over the Internet for the purpose of playing multiplayer video games. Players who own a \u201cvision camera\u201d and headset also may engage in private \u201clive chat.\u201d These accessories are plugged into various ports of the Xbox. The camera is then mounted anywhere in the range of its connecting cable. Assuming two players are engaging in private live chat, the camera displays two images on the television screen, the image of each user. If the camera is angled on each user, respectively, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>each user is able to see both images. The images appear live, without delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The victim met the defendant online while playing a multiplayer video game. Thereafter, the victim invited the defendant to become his \u201cfriend,\u201d and the defendant accepted, thereby enabling the two to engage in private live chat. The victim and the defendant first began live chatting in June, 2008. Thereafter, the victim asked the defendant his age. The defendant stated that he was twenty-three or twenty-four years of age. The defendant then asked the victim his age; the victim informed the defendant that he was ten years of age. The two also exchanged cellular telephone numbers. Thereafter, the victim telephoned the defendant and the two also would communicate by engaging in private live chat.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">About one month after the victim and the defendant started live chatting, the defendant pulled down his pants and started masturbating. This incident occurred at night, at approximately 11 p.m. The victim told the defendant that he should pull his pants up, and the defendant walked away. On three other occasions, the defendant exposed himself and began masturbating during a private live chat with the victim. On one occasion, the defendant suggested that the victim \u201ctry it.\u201d The victim complied and saw his penis appear on the television screen. The victim stopped because he felt \u201cweird.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In August, 2008, the victim and the defendant once again were engaged in a private live chat. The victim was in his room with the door shut and his twin sister was sleeping in the bed they shared. The defendant was masturbating and the victim attempted to do the same. The victim could see his penis on the television screen, which was also viewable to the defendant. At some point, the victim\u2019s mother entered the room and gasped. She saw the defendant masturbating on the television screen and saw her son with his underpants pulled down to his upper thighs, moving his arm up and down. The defendant got up and shut off his camera and the television screen went blank. The victim\u2019s parents reported the incident to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The defendant did not testify. His nephew, however, did. The defendant\u2019s nephew lived with him at the time and never saw the defendant do anything inappropriate during live chats that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>he (the nephew) observed between the defendant and the victim. The defendant\u2019s nephew testified that, in some of these live chats (not more than five), the victim \u201cmooned\u201d the defendant, who responded by turning off the gaming system and by reprimanding the victim once for \u201cinappropriate\u201d behavior. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel argued that the victim and his mother were not credible witnesses, and that the allegations could not be true in view of the fact that people were \u201ccoming and going\u201d \u201cday and night\u201d out of the defendant\u2019s living room, where the gaming system was located. In his final charge, the judge instructed the jury,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">\u201cThis indictment, in shorthand terms, charges the defendant with engaging a child in a live performance involving sexual conduct. . . . Our State Legislature specifically defined this crime in a statute, specifically, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29A <em>(b), </em>that in part states as follows: \u2018Whoever either with knowledge . . . that a person is a child under [eighteen] years of age or while in possession of such facts that he should have reason to know that such person is a child under [eighteen] years of age, solicits or entices, procures, uses, encourages, or knowingly permits such child to participate or to engage in any live performance involving sexual conduct shall be punished.\u2019 Turning to this case, in order to prove [the defendant] guilty of this crime, the Commonwealth must convince you of the following four elements. First, that [the victim] was then under eighteen years of age. Second, that the defendant. . . had knowledge that [the victim] was a child under eighteen years of age or the defendant was in possession of facts that he should have had reason to know that [the victim] was a child under eighteen years of age. Third, that the defendant either solicited or enticed, caused or encouraged, or knowingly permitted [the victim] to engage in a live performance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Fourth, that [the victim] engaged in a live performance involving sexual conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>The judge went on to define the elements with more particularity. Concerning the word \u201cengage,\u201d the judge instructed that the term \u201cmeans to become involved in an activity where the activity here identified in the statute [is] a live performance.\u201d The word \u201cperformance,\u201d the judge explained, \u201cmeans any play, dance, exhibit or such similar activity performed before one or more persons.\u201d Turning to the fourth element, the judge instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">\u201cSexual conduct includes the activities of human masturbation, sexual intercourse, actual or simulated, normal or perverted[;] [a]ny lewd exhibition of the genitals[;] and any lewd touching of the genitals. The phrase \u2018human masturbation\u2019 means either the activity of manual stimulation of the genitals to orgasm or the activity of manual stimulation of the genitalia without orgasm. Otherwise stated, the Commonwealth satisfies its burden of proof if it proves beyond a reasonable doubt that [the victim] engaged in either the activity of manually stimulating his genitals or the act of stimulating his genitalia to orgasm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The judge continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">\u201cAdditionally, in proving this element, the Commonwealth must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that it was [the defendant\u2019s] specific intent to solicit, entice, cause or encourage [the victim] to engage in a live performance involving sexual conduct. In determining whether the defendant possessed such a specific intent, you may consider all the facts and circumstances, including the defendant\u2019s acts and statements. The statute also permits the Commonwealth to establish alternatively that the defendant knowingly permitted [the victim] to engage in a live performance involving sexual conduct. As to the term \u2018knowingly,\u2019 follow my previous instruction on the definition of \u2018knowingly.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Last, the judge instructed that the jury \u201care not to consider whether [the victim] consented to such participation. Consent is not an issue in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The defendant contends that the facts were insufficient to withstand a motion for a required finding of not guilty. He also argues that no \u201cperformance\u201d occurred within the meaning of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29A (b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We first address the construction of the term \u201cperformance\u201d under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 29A <em>(b), </em>as relevant here, provides: \u201cWhoever . . . hires, coerces, solicits or entices, employs, procures, uses, causes, encourages, or knowingly permits such child ... to engage in any live performance involving sexual conduct, shall be punished . . . .\u201d A \u201c[performance\u201d means \u201cany play, dance, exhibit, or such similar activity performed before one or more persons.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31. The term \u201c[s]exual conduct\u201d includes \u201chuman masturbation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The defendant argues that no \u201cperformance\u201d occurred because the victim\u2019s act of masturbation was not a \u201csimilar activity\u201d comparable to a \u201cplay, dance, [or] exhibit,\u201d and because it did not take place before \u201cone or more persons.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31. In construing the statute, \u201c[w]hen the statute\u2019s language is plain and unambiguous, we afford it \u2018its ordinary meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>445 Mass. 315, 319 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>431 Mass. 772, 775 (2000). \u201cWhere the draftsmanship of a statute is faulty or lacks precision, it is our duty to give [it] a reasonable construction.\u201d <em>Capone </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Fitchburg, </em>389 Mass. 617, 622 (1983), quoting <em>School Comm, of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Greenfield Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>385 Mass. 70, 79-80 (1982). We \u201cmust construe the statute \u2018in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Capone </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Fitchburg, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number><em>supra </em>at 622-623, quoting <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The Legislature enacted G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29A, in order \u201cto protect minors from exploitation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>435 Mass. 708, 711 (2002). It defined the term \u201cperformance\u201d as \u201cany play, dance, [or] exhibit\u201d and also by including that action which encompasses \u201csuch similar activity.\u201d The noun \u201cexhibit\u201d means \u201can act or instance of exhibiting: display.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 796 (1993). The phrase \u201csuch similar activity\u201d is a broad term. When construed together, the term \u201cperformance\u201d includes any similar activity comparable to a display. Here, the victim\u2019s act of masturbation was not done in isolation or for only himself to see. Rather, it was done facing a camera attached to a device that, through an Internet connection, resulted in the image being broadcast to the defendant for him to view. In the circumstances, we conclude that the victim\u2019s act of masturbation constituted an \u201cexhibit\u201d as well as a \u201csimilar activity\u201d comparable to an exhibit, satisfying the statutory definition of a \u201cperformance\u201d under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The defendant also asserts that no \u201cperformance\u201d under the statute occurred because the victim\u2019s act did not take place \u201cbefore one or more persons.\u201d To circumvent the plain meaning of \u201cone,\u201d the defendant argues that he, as the person who enticed or encouraged the performance, must be excluded as a member of the audience. In support of his contention, the defendant cites <em>Braun </em>v. <em>State, </em>911 P.2d 1075 (Alaska Ct. App. 1996). This case, however, is not instructive as the statute at issue did not define the term \u201cperformance\u201d and looked to a New York statute that required a \u201cperformance\u201d be in front of an \u201caudience,\u201d which was not defined.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1081 &amp; n.4, quoting New York Penal Law \u00a7 263.00[4]. Our statute expressly defines a \u201cperformance\u201d as occurring \u201cbefore one or more persons.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31. There is nothing ambiguous about this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>language, and we decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to rewrite the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We add that a \u201cperformance\u201d does not expressly or implicitly require the physical presence of \u201cone or more persons.\u201d In view of the advances in technology, a violation of the statute may occur without the defendant\u2019s physical presence in the victim\u2019s bedroom where the act of masturbation took place. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 317, 323-324 (2011) (although concluding that evidence was insufficient to support conviction of child enticement, court noted that \u201c[i]t is now true that, by means of modem digital and telephonic technology, a defendant also need not be physically present ... to achieve an intended purpose of obtaining illicit photographs\u201d). The Legislature\u2019s interest in protecting minors from sexual exploitation should not turn on the medium used (or not used in the case of actual presence). To hold otherwise would allow persons who sexually exploit children to evade prosecution so long as they do so with the use of technology. We cannot interpret statutory language in a vacuum, ignoring the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the statute and oblivious to \u201cthe time in which [the language] is used.\u201d <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>438 Mass. 282, 285 (2002), quoting <em>Auditor of the Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trustees of Boston Elevated Ry., </em>312 Mass. 74, 76 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Turning to the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the victim\u2019s act of masturbating was transmitted (through the gaming console and accessories, and Internet) to the defendant for him to view. The victim\u2019s mother testified that, when she entered her son\u2019s room on the night in question, she saw, on her son\u2019s television screen, the defendant masturbating and the victim moving his arm up and down with his underpants pulled down. After the victim\u2019s mother gasped, the defendant got up and turned off his camera and the screen went blank. In view of this evidence, it was both reasonable and permissible for the jury to infer that the victim\u2019s act of masturbating had, in fact, been displayed on the defendant\u2019s television screen and viewed by him, thus satisfying the statutory requirement that the victim\u2019s act of masturbation occurred before \u2014 that is, in front of, though not necessarily in the physical presence of \u2014 at least <em>one </em>person.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The defendant also contends that there was insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>evidence that the victim actually engaged in masturbation under the statute because the victim testified that, at the time of the alleged incident, he was going to try masturbating again, but his mother walked in so he stopped. The defendant\u2019s argument fails. The defendant ignores other testimony of the victim, that he did on that occasion try masturbating and saw his own penis appear on the television screen. The defendant\u2019s argument also overlooks the testimony of the victim\u2019s mother, who, on entering her son\u2019s bedroom, observed him with his underpants pulled down to his upper thighs and moving his arm up and down. From this evidence, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the victim did more than \u201cattempt to masturbate,\u201d but rather actually engaged in masturbation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>421 Mass. 289, 290-291 (1995) (in determining sufficiency of evidence, Commonwealth is permitted to rely on reasonable inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence). The evidence was sufficient to prove that the victim was masturbating and thus engaging in \u201csexual conduct\u201d under the statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">b. <em>Expert testimony. </em>Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, no expert testimony was necessary on the use and operation of an Xbox and its accessories. Expert testimony is ordinarily required when the subject of the testimony \u201cis beyond the common knowledge or understanding of the lay juror.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sands, </em>424 Mass. 184, 186 (1997). The victim testified extensively about the operation of the Xbox and its accessories, and the Commonwealth supplemented his testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>with photographic evidence and testimony from another witness. There was ample, uncontested testimony that the private live chat function, together with the use of a Web camera, allowed for a live, uninterrupted broadcast between Xbox users that displayed the live image of each user on each user\u2019s television screen. Even if a lay juror did not have personal experience using an Xbox, a lay juror, from common experience and knowledge, could understand those concepts. The jury were not left to engage in conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the judge\u2019s order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty and the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-6\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 29A <em>(b), </em>provides in relevant part: \u201cWhoever . . . hires, coerces, solicits or entices, employs, procures, uses, causes, encourages, or knowingly permits such child to participate or engage in any act that depicts, describes, or represents sexual conduct for the purpose of representation or reproduction in any visual material, or to engage in any live performance involving sexual conduct, shall be punished . . . .\u201d The statute applies to persons under eighteen years of age. <em>Id. </em>See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31 (defining \u201c[mjinor\u201d as \u201ca person under eighteen years of age\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty made at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The judge and counsel spent considerable time preparing the jury instructions, with the judge noting that there was little material to guide him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The judge clarified that the language of this element \u201cis in the disjunctive so grammatically or by syntax the way [he should] have this stated is that the defendant . . . either solicited or enticed or caused or encouraged or knowingly permitted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b560-9\">The judge also had previously defined the terms \u201c[gjeneral intent\u201d and \u201cspecific intent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Although the defendant did not present this argument below in support of his motion for a required finding of not guilty, we consider the issue because a conviction based on insufficient evidence amounts to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>455 Mass. 408, 411 (2009). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kerns, </em>449 Mass. 641, 650-651 (2007) (although substantive issue on construction of statute not raised below, issue should be decided because misconstruction of statutory element could lead to wrongful acquittal of defendant from which Commonwealth would have no remedy and to incorrect instructions on law of case).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Not all similar State statutes define an \u201caudience\u201d as more than one person. See <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>State, </em>715 So. 2d 1012, 1013, 1015 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1998) (where \u201cperformance\u201d defined as \u201cvisual representation exhibited before an audience,\u201d jury instruction defining \u201caudience\u201d as \u201c[a]n individual\u201d correctly stated law); <em>Alcorn </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>910 S.W.2d 716, 717 (Ky. Ct. App. 1995) (holding that \u201caudience\u201d required for \u201cperformance\u201d \u201cmay consist of one person, such as the accused\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\">We adopt the judge\u2019s formulation of what constitutes \u201cmasturbation\u201d under the statute. No ejaculation is required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The defendant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence that the victim was a child under eighteen years of age, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>or that he (the defendant) had knowledge (or was in possession of facts that he should have had reason to know) that the victim was a child under eighteen years of age. Indeed, there was evidence that, in addition to the victim\u2019s statements to the defendant that he was ten years of age, the defendant admitted to a sheriff that he believed the victim was about the same age of his son who was then eight years of age. On the facts of this case, the judge correctly instructed the jury that the victim\u2019s consent was not an issue because the victim was not of an age where he legally could consent to any conduct within the reach of the statute. That may not always be the case in other circumstances, such as, for example, when two teenagers over sixteen years of age engage in masturbation in the presence of each other. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23; G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 39. The Legislature, thus, may choose to revisit the reach of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29A <em>(b).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
