L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 1-28, inclusive, is entitled to prejudgment interest on a retroactive award of superannuation retirement benefits and, if so, at what rate of interest. We hold that the plaintiff is not entitled to interest at a rate of twelve per cent per annum pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, because his suit was not an action \u201cbased on contractual obligations.\u201d We further hold that the plaintiff is not entitled to twelve per cent annual interest pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6H, because interest in this case is \u201cotherwise provided by law\u201d under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 20 (5) (c) (2). We interpret \u00a7 20 (5) <em>(c) (2) to </em>provide that, where, as here, a retirement board makes a legal error in denying retirement benefits that is corrected by a court, the plaintiff is entitled to a rate of interest determined by the board\u2019s actuary \u201cso that the actuarial equivalent of the pension or benefit to which the member or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\"><em>Background. </em>The plaintiff worked for twenty-seven years as a custodian and maintenance mechanic for the Wenham Housing Authority and was a member of the Essex regional retirement system.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On May 1, 2003, he was charged with sexually assaulting his daughter and, that same day, resigned his position. On May 6, he submitted an application for voluntary superannuation retirement pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5 (1) <em>(a). </em>On May 15, he pleaded guilty to two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years of age, and was sentenced to two and one-half years in a house of correction, eighteen months of which to serve. Although he met the age and service time requirements to be eligible for superannuation retirement benefits, the Essex regional retirement board<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (board) on June 27, 2003, voted to deny his application pursuant to G. L. c. 32, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>\u00a7 10 (1), based on a finding of forfeiture due to moral turpitude.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On July 14, 2004, after a hearing, an administrative magistrate of the division of administrative law appeals issued an order affirming the board\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s application for superannuation retirement benefits. On February 18, 2005, the Contributory Retirement Appeal. Board (CRAB) accepted the administrative magistrate\u2019s findings of fact and affirmed her decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The plaintiff sought judicial review pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. In June, 2009, a Superior Court judge reversed CRAB\u2019s decision and entered judgment for the plaintiff, directing the board to grant the plaintiff\u2019s application for superannuation retirement benefits, retroactive to the date of his resignation. The judge found that the board and CRAB made an error of law in their interpretation of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10 (1), concluding that a member of a retirement system forfeits his retirement benefits under \u00a7 10 (1) where the member is \u201cremoved or discharged from his office or position\u201d because of the member\u2019s moral turpitude, not where, as here, the plaintiff voluntarily resigned his position. The judge determined that a member who resigns his position is entitled to superannuation retirement benefits for which he qualifies regardless of whether his resignation was motivated by the member\u2019s moral turpitude or by the likelihood that his misconduct will lead to an involuntary discharge. The Appeals Court affirmed the judgment. See <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Essex Regional Retirement Bd., </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 645, 655 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Subsequently, the board on March 31, 2011, issued a check to the plaintiff for $191,165.76, which represented his superannuation retirement benefits retroactive to the date of his resignation, but did not include any interest thereon. The plaintiff then filed a motion in the Superior Court, claiming that he was entitled to interest on the retroactive payment pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, at the rate of twelve per cent per annum. A judge concluded that \u00a7 6C applied and ordered that \u201cinterest be awarded at the rate of [twelve per cent] on each amount of plaintiff\u2019s unpaid benefits commencing from the date that such amount became payable.\u201d The judge later clarified that he regarded each past failure of the board to pay the plaintiff his monthly retirement benefit as a breach of contract, so that the plaintiff was entitled to twelve per cent simple interest on each unpaid monthly payment from the date that payment was due. The board appealed the judge\u2019s award of interest, the case was entered in the Appeals Court, and we transferred it to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 14, which provides for judicial review of the final decisions of agencies in adjudicatory proceedings, is silent as to the question of interest where an agency decision denying the payment of money is reversed. Section 14 (7) provides only that the reviewing court \u201cmay set aside or modify the decision, or compel any action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed, if it determines that the substantial rights of any party may have been prejudiced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The plaintiff contends, and the judge ruled, that he is entitled to the award of interest under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-7\">\u201cIn all actions <em>based on contractual obligations, </em>upon a verdict, finding or order for judgment for pecuniary damages, interest shall be added by the clerk of the court to the amount of damages, at the contract rate, if established, or at the rate of twelve per cent per annum from the date of the breach or demand\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">By its terms, \u00a7 6C only applies to an action \u201cbased on contractual obligations.\u201d A contractual obligation may be created by an agreement or be imposed by statute, and \u00a7 6C applies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>contracts derived from both sources. <em>Lexington </em>v. <em>Bedford, </em>378 Mass. 562, 576 (1979). The plaintiff claims that he has a contractual right to his retirement benefits that is imposed by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 25 (5), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-4\"><em>\u201cEffect of Amendments or Repeal. </em>\u2014 The provisions of sections one to twenty-eight, inclusive, and of corresponding provisions of earlier laws shall be deemed to establish and to have established membership in the retirement system as a contractual relationship under which members who are or may be retired for superannuation are entitled to contractual rights and benefits, and no amendments or alterations shall be made that will deprive any such member or any group of such members of their pension rights or benefits provided for thereunder, if such member or members have paid the stipulated contributions specified in said sections or corresponding provisions of earlier laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">In <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>364 Mass. 847, 856-860 (1973), we declared that \u00a7 25 (5) was intended to reject the thesis suggested by a number of cases that contributory retirement plans were \u201cState-granted gratuities\u201d that did not establish contractual relationships with vested rights constitutionally protected against subsequent legislation reducing or eliminating retirement benefits. \u201cThe minimal meaning of this change is that the \u2018contract\u2019 is formed when a person becomes a member by entering the employment, and he is entitled to have the level of rights and benefits then in force preserved in substance in his favor without modification downwards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 860. We added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-6\">\u201c \u2018Contract\u2019 . . . should be understood here in a special, somewhat relaxed sense. . . . It is not really feasible \u2014nor would it be desirable \u2014 to fit so complex and dynamic a set of arrangements as a statutory retirement scheme into ordinary contract law which posits as its model a joining of the wills of mutually assenting individuals to form a specific bargain. As the commentators show, a retirement plan for public employees does not readily submit itself to analysis according to Professor Williston\u2019s canons. . . . When, therefore, the characterization \u2018contract\u2019 is used, it is best understood as meaning that the retirement scheme has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>generated material expectations on the part of employees and those expectations should in substance be respected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 861. In contrast with a traditional contract, the contractual commitment provided in \u00a7 25 (5) \u201cprotects the member of a retirement plan in the core of his reasonable expectations, but not against subtractions which, although possibly exceeding the trivial, can claim certain practical justifications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 862. Therefore, \u00a7 25 (5) creates \u201csomething less than a full contractual relationship, but one that protects the \u2018core\u2019 of a member\u2019s \u2018reasonable expectations\u2019 of \u2018vested pension rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>446 Mass. 698, 706 (2006), quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 856-862.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In the <em>Woodward </em>case, we noted that, \u201c[wjhere the Legislature intended to give a retirement board ... an \u2018action in contract\u2019 under G. L. c. 32, it did so explicitly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 705-706, and statutes cited. We held in that case that a pension forfeiture is not an action in contract, and we therefore concluded that the State Board of Retirement had the authority to forfeit the pension of a convicted public official after the expiration of the six-year statute of limitations for contract actions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 706. Where the forfeiture of a pension is not an action in contract, an action challenging the lawfulness of the forfeiture of a pension is also not an action in contract. See <em>id. </em>Cf. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>414 Mass. 340, 342 (1993) (nothing in G. L. c. 32 suggests that claims for accidental death benefits are contractual). Therefore, we conclude that interest may not be awarded under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, because judicial review of the board\u2019s decision to forfeit the plaintiff\u2019s pension is based on \u201csomething less\u201d than a contractual obligation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>The plaintiff on appeal contends, in the alternative, that he is entitled to an award of interest under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6H.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 6H is a catch-all interest provision that applies to \u201cany action in which damages are awarded, but in which interest on said damages is not otherwise provided by law,\u201d and provides for interest at twelve per cent per annum calculated from the commencement of the suit. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6H.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B. By its terms, therefore, \u00a7 6H does not apply if interest is \u201cotherwise provided by law.\u201d We conclude that \u00a7 6H does not apply to this judgment because another rate of interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>\u2022\u2014 the interest rate that will yield the \u201cactuarial equivalent,\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 l<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 has been \u201cotherwise provided by law\u201d under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 20 (5) <em>(c) </em>(2), which applies when a retirement board makes an error regarding a benefit determination or calculation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">By enacting \u00a7 20 (5) (c) (2), the Legislature \u201crecognize[d] that, in a complicated system of this type, errors are bound to occur.\u201d <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>McCormick, </em>345 Mass. 692, 698 n.5 (1963). While the statute speaks of errors in record-keeping and computation, its overriding purpose is to enable a retirement board to correct an honest error by putting members and beneficiaries in the same position they would have been had the error not been made. Cf. <em>Bianchi </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Somerville, </em>359 Mass. 642, 650 (1971) (\u201cThe error in the present case was that of the board, and that error can readily and fairly be corrected now without prejudice to the board, [the decedent\u2019s] estate or the widow\u201d); <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>McCormick, supra </em>at 698 (\u201cWe see nothing in the statute which prevents a member from receiving those benefits because of an honest error which can readily and fairly be corrected\u201d). Under the plain meaning of the statute, where a retired public employee receives a lesser amount of retirement benefits because of a record-keeping or computational error made by a retirement board, the retiree, once the error is discovered, shall receive the actuarial equivalent of the pension to which he is correctly entitled. We see no reason why the Legislature would have intended the corrective action by the board to be any different where the retired public employee erroneously was deprived of all his retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>benefits and where the board\u2019s error was an error of law rather than of record-keeping or computation. Therefore, we interpret \u00a7 20 (5) (c) (2) to provide a remedy for <em>all </em>errors made by the board that affect the amount of benefits a member or beneficiary receives, allowing the error to be corrected so that members and beneficiaries receive the actuarial equivalent of the benefits they would have received had the board not erred. Because the board\u2019s actuary must determine an appropriate interest rate to yield the actuarial equivalent, the interest rate must be determined by the board, not the court clerk, on remand from a reversal of a board\u2019s decision under G. L. c. 30A.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For these reasons, we reverse the judgment awarding twelve per cent simple interest under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, on the retroactive award of superannuation retirement benefits, and order that the case be remanded to the Superior Court for entry of a judgment directing the board forthwith to determine the rate of interest that will yield the \u201cactuarial equivalent of the pension or benefit\u201d to which the plaintiff was correctly entitled under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 20 (5) (c) (2), and to make a one-time, lump-sum payment to the plaintiff amounting to the difference between that actuarial equivalent and the $191,165.76 that has already been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Employees of towns with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants who are pension-eligible and not teachers become members of the county retirement system.

L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), which provides in pertinent part, \u201cIn no event shall any member after final conviction of a criminal offense involving violation of the laws applicable to his office or position, be entitled to receive a retirement allowance under the provisions of section one to twenty-eight, inclusive . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b824-8\">The judge believed that he was bound to award interest under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, by what he understood to be the controlling authority in <em>Thibodeau </em>v. Seekonk, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 69 (2001) <em>(Thibodeau II). </em>The plaintiff in that case had been demoted to a lieutenant from his position as captain in the Seekonk fire department, but the department failed to provide the local retire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>ment board with the written notice then required under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2), as amended through St. 1982, c. 630, \u00a7 21, and repealed by St. 1996, c. 306, \u00a7 19, thereby rendering the demotion ineffective. <em>Thibodeau </em>v. <em>Seekonk, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 367, 367-368 (1996) <em>(Thibodeau I). </em>After the Appeals Court determined in <em>Thibodeau I </em>that the plaintiff was entitled to restoration to his position as fire captain and the back pay he would have earned in that position, see <em>id. </em>at 372, the primary issue in <em>Thibodeau II </em>was whether he was entitled to twelve per cent interest on that award from the date of his demotion under \u00a7 6C or from the date of filing of his complaint under \u00a7 6H. <em>Thibodeau II, supra </em>at 72. The Appeals Court held that the plaintiff was entitled to an interest award under \u00a7 6C. <em>Id. </em>at 73-74. In contrast with the instant case, the damages at issue in <em>Thibodeau II </em>were back pay, not retirement benefits, and the statute at issue included a remedy provision that expressly stated that a wronged employee should be restored to his former position \u201cwithout loss of compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72. Given these quite different circumstances, we conclude that the judge\u2019s ruling should not have been controlled by the holding in <em>Thibodeau II. </em>In any event, the holding is not controlling on this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b825-11\">The plaintiff did not argue in the Superior Court that he was entitled to an award of interest under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6H; nor did the judge address \u00a7 6H in his order awarding interest. Although we generally deem issues that are not argued below to be waived, see <em>Carey </em>v. <em>New England Organ Bank, </em>446 Mass. 270, 285 (2006), we will address whether \u00a7 6H applies to this action because the issue is of importance to the thousands of members of the Commonwealth\u2019s various contributory retirement systems and was fully briefed by the parties.
