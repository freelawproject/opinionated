That defendant had a regular passenger depot at Henrietta, and that the platform upon which plaintiff alighted was the usual and customary place for a passenger to alight from defendant\u2019s cars; that it was gross carelessness and negligence for defendant to let said spike lie on said platform, and that it was defendant\u2019s duty to keep said platform free from all obstructions; that the plaintiff did not know said spike was lying there when he placed his foot upon it, and could not have so known by the use of ordinary and reasonable diligence; and by reason of stepping upon said spike, plaintiff\u2019s foot has sustained permanent injury, and plaintiff has been rendered a cripple for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\u201c Defendant answered by general demurrer, general denial, and plea of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">\u201c The cause was tried on the 14th day of July, 1891, and resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $1500.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">The case was proven substantially as alleged. The verdict of the jury was sustained by the evidence in ascribing the injury complained of to the negligence of appellant without fault on the part of appellee. The charge of the court was as favorable to appellant as the law would warrant, if not more so. It submitted only ordinary negligence, and not that high degree of care imposed where the passenger is held to be the bailee of the carrier. The assignments of error only call in question the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict and the action of the court in giving and refusing charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">The judgment will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
