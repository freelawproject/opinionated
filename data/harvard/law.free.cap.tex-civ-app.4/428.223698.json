Interest on Stipulated Attorney Fee.\u2014Where a stipulated rate of interest is contained in a note providing for an attorney fee in case if placed in hands of an attorney for collection, it is not error to allow the contract interest upon the entire judgment, including the stipulated attorney fee.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-15\">Appeal from the County Court of Llano.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"Af7\">Tried below before Hon.

If citation is merely defective, and defendant does not take his exceptions at the proper time, he can not be heard to urge it as error in appellate court. Cave v. City of Houston, 65 Texas, 622; Crain v. Griffis, 14 Texas, 358. The general rule is, a party will not be heard in the appellate court until he has exhausted his remedies in the lower court. Morris v. Gordon, 36 Texas, 72; Allen v. Traylor, 31 Texas, 125; Hopkins v. Donahoe, 4 Texas, 336, 338; Bank v. Lee, 13 Pet., 119; Buckley\u2019s Admr. v. Howard, 35 Texas, 566; Pierson v. Burney, 15 Texas, 274. Where there was a mere clerical error in the writ, which might have been amended, but the defendant was silent in the court below, suffering judgment to go against Mm by default, he can not make the objection avail him in the appellate court. The State v. Franklin, 35 Texas, 499.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-18\">2.
