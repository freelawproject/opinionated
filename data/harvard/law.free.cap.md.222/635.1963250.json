Fleury under the Post Conviction Procedure Act, and for the further reason stated below, Fleury\u2019s application for leave to appeal is denied. Judge Sodaro found that Fleury\u2019s allegations of the State\u2019s knowing use of perjured testimony were so vague and indefinite as to be insufficient. To this we add that his application admits that the allegedly untrue testimony does not appear in the transcript of the testimony of his trial and that the record of his hearing under the Post Conviction Procedure Act shows no effort or testimony on Fleury\u2019s part to substantiate the allegations of his petition as to this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
