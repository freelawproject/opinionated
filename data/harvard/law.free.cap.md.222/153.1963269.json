The decision below was that the father took, and the infant son, by his guardian, appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The will of J. Beauregard Clarke, a resident of Anne Arundel County who died in 1913, leaving a will executed two weeks before his death, left the residue of his estate in trust to pay the income to his widow for life, and at her death to his son Ernest for life and \u201cfrom and after the death of my said son * * * then to his issue, absolutely.\u201d Ernest Clarke had three sons. One died before his father without issue; the other two survived their father, and are now living. Of these two, Thomas has no children, and Robert Fulton, one child\u2014 Robert Fulton Clarke, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">In 1950, while Ernest Clarke, the life tenant, was still living, his grandson, Robert Fulton Clarke, Jr., by his mother, the divorced wife of Robert Fulton Clarke, brought suit for a declaration of his interest in the trust estate, for an accounting by the trustee and for protection against dissipation of the estate. The chancellor decreed that \u201cby a true construction of the will * * * the word \u2018issue\u2019 means all descendants of J. Ernest Clarke,\u201d and that his grandson, Robert Fulton Clarke, Jr., \u201chas a contingent remainder in the trust property dependent upon his survival of J. Ernest Clarke, upon which event he will be entitled to share equally with other descendants living at J. Ernest Clarke\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">It was further ordered that the substituted trustee file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>report of her administration, and a bond for faithful performance. The appeal was from that decree, and the chief contention of J. Ernest Clarke, his wife Angela, the substituted trustee, and their two sons, Thomas and Robert Fulton, was that the word \u201cissue\u201d in the will should be construed to include only the children of J. Ernest Clarke, and the infant plaintiff thus had no interest in the trust estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">This Court rejected that contention in the case entitled <em>In re Clarke's Will, </em>198 Md. 266, and held that the infant had a potential future interest in the corpus of the trust sufficient to sustain the action of the chancellor in requiring the substituted trustee to account and post bond. All other questions, including the infant\u2019s contention that at the death of his grandfather Ernest, the life tenant, he would be entitled to share <em>per capita </em>with his surviving children and descendants even though his father should also then be alive, were held to be prematurely presented and \u201creserved for future determination as the need may arise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">When the life tenant died in 1958 and the trust estate was ready for distribution, the need arose to decide the infant\u2019s claim to equality with his uncle and his father. The chancellor held that the uncle and father took in equal shares to the exclusion of the infant, saying the testator had used \u201cissue\u201d as the equivalent of \u201cchildren.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The parties agree that \u201cissue\u201d is used as a word of purchase, as a word indicating the class who are to take at the death of the life tenant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They agree, further, that no evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>dence of intent as to what the testator meant by the word \u201cissue\u201d can be found in the will or in the evidence. We concur in both instances. The opinion in the first appeal established that its meaning was broader than \u201cchildren,\u201d a meaning it often has been given.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Miller, <em>Construction of Wills in Maryland, </em>Sec. 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">We accept the contention of the infant appellant that the word \u201cissue\u201d was used by the testator to mean \u201cdescendants.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The decision that \u201cissue\u201d means \u201call descendants\u201d does not answer the ultimate and narrower question in the case\u2014do the descendants of different generations take equally, or do those of the younger generation take only as representatives of deceased ancestors, that is, can a child compete with a living parent?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The infant says the answers to the questions are in the affirmative on the strength of the English rule (that \u201cissue,\u201d unqualified when used as a word of purchase, is the equivalent of \u201cdescendants\u201d and that the descendants, of whatever generation, take <em>per </em>capita\u2014as was held in <em>Davenport v. Hanbury </em>(Ch. 1796), 3 Ves. 257, 30 Eng. Rep. 999, for example), which, he claims, the Maryland cases long ago made the law of this State. His father and his uncle argue that the later cases indicate that Maryland has adopted the rule of the <em>Restatement, Property, Future Interests, </em>Sec. 303\u2014\u201cWhen a conveyance creates a class gift by a limitation in favor of a group described as the \u2018issue of B,\u2019 or as the \u2018descendants of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>B,\u2019 * * * then, unless a contrary intent * * * is found * * * distribution is made to such members of the class as would take, and in such shares as they would receive, under the applicable law of intestate succession if B had died intestate * * '*\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The comment, speaking of the English rule, said, \u201cWhatever justification this construction may have had in its origin, it is clear that its retention in the United States at the present time would cause serious deviations from the intent normally present in the mind of a conveyor limiting property to the \u2018issue of B.\u2019 \u201d The comment continues, referring to the Restatement rule: \u201cThis rule rests upon the fact that conveyors normally use \u2018issue\u2019 as substantially the equivalent of \u2018heirs of the body,\u2019 and seldom desire the inequalities between stirpes which were unavoidable under the earlier English rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">We have found no direct, no binding decision on the point in Maryland.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There are cases in which the English rule has-been referred to as stated but in all of them the basis of decision was the intent of the conveyor disclosed by the instrument. In <em>McPherson v. </em>Snowden, 19 Md. 197, 227-230, which cited <em>Davenport v. Hanbury, </em>a deed of trust gave income for life to four daughters (the children of any daughter-dying to take the mother\u2019s share during the continuance of the trust), after the death of the last daughter to die, the corpus was given outright to \u201call the issue of all the daugh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>ters.\u201d A concessum in the case was that \u201cissue\u201d meant \u201cchildren.\u201d From the contrast between the disposition of income which the children of a deceased life tenant took as her representatives, and the disposition of corpus to children \u201caggregated into a class, with no relation to their parents which would indicate that the issue should take through them,\u201d and from the terms of the grant of corpus (\u201cto all the issue of all the daughters,\u201d) the Court found a clear intent to make the children the \u201cimmediate and equal recipients\u201d of the trust estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In <em>Allender v. Keplinger, </em>62 Md. 7, the will directed the distribution of the corpus after the death of the last life tenant \u201cequally\u201d and \u201cshare and share alike\u201d among their issue. A clear intent was found that the surviving children and grandchildren of the life tenants (the parents of the grandchildren were dead) were to take equally, that is, <em>per capita.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In <em>Levering v. Orrick, 97 </em>Md. 139, the will expressly ordered a <em>per capita </em>distribution among the descendants of a life tenant. A reference to the English rule clearly was dictum, since the express direction for a <em>per capita </em>division was a clear evidence of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">In <em>Requardt v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>143 Md. 431, 434, there were three equitable life tenants and children of a deceased life tenant took his share of the income during the continuance of the trust. No distribution of corpus was to be made until the death of the last of the life tenants to die. Then the will declared, \u201csaid trust shall cease and the corpus be divided equally among their surviving children.\u201d Speaking of the direction for equality of division, the Court held: \u201cA distribution <em>per stirpes </em>would not satisfy that requirement. It would result in an unequal division of the estate among the designated remaindermen. It is only by a <em>per capita </em>distribution that the testator\u2019s declared purpose as to the disposition of the corpus can be given effect.\u201d The Court then referred to other cases in which the use of the words \u201cequally\u201d or \u201cshare and share alike\u201d were found to evidence an intent to require a <em>per capita </em>distribution, and noted the dictum in <em>Levering v. Orrick, supra, </em>that the English rule is that a gift to \u201cdescendants\u201d <em>simpliciter, </em>as well as \u201cequally\u201d or \u201cshare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>and share alike,\u201d imports a per capita distribution to all descendants, of whatever generation. Clearly, this observation was not a necessary basis of decision in a case where plain intent was evidenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">When we turn the coin we find that the Maryland cases stamped on that side favor the proponents of the rule of the Restatement, the appellees, to perhaps a slightly greater degree than those on the reverse side do the proponent of the English rule, the infant appellant, but that they are, by no means, conclusive of the question to be answered in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In <em>Henderson v. Henderson, </em>64 Md. 185, 192, the disposition was to three equitable life tenants, children of the testatrix, with remainders to their \u201clineal descendants\u201d\u2014-subject to provisions \u201cin case either of my said children should die without leaving issue.\u201d One child died before the testatrix. When she died her other two children claimed absolute estates under the rule in Shelley\u2019s case. The Court held that the Rule did not apply and that the children of the deceased child of the testatrix took an absolute interest in one-third of the estate, and that \u201cit is also apparent that a trustee should be appointed * * * and that he should hold one-third of the property for each of the surviving children of the testatrix; and that on the death of either of said children of the testatrix, the share thus held should go, absolutely and free from the trust, to his or her issue, if there be any then living, <em>per stirpes * </em>* There was no discussion of the holding of the case that the distribution should be per stirpes.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">In <em>Thomas v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>73 Md. 451, the language of the will was \u201cat the death of my said daughters, or any of them, her share to pass to her issue, children or descendants * * The Court said: \u201cThe plain meaning of these words would seem to be that the testator intended to make provision for children in the first instance, if any, and for the descendants of deceased children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\"><em>Mazziotte v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>180 Md. 48, was a case where the testator directed that upon the death of all the life tenants the trust should cease and the corpus be delivered \u201cto the issue of my said four daughters, living at the termination of the trust per capita.\u201d The contest was be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>tween children and grandchildren of the life tenants. The eminent lawyer who represented the guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the infant grandchildren (who would take if the distribution were <em>per </em>capita) argued first in his brief that \u201cissue\u201d was synonymous with \u201cdescendants\u201d and that where there is a distribution to \u201cissue\u201d <em>simpliciter, </em>it includes all descendants, who take <em>per capita </em>even though, in so doing, they take shares along with their living ancestors. Apparently in answer to this contention, Judge Bond for the Court said at page 50 of 180 Md.: \u201cThe word \u2018issue\u2019 in the disputed clause is clearly one of purchase. * * * And standing alone, the meaning of it has been a subject of difference of opinion. * * * Primarily, it embraces all lineal descendants. * * * But in Maryland it has usually been found equivalent to heirs of the body or those who would take in case of intestacy, thus rendering gifts to remoter descendants only substitutional, in place of gifts to deceased ancestors. <em>Horwitz v. Safe Deposit Co., </em>172 Md. 437, 451, 192 A. 281; Miller, <em>supra, </em>Sec. 358, p. 1012.\u201d Having disposed of the first contention of the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>the Court held the meaning of the word \u201cissue\u201d was always a question of intention and that since the gift to issue had been expressly <em>per capita, </em>remoter descendants would share equally with their parents, citing among other authorities <em>Restatement, Property, Future Interests, </em>Sec. 303, Comment (i). In his brief counsel for the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>in arguing his second point\u2014that the words <em>\u201cper capita,\u201d </em>showed an intent for equal divisions among children and grandchildren\u2014had directed the attention of the court to the rule of per stirpes distribution (which he designated the minority rule) and to the fact that the <em>\u201cRestatement of Property, Future Interests, which has adopted the position of the minority insofar as a remainder to \u2018issue\u2019 is concerned, </em>specifically supports the contention of the appellant that where the remainder is \u2018to issue per capita\u2019 children must share with their living parents,\u201d citing Sec. 303 (i). (Emphasis supplied.).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The language of Judge Bond, which has been quoted, does not refer to Sec. 303 (1) of the <em>Restatement, Property, Future Interests, </em>but its meaning is the same as that section, as is made manifest by the comment to Sec. 1, paragraph a, page <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>1658: \u201cThe change from the English rule began with increased emphasis upon the constructional factors sufficient to cause \u2018issue\u2019 to be construed <em>as substantially similar </em>to \u2018heirs of the body\u2019 and hence to cause the ascertainment of the takers thereunder by reference to the statute of intestate distribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The concurring opinion of Judge Henderson in <em>Patchell v. Groom, </em>185 Md. 10 (in which Judge Collins and Judge Marked joined), agreed with the majority that descendants of living ancestors do not share in a distribution to descendants \u201cthen living <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita,\u201d </em>but disagreed with the holding of the Court that the stocks of descent were the grandchildren of the testator and not his children, the life tenants. The concurring opinion referred to the view of the <em>Restatement, Property, Future Interests, </em>Sec. 303, that in a gift to a class composed of the issue of B or the descendants of B, distribution is made to those who would take and in such shares as they would receive under the applicable law of intestate succession. It was then said: \u201cIn so far as the Restatement requires distribution <em>per stirpes </em>of a gift to \u2018descendants\u2019 or \u2018issue,\u2019 without more, this reflects a change from the early English authorities, as to \u2018issue,\u2019 and from a dictum of Mr. Jarman in his first edition, as to \u2018descendants,\u2019 quoted by this Court in <em>Levering v. Orrick, 97 </em>Md. 139, 145, 54 A. 620, and by the majority opinion in the case at bar. The rule of the Restatement was, however, adopted by this court in <em>Mazziotte v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., supra.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">The views of the concurring minority in <em>Patchell v. Groom, supra, </em>became those of the Court in <em>Ballenger v. McMillan, </em>205 Md. 94, where again the distribution was to descendants of the grantor of the trust after the death of the life tenants, and was expressly directed to be made <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita. </em>The holding was that the children of the grantor were the stocks of descent, and the Court quoted at length Judge Henderson\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Patchell, </em>including the sentence that the Restatement rule had been adopted as Maryland law by the court in <em>Mazziotte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">The infant plaintiff here argues that Judge Bond\u2019s paraphrase of the Restatement rule in <em>Mazziotte </em>did not mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>what it would appear to mean literally, but was talking of the word \u201cissue\u201d when construed as a word of limitation. Although the statement was made in connection with a will executed before 1912, it was made (a) in a case in which, like the one before us, the rule in Shelley\u2019s case was not applicable because the life estates were equitable and the remainders legal and (b) in a case in which the Restatement rule (Sec. 303) of per stirpes distribution where \u201cissue\u201d is used without more had been cited to the Court and (c) after the legislature had abolished the rule in Shelley\u2019s case by Ch. 144 of the Acts of 1912, now Code (1957), Art. 93, sec. 366, by providing specifically that \u201cany form of words\u201d that limit a remainder, after a life estate to \u201cheirs of the body\u201d should be construed as words of purchase. The appellant argues further that if it was intended to mean what it literally says, it was dictum and that the dictum has been perpetuated and compounded by dictum in the concurring opinion in <em>Patchell </em>and the majority opinion in <em>Ballenger. </em>Certainly it is true that Judge Bond\u2019s statement was not necessary to the decision in <em>Mazziotte, </em>although as we have noted, it has more force than it would otherwise because it was a direct answer to, and dispositive of, a contention pressed earnestly and at some length by distinguished counsel in the case. It is equally true that the reference to Sec. 303 of the Restatement was not necessary to the conclusion reached by Judges Henderson, Collins and Markell in their concurring opinion in <em>Patchell, </em>nor to the result reached by the Court in <em>Ballenger, </em>although it strengthened their conclusions, because the distribution under Sec. 303 would have been to the same persons who took under the decisions in those cases. Also, the statement in the concurring opinion in <em>Patchell, </em>repeated in <em>Ballenger </em>that the view of the Restatement had been adopted as Maryland law in <em>Mazziotte </em>may have read more into Judge Bond\u2019s language than this Court then intended.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nevertheless, it would seem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>that approval of the Restatement rule has been indicated by this Court, at least implicitly, three times, as well as by Judges Henderson, Collins and Markell, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The first two instances were <em>Mazziotte </em>and <em>Ballenger, </em>and the third is <em>Robinson v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>214 Md. 30, in which the <em>Restatement, Property, </em>Sec. 303 (1), was quoted, as was comment (e) thereon, which states that where issue consisted of children of B and grandchildren of B, who are children of a living child of B, the grandchildren are wholly excluded from sharing in the distribution of the subject matter of the class gift unless a \u201c \u2018contrary intent of the conveyor is found from additional language or circumstances.\u2019 \u201d In <em>Robinson </em>the distribution was directed to be made \u201cto the issue or descendants of said Emanuel E. Robinson living at that time, <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita,\u201d </em>from which the Court found that the intent was that the distribution was to be stirpital, quoting comment (h) to Sec. 303 of the Restatement that conveyances \u201cfrequently contain language or have circumstances tending to corroborate the conclusions that the term \u2018issue\u2019 or \u2018descendants\u2019 has been used as substantially the equivalent of \u2018heirs of the body\u2019 and hence that distribution should be made in accordance with the law of intestate succession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Faced with the situation where we find no case a conclusive and controlling precedent, we think the meaning of \u201cissue\u201d should be determined as the Restatement suggests. The English cases, which form the basis of the dicta in the cases relied on by the infant appellant, reached the result they did with reluctance and from force of necessity, as the judges of that day saw it. 3 Page, <em>Wills, </em>Sec. 1079 (Lifetime Ed.), notes that the English decisions originally came at a time when the share of a member of a class who died before testator, passed to the other members of the class, and not to his heirs or legal representatives, and then says: \u201cThe courts felt that they had no choice between permitting grandchildren to share equally with their parents and excluding them entirely, although they conceded that testator probably intended grandchildren whose parents were dead to take their parents\u2019 shares, and grandchildren whose parents were alive, to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>nothing. Being unable to give effect to testator\u2019s entire intention they preferred not to disinherit the grandchildren whose parents had died before testator, even at the expense of permitting the other grandchildren to take equally with their parents.\u201d Professor Page then points out that statutes with reference to lapse now prevent this result in almost all cases, and then says: \u201cIf the courts restrict \u2018issue\u2019 to the first generation, and distribute per capita, with representation if any of the first generation have died after the will was made and before testator dies, they will reach the result which the English courts wished to reach but could not. Some of the American states have construed such a gift in this way.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u201cOther courts persist in applying the English rule, and in dividing per capita among all generations, including those whose parents are living. Where this rule is still in force it is an interesting example of a rule, undesirable from the first, and selected only as a choice of evils, which has persisted so long that it is strong enough to force recognition although the alternative evil has ceased to exist, and the choice of the result which was desired from the first is perfectly possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The trend of the cases in other states is strongly in favor of the rule of the Restatement. In several instances Courts have reversed or repudiated earlier decisions favoring the English rule and have adopted the rule of the Restatement and, in so doing, have pointed out, as did Professor Page, the reluctance of the English Courts to reach what they considered an undesirable result, unwanted by the testator. States in which this has been done include: <em>Pennsylvania\u2014In re Mayhew\u2019s Estate, </em>160 A. 724 (see also <em>In re Thorn\u2019s Estate, </em>46 A. 2d 258); Rhode <em>Island\u2014Rhode Island Hospital Trust Company v. Bridgham, </em>106 A. 149; <em>Minnesota\u2014In re Thompson\u2019s Estate, </em>279 N. W. 574. Other states increasingly have found the intention of the testator, where unrevealed except by the use of the word \u201cissue\u201d or \u201cdescendants,\u201d to be that surviving members of the first generation share among themselves per capita, with those of subsequent generations whose ancestors have died, taking by representation. Massachusetts was one of the earliest. In <em>Dexter v. Inches, </em>17 N. E. 551, 554, Justice Holmes said for the Supreme Judicial Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Massachusetts: \u201cThe difficulty which was felt by Lord Loughborough, in <em>Freeman v. Parsley, </em>3 Ves. 421, in finding a medium between total exclusion of grandchildren and the admission of them to share with their parents, does not strike us as insuperable, * * *\u201d and in <em>Jackson v. Jackson, </em>26 N. E. 1112, the court made the fiat holding, which has since been followed in the State, that \u201cwhen by a will personal property is given in trust to pay the income to a person during life, and on the death of such person to pay the principal sum to his issue then living, it is to be presumed that the intention was that the issue should include all lineal descendants, and that they should take <em>per stirpes, </em>unless from some other language of the will a contrary intention appears.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Other decisions reaching the same conclusion include: <em>Wyeth v. Crane </em>(Ill.), 174 N. E. 871, and <em>Wilmington Trust Co. v. Chapman </em>(Del. Chan.), 171 A. 222. Connecticut and South Carolina have reached the same result by holding that the meaning of \u201cissue\u201d is equivalent to that of the phrase \u201cheirs of the body.\u201d See <em>Greenwich Trust Co. v. Shiveley </em>(Conn.), 147 A. 367, and <em>Rembert v. Vetoe </em>(S. C.), 71 S. E. 959. New Jersey seems to be the only State which continues to adhere strongly to the English rule. The writers in the law reviews generally support the Restatement rule and predict that more and more courts will follow it. See Schnebly, <em>Testamentary Gifts to \"Issue,\u201d </em>35 Yale L.

The Rule in Shelley\u2019s case does not have application for several reasons. The will was executed after the abolition of the Rule by Ch. 144 of the Acts of 1912, Code (1957), Art. 93, Sec. 366. Also, the estate of the life tenant was equitable, those of the remainder-men are legal; the two not being of the same quality, the Rule would not apply. <em>Cowman v. Classen, </em>156 Md. 428, 435-436. And see <em>Timanus v.

A testator died leaving an equitable life estate to his son, and upon the death of the son, \u201cthen to his (the son\u2019s) issue, absolutely.\u201d The parties agree that the word issue is a word of purchase, i.e., it names the person or class in whom a new estate of inheritance is created;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that there is nothing additional in the will nor in the evidence to indicate the testator\u2019s intent as to the actual mode of distribution. A previous appeal in this case determined that the word \u201cissue\u201d was not the equivalent of \u201cchildren,\u201d an interpretation which, however, has been frequently accorded it. Miller, <em>op. cit., </em>Section 90.

Maryland adopted and has adhered to what is termed the \u201cgeneral\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u201cbasic\u201d rule, while Massachusetts adopted and adhered to a minority rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, we find in 2 A.L.R. 963, the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">\u201cIt is very generally held, except in Massachusetts, that under a gift to \u2018issue,\u2019 where the word is used without any terms in the context to qualify its meaning, the children of the ancestor and the issue of such children, although the parent is living, as well as the issue of deceased children, take in equal shares per capita, and not per stirpes, as primary objects of the disposition. See McPherson v. Snow-den (1862) 19 Md. 197; [and citations from other states] * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">\u201cIn Massachusetts, however, the courts have adopted the converse rule that the word \u2018issue,\u2019 where its meaning is unrestricted by the context, will be construed as importing representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">I turn now to the Maryland decisions and authorities, and I shall cite one English case cited with approval by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">In Miller, <em>Construction of Wills, </em>Section 96, we find the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">\u201cin bequests to \u2018descendants equally,\u2019 or to \u2018all the descendants\u2019 of any person, or the \u2018descendants\u2019 simply (without the word \u2018equally\u2019 or \u2018all\u2019), [in other words, when used as words of purchase] the rule is that all take per capita unless a contrary intention appears. Moreover in such a gift each individual of the stock takes an equal share <em>concurrently with, not in place of, his or her parent; </em>but where the distribution is to be per stirpes [when \u2018descendants\u2019 is used as a word of limitation] the principle of representation will be applied through all degrees, * v * \u201d (Emphasis supplied.) See also Section 91.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>In this statement, Mr. Miller is supported by a long line of Maryland and English decisions. The early case of <em>Davenport v. Hanbury </em>(1796), 3 Ves. 257, seems to be the leading English case involving the construction of the word \u201cissue,\u201d without qualifying words, and the proper mode of distribution under a will where the term \u201cissue\u201d is so used. The Court carefully considered other cases where, because of other words in the wills, it was held that \u201cissue\u201d should take <em>per stirpes, </em>then stated, \u201c[t]his case depends entirely upon the construction of these words, \u2018to Mary Davenport or her issue\u2019 \u201d; and held that \u201cissue,\u201d as there used, was a word of purchase, and when so used it had \u201calways been considered as synonymous to and the same as \u2018descendants\u2019; and whoever can make himself out a descendant of the person, to whose issue the bequest is made, had a right to be considered <em>persona designata </em>in that bequest,\u201d and that the distribution should be <em>per capita </em>(in this instance the descendants were one child and two grandchildren). This case was followed in later English decisions, which it will be unnecessary to discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"ASM\">In <em>McPherson v. Snowden, </em>19 Md. 197, the Court considered a trust made by deed which provided for the payment of income to four daughters of D, \u201cand from and after the death of all of the aforesaid daughters * * *, then for the use and behoof of all of the issue of all of the daughters of * * * [D] and their heirs, in fee-simple.\u201d The parties agreed that the word \u201cissue\u201d as there used was the equivalent of children, and the question arose as to whether there should be a <em>per stirpes or per capita </em>distribution among the children of the daughters. The Court pointed out the well-recognized principle that in a deed, at common law, the word \u201cissue\u201d was a word of <em>purchase, </em>and said, \u201c[i]f, therefore, the issue of the daughters take in their own right [because the word \u201cissue\u201d was a word of purchase as in the instant case], and not by representation, they take <em>per capita. </em>See <em>Davenport v. Hanbury, </em>3 Vesey, 260.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">In <em>Allender v. Keplinger, </em>62 Md. 7, the same principle was applied. There, however, the will directed that the property be \u201cequally\u201d divided among the \u201clawful issue\u201d of testator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>three children. Distribution was made <em>per capita </em>among the children and grandchildren of the testator\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">In <em>Levering v. Orrick, </em>97 Md. 139, a <em>per capita </em>division among descendants of two deceased persons was ordered by the will, with a direction that the descendants were to be considered as <em>purchasers. </em>In holding that all of the children <em>and grandchildren </em>of the two deceased persons took equally, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">\u201cIn bequests to descendants equally, or to all the descendants of any person, or to the descendants simply, the rule is all take <em>per capita </em>unless a contrary intention appears.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 2 <em>Redfield on Wills, </em>36 and and 74; 1 <em>Roper on Legacies, </em>126. The following are instances of the application of the rule. \u2018\u00bf4,000 to the descendants of Frances Ince.\u2019 Held, that great grandchildren were entitled to share with grandchildren. <em>Crossley v. Clare, </em>Ambler, 397. \u2018Legacy to the descendants of A and B equally.\u2019 Children and grandchildren take <em>per capita. Butler v. Stratton, </em>3 Brown\u2019s Ch. 367. \u2018Under the provisions of a will that the residue of an estate is to be equally divided between my brothers Edwin and Charles\u2019 children,\u2019 the distribution is to be made <em>per capita. McIntire v. McIntire, </em>14 App. D. C. 339.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">\u201cIn the present case Mrs. Thomas being the last of the sisters, her share cannot pass to her <em>surviving </em>sisters, and can only pass to their <em>descendants, in which case the rule of law is that the distribution must be per capita, unless a contrary intention appears; and here a per capita distribution is expressly ordered, </em>* * (Emphasis partly supplied.) It will be noticed the principle by this time had become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>so firmly established, the Court refers to it as a rule of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\"><em>Requardt v. Safe Deposit and Trust Co., </em>143 Md. 431, was a case where the income was devised to testator\u2019s brothers and sisters with a provision that on the death of any of the brothers or sisters their respective shares in the income should be paid to their issue until the last of the brothers and sisters died, when \u201csaid trust shall cease and the corpus divided equally among their surviving children.\u201d The Court held that there was a clear direction to distribute the corpus <em>per capita, </em>though there was a <em>per stirpes </em>division of the income, reaffirmed <em>McPherson v. Snowden, supra, </em>and repeated the rule that we have just quoted from <em>Levering v. Orrick, supra, </em>and Miller, <em>op. cit., </em>Section 96.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\"><em>Judik v. Travers, </em>184 Md. 215, is another case that forcefully states the Maryland rule that we now have under consideration. There, a <em>per stirpes </em>distribution was directed. In giving effect to the specific language used by the testator, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">\u201cThe rule is that all take per capita, unless a contrary intention appears, in cases of bequests to descendants equally, or to all the descendants of any person, or to descendants simply. <em>Levering v. Orrick, 97 </em>Md. 139, 145, 54 A. 620; <em>Requardt v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>143 Md. 431, 435, 122 A. 526. See also <em>In re Stone v. Baker, supra. </em>The testator in the instant <em>case obviously wanted to make clear that his intention was contrary to the rule on this point and that is precisely the effect of the language used to do so.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>The same statement was repeated in <em>Patchell v. Groom, </em>185 Md. 10, 14, 43 A. 2d 32; and in Singley, <em>Patchell and Groom, Revisited, </em>15 Md. L. Rev. 1, we find the learned author stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">\u201cIt should be emphasized that these cases were not concerned with a gift to \u2018my descendants equally\u2019; a gift to \u2018the descendants of A\u2019; or a gift to \u2018my descendants\u2019, without a direction or an implication that a stipital distribution was intended. In these examples, the rule is that all take <em>per capita, </em>in the absence of contrary intention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The latest expression upon the subject is found in <em>Robinson v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>214 Md. 30, 34, (1956), 132 A. 2d 841, cited in the majority opinion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There we quoted from <em>Lycett v. Thomas, </em>153 Md. as follows: \u201c \u2018We do not understand that there is any dispute about the general rule, that where there is a gift to a class [a fact conceded in the instant case], members of the class take per capita [which is not permitted by the majority opinion herein], unless the contrary intention clearly appears [that no contrary intention appears is another concessum in the case].\u2019 \u201d As a matter of fact the Court continued (153 Md. 446) that the rule \u201chas been so generally accepted that the citation of authorities seems almost superfluous. In Maryland,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> certainly, the decisions have been uniform from at least as far back as <em>Benson v. Wright, 4 </em>Md. Ch. 278, down to <em>Stahl v. Emery, </em>147 Md. 123.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">I am unable to reconcile these repeated statements of the rule of law in Maryland made and concurred in by so many of the judges, past and present, of this Court with the majority ruling in the present case. The majority, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>base their conclusion upon the fact that (quoting from their opinion) \u201cit would seem that approval of the Restatement rule [Section 303 (1)] has been indicated by this Court, <em>at least implicitly, </em>three times * * (Italics added.) This is the first appellate decision that has come to my attention that is based upon \u201cimplicit indications,\u201d when there were previous decisions explicitly to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The majority opinion refers to the <em>Mazziotte </em>[180 Md. 48] <em>Patchell, supra, </em>and <em>Ballenger </em>[205 Md. 94] cases. It concedes that a statement made by Judge Bond in <em>Mazziotte </em>[which was clearly a reference to the word \u201cissue\u201d when used as a word of limitation, which is plainly shown by reference to the authorities cited by him immediately following the statement] \u201cwas not necessary to the decision,\u201d and that \u201cthe statement in the concurring opinion in Patchell<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> * * * that the view of the Restatement [Section 303 (1)] had been adopted as Maryland law in <em>Mazziotte </em>may have read more into Judge Bond\u2019s language than this Court intended,\u201d but holds there was an implicit indication of approval of the Restatement [Section 303 (1)] in the three cases. Instead of reading \u201cmore into Judge Bond\u2019s language than this Court intended,\u201d the statement quoted in footnote 11 simply cannot be justified. There was no question of Section 303 (1) of Restatement involved in <em>Mazziotte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">In that case a testator had devised equitable life estates in realty to four daughters, with the provision that upon the death of all the daughters, \u201cthen the trust hereby created shall cease and * * * the trust property shall be paid * * * to the issue of my said four daughters living at the termination of the trust per capita.\u201d At the termination of the trust, the daughters left surviving them children and grandchildren, and the question arose as to the proper distribution of the trust fund. The Court stated that the word \u201cissue,\u201d as used in the will, was clearly one of purchase; that \u201cstanding alone, the meaning of it has been a subject of difference of opinion\u201d; but the word did not stand alone, the \u201ctakers are to be the issue per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>capita, and the qualification seems to dispose of the question of interpretation.\u201d The Court continued by pointing out that where the distribution is to be \u201camong issue per capita remoter descendants will share with their parents.\u201d In doing so, it referred to several out-of-state authorities and one of them was a part of comment (i) of Restatement, <em>Property, </em>Section 303, <em>viz., </em>\u201cwhen the issue take per capita and not per stirpes, a remoter descendant of B can share even though his parent is alive and shares.\u201d This Comment (i) of Restatement is entirely consistent with the Maryland rule that has been repeated so many times. The Court then held, as we should have here, that the grandchildren and great-grandchildren should share equally in the distribution. The case was another illustration of what was said in <em>Judik v. Travers, supra, </em>only this time the testator \u201cwanted to make clear that his intention was [not] contrary to the [Maryland] rule on this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">It should be noted that nowhere in the opinion in <em>Massiotte </em>is any reference made to Restatement, <em>Property, </em>Section 303, except the small portion of Comment (i) previously quoted, and we do not find the Restatement cited in support of the position of any of the parties in any of the briefs filed. Moreover, the case was not a proper one for the invocation of said Section 303 (1), as there was present in the will involved \u201ca contrary intent of the conveyor <em>* * </em>* found from additional language or circumstances,\u201d the absence of which is an explicit prerequisite to bringing Section 303 (1) into play. In fact, there was a specific holding in the case that the testator in ordering a distribution <em>per capita </em>had manifested an intention that his property be divided as the Court ordered, which, of course, was not in accordance with the Maryland law of intestate succession, but was in complete accord with the previous Maryland decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">There is no need to discuss in any detail the <em>Ballenger </em>and <em>Robinson </em>cases cited. In neither of these cases was any question of Section 303 (1) of Restatement involved. In each, there was a specific direction that the property be distributed <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita, </em>which, of course, made the section inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>In concluding, I wish to make it clear that I have not attempted to present the relative merits of the Massachusetts rule as adopted by Restatement in Section 303 (1), and the Maryland rule. There has been a trend toward the Massachusetts rule, and it may well be that it is the better one. If it be desirable for Maryland to reverse its time-honored and oft-repeated rule, I simply, but emphatically, suggest that it should be done by the Legislature and not by the Courts. In this manner, there would be an orderly and prospective integration of the new rule. As it is now, we do not know how many more wills there are in existence that will be affected by this complete change, nor how many beneficiaries there are who would have inherited except for the majority decision herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">On the Maryland authorities, cited above, I think the distribution should be in thirds\u2014one each to the sons of the deceased life tenant and the other to his grandchild.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Judge <em>Homey </em>has authorized me to say that he concurs in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\">. For examples, former Chief Judge Marbury, one of the ablest and most highly esteemed jurists this State has produced, who wrote the opinion in Patchell v. Groom, infra, and Frederick J. Singley, Jr., Esquire, whose splendid Md. L. Rev. article will be referred to later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\">. Words of limitation, of course, designate or limit the estate in the first taker. It is important in the case at bar to know the real distinction between words of purchase and words of limitation. When words of purchase are used, they designate the person or class to take, who take in their own right and not by representation, i.e., because they are heirs or distributees of an ancestor. Miller, Construction of Wills, Section 77. The statement in this note must be qualified by saying this was the Maryland rule before the filing of the majority opinion herein, as will be demonstrated in the remainder of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b185-9\">. This acceptance was due primarily to the decision in the previous appeal, In Re Clarke\u2019s Will, 198 Md. 266, where it was held the word \u201cissue\u201d did not mean \u201cchildren\u201d but \u201cdescendants.\u201d While not of controlling force, it is interesting to note that the majority make no mention or explanation of this significant language used in the opinion at page 271: \u201cIn the instant case there are several reasons why we think the word [issue] should be given the broader meaning [descendants instead of children], * * * The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>testator could have had no particular persons in mind, since his son did not marry until three years after the testator\u2019s death. <em>There is nothing to indicate that the testator intended to prefer his putative grandchildren over his putative great grandchildren.\u201d </em>It is obvious that the present holding of the majority does prefer the grandchildren even to the <em>exclusion </em>of the great-grandchild. [Italics added in the quotation.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b186-11\">. In support of this statement, they adopt the rather unusual practice of citing an opinion of the late Judge Lawrence, at nisi prius, to the effect that the interpretation of the word \u201cissue,\u201d simpliciter, was a novel one in Maryland. The learned judge would have had to have gone no further than to turn to the early case of Goldsborough v. Martin, 41 Md. 488 (1875), wherein it was said, \u201c[t]he term \u2018issue\u2019 is here used without restriction, and embraces all lineal descendants of the daughter,\u201d to see that this statement is not accurate. If this quotation, alone, be not sufficient to show the statement inaccurate, see the interpretation placed upon the opinion in 2 A. L. R. 931. See also Timanus v. Dugan, 46 Md. 402, where the devise was to \u201cissue in fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">The holding of Judge Lawrence was simply that the word \u201cissue\u201d as used in the will before him meant \u201cchildren,\u201d an interpretation frequently accorded the same.

This seems to be practically the same as the quotation from Miller, op. cit., Sec. 96, which I set out above.
