The order filed by the court does not specifically answer any of the contentions made by the appellant, but merely contains a general conclusion that no grounds for relief were shown. The existence of the alleged letters was not denied by the State\u2019s Attorney in his answer, nor did the court make any finding with reference thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-15\">In accordance with the suggestion of the Assistant Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>General and our ruling in <em>Hines v. Warden, </em>221 Md. 616, the application for leave to appeal will be granted and the cause remanded for specific findings upon the questions presented by the amended petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">\n<em>Leave to appeal granted and case remanded for further proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
