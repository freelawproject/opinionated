See also <em>Ward v. State, </em>219 Md. 559. It is significant that, in that appeal, no contention was raised as to the validity of a search and seizure of his automobile, following his arrest for drunken driving. It cannot be raised in this proceeding. <em>Mears v. Warden, 220 </em>Md. 682. The same thing is true of the alleged lack of preliminary hearing. Cf. <em>Culley v. Warden, </em>218 Md. 639.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
