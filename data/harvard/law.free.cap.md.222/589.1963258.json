Applicant complained that his constitutional rights were denied because he was not permitted to confront the anonymous informer who told the police he was involved in the robbery. Assuming this claim goes to confrontation at the trial rather than prior to it, we have previously held that there is no right to confront those who supply information to the police concerning a violation of the law, except in circumstances not relevant here. <em>McCoy v. State, </em>216 Md. 332, 140 A. 2d 689. In any event this point cannot be raised in collateral proceedings. <em>Howell v. Warden, </em>216 Md. 611, 139 A. 2d 270; <em>Shockley v. Warden, </em>216 Md. 607, 139 A. 2d 264; <em>Kirby v. Warden, </em>214 Md. 600, 133 A. 2d 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Applicant alleges he was denied a fair post conviction hearing because he was not present. His presence was not, however, required. <em>Plump v. Warden, </em>220 Md. 662, 153 A. 2d 269; <em>Shifflett v.
