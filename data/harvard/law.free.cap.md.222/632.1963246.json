Chief Judge Niles,\u2019 in a careful opinion, considered and answered the arguments advanced by court-appointed counsel for the petitioner. Assuming, without deciding, that the point had not been waived in prior appeals and applications for relief, the court held that the legislative penalties imposed by the Legislature on third offenders do not exceed constitutional limits. We agree. Cf. <em>Delnegro v. State, </em>198 Md. 80, 88, and <em>Dobson v. Warden, </em>214 Md. 654, 656, cert. denied 355 U. S. 966. The application for leave to appeal is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
