Warden, </em>221 Md. 611, 157 A. 2d 284 (1960)]; (ii) that his constitutional rights were violated (a) because the evidence was insufficient to convict him of robbery in that the victim\u2014who admitted that he was too drunk to remember what had happened\u2014was unable to identify the petitioner until after a police sergeant had told the victim the position of the petitioner in a \u201cline-up\u201d and (b) because there was no credible corroboration of an accomplice who also testified against him, which are questions as to the sufficiency of the evidence that should have been raised on direct appeal [Cf. <em>Galloway v. Warden, supra]; </em>and (iii) that he was denied his right to a new trial and a direct appeal because the trial court failed to advise him of such rights, which is wholly without merit since a court is under no obligation to inform a defendant of either of such rights. [Cf. <em>McClung v. Warden, </em>221 Md. 596, 155 A. 2d 893 (1959)].</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
