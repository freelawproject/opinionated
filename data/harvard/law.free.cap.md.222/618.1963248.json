Warden, </em>221 Md. 592, 155 A. 2d 697. Although he complains that he was not given a transcript of the testimony of his original trial, there is no allegation that he either requested such a transcript or that he sought an appeal and was prevented from perfecting it as a result of being denied the transcript, or otherwise. His application to the lower court shows no grounds for relief under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>the Post Conviction Procedure Act, and his application for leave to appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
