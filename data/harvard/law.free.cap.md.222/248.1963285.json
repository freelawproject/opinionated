It was alleged that the lot was easily accessible to the public and was in an area known by the defendants \u201cto be frequented by thefts of automobiles by unauthorized, unqualified and dangerous drivers,\u201d and that the ignition was in such a position as to enable anyone, including the thief, to start and drive the car without the use of a key. It was charged that the defendants owed a duty to \u201cthe general public, including the plaintiff,\u201d to take precautions in order to eliminate the possibility that the car would be stolen. Reliance was put on Code (1957), Art. <em>66\u00bd, </em>Sec. 247, which provides: \u201cNo person driving or in charge of a motor vehicle shall permit it to stand unattended without first stopping the engine, locking the ignition and removing the key, or when standing upon any perceptible grade without effectively setting the brakes thereon and turning the front wheels to the curb or side of the highway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">It is to be noted that the declaration does not state how long the car had been on the lot nor how long after it had been stolen the accident happened. It does not specify the negligence of the driver\u2014indeed does not allege directly that he was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">If it is assumed that the declaration charges negligence on the part of the driver and that the statute relied on is applicable to cars on private property, assumptions as favorable as the plaintiff could expect, the declaration failed under our recent holding in <em>Liberto v. Holfeldt, </em>221 Md. 62, 155 A. 2d 698, (a) to show a breach of duty owed by the defendants to the plaintiff; and (b) to establish that a breach of such a duty had not been interrupted by a break in the chain of causation. In the <em>Liberto </em>case, where the plaintiff was injured when his car was struck by defendant\u2019s car, then being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>driven by a thief who had stolen it while the owner had left it at the curb momentarily with the key in the lock, we affirmed a summary judgment for the owner of the automobile. The case is controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
