Instead he relied on several restricted claims, which collectively constitute the only contention properly before us. In effect it is that since all persons involved in the offenses of which he was convicted\u2014statutory rape and perverted practices\u2014and all facts concerning such offenses were not known to the trial court, the petitioner was not given a fair and just trial. The contention is without merit. Judge Duckett found at the post conviction hearing that the petitioner, though he plead not guilty, had admitted his guilt at the trial and thereby rendered unnecessary the calling of other witnesses for the purpose of taking additional testimony. Moreover, the hearing also developed the fact that the character witnesses called by the defendant were not permitted to testify because they could not qualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Certain other claims concerning the characters of the other participants in the offenses of which the petitioner was convicted are not .only irrelevant, but were not asserted below and will not be considered here. A further contention also not raised below\u2014to the effect that the sentence of ten years for statutory rape was excessive\u2014will likewise be ignored though we do observe that the maximum sentence could have been death under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
