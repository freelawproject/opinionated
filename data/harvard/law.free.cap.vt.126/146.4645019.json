See 125 Vt. 289, 215 A.2d 134. The case was reversed with an order that a new decree be drawn and entered in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion. The petitioners\u2019 appeal from this decree presents three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">I. Is there any basis for the court of chancery\u2019s decree that the petitioners do not have the power to enforce the provisions of the act of incorporation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">II. Is there any basis for the court of chancery\u2019s decree that the rules and regulations of- the. Henry W. Putnam Memorial Hospital are \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">III. Is there any basis for the court of chancery\u2019s decree that a person entitled to public assistance is not \u201cdestitute\u201d under the terms of the trust?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Questions I and III encompass issues which were settled by the original opinion, and are, therefore, res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">Question II relates to whether the rules and regulations of the hospital are \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d The trial court made no findings in this connection and, as the previous opinion states, \u201c(T)here is no basis for this Court to consider the reasonableness, or lack of it, in such rules and regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">Under the authority of 12 V.S.A. \u00a74605, let a new decree issue providing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-13\">1. The decree appealed from is stricken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-14\">2. The defendant Henry W. Putnam Memorial Hospital, its agents, attorneys, officers and servants, are hereby strictly restrained and enjoined from refusing or denying admittance into its hospital of any person residing in any town in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>county of Bennington, on the grounds of destitution, or to make any charge to such person; but this hospital shall not be barred from seeking reimbursement from patients who have available resources, or from compensation carriers, or from federal, state, county, town, city or other governmental agencies or from any source which may be able to pay, in full or in part, for such services as the patient has received.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">3. The said defendant Hospital shall have the right and duty to make reasonable rules and regulations relative to the admission of the destitute of Bennington County.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">4. Let the defendant recover its taxable costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b176-7\">Holden, C.J., took no part in the consideration of this appeal.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
