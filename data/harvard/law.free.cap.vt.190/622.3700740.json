Husband appeals from a post-divorce ruling by the family court. The court held that, in determining what husband was owed from the sale of the marital home, wife could deduct the principal and interest components of mortgage payments she had made. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-15\">V 2. The parties were divorced in 1997. By stipulation, which was incorporated into the final divorce order, wife was awarded the marital home (purchased three years earlier) until the parties\u2019 youngest child turned eighteen. Wife was responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the home, including \u201cthe current mortgage,\u201d of which there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>two, totaling $87,600, a value near the property\u2019s purchase price. The stipulation provided that the proceeds from the sale of the property would be divided equally after deducting the usual and customary expenses associated with the sale of the property, the remaining balance of the current mortgage, the cost of the appraisal, and \u201cthe cost of all capital improvements and capital contributions (mortgage).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">\u00b6 3. The phrase \u2014 \u201ccapital contributions (mortgage)\u201d \u2014 is at the heart of this case. When wife attempted to sell the property in 2008 for $140,000, the bank required husband to sign off on the sale. Husband refused to do so, claiming that wife owed him money under the terms of the final divorce order. Eventually, each party filed a motion to enforce. The dispute turned on whether wife was entitled to deduct not only the principal component of the mortgage payments she made, but also the interest component of those payments. Following a hearing, the court found the phrase \u201ccapital contributions (mortgage)\u201d ambiguous, and it examined extrinsic evidence to discern the parties\u2019 intent. After hearing testimony from husband\u2019s attorney, who drafted the language in question, as well as from wife, the court concluded that the more reasonable interpretation, given the use of the word \u201cmortgage,\u201d was that wife could deduct the entirety of the payments made on the debt secured by the original two mortgages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court then requested briefing on the amount owed to husband from the sale of property. It appears undisputed that after wife\u2019s deductions for capital improvements, which are permitted under the divorce order, and after deducting all of her payments in the amounts of principal and interest called for in the original mortgages, there is little or no equity left to split between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">\u00b6 4. On appeal, husband argues that the phrase \u201ccapital contributions (mortgage)\u201d plainly denotes only the mortgage payments to principal. Even if the phrase is ambiguous, he asserts that the court should have relied on the undisputed testimony of the attorney who drafted the phrase and testified that it was intended to refer only to principal payments as opposed to the entire mortgage payment. Conversely, wife maintains that the language supports her interpretation, but if the language is ambiguous, this Court should find the family court\u2019s construction reasonable. Because the language does not plainly support either interpretation to the exclusion of the other, the family court correctly found the phrase ambiguous, and its construction of the ambiguous language was reasonable in light of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">\u00b6 5. We interpret divorce decrees according to contract principles. <em>Sumner v. Sumner, </em>2004 VT 45, \u00b6 9, 176 Vt. 452, 852 A.2d 611. Thus, we look first to the explicit terms of the decree and decide de novo if they are ambiguous. <em>John A. Russell Corp. v. Bohlig, </em>170 Vt. 12, 16, 739 A.2d 1212, 1216 (1999). If an agreement, even if \u201cinartfully worded or clumsily arranged, fairly admits of but one interpretation, it may not be said to be ambiguous or fatally unclear.\u201d <em>Isbrandtsen v. N. Branch Corp., </em>150 Vt. 575, 580-81, 556 A.2d 81, 85 (1988) (quotation omitted). If unambiguous, the language of the decree controls and the Court does not look to external evidence. <em>Sumner, </em>2004 VT 45, \u00b6 9; <em>O\u2019Brien Bros.\u2019 P\u2019ship v. Plociennik, </em>2007 VT 105, \u00b6 9, 182 Vt. 409, 940 A.2d 692. But if \u201creasonable people could differ as to its interpretation,\u201d a provision is ambiguous and the court should look be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>yond the plain language to discern the parties\u2019 intent. <em>O\u2019Brien Bros.\u2019 P\u2019ship, </em>2007 VT 105, \u00b6 9 (quotation omitted). This is \u201ca question of fact to be determined based on all of the evidence \u2014 not only the language of the written instrument, but also evidence concerning its subject matter, its purpose at the time it was executed, and the situations of the parties.\u201d <em>Main St. Landing, LLC v. Lake St. Ass\u2019n, </em>2006 VT 13, \u00b6 7, 179 Vt. 583, 892 A.2d 931 (mem.). We defer to the court\u2019s factual findings so long as not clearly erroneous, meaning that we will affirm if they are supported by the evidence as seen in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Willey v. Willey, </em>2006 VT 106, \u00b6 11, 180 Vt. 421, 912 A.2d 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">\u00b6 6. Husband argues that \u201ccapital contributions (mortgage)\u201d applies to payments toward principal, but not toward interest. The family court correctly noted that the phrase \u201ccapital contribution\u201d does not ordinarily apply to any mortgage payments. Technically, \u201ccapital contribution\u201d is a business term of art defined as \u201c[clash, property, or services contributed by partners to a partnership,\u201d or \u201c[f]unds made available by a shareholder, usu[ally] without an increase in stock holdings.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 222 (8th ed. 2004). The only case in Vermont that uses the term in a divorce context applies it to supplying funds for a home purchase rather than making mortgage payments. See <em>Ward v. Ward, </em>155 Vt. 242, 249-50, 583 A.2d 577, 582-83 (1990). Nor do there appear to be cases from other jurisdictions that address capital contributions specifically in a mortgage payment context. On the other hand, and as also explained by the court, a \u201cmortgage\u201d is commonly understood to mean payments of principal <em>and </em>interest unless specified to the contrary. Assuming then, for argument\u2019s sake, that the phrase \u201ccapital contributions\u201d could reasonably refer to payments to mortgage principal only, the parenthetical addition of the explanatory, but contradictory, term \u201cmortgage\u201d within the same reference muddies the meaning of \u201ccapital contribution.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Not insignificantly to the court, the term \u201cmortgage\u201d was also used earlier in the same subsection of the parties\u2019 stipulation to have wife assume, and hold husband harmless from, the mortgage payments \u2014 again commonly understood and clearly intended by the parties to mean principal <em>and </em>interest, so that husband would be relieved of that obligation. This is another reason why husband\u2019s construction of \u201ccapital contributions (mortgage)\u201d is not the only plausible reading of the language, and that the court\u2019s construction is not unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">\u00b6 7. The parties\u2019 mutual invocation of the interpretive canon against surplusage underscores the ambiguity of the phrase. See <em>N. Sec. Ins. Co. v. Mitec Elecs., Ltd., </em>2008 VT 96, \u00b6 24, 184 Vt. 303, 965 A.2d 447 (noting that the Court strives to avoid an interpretation that renders any contract language surplusage). Both husband\u2019s and wife\u2019s readings of the three words in question must result in a superfluous term. Wife posits that \u201cmortgage\u201d clarifies that she is due credit for payments to both mortgage principal and interest, but this necessarily renders the preceding phrase, \u201ccapital contributions,\u201d superfluous. Husband argues that \u201cmortgage\u201d is merely descriptive of wife\u2019s \u201ccapital contributions\u201d based on her payments of mortgage principal. This renders the same term superfluous if, as husband argues, \u201ccapital contributions\u201d could <em>only </em>mean principal paid on the mortgage since other capital investment would appear to fall within the decree\u2019s credit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>her \u201ccapital improvements.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Unlike <em>Isbrandtsen, </em>the language here arguably supports both parties\u2019 interpretations and so is ambiguous. See <em>Isbrandtsen, </em>150 Vt. at 581, 556 A.2d at 85. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">\u00b6 8. The remaining question is whether the family court\u2019s construction of this ambiguous phrase is clearly erroneous. See <em>Willey, </em>2006 VT 106, \u00b6 11. We hold that it is not. Faced with two less-than-compelling interpretations, the family court noted greater deficiencies in husband\u2019s construction, especially his failure to craft the stipulation to explicitly limit wife\u2019s reimbursement to principal payments if that was the parties\u2019 intent. That wife\u2019s reading was not flawless did not foreclose the court from adopting her version if supported by conventions of contract construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">\u00b6 9. There are ample reasons to support the court\u2019s judgment. One is that a \u201cmortgage\u201d payment, as recited by the court, ordinarily consists of principal and interest payments. Another is that the preceding phrase, \u201ccapital contributions,\u201d does not necessarily contradict the later parenthetical, as opposed to informing the court that what the parties meant by \u201ccapital contributions\u201d was \u201c(mortgage)\u201d payments. Yet another, as mentioned above, is that the term \u201cmortgage\u201d is used twice in the same stipulation without distinction, the first referring to mortgage payments \u2014 principal and interest. The family court was not irrational in giving identical terms in the same document the same meaning. Finally, though the parties\u2019 attorneys apparently traded drafts back and forth, husband\u2019s attorney recalled drafting the specific provision in question, and the court found him to be the author of the stipulation. \u201c[WJhere a contract is ambiguous, it will be eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>strued against the party who drafted it.\u201d <em>State v. Spitsyn, </em>174 Vt. 545, 547, 811 A.2d 201, 204 (2002) (mem.). Accordingly, the family court was not clearly wrong to construe the ambiguous provision against husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">\u00b6 10. The family court\u2019s construction was not unfair or unreasonable. See <em>Trustees of Net Realty Holding Trust v. AVCO Fin. Servs. of Barre, Inc., </em>147 Vt. 472, 475-76, 520 A.2d 981, 983 (1986) (preferring fair and reasonable resolution of ambiguous terms against the drafter). While husband\u2019s divorce lawyer testified to the effect that there was \u201clittle equity\u201d in the house at the time of the divorce, the court made no finding as to value. Nor, so far as we can discern, did husband introduce evidence of significant equity in the house at the time of purchase or divorce. The dissent suggests that husband was inequitably denied an accrued stake in the predivorce marital estate, but without evidence of some actual beginning value, the dissent\u2019s equitable arguments are largely, if not entirely, speculative. Even if theoretically unfair, the actual record does not support husband\u2019s, and the dissent\u2019s, argument that the family court\u2019s construction of the stipulation was clearly erroneous. Thus, husband\u2019s ongoing interest in relinquishing the marital home to wife, in return for wife assuming the whole mortgage payments, was to share in any accrued appreciation at the time of a later sale.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It was not clearly inequitable to credit wife for her entire mortgage payments, when husband\u2019s interpretation would impose upon her, at no cost to him, the entire interest-carrying cost for his prospective appreciation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">V 11. Unsupported by the record, the dissent contends that husband\u2019s child support subsidized wife\u2019s mortgage in proportion to her payments, so that return on his contributions to equity were denied by the court\u2019s construction. Using the dissent\u2019s calculation of $860 per month in child support and $550 per month in mortgage payments, it is still speculative that husband\u2019s support payments fully covered one half of wife\u2019s actual child rearing expenses, and that some portion of his child support should be fairly credited toward wife\u2019s mortgage payments. In any event, this argument was not presented below or on appeal, and it is not properly considered now. And again, any theoretical merit to this argument does not render the family court\u2019s fact-based construction untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-5\"> There was subsequent refinancing by wife that increased the mortgage debt, but the court limited her reimbursement to an amount based on payments equivalent only to the mortgage obligations \u201ccurrent\u201d at the time of the divorce decree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-7\"> The dissent suggests that husband\u2019s attorney\u2019s testimony deserves greater weight, <em>post, </em>\u00b6 18 n.14, but the record reflects no reason to credit the attorney\u2019s evidence over wife\u2019s testimony to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b643-4\"> The dissent states, implausibly, that the word \u201cmortgage\u201d could clarify that \u201ccapital contributions\u201d refers only to the 1994 mortgage, or that the phrase \u201ccapital contributions\u201d does not apply to nonmortgage expenditures that are also not capital improvements. <em>Post, </em>\u00b6 22. The first theory is not reasonable because the word \u201cmortgage\u201d does nothing to specify whether \u201ccapital contributions\u201d refers to all mortgages or just the 1994 mortgage. The second explanation seems equally unlikely since the dissent would rely on \u201cmortgage\u201d to exclude expenditures no one would reasonably consider capital contributions in the first place. We note that neither explanation was advanced by husband or by his attorney who drafted the document.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b643-5\"> Nor are we persuaded otherwise by the dissent\u2019s emphasis that wife must pay husband \u201chalf of the equity\u201d at the time of sale under subsection (c) of the divorce decree. <em>Post, </em>\u00b6 17. It is true this is a clear order that wife is to pay husband half of the equity at the time of sale. Superficially, this recommends husband\u2019s interpretation, since house \u201cequity\u201d is commonly understood to be the difference between the sale price and mortgage lien, and would ordinarily suggest no credit to wife for her mortgage interest payments. And yet, under neither spouse\u2019s interpretation is husband entitled to half of that equity so defined. As the dissent acknowledges, subsection (c) incorporates by reference subsection (b), which allows wife to deduct certain costs, including \u201ccapital contributions (mortgage).\u201d There is no question that under subsection (b) wife was also entitled to deduct for capital improvements as well as payments to principal, meaning she is entitled to more than half the equity if \u201cequity\u201d is given its standard meaning, so we know the standard meaning does not govern. The dissent\u2019s reiteration that husband is entitled to half the equity merely begs the question as to what is \u201cthe equity.\u201d Such unavoidable circuity confirms the trial court's conclusion that the stipulation is ambiguous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b644-5\"> The family court\u2019s construction of the clause does not, as claimed by the dissent, necessarily defeat husband\u2019s share in any appreciation in the home. By the dissent\u2019s own calculations, if the value of the house had increased an additional one quarter of one percent per year, husband would have been entitled to some payment under the family court\u2019s order. Failure of husband to realize appreciation in the home, after ostensibly contributing nothing to the principal and interest for eleven years, was a function of the market as well as the court\u2019s construction of the parties\u2019 stipulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b644-13\"> That husband remained legally liable on the original mortgage is no basis, by itself and as the dissent would have it, for disallowing wife\u2019s interest payments or crediting them to husband\u2019s account. This claim seems especially unfounded where, as here, the parties expressly intended wife to hold husband harmless on the debt and husband proffered no evidence of contributing to the payment of interest. The dissent would, incongruently, credit husband for wife\u2019s interest payments even after her 2007 refinancing removed him from the debt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"Aum\">Dooley, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">\u00b6 12. dissenting. Viewed from any perspective, the result in this case is manifestly unfair, and the provision in the order, as interpreted by the majority, is perverse and indefensible. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>this point, I strongly disagree with the majority decision that the result is not \u201cunfair or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>\u00b6 10. The majority justifies the result, and the perverse term of the order, on the basis that the wording of the controlling provision, in context, requires it. In fact, the majority ignores the critical wording of the provision that controls this decision. Properly construed, the controlling provision supports the only fair result. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">\u00b6 13. Let me start with why the result is unfair. At the time of the divorce, the parties had limited property to divide apart from then clothing and personal effects. Wife was awarded an almost new car, the house and most of its interior furnishings and contents. Husband was awarded a twelve-year old van, a two-year-old snowmobile and a six-year old motorcycle. The only real value in this property was in the house, although the equity was unknown and the property was subject to mortgages to secure loans totaling $87,500. At a minimum, there was the equity created by the appreciation in value between the date of purchase (1994) and the date of the divorce (1997). In order to try to equalize the property distribution, the court awarded wife title to the house, but she was required to sell it when the youngest child reached eighteen years of age and divide the proceeds with husband or, if wife remarried or moved from the house before that time, she was required to pay \u201cone half of the equity\u201d to husband. In the end, wife received all the equity in the house, and husband received nothing from its sale.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At least<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for the period until the house was sold, husband was obligated on the underlying notes that reflected the purchase price of the house.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Apparently, wife became delinquent in mortgage payments in late 2003, and the bank started seeking collection from husband.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, not only did husband get no benefit from the value of the house, it represented a large liability until it was sold. The result is that the distribution of the property of the marriage was inequitable, with wife receiving almost all of its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">\u00b6 14. The whole point of the distribution was to enable wife to stay in the marital house with the two children. To do this, wife paid around $550 per month on the mortgages. The vast majority of the mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>gage payments went to interest. In essence, husband\u2019s equity in the property was being consumed by the interest payments that were credited to wife in the distribution of the proceeds of the sale. If, as the majority states, there was no equity in the property at the time of the divorce,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the property would have had to increase in value at a rate of approximately 4.62% per year for husband to have ever recovered any equity \u2014 even a dollar \u2014 from the property if it had been sold at the time of refinancing. The value of the house actually increased at the annual rate of approximately 4.37% between the divorce and the refinancing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The fact is that husband\u2019s interest in the equity was illusory. The agreement and order was a kind of shell game that husband could not win. He would have been better off if the house had been awarded completely to wife with a requirement that the debt obligation be refinanced so husband was no longer liable for the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">\u00b6 15. There is another way in which the result is unfair. Husband is paying child support according to the child support guidelines; the original order set the amount at $200 per week.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The amount is based on the financial need of children, which includes their housing cost. See 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 654 (\u201cThe secretary of human services shall prescribe by rule a guideline for child support.... The rule shall be based on the financial needs of Vermont children, established by such reliable data as most accurately reflect their needs.\u201d); R. Williams, <em>Guidelines for Setting Levels of Child Support Orders, </em>21 Fam. L.Q. 281, 287 (1987) (\u201c[A] recent economic study . . . estimates that over one-half of family expenditures on children fall into just three categories: food, housing, and transportation.\u201d). In this case, the major share of the children\u2019s housing costs is the mortgage costs, particularly the interest on the debt. Thus, a substantial share of husband\u2019s child support represents payment of mortgage interest. At the same time, this interest is being credited to wife to steadily reduce husband\u2019s equity interest in the property. In essence, husband is paying twice for the same expense \u2014 once through child support, and once through reduction in the equity. His steady loss of equity cannot be offset against his gross income in calculating child support payments. See 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 653(1) (defining \u201cavailable income\u201d to determine child support obligation). Nor was it counted as income to wife in determining her share of the child support obligation. In fact, husband\u2019s child support amount was temporarily increased to reflect the children\u2019s homeplace \u201ccosts and expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">\u00b6 16. Finally, our assessment of fairness should be reached in relation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>limits in our cases on delayed distribution of property. The court can delay distribution of property with each party obtaining a percentage of the value at the time of distribution, including any appreciation or depreciation caused by the delay. <em>Leas v. Leas, </em>169 Vt. 364, 370, 737 A.2d 889, 894 (1999). Alternatively, it can award a property interest, and delay its realization, but it must require the payment of interest on the value of the property if a lengthy delay is expected. See <em>id.; Johnson v. Johnson, </em>163 Vt. 491, 497, 659 A.2d 1149, 1153 (1995). Here, husband has the worst of all alternatives. Ostensibly, he is awarded a percentage of the equity in the property, but he can never receive that equity. Not only does he not obtain a share of any appreciation in value, he loses any property value he had at the time of the divorce order. He is, of course, awarded no interest on any equity value; in fact, he has to pay interest to the spouse who has the use of the property and he remains liable on the underlying debt obligation for the property even though he will never receive any benefit! If this order were imposed by a court without an underlying stipulation, I doubt that we would uphold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">\u00b6 17. In the following paragraphs, I outline the reasons why I believe that the majority\u2019s construction of the language of the original court order is wrong, apart from the unfairness of the result. One point in this analysis needs special emphasis. The \u201cReal Estate\u201d section of the divorce order contains three subsections. Subsection (b), quoted and construed by the majority, applies directly only when the youngest child turned eighteen. In fact, the youngest child of the parties was born in 1996 and will turn eighteen in 2014. As a result, subsection (b) does not apply directly to this case. The operative section is subsection (c), which applies if wife remarries or moves from the marital residence, the latter having occurred here. It goes on to say that the property must be refinanced to pay off husband or sold and that the distribution of the proceeds will occur under subsection (b), thus indirectly invoking that subsection. It is, however, more specific in describing wife\u2019s obligation as \u201cto pay to [husband] ... one half of the equity,\u201d language not in subsection (b) and ignored by the majority. This language is important because it says clearly that the point of the proceeds distribution methodology is to give husband one half of the equity in the property. Under the majority\u2019s construction of the distribution methodology language, the one result that can <em>never </em>occur is that husband will receive one half of the equity in the property. The minute that wife made a mortgage payment the equity available for distribution was reduced by the amount of wife\u2019s interest payment. The inevitable result, as this case demonstrates, is that if wife stayed in the house for an extended period, husband would receive no part of the equity of the property. In my view, the added language in subsection (c), the operative subsection of the order, is the chief reason that the majority\u2019s construction of the distribution language is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">\u00b6 18. Even apart from the unfair result and the language in subsection (c) that specifies the intended outcome, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s reasoning and result on its own terms. We have many rules for construction of language in contracts or statutes, but the most important step is to choose the right approach to best implement the drafter\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Here, the majority begrudgingly accepts that the phrase \u201ccapital contribution\u201d means the part of the mortgage payment that goes to principal and thus increases the equity \u2014 capital \u2014 owned by the mortgagee(s). However inartful the chosen language may appear, it cannot have any other meaning in context. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, that meaning is supported by our case law<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and decisions from other states.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is particularly common in tax law because of the different tax treatments of interest and capital payments. See <em>United States v. 461 W. 42nd St., </em>251 F.3d 1329, 1336 (11th Cir. 2001) (\u201c[T]he mortgage payments constitute both an ordinary operating expense \u2014 payment of the interest \u2014 and a capital expense \u2014 payment going toward equity.\u201d); <em>United States v. All Assets &amp; Equip. of West Side Bldg. Corp., </em>1997 WL 187319, at *4 (N.D. Ill. 1997) (\u201cThe mortgage payments ... include two components: an operating expense (the interest component of the payment) and a capital expense (the equity component of the payment).\u201d). This Court has never used the term \u201ccapital contributions\u201d to refer to payments resembling or including interest expenditures. Neither the trial court nor the majority even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>try to make \u201ccapital contribution\u201d mean interest payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">\u00b6 19. Next, the majority concludes that \u201c(mortgage)\u201d means all payments on the underlying debt secured by the mortgage. Because the term in the agreement is the \u201cexisting mortgage,\u201d the trial court held that it means the 1994 mortgage, the only one in existence at the time of the agreement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> While an all-payment interpretation is a stretch for a single word inserted in parentheses, I generally accept this interpretation in order to continue with the analysis. I note, however, that it is a definition intended to create a conflict, exactly the wrong approach in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">\u00b6 20. It is at this point that the majority goes wrong finding an unnecessary conflict between the words \u201ccapital contributions\u201d and \u201cmortgage\u201d and declaring that husband\u2019s interpretation will produce a surplus term when it will not. The critical interpretation rule is that we must apply all the terms of the contractual language and seek to reconcile any superficial conflicts if possible. See <em>State v. Philip Morris USA Inc., </em>2008 VT 11, \u00b6 13, 183 Vt. 176, 945 A.2d 887 (stating that in interpreting contracts, this Court \u201cstrive[s] to give effect to every part of the instrument and form a harmonious whole from the parts\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>In re Verderber, </em>173 Vt. 612, 615, 795 A.2d 1157, 1162 (2002) (mem.) (agreeing that \u201can interpretation which harmonizes all parts of the contract is preferable to an interpretation which focuses on one provision heedless of context\u201d (quotation omitted)). The majority doesn\u2019t attempt to reconcile its apparent conflict, even though the method of doing so is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">\u00b6 21. In viewing the language to interpret it, we must start by recognizing that a contradiction between a parenthetical phrase or word and a textual phrase is virtually impossible. A parenthetical word or phrase is supplementary to the language it follows, and is optional for the reader. See, e.g., The Oxford Companion to the English Language 750 (1st ed. 1992) (explaining that a parenthesis is \u201ca qualifying, explanatory, or appositive word, phrase, clause, or sentence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>interrupts a construction without otherwise affecting it,\u201d and that it \u201cmay be marked by pairs of commas, dashes, or round braekets/parentheses\u201d); The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy 156 (3d ed. 2002) (stating that parentheses \u201csubordinate . .. the material within them so that readers save most of their attention for the rest of the sentence\u201d). It is totally inconsistent with the limited function of a parenthetical phrase to make it controlling over the phrase it supplements. While I would still disagree with the majority\u2019s construction if the word \u201cmortgage\u201d were set off by commas, rather than parentheses, I think it is particularly wrong in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">\u00b6 22. The obvious reconciliation of the terms is to interpret the phrase and parenthetical as meaning capital contributions made through mortgage payments. This interpretation gives effect to all words in the operative phrase and parenthetical and creates no internal conflict. Moreover, it does not make the reference to the mortgage unnecessary as the majority claims. The trial court interpreted the mortgage as only the 1994 mortgage<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and not the 2007 mortgage. Thus, payments of principal under the 2007 mortgage may be capital contributions but they are neither \u201ccapital improvements\u201d nor \u201ccapital contributions\u201d as the terms are used in subsection (b) of the order.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">\u00b6 23. I believe that anyone fairly looking at the language of the order would conclude that it allows wife an offset for the portion of her mortgage payments that increase the equity in the property, but not for interest. When it is clear that this interpretation is necessary to reach a fair result and to implement the purpose to split the equity from the property between the parties, I think we must reverse the trial court decision. Whatever standard of review we operate under, we must reach the right result as a matter of law. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b650-9\">\u00b624. I am authorized to state that Justice Skoglund joins in this dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b645-5\"> The majority tries to sugareoat the result a bit by stating that there was \u201clittle or no equity left to split\u201d after wife received all her credits off the top. <em>Ante, </em>\u00b6 3. In fact, it cannot be disputed that wife received 100% of the equity and husband received 0%.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b645-8\"> 1 have used \u201cat least\u201d because it is not clear that husband is free of the debt obligation even today. As the trial court found, wife failed to pay off the preexisting mortgage entirely and never had it discharged. Husband signed that mortgage because of his interest, albeit illusory, in the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b645-9\"> A three-justice panel of this Court found this exact distribution of risk and responsibility to be unfair because it required, as here, that husband deed his interest to wife, but left him obligated on the mortgage note and with no security to ensure he would eventually receive part of the equity. The panel ordered that husband not be required to sign a deed or that he receive a security interest. <em>Gray v. Gray, </em>No. 2008-209, 2008 WL 4903038, at *2 (Vt. Nov. 5, 2008) (unpub. mem.), available at http://www.vermontjudiciary.org/d-upeo/ upeo.aspx.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b645-10\"> The majority emphasizes that wife agreed to hold husband harmless from the costs of the current mortgage. This is an illusory right where, as here, wife cannot make the mortgage payments to the bank. Husband is forced to pay the bank but cannot collect on the hold harmless agreement from wife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b646-4\"> In fact, the assumption that there was no equity in the house is almost certainly wrong. There was no appraisal at the time the house was purchased. Husband and wife made no down payment; the full purchase price was financed by the bank. The \u201cno equity assumption\u201d is built on the unlikely assumption that the bank loan equaled all the value of the house, leaving the bank no margin of error in case of default. Further, it assumes that the value of the house did not increase in the three years between its purchase and the divorce, an even more unlikely assumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b646-5\"> It is worth observing that this level of increase occurred mostly during a housing market where appreciation in value was substantial. In the stagnant market of the last few years, the amount of total equity would not increase but the mortgage interest payments would continue making husband\u2019s likelihood of receiving any equity even more remote.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b646-9\"> It was amended a number of times thereafter, but the payment amount remained comparable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b647-7\"> Although not my central point, an example of how construction rules can be misused is in the treatment of the testimony of husband\u2019s lawyer who drafted the provisions of the stipulation dealing with the distribution of property. He testified that he did not intend that wife could get credit for interest paid on the house purchase loan in determining the amount of equity to be distributed. AI-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>though the trial court, and the majority, find the critical language of the stipulation to be ambiguous, they ignore the testimony and then, to pile on, construe the language against husband because his attorney was the drafter. See <em>ante, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b648-5\"> See, e.g., <em>Quimby v. Myers, </em>2005 VT 123, \u00b6 11, 179 Vt. 611, 895 A.2d 128 (mem.) (noting, in case about alleged business partnership, that \u201ccourt did not find an intent to distribute the assets on the basis of individual capital contributions\u201d); <em>Murphy v. Stowe Club Highlands, </em>171 Vt. 144, 156, 761 A.2d 688, 697 (2000) (referring to another case where \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s president received a substantial capital contribution to the corporation and intentionally failed to disclose it to defendant\u201d). In one opinion dealing with divorce, we used \u201ccapital contributions\u201d to refer specifically to a husband\u2019s initial equity investment in a piece of property. <em>Ward v. Ward, </em>155 Vt. 242, 250, 583 A.2d 577, 582 (1990) (finding that, where defendant husband paid about $11,000 of his own money for couple\u2019s interest in property and spent two thousand hours renovating it, that \u201cthe trial court weighed defendant\u2019s egregious conduct in the balance, on the one hand, against defendant\u2019s sole initial capital contribution and his largely single-handed renovation effort\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b648-6\"> For example, in <em>Thompson v. Thompson, </em>a Colorado divorce case, the court acknowledged that all capital contributions, whether made through direct financial investment or sweat equity, were meant to add to the accumulation of assets. 489 P.2d 1062, 1064 (Colo. App. 1971) (holding that \u201cit was proper for the trial court to consider contributions of parties to the increase in or accumulation of assets by means other than direct contribution of capital\u201d); see also <em>Gregg v. Gregg, </em>474 So. 2d 262, 265 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1985) (acknowledging and applying a theory that treats \u201cspecial equity,\u201d or equity resulting from the contribution of the wife\u2019s separate funds, \u201cas a capital contribution whereby the spouse obtains a percentage of the value of the acquired property equal to the ratio that the separate property contributed was to the original total acquisition cost\u201d); <em>Van Erem v. Van Erem, </em>111 N.W.2d 440, 442 (Wis. 1961) (noting that \u201cwhere the estate to be divided on divorce has been partially acquired from capital contributions of the wife, the wife should first be awarded her capital contributions and the residue divided on the basis of an equitable formula,\u201d and listing \u201ccapital contributions\u201d as including \u201ccontributions from her separate estate ($9,500 equity in Appleton property and $564.35 inheritance)\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b649-5\"> Although it does not ultimately matter because husband gets nothing no matter what is credited as mortgage payments, construing the term mortgage to mean all payments creates difficulties in fairness and meaning. For example, wife made many late payment penalties because she failed to make her installment payments on time. These penalties are secured by the mortgage and, therefore, are mortgage payments just as much as interest payments are mortgage payments. Crediting these payments to wife to reduce husband\u2019s equity increases the unfairness to husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The trial court tried to creatively maneuver around another fairness issue that is caused by its resolution of this dispute. Wife refinanced the mortgage debt in 2007 with a different financial institution and increased the amount to pay off personal debts. The trial court held that wife could not get credit for the greater payments under this mortgage because the terms of the divorce order allowed the remaining balance of only the \u201ccurrent mortgage\u201d to be deducted from the sale price as part of the equity calculation. The court interpreted the \u201ccurrent mortgage\u201d to mean the 1994 mortgage and not the 2007 mortgage so credits would be made as if the 1994 mortgage were still in effect. This result is creative but hardly comports with the language of the order. Since the 1994 mortgage was paid off in 2007, there were no payments thereafter on that mortgage. The interpretation should mean that wife would receive no credit for interest or principal payments after the 1994 debt and mortgage were extinguished.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\"> The majority now appears to war with the trial court interpretation, saying the word \u201cmortgage\u201d does not specify whether it means the mortgage existing at the time of the agreement or any mortgage. Except in the parenthetical, the agreement consistently refers to the \u201ccurrent mortgage,\u201d which supports the trial court interpretation. Under the alternative interpretation, wife could deduct any principal and interest on any mortgage, including the refinancing mortgage used to pay other debts. I cannot imagine anyone would say that is an acceptable interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b650-16\"> This is the most obvious answer to the majority\u2019s conclusion that the term mortgage is superfluous because all other capital contributions come under the heading of capital improvements, which are specially recognized in the provision of the court order. It is not the only answer. Expenditures could increase the value of the house without fitting within the term \u201cimprovements.\u201d For example, repair expenditures to fix storm damage would increase the value of the house, but could be found not to be improvements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
