This case considers who should bear responsibility for the cost of cleaning up petroleum contamination caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>by releases from a gas station\u2019s underground storage tanks. The controversy in this appeal is between the State of Vermont, which runs the Vermont Petroleum Cleanup Fund (VPCF) and Stonington Insurance Co. (Stonington), which insured Bradford Oil, the owner of the underground storage tanks, for approximately a three-and-a-half-year period. The State appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment limiting Stonington\u2019s liability to a 4/27 share of past and future cleanup costs and awarding the State $45,172.05. On appeal, the State argues: (1) this Court\u2019s application of time-on-the-risk allocation in <em>Towns v. Northern Security Insurance Co., </em>2008 VT 98, 184 Vt. 322, 964 A.2d 1150, does not preclude joint and several liability under all standard occurrence-based policy language; (2) the circumstances here, including the reasonable expectations of the insured and the equity and policy considerations, support imposing joint and several liability on Stonington for all of the State\u2019s VPCF expenditures; and (3) even if time-on-the-risk allocation would otherwise be appropriate, Stonington is not entitled to such allocation because it has failed to show sufficient facts to apply this allocation method in the present case. We conclude that <em>Towns </em>does control here, and we are unconvinced by the State\u2019s reasonable expectations, equity, and policy arguments to distinguish this recent decision. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b6 2. Plaintiff Bradford Oil Company, Inc. (Bradford) owns a Mobil station in St. Johnsbury that is the site of the petroleum contamination at issue. According to the parties\u2019 experts, the contamination may have begun as early as the 1960s or as late as the end of the 1970s. The Agency of Natural Resources (ANR) placed the site on the Vermont Hazardous Waste Sites List when, in April 1997, petroleum contamination was discovered following the removal of three underground storage tanks. In recent years, at the State\u2019s direction, Bradford has been paying to investigate and clean up the contamination, and the VPCF has reimbursed most of Bradford\u2019s expenses. Bradford initiated this case in 2006 to establish coverage for its cleanup liability under four commercial general liability policies from Stonington. The State cross-claimed seeking reimbursement to the VPCF from Stonington under the same policies. The coverage periods for the policies at issue began on July 18, 1994, and continued through December 1, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b6 3. Initially, Stonington denied that its policies provided any coverage for the contamination damage on Bradford\u2019s property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>but it eventually stipulated to the existence of coverage, leaving only the allocation of costs and damages before the trial court. The allocation question arises because the coverage periods of Bradford\u2019s Stonington policies cover only a portion of the total time that contamination was allegedly occurring and that other policies might have been triggered, if any others existed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b6 4. Stonington filed a motion for partial summary judgment in October 2009, asserting that a simple time-on-the-risk allocation method should apply in this case and that the company should be held liable for damages only in proportion to the time it assumed the risk of loss. Under a time-on-the-risk allocation or \u201cpro-ration by years\u201d method, each triggered policy bears responsibility for damages in proportion to the time it was \u201con the risk,\u201d relative to the total time of triggered coverage. <em>Towns, </em>2008 VT 98, \u00b6 33 (quotation omitted). Stonington argued that the trial court should follow this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Towns, </em>where we held that a simple time-on-the-risk allocation method was appropriate based on standard occurrence-based insurance policy language in the context of slowly occurring environmental contamination. The Washington Superior Court, Civil Division, agreed that <em>Towns </em>controls this case. The court granted Stonington\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to the method of risk allocation, but found that it could not determine Stonington\u2019s actual total liability on summary judgment because the proportion of time for which Stonington was responsible was still in dispute. Following summary judgment, in response to the remaining issues of fact identified by the trial court, the parties submitted a joint statement of facts not in dispute. Based on these undisputed facts and the earlier summary judgment decision, the trial court issued a judgment in August 2010 decreeing that Stonington\u2019s liability under its four insurance policies is limited to a 4/27 share of past and future cleanup costs and awarding the State $45,172.05 from Stonington for reimbursement of the VPCF expenditures and interest on the expenditures. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b6 5. This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the trial court. <em>Towns, </em>2008 VT 98, \u00b6 8. We will uphold summary judgment if there are no genuine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.; </em>V.R.C.P. 56(c)(3). Likewise, our review of a trial court\u2019s interpretation of an insurance contract is \u201cplenary, and nondeferential,\u201d because such an interpretation is a question of law. Towns, 2008 VT 98, \u00b6 8 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b6 6. The central question here is which of the two principal methods of allocating costs and damages is appropriate given the facts of this case. The first allocation method, advocated for by the State, is joint and several liability,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in which \u201cany policy on the risk for any portion of the period in which the insured sustained property damage ... is jointly and severally obligated to respond in full, up to its policy limits, for the loss.\u201d <em>Towns, </em>2008 VT 98, \u00b6 33 (quotation omitted). Under joint and several liability as argued by the State, Stonington would be liable for all cleanup costs up to its policy limits, irrespective of when the contaminant exposure occurred, but would have the right to obtain contribution from other insurers or the owner for the period in which there is no insurance based on a time-on-the risk analysis. The second method, advocated for by Stonington, and adopted by the trial court, is the time-on-the-risk or \u201cpro-ration by years\u201d method in which \u201ceach triggered policy bears a share of the total damages proportionate to the number of years it was on the risk, relative to the total number of years of triggered coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Under this method, Stonington is liable for only 4/27, or 15%, of the cleanup costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b6 7. Specific policy language limiting coverage affects whether liability allocation should be joint and several or related to time on the risk. \u201cClaims-made\u201d policies generally restrict coverage to claims made during the policy period \u201cwithout regard to the timing of the damage or injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 29 (quotation omitted). \u201cOccurrence-based\u201d policies, on the other hand, provide coverage only for injury or property damage \u201cwhich occurs during the policy period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 28 (quotation omitted); see also <em>Montrose Chem. Corp. v. Admiral Ins. Co., </em>913 P.2d 878, 892 (Cal. 1995) (holding that standard occurrence-based policy \u201cwas intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>provide coverage when damage or injury . . . occurs during the policy period\u201d). In cases of contamination from continuing leakage of hazardous materials, courts have used the \u201ccontinuous trigger\u201d theory to find that damage from continuous exposure to contaminants during a policy period is an \u201coccurrence\u201d sufficient to trigger coverage under an occurrence-based policy. See <em>Towns, </em>2008 VT 98, \u00b6 6; see also <em>Montrose, </em>913 P.2d at 894 (stating that under continuous-trigger test, \u201cinjuries and property damage that are continuous or progressively deteriorating throughout successive policy periods are covered by all policies in effect during those periods\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b6 8. The State makes two categories of arguments: (1) <em>Towns </em>should be narrowed so it doesn\u2019t apply to commercial general liability insurance or to litigation brought by the State on behalf of the VPCF; and (2) <em>Towns </em>should not apply on the facts of this case. Before we get to the specifics of these arguments, we summarize our decision in <em>Towns. Towns </em>involved a property owner who, from 1972 to 1987, diverted waste and debris from his waste-hauling business to his own private property to use as fill. This fill resulted in chemical contamination, which was described in the case as generally including \u201can initial \u2018burst\u2019 of constituents lasting several months, followed by a relatively \u2018steady state\u2019 of contamination lasting for as long as the material remains in place.\u201d <em>Towns, </em>2008 VT 98, \u00b6 32. The litigation involved an action filed by the property owner against an insurance company that had provided him a homeowner\u2019s liability policy covering the property from November 1983 to June 1987. The property owner was self-insured from November 1972 until November 1983. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 6 n.2. As in the current case, the insurance policy at issue in <em>Towns </em>was an occurrence-based policy. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 28. We concluded that chemical contamination undoubtedly occurred during the period when the insurance policy was in effect and that the trial court properly applied a continuous-trigger test to determine whether an injury-producing occurrence took place during the policy period. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-32. Under the continuous-trigger test, any insurance carrier who insured the risk during the period from the point the property was first exposed to the migration of hazardous chemicals into the soil and groundwater to the point where the migration ceased is liable in some amount. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the \u201cinjury is deemed to have \u2018occurred\u2019 at each and every point of time at which there was a contributing contamination.\u201d R. Bratspies, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number><em>Splitting the Baby: Apportioning Environmental Liability Among Triggered Insurance Policies, </em>1999 BYU L. Rev. 1215, 1231 (cited in <em>Towns).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\u00b6 9. After determining that there was an occurrence during the period of coverage by the insurance policy, we turned to how the damages caused by the contamination would be allocated. We carefully reviewed numerous commentators and jurisdictions addressing the proper method of allocating insurance coverage in such situations. <em>Towns, </em>2008 VT 98, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. After taking into account various policy considerations, we ultimately held that defense and indemnity costs in <em>Towns </em>were properly allocated between the property owner and the insurance company based on the percentage of each party\u2019s time on the risk. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 38. Thus, based on the total period of the exposure of approximately fourteen and a half years, and the policy period of approximately three and a half years, the decision allocated approximately 25% of the damages to the insurance carrier.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6, 38. We concluded that this method of allocation was the \u201cmost consistent with the continuous-trigger rule and the standard occurrence-based policy provision,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 34, and that the \u201ctime-on-the-risk method offers several policy advantages, including spreading the risk to the maximum number of carriers, easily identifying each insurer\u2019s liability through a relatively simple calculation, and reducing the necessity for subsequent indemnification actions between and among the insurers,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 35. We also held that \u201cwhere the policyholder is self-insured for any period of time on the risk ... it is equally fair and reasonable to hold the policyholder responsible for that portion of the total defense and indemnity costs over which he or she chose to assume the risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\"> \u00b6 10. In its first category of arguments, focusing on the idea that <em>Towns </em>should be narrowed, the State argues that <em>Towns </em>should not apply, and joint and several liability should apply, because the policy involved here was a commercial general liability policy for a gasoline station. Because the station owner is subject to joint and several liability under 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6615(c), and faced the risk of a hazardous waste migration, the State argues that the owner expects that the policy would impose the same joint and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>several liability on the insurer. There are multiple difficulties with the State\u2019s argument. First, <em>Towns </em>is fundamentally based on the occurence-based language of the policy, and the language is not significantly different in the policy in this case. The State correctly notes that, because an insurer generally prepares insurance policies with little meaningful input from the insured, this Court construes insurance policy, language in favor of the insured, in accordance with the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations for coverage. See <em>Hardwick Recycling &amp; Salvage, Inc. v. Acadia Ins. Co., </em>2004 VT 124, \u00b6 23, 177 Vt. 421, 869 A.2d 82. At the same time, however, we \u201cwill not deprive the insurer of unambiguous terms placed in the contract for its benefit.\u201d <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. CNA Ins. Co., </em>2004 VT 93, \u00b6 9, 177 Vt. 215, 862 A.2d 251; see also <em>Vt. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Parsons Hill P\u2019ship, </em>2010 VT 44, \u00b6 28, 188 Vt. 80, 1 A.3d 1016 (reasonable expectations of insured cannot control over unambiguous policy language). We give insurance contracts a \u201cpractical, reasonable, and fair interpretation, consonant with the apparent object and intent of the parties, and strained or forced constructions are to be avoided.\u201d <em>McAlister v. Vt. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n, </em>2006 VT 85, \u00b6 17, 180 Vt. 203, 908 A.2d 455 (quoting <em>Wendell v. Union Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>123 Vt. 294, 297, 187 A.2d 331, 333 (1963)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Bradford\u2019s Stonington policies unambiguously state that the insurance provided \u201capplies to \u2018bodily injury\u2019 and \u2018property damage\u2019 only if: (1) The \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 is caused by an \u2018occurrence\u2019 that takes place in the \u2018coverage territory\u2019; and (2) The \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 occurs during the policy period.\u201d The only reasonable interpretation of this policy language is that Stonington was limiting its liability to damages for occurrences that took place during the policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b6 11. Further, the State has adopted a selective view of the reasonable expectations of the insured. As many courts have held, it is unreasonable to expect that an insurance policy with a specific durational limit will provide coverage for occurrences outside of that limit. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court recently explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">Further, we doubt that an objectively reasonable insured reading the relevant policy language would expect coverage for liability from property damage occurring outside the policy period. Read as a whole, neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Century policy expressly makes or implies a promise to pay one hundred per cent of Boston Gas\u2019s liability for multi-year pollution damage occurring decades before or after the policy period. No reasonable policyholder could have expected that a single one-year policy would cover all losses caused by toxic industrial wastes released into the environment over the course of several decades. Any reasonable insured purchasing a series of occurrence-based policies would have understood that each policy covered it only for property damage occurring during the policy year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><em>Boston Gas Co. v. Century Indem. Co., </em>910 N.E.2d 290, 309 (Mass. 2009). We do not see how this reasonable expectation is any different for an insured under a homeowner\u2019s policy than for an insured under a commercial general liability policy. In fact, virtually all the significant cases in this area have involved commercial general liability policies covering businesses with hazardous waste exposure risk. See <em>Pub. Serv. Co. v. Wallis &amp; Cos., </em>986 P.2d 924, 927-28, 939-40 (Colo. 1999); <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>910 N.E.2d at 294; <em>EnergyNorth Natural Gas, Inc. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, </em>934 A.2d 517, 519, 526 (N.H. 2007); <em>Consol. Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>774 N.E.2d 687, 695 (N.Y. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b6 12. Finally on this point, the State\u2019s argument is based on a supposed equivalence of the insured\u2019s joint and several liability and that of the insurer. We used the term \u201cjoint and several liability\u201d to describe the alternative allocation rule in <em>Towns, </em>but this description only confuses the issue here. Other courts have used different descriptions, and one commentator has urged that \u201c[cjourts . . . refrain from describing the results they reach as having any relationship to \u2018joint and several\u2019 liability when, in fact, no such relationship exists.\u201d W. Hickman <em>&amp; </em>M. DeYoung, <em>Allocation of Environmental Cleanup Liability Between Successive Insurers, </em>17 N. Ky. L. Rev. 291, 315 (1990). In fact, the indemnity obligation of insurance carriers will be determined by contract language and policy limits, which may have no relationship to the duration of insurance or the amount of damages. Thus the contribution of insurers is different from the tort concept of contribution between joint tortfeasors. This difference can be further seen in the fact that even the supposed \u201cjoint and several\u201d liability that the State seeks would allow any insurer that pays the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>State\u2019s cost to seek contribution from other insurers, whereas our common law does not recognize a right of contribution between tortfeasors who are jointly and severally liable, see <em>Swett v. Haig\u2019s, Inc., </em>164 Vt. 1, 5, 663 A.2d 930, 931 (1995). The equivalence on which the State relies is, at best, a rough similarity that may or may not apply in the individual case.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b6 13. To summarize, the reasonable expectation of the insured, if it controls at all, is too uncertain for us to rely upon in fashioning an allocation rule for insurers. The State\u2019s reasonable expectation arguments do not persuade us to abandon <em>Towns </em>or to distinguish that decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\"> \u00b6 14. The State\u2019s second argument in this category is that the <em>Towns </em>allocation rule should not apply when the plaintiff is the VPCF and not the insured. By statute, the State may recover cleanup costs \u201cto the extent covered, when there is insurance coverage.\u201d 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 1941(f). The statute authorizes the State to \u201cseek reimbursement in instances where the land is covered by insurance, to the extent of the coverage.\u201d <em>Agency of Nat. Res. v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>173 Vt. 302, 307, 796 A.2d 476, 480 (2001). Consistent with the use of the term \u201cto the extent covered,\u201d the statute does not govern how coverage will be determined. As the trial court held, the State stands in the shoes of the insured when it sues the insurer. Despite that relationship, the State is arguing that it should be able to recover more from the insurer than the insured can recover. <em>Towns </em>specifically governs the relationship between the insured and the insurer. We see no reason why it should not govern the insurance coverage available to VPCF.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b6 15. The State makes a number of policy arguments why VPCF should be able to recover the full policy limits from any insurer irrespective of the duration of its coverage. For example, the State argues that early VPCF intervention limits the total cost of cleanup and reduces the cost for all responsible parties. It points out that VPCF is not an insurance company that can limit its liability. These arguments presuppose a different statutory scheme in which insurance coverage and the allocation of responsibility between insurers and between insurers and the insured(s) is determined specifically by statute based on the policy concerns the State asserts. In this case, the responsibility of a specific insurer is based on its insurance policy with the insured, and <em>Towns </em>governs that relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>\u00b6 16. The State\u2019s third argument falls mainly in its second category of claims \u2014 that <em>Towns </em>should not apply on the facts of this case. Specifically, the State argues that a share of the liability can be allocated to the owner, Bradford, only if it elected to self-insure during that period and Stonington failed to prove that Bradford did choose to self-insure. The State\u2019s argument is premised on its claim that Stonington had the burden of proof on allocation and that burden included showing the presence and availability of other insurance and Bradford\u2019s reasons for its actions. We cannot accept the State\u2019s argument either as to the burden of proof or as to the importance of the reasons for Bradford\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b6 17. We acknowledge that we did not comprehensively analyze these issues in <em>Towns </em>because they were not raised in that case, and the absence of this analysis enables the State\u2019s argument. In <em>Towns, </em>we said \u201cwhere the policyholder is self-insured for any period of time on the risk, ... it is equally fair and reasonable to hold the policyholder responsible for that portion of the total defense and indemnity costs over which he or she chose to assume the risk.\u201d 2008 VT 98, \u00b6 37. In fact, there are multiple reasons why the evidence may show gaps in insurance coverage: (1) the landowner chose not to purchase insurance; (2) there is insurance, but the carrier is insolvent; (3) there is insurance, but the landowner cannot locate the policy or identify the insurer; (4) there is insurance, but the risk is covered by an exclusion; (5) insurance for the risk involved is unavailable. See T. Jones &amp; J. Hurwitz, <em>An Introduction to Insurance Allocation Issues in Multiple-Trigger Cases, </em>10 Vill. Envtl. L.J. 25, 51 n.115 (1999). In the aggregate, the period of time when there is no effective insurance is known as \u201corphan shares.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51. In general, courts that have adopted time-on-the-risk allocation have not deemed relevant why there is no effective insurance and have allocated orphan shares to the landowner. See S. Plitt &amp; J. Rogers, <em>A Proportional Methodology for Determining Covered Damages Where Continuing and Progressive Injury Is Involved, </em>31 Ins. Litig. Rep. 361, 370 n.31 (2009). The reason is stated in <em>Spartan Petroleum Co. v. Federated Mutual Insurance Co., </em>162 F.3d 805, 812 (4th Cir. 1998), a decision relied upon in <em>Towns-. </em>\u201cTo hold otherwise would be to make an insurer liable for damages that occurred when it was <em>not </em>on the risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\u00b6 18. The State has relied upon a line of cases beginning with <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. United Insurance Co., </em>650 A.2d 974 (N.J. 1994). In <em>Owens-Illinois, </em>the court adopted an allocation that melded time on the risk with policy limits and decided that no period would be allocated to the landowner where insurance was unavailable. <em>Id. </em>at 995-96. Courts following <em>Owens-Illinois </em>have held that an insurer seeking to allocate a period to the landowner bears the burden of proving that insurance was available at that time. See <em>Chem. Leaman Tank Lines, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>177 F.3d 210, 231 (3d Cir. 1999). The State, by its argument, has attempted to limit <em>Towns </em>to any reason for an orphan share other than the first \u2014 intentional self-insurance where insurance extending coverage is available \u2014 and has attempted to place the burden on the insurer to prove that no other reason for lack of coverage applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b6 19. We conclude that the reason for the absence of effective insurance is not determinative. The rationale for the allocation of orphan shares in <em>Owens-Illinois </em>may be consistent with its overall allocation methodology, but it is not consistent with a pure time-on-the-risk methodology. Moreover, we do not want to adopt a methodology that rewards inaction, failure to obtain appropriate coverage, or failure to' keep track of insurance policies. Also, we note that in this case the State challenged a pollution exclusion in the Stonington policy and prevailed. We cannot assume that pollution exclusion provisions in other policies would be effective to prevent liability for other carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b6 20. Apart from the substance of the State\u2019s argument, we cannot accept much of its procedural argument. The State argues that allocation is an affirmative defense that Stonington must plead under V.R.C.P. 8(c), and prove under <em>Pharmacists Mutual Insurance Co. v. Myer, </em>2010 VT 10, \u00b6 14, 187 Vt. 323, 993 A.2d 413. We do not believe that allocation was an affirmative defense in this case. The State brought a cross-claim against Stonington alleging that it was liable for <em>all </em>cleanup costs. It was required to prove this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b621. Assignment of the burden of proof, particularly in insurance coverage cases, must often be based on practical considerations. In <em>State v. CNA Insurance Cos., </em>172 Vt. 318, 329-31, 779 A.2d 662, 671-72 (2001), we assigned to the insurer the burden of proof to show the absence of an occurrence that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>trigger insurance coverage. The issue was whether the pollution was intended or expected from the actions of the insured taken some fifty years earlier. We held that the insurer was in the better position to show an intent to harm the environment rather than imposing the obligation to prove the negative on the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 331, 779 A.2d at 672. As we explained in <em>Northern Security Insurance Co. v. Stanhope, </em>2010 VT 92, \u00b6 10, 188 Vt. 520, 14 A.3d 257, the holding in <em>CNA </em>is intended to avoid leaving the insured the obligation to prove a negative and to place the burden on the party with the most incentive and ability to develop the issue. The State\u2019s theory of burden allocation in this case would leave Stonington proving a negative \u2014 that Bradford did not intend to self-insure \u2014 during periods without effective insurance, including the absence of policies and the failure to obtain complete coverage. While it might have been appropriate to hold that Stonington must prove that insurance with pollution coverage was available from some source, as cases in the <em>Owens-Illinois </em>line held, we do not believe it would be appropriate to make the insurer disprove other reasons why effective insurance was not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b622. Finally, we consider one other argument that the State failed to preserve. The State contends that, due to the equities involved here, the policies at issue should not be construed as occurrence-based policies but, rather, as essentially claims-made policies. It argues that, based on prior Vermont cases, the policies should have included a pollution coverage endorsement providing coverage on a claims-made basis<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that, since Stonington stipulated to coverage here, the company \u201ceffectively acknowledged] that its insurance policy was not enforceable under Vermont law.\u201d We decline to reach the merits of this argument because the State failed to preserve it in the trial court. We have consistently held that matters not raised at the trial court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>not be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Progressive Ins. Co. v. Brown ex rel. </em>Brown, 2008 VT 103, \u00b6 8, 184 Vt. 388, 966 A.2d 666. Preservation requires a party to \u201cpresent the issue with specificity and clarity\u201d at the trial court in order to \u201censure that the original forum is given an opportunity to rule on an issue\u201d prior to review by this Court. <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). In its statement of undisputed facts, the State did mention multiple times that the general insurance policy Stonington issued to Bradford did not contain a pollution endorsement. However, the State never made any argument in the trial court about the effect that this absence might have on the characterization of Stonington\u2019s policy as either occurrence-based or claims-made. We conclude that the State\u2019s references to the pollution endorsement at the trial court were insufficient to properly preserve the pollution endorsement argument now brought on appeal \u2014 the argument was not brought before the trial court with enough clarity to allow the court to rule on it. Because the issue was not properly preserved, we decline to reach it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b623. In conclusion, although the State has argued that our decision in <em>Towns </em>can be distinguished, we conclude that this case fits squarely within the <em>Towns </em>holding. In order for the State to prevail, we would have to overrule much of the <em>Towns </em>holding. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-6\"> The record indicates that two other policies, covering the period between July 18, 1992 and July 18, 1994, have been discovered, but these policies contain pollution exclusion clauses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\"> As discussed <em>infra, </em>\u00b6 12, the description \u201cjoint and several liability\u201d is a misnomer when applied to insurance coverage.
