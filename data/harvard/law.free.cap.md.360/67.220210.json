The claim of the United States is pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Internal Revenue Code and represents mostly a penalty assessed against the deceased for unpaid employment taxes of Shay Heating and Air Conditioning Company, Inc. (\u201cShay Heating\u201d), of which at the time of his death and when the claim accrued, the decedent was the president and sole shareholder. The United States maintained that 31 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3713(a)(1)(B),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Federal Insolvency Statute, gave its claim priority. The Orphans\u2019 Court for Montgomery County found to the contrary and, therefore, ordered the assets of the estate, which were insufficient to pay all of the decedent\u2019s debts, to be distributed in accordance with the ratio of the claims. We granted certiorari on our own motion prior to proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals. We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Daniel M. Shay, the decedent, died testate on October 26, 1994. Pursuant to his will, Carla Bielaski, the appellee,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was appointed personal representative of his estate, which is being probated in the Orphans\u2019 Court for Montgomery County. The Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) filed, in the Orphans\u2019 Court on behalf of the United States, the appellant, and against the decedent\u2019s estate, a Proof of Claim for Internal Revenue Taxes, which alleged the estate\u2019s indebtedness, in the amount of $40,790.98, to the United States. The debt, the IRS stated in the form, was \u201cfor taxes due under the internal revenue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>laws of the United States.\u201d Of the total amount due, $38,528.78 was characterized as \u201cWT-Fica, 100% penalty, Pecuniary loss\u201d while the remaining $2,262.20 was described as \u201cInterest to 06-30-96\u201d and \u201cPenalty to 06-30-96.\u201d Citing \u00a7 3713(a) of the Federal Insolvency Statute, the IRS asserted that the \u201cdebt has priority and must be paid in full in advance of distribution to creditors to the extent provided by law.\u201d In addition to the United States, six general creditors filed claims against the decedent\u2019s estate totaling $271, 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">At the time of his death, in addition to being president and sole shareholder of Shay Heating, the decedent was a 50% partner with Edward Michaels in DMS Associates, a partnership with several real estate holdings. Subsequent to the filing of the claim by the United States, in order to resolve claims and disputes between the decedent\u2019s estate and Mr. Michaels and DMS Associates, Ms. Bielaski and Mr. Michaels entered into a settlement, contingent on court approval, under which Mr. Michaels would purchase the assets of DMS Associates for $14,000, resulting in total assets of the estate of approximately $96, 936.84, and assume all the liabilities of the partnership. In her Motion to Accept Proposed Payment of Claims, the appellee requested that the $74, 936.84 balance remaining in the estate after the administration expenses of $22,000 had been paid, be distributed on a pro-rata basis to the six general creditors of the estate, Rheem Manufacturing, R.E. Michel Company, Lennox Industries, Sandy Spring Bank, Vicky Shay, and Sue Ferris.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Over the United States\u2019 objection and despite its priority argument, after a hearing, the motion was granted and the Orphans\u2019 Court ordered distribution of the estate\u2019s assets to the general creditors pro rata, with the United States to receive none. That portion of the order subsequently was vacated on motion of the United States, however. Thereafter, following a meeting of creditors, the court issued its Memorandum Opinion and Order, in which it rejected the United States\u2019 claim of priority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">\u201cThe claim of the Internal Revenue Service in the amount of Forty Thousand Seven Hundred Ninety Dollars and Nine<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>ty-Eight Cents ($40,790.98) is a claim for penalty and interest upon taxes which have already been paid by or on behalf of the decedent. After an examination of the applicable Estates &amp; Trusts Statute pertaining to this issue, Estates &amp; Trust Section 8-105,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] which sets forth the order of payment when there are insufficient assets in the estate, provides that the sixth item of priority are taxes due by the decedent. It is the belief of this court upon examination of the statute and applicable authorities and upon argument of counsel that the amount due the Internal Revenue service are not taxes due from or by the decedent, but is simply a debt due from the decedent upon taxes previously paid. As a consequence, the claims of the Internal Revenue Service is accorded the same status as other claims under Category 11 of E.T. Sec. 8-105.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The court, instead, ordered that the assets of the estate be distributed among all the creditors, including the United States, pro rata. The motion of the United States to amend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>the judgment to the extent that it failed to accord priority to its claim was denied, after which the United States noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. As noted, while the case was pending in that court, we granted certiorari to address this important issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The United States\u2019 argument is straight forward and simple: the matter of the priority of its claim over that of the general debtors is controlled by the Federal Insolvency Statute and not Maryland law. Noting that \u00a7 3713(a)(1)(B) of that statute requires that \u201c[a] claim of the United States Government shall be paid first when ... the estate of a deceased debtor, in the custody of the executor or administrator, is not enough to pay all debts of the debtor,\u201dit concludes that \u201c[t]he Federal Insolvency Statute thus explicitly and unequivocally gives priority to debts due the United States.\u201d The United States is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">This Court has previously considered the priority of claims by the United States under the Federal Insolvency Statute. In <em>Brown v. Coleman, </em>318 Md. 56, 566 A.2d 1091 (1988), there were competing claims by the United States and the victims of a fraudulent investment scheme to the proceeds of the liquidation sale of the defrauded\u2019s assets. The claim of the United States was for taxes and penalties and interest, the amount of which was based on income, consisting of the monies the defrauder acquired through the fraud, which should have been reported and constituted taxable income, <em>see </em>Internal Revenue Code 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61 (1982, Supp. V 1987). Relying on the Federal Insolvency Statute, the United States asserted priority over any distribution to the victims of the fraud and, because the amount of the claim exceeded the total amount available for distribution, it sought payment of the entire distribution. The Maryland Securities Commissioner, believing that result would be unfair, sought to avoid it by having it declared that the funds were held in constructive trust for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>defrauded investors, and thus unavailable to satisfy the United States\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">This Court held that the United States was entitled to the priority. In so holding, we recognized that the priority of the federal insolvency statute extends to all of a debtor\u2019s property until his debt is paid, <em>Brown v. Coleman, </em>318 Md. at 65-66, 566 A.2d at 1096 (1989), <em>citing Hunter v. United States, </em>5 Pet. 173, 184, 8 L.Ed. 86 (1831), but that what constitutes a debtor\u2019s property at the critical time is a matter of State, rather than federal law. <em>Id. </em>at 66, 566 A.2d at 1096. Moreover, we pointed out that \u201c[t]he priority established by \u00a7 3713 is a matter of federal law. The statute cannot be impaired or superseded by a state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66, 566 A.2d at 1096, <em>citing United States v. Oklahoma, </em>261 U.S. 253, 260, 43 S.Ct. 295, 298, 67 L.Ed. 638, 644 (1923); <em>Field v. United States, </em>9 Pet. 182, 201, 9 L.Ed. 94 (1835); <em>Mickelson v. Barnet, </em>390 Mass. 786, 460 N.E.2d 566, 571 (1984). Finally, we confirmed what the United States now argues, that \u201c[t]he federal insolvency statute \u2018on its free permits of no exceptions whatsoever\u2019 and it \u2018applies to all the insolvent\u2019s debts to the Government, whether or not arising from taxes, and whether or not secured by a lien.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 566 A.2d at 1095, <em>quoting United States v. Vermont, </em>377 U.S. 351, 357, 84 S.Ct. 1267, 1270-1271, 12 L.Ed.2d 370 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><em>Massachusetts v. United States, </em>333 U.S. 611, 68 S.Ct. 747, 92 L.Ed. 968 (1948) is to the same effect. There, the issue was whether the United States has priority, by virtue of the federal insolvency statute, for payment from an insolvent debtor\u2019s estate of federal insurance contribution taxes, unemployment compensation taxes and capital stock taxes, as against a state\u2019s claim for unemployment compensation taxes imposed by its statute conforming to the federal act\u2019s requirements. The Supreme Court held that the United States had priority, pointing out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">\u201c[the insolvency statute] gives priority explicitly for \u2018debts due to the United States\u2019 and the priority given is in terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>absolute, not conditional. Once attaching, it is final and conclusive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 625, 68 S.Ct. at 755-56, 92 L.Ed. at 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Furthermore, it is well settled that taxes due the Government are \u2018debts\u2019 within the meaning of the insolvency statute. <em>Id. </em>at 625, 68 S.Ct. at 755-56, 92 L.Ed at 978. See <em>also United States v. Waddill, Holland, &amp; Flinn, </em>323 U.S. 353, 65 S.Ct. 304, 89 L.Ed. 294 (1945) (unemployment compensation taxes and a debt arising out of a Federal Housing Administration transaction); <em>United States v. Texas, </em>314 U.S. 480, 62 S.Ct. 350, 86 L.Ed. 356 (1941) (gasoline taxes); <em>New York v. Maclay, </em>288 U.S. 290, 53 S.Ct. 323, 77 L.Ed. 754 (1933) (income taxes); <em>Price v. United States, </em>269 U.S. 492, 46 S.Ct. 180, 70 L.Ed. 373 (1926) (income taxes and customs duties); <em>Stripe v. United States, </em>269 U.S. 503, 46 S.Ct. 182, 70 L.Ed. 379 (1926) (income tax, excess profits, and capital stock taxes). So too have tax penalties been recognized as debts for purposes of the insolvency statute. <em>Spokane County v. United States, </em>279 U.S. 80, 49 S.Ct. 321, 73 L.Ed. 621 (1929) (income taxes and penalties); <em>United States v. Rome, </em>414 F.Supp. 517, 518 (D.Mass.1976); <em>Jobbers Credit Association, Inc. v. United States, </em>164 F.Supp. 22, 24 (E.D.N.Y.1958); <em>Mickelson v. Barnet, </em>390 Mass. 786, 460 N.E.2d 566, 570 (1984); <em>In Re Campbell and Campbell, Inc., </em>131 Vt. 617, 313 A.2d 397, 400 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE ORPHANS\u2019 COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO ENTER JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE UNITED STATES.
