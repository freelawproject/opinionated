Brantner, the appellee, who had altered such a letter, and the State noted its appeal. We granted certiorari on our own motion while the case was pending in the Court of Special Appeals. We agree with the Circuit Court and, therefore, affirm the judgment of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">On August 21, 1997, the appellee was a defendant in the case of <em>State v. Brantner, </em>No. 19914, a criminal case which was then pending in the Circuit Court for Washington County. By letter of that date, the Honorable John H. McDowell, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>judge of that court, wrote to Gordon A. Lynn, the attorney representing appellee in the case, with respect to scheduling <em>in </em>that case, sending copies of the letter to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, the appellee, the Sheriffs Department, the Assignment Clerk, and the Clerk of the Court. As written by Judge McDowell, the letter read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-4\">\u201cPlease note that the Court has scheduled a modification hearing on September 8, 1997, at 9:00 a.m., for the above-captioned case. Please make arrangements to be in court on that date and time. Thank you for your cooperation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">On the copy he received, appellee deleted the date and the text of the letter, replacing the text with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">\u201cAs per the case scheduled for September 1997, a Stay was placed on the charges, and the probation, due to extenuating circumstances. As of October 15, 1998, Mr. John E. Brant-ner, Jr. was completely exonerated of all charges, pertaining to case No: 19914 CT.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">As a result, the appellee subsequently was charged with violation of Article 27, \u00a7 45A (b). That section prohibits any wilful alteration, defacement, destruction, removal, or concealment of any public record.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Following trial, the Circuit Court expressed dismay that the appellee \u201cpresumably altered one of its colleague\u2019s letters for his own personal benefit\u201d and found that the appellee\u2019s actions were \u201cimmoral, fraudulent and downright childish in nature.\u201d Nevertheless, the court agreed with appellee that a photocopy of a judge\u2019s letter did not constitute a \u201cpublic record\u201d within the ambit of \u00a7 45A (a)(1) and, thus, its alteration \u201csimply [does] not constitute a violation of Article 27, section 45A.\u201d It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">\u201cThe definition of public record in Article 27, section 45A is somewhat modified and limited by the adjective \u2018official\u2019. It says \u2018official books, papers or records.\u2019 And the term \u2018official\u2019 relates to someone holding office. In this case, the official public record is the copy of Judge McDowell\u2019s letter maintained by the clerk of court. Interestingly, the definition of public record in Article 27, section 45A does not</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>include photocopies. However, in section 10 \u2014 611(f) of the State Government Article, the General Assembly specifically included photocopies in the definition of public record in that article. In Article 27, section 45A, the legislature chose not to .include \u2018photocopy\u2019 within the definition of public record. In this case, if the allegations are true, the defendant would presumably be guilty of uttering a willfully altered or defaced public record if such a crime existed in Maryland. The term uttering means to circulate as if authentic or genuine. However there is no such crime as uttering forged public records in Maryland, although there is such a crime in Virginia[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] and some other jurisdictiona.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The State challenges the Circuit Court\u2019s premise, that \u00a7 45A (a)(1)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> does not include within its reach copies or photocopies of official documents. It argues that the statute is not under-inclusive, as it clearly covers \u201call\u201d official papers, \u201cwhether kept on a manual or automated basis,\u201d thus including copies. The only limitation \u00a7 45A (a)(1) imposes, the State asserts, is that the public records be \u201ccreated, received, or used by the State or any agency thereof....\u201d Therefore, it submits, unlike Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 10-611(f) of the State Government Article,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> upon which the court and the appellee rely and which specifically includes the term \u201ccopy\u201d in its definition of \u201cpublic record,\u201d given the use of the term \u201call,\u2019\u2019encompassing both categories, there was no need to specify in \u00a7 45A (a)(1) that it covered originals as well as copies. Contrary to the appellee\u2019s argument, the State argues that if the Legislature had wanted to limit \u00a7 45A (a)(1) to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>originals of public records, it would have so stated explicitly or, at least, more clearly.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Noting the purpose of the statute, to criminalize the alteration, defacement, removal, or destruction of any public record and the necessity for the court, in the fulfillment of its duties, to communicate with all parties, the accomplishment of which frequently requires that copies or photocopies of official documents be sent to those parties, the State maintains that the appellee\u2019s removal of the official text of the letter, replacing it with his own, was an attempt to pass off as official a false statement exonerating himself. Thus, it asserts, though quickly found out, the appellee\u2019s use of the official letterhead, found on the court generated document, as well as his misappropriation of Judge McDowell\u2019s signature, illustrates an intent, i.e. a wilfulness, to: make a false entry in a public record; alter a public record; and intentionally access a public record. Consequently, as the State sees it, the appellee\u2019s actions violated not some, but all three of the actions prohibited by \u00a7 45A (a)(1). It also urges that, if the Court were to hold that the appellee was immune from punishment because the document he altered was a copy and not an original, anyone who would alter a document created and issued by the State would simply copy it before making the alterations and, thereby, avoid the reach and the penalties of \u00a7 45A.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The issue this Court must resolve involves statutory interpretation. We approach that task by seeking to discern the intent of the Legislature in enacting the statute. <em>Handy v. State, </em>357 Md. 685, 704, 745 A.2d 1107, 1117 (2000) (Court\u2019s paramount objective is to ascertain and effectuate intent of legislature when it enacted statute.) This requires reading and interpreting the entire statute, neither adding, nor deleting, words in order to give it a meaning not otherwise evident by the words actually used. <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 145, 626 A.2d 946, 950 (1993); <em>Bd. of Educ. of Garrett County v. Lendo, </em>295 Md. 55, 63, 453 A.2d 1185, 1189 (1982); <em>Smelser v. Criterion Ins. Co., </em>293 Md. 384, 389, 444 A.2d 1024, 1027 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>(1982). The search for legislative intent begins by looking first at the words of the statute. <em>Williams v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 101, 115, 753 A.2d 41, 49 (2000) ( Legislative intent must be sought first in actual language of statute.). If, giving the words used by the Legislature their ordinary and common meaning, see <em>Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 335, 748 A.2d 478, 483 (2000) ( As a rule, the Court of Appeals views the words of a statute in ordinary terms, in their natural meaning, in the manner in which they are most commonly understood), the statute is clear, we need look no further. <em>Adamson v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc., </em>359 Md. 238, 251, 753 A.2d 501, 508 (2000) (If the Legislature\u2019s intentions are evident from the text of the statute, a court\u2019s inquiry will normally cease and the plain meaning of the statute will govern); <em>Williams v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>359 Md. at 116, 753 A.2d at 49 (2000) (Where statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity, and expresses a definite and simple meaning, court normally does not look beyond words of statute to determine legislative intent) Only if the words of the statute are ambiguous need we seek the Legislature\u2019s intent in the legislative history or other extraneous sources. <em>Marsheck v. Board of Trustees of Fire &amp; Police Employees\u2019 Retirement System of City of Baltimore, </em>358 Md. 393, 403, 749 A.2d 774, 779 (2000) (If statute\u2019s language is ambiguous, court will look towards other sources, such as relevant case law and legislative history, to aid in determining legislature\u2019s intentions); <em>Resper v. State, </em>354 Md. 611, 619, 732 A.2d 863, 867 (1999) (If a statute contains an ambiguity, the court must look to not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of the enactment in order to find a construction that best realizes the legislative intent) Moreover, construction requires that the statute be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is illogical or incompatible with common sense. <em>D &amp; Y, Inc. v. Winston, </em>320 Md. 534, 538, 578 A.2d 1177, 1179 (1990); <em>Blandon v. State, </em>304 Md. 316, 319, 498 A.2d 1195, 1196 (1985); <em>Erwin and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>Shafer, Inc. v. Pabst Brewing Co., </em>304 Md. 302, 315, 498 A.2d 1188, 1194 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Section 45A (a)(1) is clear and unambiguous in the statement of the requirements of a public record. To be a public record as defined by that section, the \u201cofficial books, papers, or records\u201d must have been \u201ccreated, received, or used by the State or any agency thereof\u2019 and kept, \u201cwhether ... on a manual or automated basis,\u201d by the State or the governmental agency creating, receiving or using them. The latter requirement is not stated as directly as the former, but it is nevertheless clear beyond cavil that it is prescribed by the statute. The reference to \u201cmanual or automated basis,\u201d addressing the manner in which the governmental entity retains the official document, not the manner in which it is generated, a meaning that is confirmed by the Legislature\u2019s use of the term, \u201ckept,\u201d in connection with the phrase, is necessary only if the keeping or retention of the records is an essential requirement of the definition. This is further confirmed by the fact that, to read the statute as the State proposes would render the phrase, \u201cwhether kept on a manual or automated basis,\u201d meaningless and mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Moreover, under the State\u2019s interpretation, not only the record retained by the official or agency, but all copies generated and disbursed by the official or agency pursuant to the official\u2019s or agency\u2019s official duties would be \u201cpublic records.\u201d Taking that interpretation to its logical conclusion, any copy of any public record in the hands of the recipient would be subject to the proscriptions of \u00a7 45A (b), so that any such recipient who wilfully alters the copy in possession would be guilty of a violation of that section, notwithstanding that the copy in the hands of the governmental agency remains fully intact and in no way compromised. This is so because, logically, the violation would occur at the moment the alteration is made and notwithstanding the intent with which the alteration was made or whether the altered document is published or circulated. There simply is no requirement in \u00a7 45A (a)(1) that the accused have an intent to defraud by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>means of the alteration or even that the altered document be circulated or published.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Recognizing, apparently, that an interpretation of the statute to mean that the mere alteration of a copy of a public record in the hands of a third party is actionable<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> defies common sense, the State at oral argument made clear that its argument is not so limited. Rather, acknowledging the importance to the proper functioning of the government of having accurate copies of government-related records, it maintained that it is the manner in which the altered record is used or attempted to be used that is dispositive. That argument was rejected by the Circuit Court. We do, as well. By its very terms, which, as we have seen, are not ambiguous, \u00a7 45A (a)(1), as we have also observed, prohibits the wilful alteration of a public document. It does not prescribe the purpose for which the alteration must be made to be actionable or the manner in which the altered document must be used. We shall not add an element to the statute to make criminal what otherwise would not be, or to give to the statute a meaning that it does not have.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The legislative history of section 45A and the interpretation other courts have given similar, although admittedly not identical, statutes confirm our interpretation. Section 45A was enacted in 1979, in response to the decision by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Reese v. State, </em>37 Md.App. 450, 378 A.2d 4 (1977).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At issue in that case was the sufficiency of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>evidence to sustain the conviction of the accused pursuant to Maryland Code (1951, 1976 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 44 of forgery of an \u201cacquittance or receipt for money or property,\u201d which that s\u00e9ction proscribed. Although it was clear that accused was shown to have been responsible for some of the false entries made in the tax rolls, the court reversed the accused\u2019s conviction, holding that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">\u201cThe actions imputable to the [accused], even if fraudulent, did not constitute forgery generally and did not constitute forgery of acquittances or receipts specifically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">Forgery, in its most fundamental character, is not an offense involving false and fraudulent writing generally but is a very specific offense in the nature of counterfeiting. It involves not the making of false entries for fraudulent purposes in an otherwise genuine document but the very manufacturing of a false or spurious document itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-7\"><em>Reese, </em>37 Md.App. at 454, 378 A.2d at 6, <em>citing </em>Clark and Marshall, The Law of Crimes (Sixth Wingersky Edition) at 845-846, <em>noting, </em>LaFave and Scott, Criminal Law (1972) at 671 and Perkins, Criminal Law (2nd Ed., 1969) at 345. Thus, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">\u201cthat in this case the making of false entries in the tax rolls may well have been fraudulent but was not a forgery. There was no manufacturing or counterfeiting of a spurious or non-genuine tax roll; there was merely the making of false statements in a genuine document.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-9\"><em>Reese </em>at 458, 378 A.2d at 8. Section 45A fills the gap which <em>Reese </em>identified. It is significant that in <em>Reese </em>the documents altered were clearly public records, tax rolls. Thus, there is no indication that the General Assembly was intending to do more than that, fill that gap, or that it intended to broaden the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>definition of public records. In that regard, it is also interesting that one of the states to which the court looked in reaching its decision was Colorado. That State was also mentioned in the legislative history file, in the context of indicating that the Colorado statute was similar to what was proposed by \u00a7 45A.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The Colorado statute that is similar to \u00a7 45A is Colo.Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 18-8-114. Captioned \u201cAbuse of public records,\u201d it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">\u201c(1) A person commits a class 1 misdemeanor if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">\u201c(a) The person knowingly makes a false entry in or falsely alters any public record; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"av-dedup-0\">\u201c(b) Knowing the person lacks the authority to do so, the person knowingly destroys, mutilates, conceals, removes, or impairs the availability of any public record; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqc\">\u201c(c) Knowing the person lacks the authority to retain the record, the person refuses to deliver up a public record in the person\u2019s possession upon proper request of any person lawfully entitled to receive such record; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq_\">\u201c(d) Knowing the person has not been authorized by the custodian of the public record to do so, the person knowingly alters any public record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">\u201c(2) As used in this section, the term \u201cpublic record\u201d includes all official books, papers, or records created, received, or used by or in any governmental office or agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQk\">Although not involving this statute, the Supreme Court of Colorado has addressed the issue of what constitutes a public record. In <em>People v. Trujillo, </em>185 Colo. 14, 521 P.2d 769, 770 (1974), the court construed the phrase, \u201cof or belonging to any public office within this state.\u201d In that case, a probation officer who submitted an application for chief probation officer containing two material misrepresentations, was charged with violating 1967 Perm. Supp., C.R.S.1968, 40-7-9, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u201cOfficer purloining records \u2014 penalty. If any judge, sheriff, coroner, clerk, recorder, or other public officer, or any person whatsoever, shall steal, fraudulently convert, alter, corrupt, withdraw, falsity, or avoid, any record, process, charter, gift, grant, conveyance, bond, or contract, or shall knowingly and willfully take off, discharge, or conceal any issue, forfeited recognizance, or other forfeiture, or shall forge, deface, or falsify any document or instrument recorded, or any registry, acknowledgment, or certificate, or shall alter, deface, of falsify any minute, document, book, or proceeding whatever, Of or belonging to any public office within this state, the person so offending upon conviction shall be punished by confinement in the state penitentiary for a term not less than one year nor more than seven years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Affirming the dismissal of the charges, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">\u201cthat a violation of Section 40-7-9 occurs only where a person falsifies or otherwise corrupts a record which is in, or is required by law to be in, the custody on control of a public agency at the time of falsification. The statute does not apply to a situation like that present here, where, when falsified, the application for the position sought did not belong to any public office within this state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">This interpretation was supported by the two cases that previously had addressed the issue: <em>Downing v. Brown, </em>3 Colo. 571 (1877) and <em>Shimmel v. People, </em>108 Colo. 592, 121 P.2d 491 (1942). In, <em>Downing, </em>the court determined that a personal book kept by a probate judge \u201cfor his own information and convenience which contained records not germane to his office was not a public record.\u201d <em>Trujillo, </em>521 P.2d at 770. Citing <em>Shimmel, </em>the <em>Trujillo </em>court held that unused civil service examinations were not public records, reasoning that \u201cthe statute was designed to inhibit the alteration of records which were prepared by, and in, the custody of a public agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The Colorado \u201cAbuse of public records statute,\u201d \u00a7 18-8-114(2) is consistent; its definition of public records as \u201cofficial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>books, papers, or records created, received, or used by or in any governmental office or agency\u201d evidences the same focus and rationale. Section 45A\u2019s definition of public records is quite similar. In fact, by referencing the manner in which the records are kept, it is more precise in that regard than the Colorado law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This confirms the interpretation we have given \u00a7 45A. <em>See also </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 13-2407(B) (West 1999), defining \u201cpublic record,\u201d as used in subsection (A) of that statute,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to mean \u201call official books, papers, written instruments or records created, issued, received or kept by any governmental office or agency or required by law to be kept by others for the information of the government;\u201d Mo. Ann. Stat. 575.010(8) (West 1999), limiting \u201cpublic record\u201d to \u201cany document which a public servant is required by law to keep;\u201d Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 28-911(2) (1999), defining \u201cpublic record\u201d to include \u201call official books, papers, or records created, received, or used by or in any governmental office or agency.\"<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>That interpretation is also shared by other courts that have confronted the issue. In <em>People v. Parks, </em>7 Cal.App.4th 883, 9 Cal.Rptr.2d 450 (1992), for example, the issue was whether a falsified temporary restraining order was, at the time the defendant altered it, a \u201cpublic record,\u201d within the meaning of Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 6201,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> proscribing a non custodian\u2019s alteration or destruction of public records. <em>Acknowledging, citing People v. Garfield, </em>40 Cal.3d 192, 219 Cal.Rptr. 196, 707 P.2d 258, 260 (Ca.1985) (holding with respect to a -will altered before it was offered for filing, that \u201c[a] will is not a public document before it is filed for probate.\u201d), the accuracy of the defendant\u2019s observation that a document requires to be filed does not become a public record until it is filed, the court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument in that case \u201cbecause the signed genuine TRO Parks obtained from Judge Mason was, when obtained, part of a court file.\u201d <em>Parks </em>at 888, 9 Cal. Rptr.2d 450. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">\u201cIn this case Parks altered an original court record which had been stamped with a case number and the day and date and signed by a judge, although thereafter it was to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>returned to the clerk\u2019s office for filing and obtaining of conformed copies of the original for further use. Under prior case authority, \u201cthere can be no doubt that court records are public records\u201d <em>(Estate of Hearst </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 777, 782, 136 Cal.Rptr. 821) and the documents in a court file are \u201cpublic records.\u201d <em>(People v. McKenna </em>(1953) 116 Cal.App.2d 207, 211, 255 P.2d 452.) When Parks obtained and then falsified this public record he committed the offense proscribed by Government Code sections 6200-6201.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 888, 9 Cal.Rptr.2d 450 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Injuring public records is a crime in Louisiana. As defined in La.Rev.Stat.

Shows, </em>508 So.2d 991 (La.App. 2d Cir.1987), the court delineated the elements of the crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">\u201c(1) intentional removal or concealment; (2) of a public record; (3) the public record has been filed or deposited; (4) the filing or depositing was by authority of law; and (5) the filing or depositing is in a public office or -with a public officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 994, <em>citing State v. Gomez, </em>433 So.2d 230 (La.App. 1st Cir.1983), <em>writs denied </em>440 So.2d 730 and 441 So.2d 747 (La.1983). The court commented specifically on the 4th element:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">\u201cWe conclude that the element \u201cfiled or deposited, by authority of law,\u201d requires more than a mere physical placing or keeping in storage in a public office or with a public officer. LSA-R.S. 14:132 contemplates either that the law expressly mandate or permit the filing or depositing of the record in question and that there be in addition some official act of filing or depositing. Unless these requirements are met, there is no violation of the statute; consequently we have focused directly on these requirements\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Of significance to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the <em>Shows </em>court was clear and emphatic in its statement that that element applied equally to the duplicate of a document, even when \u201cthe record tends to establish that the duplicate would be retained in the normal course of ... business and would serve as a record of the transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The Military courts are in agreement. In <em>United States v. McCoy, </em>47 M.J. 658, 656 (1997), the U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals, construing Article 184 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 984, held that \u201cthe mere completion of a blank form indicating graduation from an Army school and presentment of that document to military officials as proof of such schooling does not constitute the offense of wrongfully altering a public record.\u201d In reaching its conclusion, the court pointed out, <em>citing United States v. Spain, </em>17 U.S.C.M.A. 347, 38 C.M.R. 145, 146-47, 1968 WL 5352 (1968), and <em>United States v. Oglivie, </em>29 M.J. 1069, 1071 (A.C.M.R.1990), that the article 134 offense was derived from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2071(a)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>, the intent of which is to \u2018 \u201cprevent any conduct which deprives the government of the use of its documents.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 664, <em>quoting Oglivie, </em>29 M.J. at 1071 <em>(citing United States v. Rosner, </em>352 F.Supp. 915, 919 (S.D.N.Y.1972), petition denied, 497 F.2d 919 (2d Cir.1974)). Thus, it opined, \u201c[t]he essence of the Article 134, UCMJ, offense is whether the charged misconduct disturbs the integrity of the public record itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654-55. To like effect is <em>United States v. Isler, </em>36 M.J. 1061 (1993). In that case the issue was whether the alteration of the personal copy of a permanent change of station order constituted the wrongful alteration of a public record,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in violation of Article 134. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Concluding that it did not, but acknowledging that the definition of \u201cpublic records\u201d envisions documents in possession of an \u201cofficial function,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1064, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">\u201cAlthough the level where a public record may be maintained is appropriately low for the military offense, <em>ie., </em>unit or staff function, we do not construe the definition to lower it to the individual ownership level____ To hold every personal copy of one\u2019s PCS orders is a public record would, in effect, make every airman an official custodian of those copies, for we believe that is the only means for imposing individual criminality for not protecting one\u2019s personal copies as a public record. Plainly, as currently drafted, there is insufficient notice in the offense to do so. Because MCM, Part IV, paragraph 99 prescribes a criminal offense, in the absence of clear proscriptions, we must restrict its applications to reasonable parameters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">In so concluding, the court rejected arguments quite similar to those made by the State in this case. <em>Id. </em>at 1064. <em>See United States v. Osborn, </em>32 M.J. 854 (N.M.C.M.R.1991) (alteration of officially authenticated copy of divorce decree in possession of the service person not a public record); <em>United States v. Oglivie, </em>29 M.J. 1069 (A.C.M.R.1990) (alteration of personal copy of divorce decree not a public record).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Given the legislative history of the statute, as well as the reasoning behind similar statutes, it is thus clear that the purpose of the \u00a7 45A (a)(1) is protection of those public records in official custody, and not the protection of personal, officially generated copies of public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\">.
