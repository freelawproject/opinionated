Edwin Brown, P.A., The Peach Tree Road Investment Co.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rex L. Sturm, P.A., R. Edwin Brown, Esquire, and Rex L. Sturm, Esquire. The circuit court granted the respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the petitioners\u2019 law claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations and their equity claims were barred by laches. A divided panel of the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Frederick Road Limited Partnership v. Brown and Sturm, </em>121 Md.App. 384, 710 A.2d 298 (1998). This Court granted certiorari to address two issues: whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment by determining, as matter of law, that the petitioners were on notice that their losses were caused by the legal malpractice or fraud committed by their attorneys and whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the grounds that the petitioners\u2019 contract claims were barred by statute of limitations and their equitable claim precluded by the doctrine of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">We shall hold that summary judgment in this case was inappropriate. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">In 1981, with the goal of minimizing potential estate and gift taxes, Mr. W. Lawson King and Mrs. Cordelia E. King (\u201cthe Kings\u201d) sought to transfer 438 acres of farm land in Montgomery County, known as the \u201cKing Farm,\u201d to their three children. To accomplish this goal, the Kings sought legal advice from the respondent, R. Edwin Brown, Esquire, (\u201cBrown\u201d), a Montgomery County real estate attorney, who had been engaged in the private practice of law for more than thirty (30) years with a primary focus in condemnation and other land valuation cases. Mr. King had known Brown since high school, and Brown had previously represented Mr. King in a land condemnation case in the 1970\u2019s. The Kings also sought accounting and financial advice from their certified public accountant, Mr. August C. Bonsall (\u201cBonsall\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Brown and Bonsall began working together to estimate the value of the land and calculate the potential taxes. Bonsall believed the value of the King Farm was between $20 million and $100 million. Brown believed that the King Farm could be valued at much less and result in significant tax savings, if the farm were appraised using a \u201cfarm-use only\u201d valuation. Brown therefore, after procuring three appraisals of the King Farm, each of which, at his instruction, valued the property for \u201cfarm-use only,\u201d received estimates for the farm at between $515,000 and $720,000. To justify this price under the various tax codes, Brown proposed that the Kings place a three-year \u201cfarm-use only\u201d easement on the property. This method, he assured the Kings and their children, would comply with applicable provisions of the federal and local tax codes, and result in significant tax savings.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Bonsall discussed the accounting and legal particulars of the plan with G. Van Velsor Wolf, Esquire (\u201cWolf\u2019), whom he contacted for that purpose. The Kings had often consulted Wolf for legal and estate planning advice. Wolf disagreed with Brown\u2019s advice, calling it \u201cbadly flawed\u201d from an estate planning perspective. Thereafter, Wolf and members of his law firm, Piper &amp; Marbury, met with Mr. King to discuss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>alternatives to the plan and to explain their view that any taxes would be based, not on the value of the land with the temporary agricultural easement, but on the \u201cfair market value\u201d of the farm at its \u201chighest and best use.\u201d Wolf proposed several alternative plans, finally advising Mr. King that a charitable lead trust would be the most advantageous estate-planning vehicle. Mr. King authorized Wolf to prepare such a trust for his consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">After being informed that Mr. King had consulted with Wolf, who disagreed with his plan, Brown met with Mr. King and reassured him that selling the property with a farm-use only easement would be legitimate under the tax codes and, what\u2019s more, would be the most beneficial method, from a tax savings perspective, of transferring the land. Persuaded by Brown, and without notice to Wolf or his law firm, the Kings decided to proceed with Brown\u2019s advice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, on February 5, 1982, King executed a deed transferring approximately 418<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> acres of the King Farm to two limited partnerships created by the King children: (1) Frederick Road Limited Partnership, for which the petitioner, Mrs. Aschenbach, served as general partner; and (2) Field Farms Limited Partnership, for which the Kings other children served as general partners.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The total sale price was $596,942.95, representing the average of the three \u201cfarm-use only\u201d appraisals.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Mr. King subsequently discharged Wolf as the couple\u2019s attorney. In reply, Wolf wrote a lengthy letter to Mr. King, with a copy to Brown, expressing concern about the potential tax consequences of the property transfer transaction. Wolf believed that the fair market value of the farm could be between $27 million and $54 million and that the sale could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>lead to serious tax consequences. In the letter, Wolf explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\">\u201c[A]s of the present moment I either know or have every reason to believe that the property you recently transferred to your children for $566,434.18 [sic] did not have a \u201cfan-market value\u201d \u2014 which is the test under all three of the federal tax laws, to wit, income, gift and estate \u2014 of that amount or anywhere near it. On the contrary, ... the true value of that land for federal estate tax purposes is far, far in excess of $1,500 an acre.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">\u201cI have been advised by a very knowledgeable, experienced and responsible person who is wholly familiar with the property ... that at the very least the \u201chome farm\u201d as transferred to the children is worth $1.50 a square foot or $65,340 an acre. That is, for 418 acres the minimum federal income tax valuation might well be in the neighborhood of $27,312,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">\u201cAccording to our figures if the Internal Revenue Service should use what I was advised to be a \u201crealistic\u201d value of the property per acre, that is $3.00 per square foot, or a total of $54,624,240, the federal gift tax which you and Mrs. King would have to come up with would be approximately $33,943,000 in cash. ... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">After receiving the letter, the Kings and their children immediately called a meeting with Brown to discuss Wolfs concerns. Again, however, Brown unequivocally assured them that the transaction as he proposed it was legitimate and that Wolfs warnings were simply a difference of professional opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Soon after the sale, however, Brown had difficulty recording the deed in the Montgomery County land records. Montgomery County officials believed that the sale price, upon which the County transfer tax would be imposed, was far below the fair market value of the farm. An Assistant County Attorney advised Brown that the State Department of Assessment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Taxation (\u201cSDAT\u201d) had appraised the farm, as of March 16, 1982, without improvements, at approximately $9 million. Despite the SDAT appraisal, Brown again assured the Kings that the transaction was legitimate and that the problems with the county would be resolved without the payment of additional taxes. Brown\u2019s advice soon proved to be correct; thereafter, Brown successfully recorded the deed in the county records without either modifying the sale price or paying any additional taxes. Thus, in December of 1982, with confidence in Brown\u2019s advice, the Kings conveyed the remaining 20-acre homestead to their children for the stated consideration of $248,100, again based upon the farm-use only appraisals.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Mrs. King died in 1983 and Mr. King in 1985. Soon after their deaths, the IRS began investigating the property transfer transaction. Brown, on behalf of the King children, responded to the IRS inquiries, at all times defending the transaction as legitimate. In July and August of 1987, however, the IRS issued a deficiency assessment, totaling more than $68 million in taxes and penalties, against the estates of the Kings, as well as the King children. The IRS stated that the \u201cunderpayment of tax\u201d was \u201cdue to a valuation underpayment which was less than 40 percent of the correct value.\u201d The King children, however, were not particularly concerned about the deficiency notices because Brown had told them to expect an IRS challenge. At the same time, Brown advised them that the challenge would be resolved without the payment of additional taxes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Brown represented the King children in the tax matter on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>reverse contingency basis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because Brown had never argued a case in the federal tax court, he requested and received permission from the King children to hire Charles Burton, Esquire (\u201cBurton\u201d), an experienced tax litigator. The King children agreed to compensate Burton at $125 per hour. The King children also agreed to hire four independent appraisers to retroactively assess the \u201cfair market value\u201d of the property. When completed, each appraisal was substantially higher than Brown\u2019s pre-sale estimates and substantially lower than Bon-sall and Wolfs pre-sale estimates. The four appraisers assessed the fair market value of the King Farm at $6.2 million, $10.4 million, $5.1 million, and 4.9 million, respectively, averaging approximately $6.7 million. Both Brown and Sturm believed that these appraisals were good and would stand up at the trial in tax court, but they did not abandon their primary position that the original land valuation plan was legally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">In December of 1988, two weeks before the scheduled trial in tax court, Brown advised the King children to settle the case for $20 million in taxes and penalties. Brown\u2019s sole reason for this advice was that the IRS files contained a copy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>of the June 30,1982 letter from Wolf, and Brown believed that this compromised all of his defenses. Neither Burton, the King children\u2019s tax attorney, nor Brown attempted to challenge the admissibility of the letter in tax court. Moreover, at no time during the representation in tax court or thereafter did Burton or Brown advise the King children that they may have a cause of action against Brown for negligent advice. Later that month, the King children decided to take Brown\u2019s advice and settled with the IRS for the recommended $20 million.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Pursuant to the reverse contingency agreement, the settlement resulted in legal fees owed to Brown and his law firm in excess of $4.8 million.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The King children also owed Burton $30,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Brown continued to represent the King children in all matters related to the farm, including assisting them with borrowing $20 million, from a bank, secured by the King Farm to pay the IRS, and assisting with the establishment of an $11 million line of credit to service the debt. The attorney\u2019s fees and bank loan were to be satisfied from the proceeds of the sale of the King Farm, of which Brown <em>&amp; </em>Sturm was the sole agent for receipt of offers or plans for purchase, and controlled all negotiations concerning disposition of the King Farm. Additionally, Brown recommended that the King children retain yet another attorney, Bayard Z. Hochberg (\u201cHoch-berg\u201d), to institute a legal malpractice claim against Wolf and Piper &amp; Marbury. As Brown viewed it, the release of the letter to the IRS by Wolf or members of his law firm, was a breach of the attorney-client privilege and the direct and proximate cause of the $20 million in damages sustained by the King children. Following Brown\u2019s assurances, the King children hired Hochberg and filed the malpractice claim against Wolf and Piper &amp; Marbury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Brown remained actively involved with Hochberg in the malpractice suit against Wolf and Piper <em>&amp; </em>Marbury. Hoch-berg\u2019s initial engagement letter was actually addressed to Brown <em>&amp; </em>Sturm, and Hochberg\u2019s first meeting on the malpractice matter was with Brown. Moreover, much of Hochberg\u2019s investigation was based upon information provided to him from Brown &amp; Sturm\u2019s files. Hochberg also sent Brown &amp; Sturm the original complaint for review and comment before filing. At no time did Hochberg, Brown, or any member of Brown &amp; Sturm inform the King children that they may have a cause of action against Brown individually or against the law firm of Brown &amp; Sturm.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In May of 1991, the attorney representing Wolf and Piper &amp; Marbury, George Beall, Esquire (\u201cBeall\u201d), sent Hochberg a letter stating, among other things, that Wolf and Piper &amp; Marbury had done nothing wrong, and that if the King children were harmed in any way it was the result of Brown &amp; Sturm\u2019s bad advice and estate counseling. Hochberg sent a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>copy of the letter to Brown, but neither Brown nor Hochberg shared this letter with the King children.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">On October 21, 1992, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County granted Wolf and Piper &amp; Marbury\u2019s motion for summary judgment. That court reasoned that Wolfs letter would have been inadmissible in the federal tax case, and that, even if it were admissible, the letter was not the legal cause of any damage suffered by the King family. Instead, the circuit court strongly suggested that the damages sustained by the King children were the result of two things: 1) Brown <em>&amp; </em>Sturm\u2019s bad advice, dating back to the inception of the property transfer sale in 1981; and 2) Brown\u2019s failure to object to the admissibility of the letter before the tax court. Specifically, with reference to the admissibility of the letter, the trial judge, Judge Messitte, opined: \u201c[B]y the slightest exertion of effort by Plaintiffs or their counsel, they could have prevented the document from ever coming into evidence in the first place.\u201d <em>See King v. Davis, </em>Civ. No.82446, slip opinion at 13 (Cir. Ct. Montgomery County, Oct. 21, 1992). The petitioners noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Adopting the reasoning of the trial court, that court, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the summary judgment order.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The King children subsequently discharged Brown &amp; Sturm as their attorneys and, in May of 1995, almost seven years after the final settlement with the IRS, filed the present cause of action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. In it, they sought damages for the respondents\u2019 legal malpractice, fraud, civil conspiracy, breach of fiduciary duty, and aiding and abetting.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They also sought equitable relief; in particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>lar, the rescission of the retainer agreement, including subsequent amendments to that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The Circuit Court granted the respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment on all counts, ruling that all were barred by the applicable statute of limitations and/or by laches. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">\u201c[The King children] necessarily knew at [the] point of final settlement [with the IRS] that the representations and promises made by [Brown <em>&amp; </em>Sturm] regarding avoidance of additional taxes had not and would not ever be realized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4\">\u201cIn short the undisputed facts indicated that [the King children] were or should have been put on notice, at least at that point in time [when they settled with the IRS for $ 20 million] such that a reasonable person would have made reasonable inquiry as to the cause of action against [Brown &amp; Sturm].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">A divided Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Frederick Road Limited Partnership et. al., v. Brown &amp; Sturm, et al., </em>121 Md.App. 884, 710 A.2d 298 (1998). The majority of that court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">\u201c[T]he conclusion is inescapable that the court properly granted summary judgment. Once appellants settled the tax case, they had actual knowledge of sufficient material facts giving rise to their claims against appellees. Appellants\u2019 attempt to \u2018shoot the messenger,\u2019 by filing suit against Wolf and Piper [<em>&amp; </em>Marbury] for allegedly exposing appellees\u2019 flawed tax strategy, did not toll the statute of limitations. Appellants\u2019 reasoning as to inquiry notice is plainly flawed; they stretch the discovery rule beyond its breaking point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 408-409, 710 A.2d at 310. As to the equitable claims, that court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">\u201c[W]e agree with the trial court that appellants\u2019 equitable claim should have been brought within three years of appellants being placed on inquiry notice of the facts and circumstances underlying the claim. Therefore, we hold that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>trial court was correct in concluding that laches barred appellants\u2019 equitable claim for rescission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">One judge dissented on the basis that a reasonable juror could find that the respondents \u201ccreated a smoke screen to obscure their own potential liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 423, 710 A.2d at 317 (Kenney, J. dissenting). He concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">\u201cThis does not appear to be a situation in which appellants truly slumbered, but if they have, an inference could be drawn that they were purposely lulled to sleep, if not sedated, by extended and diversionary litigation encouraged by [the respondents].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 425, 710 A.2d at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">The petitioners\u2019 motion for reconsideration was denied. Thereafter, the petitioners timely filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which we granted to consider the important issues this case presents.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">In this Court, the petitioners contend that the intermediate appellate court erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s grant of summary'judgment on limitations and laches grounds. They argue that there are genuine issues of material fact which the trier of fact must resolve, <em>ie., </em>as to when they knew or should have known that their losses were caused by the respondents\u2019 legal malpractice or fraud. They contend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-11\">\u201cAt all times during this attorney-client relationship, [the petitioner] and her siblings placed complete trust and confidence in Brown &amp; Sturm, and relied wholeheartedly upon Brown &amp; Sturm\u2019s advice. Until Judge Messitte issued his opinion in the legal malpractice case against Wolf and Piper &amp; Marbury, [the petitioner and her siblings] never realized, nor understood, the malpractice and deception perpetrated by [the respondents] throughout the course of their representation of [the petitioners], believing instead that Wolf and Piper <em>&amp; </em>Marbury had committed the malpractice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Alternatively, the petitioners urge this Court to adopt the \u201ccontinuous representation rule.\u201d This is a rule, they argue, that many states have adopted to toll the statute of limitations in legal malpractice actions until the legal representation is complete, even when the client may be aware of the attorney\u2019s negligence. Citing <em>Hecht v. Resolution Trust Corp., </em>333 Md. 324, 337-338, 635 A.2d 394, 401 (1994), they argue that the continuous representation rule is a natural corollary to the \u201ccontinuous course of treatment rule\u201d as applied in medical malpractice cases. Further, relying on <em>Desser v. Woods, </em>266 Md. 696, 708-709, 296 A.2d 586, 593 (1972) and <em>Herring v. Offutt, </em>266 Md. 593, 600-601, 295 A.2d 876, 880-81 (1972), the petitioners submit that the continuous representation rule \u201cembodies the principle that one dealing with a fiduciary has no \u2018duty to make inquiry that the confidential relationship has been abused during the continuation of that relationship,\u2019 \u201d a standard that should be applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The petitioners assert that, in any event, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the respondents on the grounds that the contract claims were barred by limitations and the equitable relief was precluded by the doctrine of laches. In urging this Court to reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, they argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">\u201c[tjhere is no justice in allowing Brown &amp; Sturm to: provide negligent advice to their clients; cause millions of dollars in damages; deliberately create diversionary litigation to prevent the discovery of their own wrongdoing; seek shelter from redress by asserting a statute of limitations defense, and at the same time, be able to sue the very clients they so egregiously harmed for approximately $8 million in attorney fees and interest (after having paid approximately $1.6 million), because they made the retainer agreement a specialty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The respondents see it much differently. They argue that the trial court and the intermediate appellate court reached the correct result. As they see it, an action is deemed to accrue on the date when the plaintiff knows, or with the exercise of reasonable diligence, reasonably should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>known of the wrong. Maintaining that they are innocent of malpractice and fraud, they contend that in 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988, there were \u201cseveral discrete events\u201d that were sufficient to put the petitioners on \u201cinquiry notice\u201d of a potential cause of action. Moreover, they argue that the circuit court\u2019s summary judgment order on the grounds that the petitioners\u2019 law claims were barred by the statute of limitations and the equity claims by laches is especially appropriate where \u201cthree important witnesses are dead: Lawson King, Cordelia King and G. van Velsor Wolf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The respondents also argue that, even if this Court were to apply the \u201ccontinuous representation rule\u201d in this case, the petitioners\u2019 cause of action would still fail because, as they see it, the petitioners have ignored the parameters of the \u201ccontinuous course of treatment\u201d rule. The respondents argue that, when a patient or client learns or should have learned of the harm resulting from the alleged malpractice during the course of the physician/patient or attorney/client relationship, the statute of limitations runs from the time that knowledge, actual or constructive, is acquired, and is not tolled until the relationship ends. Moreover, they contend that, because the petitioner hired a new attorney, namely Hochberg, to represent them in the legal malpractice claim against Wolf and Piper &amp; Marbury, the representation was not \u201ccontinuous\u201d and, therefore, the rule simply does not apply.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">We agree with the petitioners. Without presupposing that the respondents have engaged in malpractice or any other wrongdoing, our review of the record in this case reveals sufficient facts to generate a genuine dispute of material fact and, thus, a jury issue, on the key elements of whether, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>when, the petitioners were on notice of a cause of action against the respondents and whether, once on notice, the petitioners acted diligently to protect their rights. Therefore, we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Summary judgment practice in this state is governed by Maryland Rule 2-501. It states, in relevant part, \u201c[t]he court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Rule 2-501(e). Summary judgment is not a substitute for trial. <em>Goodwich v. Sinai Hosp. of Baltimore, Inc., </em>343 Md. 185, 205, 680 A.2d 1067, 1077 (1996). The function of the trial court at the summary judgment stage is to determine whether there is a dispute as to a material fact sufficient to require an issue to be tried. <em>Gross v. Sussex, Inc., </em>332 Md. 247, 255, 630 A.2d 1156, 1160 (1993); <em>Foy v. Prudential Insurance Company of America et al., </em>316 Md. 418, 422, 559 A.2d 371, 373 (1989); <em>Coffey v. Derby Steel Company, </em>291 Md. 241, 247, 434 A.2d 564, 568 (1981). Thus, an appellate court\u2019s review of the grant of summary judgment involves the determination whether a dispute of material fact exists, <em>Gross, </em>332 Md. at 255, 630 A.2d at 1160; <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Products, </em>330 Md. 726, 737, 625 A.2d 1005, 1011 (1993), and \u201cwhether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Heat &amp; Power Corporation v.

Such statutes are designed to balance the competing interests of each of the potential parties as well as the societal interests involved. Thus, one of the purposes of such statutes is to assure fairness to a potential defendant by providing a certain degree of repose. This is accomplished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>by encouraging promptness in prosecuting actions; suppressing stale or fraudulent claims; avoiding inconvenience that may stem from delay, such as loss of evidence, fading of memories, and disappearance of witnesses; and providing the ability to plan for the future without the uncertainty inherent in potential liability. Another basic purpose is to prevent unfairness to potential plaintiffs exercising reasonable diligence in pursuing a claim.

As this Court explained in <em>Pierce, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">\u201cStatutes of limitation find their justification in necessity and convenience rather than in logic.

(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Recognizing the unfairness inherent in charging a plaintiff with slumbering on his rights where it was not reasonably possible to have obtained notice of the nature and cause of an injury, this Court has adopted the discovery rule to determine the date of accrual. <em>Hahn v. Claybrook, </em>130 Md. 179, 186-187, 100 A. 83, 85-86 (1917). The discovery rule tolls the accrual of the limitations period until the time the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>discovers, or through the exercise of due diligence, should have discovered, the injury. Thus, before an action is said to have accrued, a plaintiff must have notice of the nature and cause of his or her injury. <em>See, Pennwalt, supra, </em>314 Md. at 453, 550 A.2d at 1165-1166 (holding that hmitations do not begin to run until a plaintiff knows or reasonably should know the nature and cause of his or her harm.). <em>See also, United Parcel, supra, </em>336 Md. at 579, 650 A.2d at 231 (holding that \u201ca cause of action \u2018accrues\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 5-101 when \u2018the plaintiff knows or should know of the injury, its probable cause, and ...

Kovens, </em>305 Md. 280, 503 A.2d 1313 (1986), made clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8\">\u201cwhether or not the plaintiffs failure to discover his cause of action was due to failure on his part to use due diligence, or to the fact that defendant so concealed the wrong that plaintiff was unable to discover it by the exercise of due diligence, is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 294-295, 503 A.2d at 1320. (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Today, the discovery rule ordinarily applies to all actions where limitations are governed by the three year statute of limitations, <em>see, Poffenberger, supra, </em>290 Md. at 635, 431 A.2d at 679, and has long applied in all manners of malpractice litigation. <em>See, e.g., Callahan v.

For example, in <em>W., B. &amp; A. Elec. R.R. Co. v. Moss, </em>130 Md. 198, 100 A. 86 (1917), a case involving compensation for services for an extended time, we said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">\u201cin cases where there is an undertaking which requires a <em>continuation of services, </em>or the party\u2019s right depends upon the happening of an event in the future, the statute begins to run only from the time the services can be completed or from the time the event happens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 204-205, 100 A. at 89. (emphasis added). Similarly, in <em>Vincent v. Palmer, </em>179 Md. 365, 19 A.2d 183 (1941), where an employee sued his employer on an agreement to share profits, we said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">\u201c[w]here a contract does not mention the period of employment, and the claim of the employee is based upon <em>\u2018continuous employment,\u2019 </em>indicating one entire contract, even though the work may be interrupted from time to time, the statute will not run until the completion of the contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM\"><em>Id. </em>at 374, 19 A.2d at 189. (citation omitted) (emphasis added). Moreover, in <em>Waldman v. Rohrbaugh, </em>241 Md. 137, 215 A.2d 825 (1966), a case involving a continuous course of treatment by a physician we noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">\u201cif the facts show <em>continuing medical or surgical treatment </em>for a particular illness or condition in the course of which there is malpractice producing or aggravating harm, the cause of action of the patient accrues at the end of the treatment for that particular illness, injury or condition, unless the patient sooner knew or reasonably should have known of the injury or harm.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 142, 215 A.2d at 828 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The reasoning underlying each of these cases is that a relationship which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>built on trust and confidence generally gives the confiding party the right to relax his or her guard and rely on the good faith of the other party so long as the relationship continues to exist. The confiding party, in other words, is under no duty to make inquiries about the quality or bona fides of the services received, unless and until something occurs to make him or her suspicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Fraud perpetrated by an adverse party may also serve to postpone the accrual date of a cause of action. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5-203 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">\u201cIf the knowledge of a cause of action is kept from a party by the fraud of an adverse party, the cause of action shall be deemed to accrue at the time when the party discovered, or by the exercise of ordinary diligence should have discovered the fraud.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">This section is remedial in nature. <em>See, Geisz v. Greater Baltimore Medical Center, </em>313 Md. 301, 323-324, 545 A.2d 658, 669 (1988). It was passed by the General Assembly for the purpose of enabling the plaintiff in an action at law to set up the fraud of the defendant in order to avoid a plea of limitations. <em>Piper v. Jenkins, </em>207 Md. 308, 315, 113 A.2d 919, 922 (1955); <em>Herring v. Offutt, </em>266 Md. 593, 599, 295 A.2d 876, 880 (1972). Section 5-203 does not require that the defendant commit a fraud distinct from that initially committed for the purpose of keeping the plaintiff in ignorance of his or her cause of action. Instead, by its own terms, \u00a7 5-203 is made to apply in those cases where two conditions are met: (1) the plaintiff has been kept in ignorance of the cause of action by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>the fraud of the adverse party, and (2) the plaintiff has exercised usual or ordinary diligence for the discovery and protection of his or her rights. <em>See, Piper v. Jenkins, </em>207 Md. at 318, 113 A.2d at 924 (1955); <em>Mettee v. Boone, </em>251 Md. 332, 338-339, 247 A.2d 390, 394 (1968). As to the latter, this Court, in <em>O\u2019Hara, supra, </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">\u201cNotice is not limited to actual knowledge of the fraud. Nor does it mean discovery of proof which, if believed, would, in the opinion of counsel, take the case to the jury on the merits. It is not limited to admissible evidence.... \u201c[B]eing \u2018on notice\u2019 means having knowledge of circumstances which would cause a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiffs to undertake an investigation which, if pursued with reasonable diligence, would have led to knowledge of the alleged fraud.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">305 Md. at 301-302, 503 A.2d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Consistent with the continuation of events theory and the General Assembly\u2019s intention that the statute of limitations for fraud be tolled, this Court in <em>Herring, supra, </em>held that, where a confidential relationship exists between the parties, failure to discover the facts constituting fraud may toll the statute of limitations, if: (1) the relationship continues unrepudiated, (2) there is nothing to put the injured party on inquiry, and (3) the injured party cannot be said to have failed to use due diligence in detecting the fraud. 266 Md. at 600-601, 295 A.2d at 880-881. Of particular relevance to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the <em>Herring </em>Court pointed out that a confidential relationship, by its nature, gives the confiding party the right to relax his or her vigilance to a certain extent and rely on both the good faith of the other party and that party\u2019s duty to disclose all material facts and, as a result, the confiding party has no duty to make inquiries until something occurs to make him or her suspicious. <em>Id. </em>The result is different, however, if the confiding party acquires actual knowledge during the existence of the confidential relationship that the confidential relationship has been abused, or comes into possession of facts which put him or her upon inquiry notice, which, if pursued, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>would have disclosed the abuse. In that event, the applicable statute of limitations runs from the time the confiding party receives actual knowledge or the facts which placed him or her upon inquiry notice. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Herring, </em>this Court made clear that, whether the plaintiffs failure to discover the cause of action was due to a failure to exercise due diligence or to the defendant\u2019s concealment of his or her wrongdoing, ordinarily is a question for the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 599, 295 A.2d at 880; <em>See also, New England Mut.

A client is entitled to believe a lawyer who says \u201cI am your lawyer, why not trust me, I am a lawyer, I would not do anything that is wrong.\u201d <em>See, Kornbau v. Evans, </em>66 Cal.App.2d 677, 152 P.2d 651, 653 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>(1944) (holding that statute of limitations did not begin to accrue where client relied on assurances from her attorney); <em>See also, Wille v.

I protect you in every way\u201d). This Court has noted that a client\u2019s right to rely upon his or her attorney\u2019s advice is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-8\">\u201cfounded upon public policy, because the <em>confidential and fiduciary relationship enables an attorney to exercise a very strong influence over his client </em>and often affords him opportunities to obtain undue advantage by availing himself of the client\u2019s necessities, credulity and liberality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><em>Hughes v.

There we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">\u201c[A] lawyer\u2019s duty is a high one which, because of the nature of the relationship that exists between an attorney and his client, embraces moral standards that are more stringent than those applicable to others. This duty, which is first assumed with the taking of the oath on admission to the bar, is not shed as long as one remains a member of the profession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">\u201cThe relationship existing between an attorney and his client is one that of necessity requires mutual trust and confidence. It is of prime importance not only to the parties themselves, but also to lawyers as a group as well as to society in general, that there be no lessening of the degree of confidence that the public has in the fidelity, honesty and integrity of members of the profession. It has been immemorially acknowledged that at the very heart of the attorney-client relationship is the trust concept with the attorney acting as a trustee for his client in all of his undertakings for him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 518-519, 307 A.2d at 682. Thus, it is clear that the attorney-client relationship requires the attorney to act with the utmost good faith and loyalty, which includes making known to the client all information that is significant and material to the matter that is the subject of the relationship. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct on the subject,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and, indeed, supplementary thereto, the requirement of good faith and loyalty is deeply rooted in common law and equity principles, <em>see, </em>2 Ronald E. Mallen &amp; Jeffery M. Smith <em>Legal Malpractice, </em>\u00a7 14.1 (4th ed.1996); <em>see also Sargent v. Buckley, </em>697 A.2d 1272, 1275 (Me.1997); <em>Santa Clara County Counsel Attys. </em>Assoc. <em>v. Woodside, </em>7 Cal.4th 525, 28 Cal.Rptr.2d 617, 869 P.2d 1142, 1154 (1994), and, therefore, must be upheld as a principle that is rightfully relied upon by the public and integral to the proper function of our judicial system. It follows that a client has the right to rely on his or her lawyers\u2019 loyalty and to believe the accuracy and candor of the advice they give.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Having concluded that a continuous, confidential relationship existed between the parties in this case, the paramount issue to be decided is whether the petitioners had such knowledge prior to the dismissal of their suit against Wolf and Piper <em>&amp; </em>Marbury as would cause reasonable people in their position to undertake an additional, or more thorough investigation, which, if pursued with reasonable diligence, would have led to discovery of the respondents\u2019 wrongdoing and, thus, to an earlier action against the respondents for their alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>malpractice and related wrongdoing. Under the circumstances of this case, we believe that this is a question of fact and, therefore, summary judgment should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The respondents dominated the property transaction, the tax litigation, and the malpractice litigation against Wolf and Piper <em>&amp; </em>Marbury, constantly giving assurances that the property transaction, which is the genesis of this action, was legitimate and would be upheld by the IRS. Later, when the petitioners were required, on the respondents\u2019 advice, to settle the tax action for an amount quite a bit more than they had originally been advised that they would have to pay, the respondents maintained that it was Wolf and Piper &amp; Mar-bury, rather than themselves, who were responsible. To determine whether the petitioners can be said to have been put on notice, the finder-of-fact must be permitted to evaluate the many stages of the events from 1981 to 1994 which led the petitioners to believe that they were harmed by the respondents. We believe, on the record in this case, a finder-of-fact could conclude that it was reasonable for the petitioners, untrained in the law and relying on the fiduciary relationship with their attorneys, to have failed to discover their cause of action against the respondents. This is particularly the case considering that their attorneys\u2019 past assurances regarding the legitimacy of the property transfer transaction proved to be accurate, the dispute with Montgomery County tax officials was resolved when the deed, to the property was filed -without the payment of additional taxes,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and, the central issue in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>tax litigation being the valuation of the farm land, that the petitioners knew that Brown was experienced in land valuation cases. Additionally, the finder-of-fact could have concluded that the petitioners were not put on notice of a cause of action against the respondents based upon the conduct of the petitioners\u2019 tax lawyer, Burton, and the respondents, during and immediately following the tax litigation, having never notified the petitioners that they may have had a cause of action against Brown individually or Brown &amp; Sturm. Moreover, the finder-of-fact must be able to consider the respondents\u2019 conduct at the time of the settlement with the IRS, having recognized that the petitioners were injured, yet persuading the petitioners that the sole source of their injury was a third party and recommending counsel to assist the petitioners in the pursuit of that party. Further, the finder-of-fact must be able to consider the silence of Hochberg as to existence or nonexistence of a cause of action against the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">To be sure, the petitioners sought legal advice from four attorneys \u2014 Brown, Sturm, Burton and Hochberg \u2014 none of whom identified the respondents as potential malpractice defendants. All of the attorneys knew, or should have known, the facts and circumstances surrounding the initial tax advice and settlement, and all knew, or should have known, of the existence and content of Wolfs letter. Yet all of the attorneys directed their attention toward Wolf and Piper &amp; Marbury as the direct and proximate cause of the petitioners\u2019 alleged harm. Quite clearly, reasonable minds could conclude that, to require the petitioners in this circumstance, while the respondents continued to represent them, not only to be suspicious of their lawyers, but to ferret out, by seeking yet more legal advice than that being obtained from Brown, Sturm, Burton and Hochberg, every possibility that their lawyers may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>provided negligent advice, or that they were being defrauded, would amount to the exercise of extraordinary diligence, rather than that usually required, usual or ordinary diligence. See, e.g., <em>Herring, </em>266 Md. at 600, 295 A.2d at 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">A majority of the Court of Special Appeals in deciding, as a matter of law, that the petitioners were on inquiry notice before the dismissal of the malpractice claim against Wolf and Piper &amp; Marbury, reasoned that the petitioners</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As7\">\u201ccannot reasonably overlook or ignore that, almost from day one, they were alerted by a highly regarded estates and trusts attorney and a reputable law firm that the validity of appellees\u2019 tax planning was questionable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\"># * jJ:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">\u201cIf Wolfs analysis were incorrect and the transaction was legitimate, as appellees advised, then a reasonable person should have wondered why appellees would fear the compromise of the defense based on a letter that was legally incorrect. Stated otherwise, if Wolfs view' was wrong, as appellees had maintained, Wolfs letter should not have made a difference in defending what was cast by appellees as a legitimate transaction. Conversely, because Wolfs letter was of concern, that, too, should have alerted appellants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">\u201cThe size of the settlement is also a factor of some significance here. We recognize that, for any number of reasons, many cases are settled by payment from a party who is not necessarily culpable, or who does not believe he or she is actually liable. A $20 million settlement, however, is not of the kind or amount that is ordinarily paid without some genuine concern as to liability or wrongdoing. A settlement of that magnitude surely should have signaled to appellants that something may have been wrong with the underlying advice from appellees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>121 Md.App. at 403-404, 710 A.2d at 307. The intermediate appellate court also concluded that the petitioners created \u201ca smoke screen\u201d to ignore notice. <em>Id. </em>at 407, 710 A.2d at 309. Moreover, it believed that the petitioners should be charged with notice of the information in the letter from Beall, received by Hochberg and Brown, pointing out that the advice rendered by the respondents to the petitioners was flawed. <em>Id. </em>at 408, 710 A.2d at 309-310. We disagree with the reasoning and the conclusions of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">To reach the conclusion it did, the Court of Special Appeals made credibility determinations, which it then used in making, and to justify, its summary judgment analysis. In order for them to have been on notice for purposes of the discovery rule, the petitioners must have known, or at least have reason to believe the correctness of the advice Wolf and Piper &amp; Marbury gave their parents and, conversely, to disbelieve, or at least suspect the accuracy, of that given by Brown. Under the court\u2019s analysis, the petitioners are required to have credited the Wolf and Piper &amp; Marbury advice and rejected the advice from Brown. That must follow from the intermediate court\u2019s premise, that the former was necessarily correct and the latter was necessarily wrong. But, certainly, a flnder-of-fact could conclude that, under the circumstances, it was reasonable for the petitioners to trust their attorneys, that the petitioners, in good faith, could believe their advice to be accurate, and, thus, reasonably reject that offered by Wolf. As we have seen, it is not the role of the trial court at the summary judgment stage to try the case, to resolve the ultimate issue of determining which of the parties is the wrongdoer. Rather, it is trial court\u2019s responsibility simply to determine whether there is a genuine dispute as to the material facts of whether the petitioners were on notice of the respondents\u2019 alleged wrongdoing and, if not, whether they acted -with reasonable diligence to discover it, thereby appropriately pursuing their cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">It is significant in this case that the IRS investigation of the transaction did not come as a surprise to the petitioners; they were advised by Brown that the IRS probably would invest\u00ed-</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>gate but that, if investigated, the transaction would not result in the payment of additional taxes. Moreover, the five subsequent appraisals of the property at fair market value, including the appraisal conducted by Montgomery County, were notably less than that estimated by Wolfs \u201cknowledgeable, experienced and responsible\u201d source. In addition, the settlement with the IRS, which included penalties, also was appreciably less than Wolfs minimum estimated tax liability of over $27 million. Finally, the reason the respondents gave for recommending that the petitioners settle with the IRS, the negligence of Wolf and Piper &amp; Marbury, was reinforced by Burton and Hochberg. Viewing these facts in the light most favorable to the petitioners, a trier of fact reasonably could conclude that the petitioners\u2019 reliance upon their lawyers was reasonable, that the attorneys provided a basis for crediting their conclusion that any blame for the $20 million in damages the petitioners suffered was solely attributable to the release of Wolfs letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Furthermore, it is also significant to the issue of fraud that the respondents consistently assigned blame to Wolf and Piper <em>&amp; </em>Marbury and that they never shared with the petitioners the letter from Beall, which charged that the respondents provided negligent advice to the petitioners. Thus, a trier of fact could conclude, as to that issue, that the respondents were instrumental in deflecting responsibility away from themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">This Court should not, and will not, charge a complaining party with failure to search for a missing element of a cause of action if a diligent search would not have revealed it or there was no reason for that party to conduct the search. As we have seen, the existence of a continuous, fiduciary relationship permits a complaining party to trust, albeit not blindly, that such a relationship will not be violated and that the he or she receives will not be provided negligently. Under the facts of this case, there is no basis, except crediting one side over the other, thus, making a credibility determination, for disallowing the trust and confidence that the petitioners placed in their attorneys or attributing notice to them as a matter of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>simply because other attorneys, on the other side of the issue and acting in their self interest, expressed, even if strongly so, a contrary opinion as to the state of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Finally, the intermediate appellate court improperly inverts the attorney-client relationship by charging the petitioners with greater knowledge of the law than their attorneys:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">\u201cA diligent investigation surely would have revealed that [the petitioners] could have asserted attorney-client privilege in the tax case to block the IRS from using Wolfs letter in the tax litigation, but apparently [the petitioners] failed to recognize that legal point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">121 Md.App. at 412, 710 A.2d at 311. This is utterly inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">First, the petitioners were represented by counsel, on whom they could, and should, rely to apprise them of their rights and to develop trial strategy. At the very least, however, reasonable minds could differ as to whether the petitioners, under the circumstances extant, should have discovered that they could have asserted the attorney/client privilege and thereby prevented the use by the IRS of the Wolf letter. Here, the petitioners alleged that they were kept in ignorance of their cause of action by the actions of the respondents, that they discovered the negligence and/or fraud when reading the opinion in <em>King v. Davis, supra, </em>that they did not discover it sooner because of the silence, and affirmative acts on the part of the respondents, and that they relied upon the fiduciary attorney-client relationship between themselves and the respondents and were not advised by Burton or Hochberg that they might have a cause of action against the respondents. A trier of fact could find from these facts, if established, that this is a sufficient basis to satisfy the requirements outlined in <em>Mettee v. Boone, supra, </em>251 Md. at 338-339, 247 A.2d at 394 and <em>Piper v. Jenkins, supra, </em>207 Md. at 319, 113 A.2d at 924. Further, a finder-of-fact could have concluded that Brown\u2019s failure to assert the attorney/client privilege to prevent use of the Wolf letter, while persisting in blaming any resulting damages on the release of the letter, was itself evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>respondents\u2019 continuing concealment \u2014 whether negligently or fraudulently \u2014 of their initial negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The respondents rely on <em>Feldman v. Granger, 255 </em>Md. 288, 257 A.2d 421 (1969), <em>Leonhart v. Atkinson, </em>265 Md. 219, 289 A.2d 1 (1972), and <em>Watson v. Dorsey, </em>265 Md. 509, 290 A.2d 530 (1972), all involving allegations of professional malpractice, as support for their position. Because neither negligent nor fraudulent concealment was at issue in those cases, the respondents\u2019 reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\"><em>Feldman </em>was a professional malpractice action against an accountant for damages due to an assessment of penalties and interest by the IRS. 255 Md. at 289, 257 A.2d at 422. The issue that this Court addressed was whether the statute of limitations for such an action began to run. There, almost eight years after the alleged negligent act, Feldman, the owner of a furniture company, sued his former accountant for damages he alleged were caused by the accountant\u2019s failure to timely file forms -with the IRS as to his election of sub-chapter S treatment for his small business. To qualify for that treatment, the necessary form had to be filed within 30 days prior to or after the beginning of the corporation\u2019s fiscal year. It was not disputed that the form was mailed between 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. on the 30th day after the beginning of the corporation\u2019s fiscal year, but was postmarked the 31st day.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although notified by the IRS shortly after the filing of the untimeliness and thus the denial of the election, Feldman proceeded to file returns as if the election had been approved, claiming that he had been assured by the accountant that there was nothing to worry about. Subsequently, Feldman received a deficiency notice from the IRS, which he contested, pursuing the matter to decision in federal tax court. Only after that court held for the IRS did Feldman bring a tort action against his accountant.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>The failure to file the forms in a timely manner, Feldman contended, caused damages in excess of $25,000 in back taxes, penalties, and interest. <em>Id. </em>at 290, 257 A.2d at 422. Contending that the statute of limitations began to run on the date the company\u2019s owner received the tax deficiency, rather than, as contended by Feldman, on the date that the tax court sustained the deficiency assessment made by the IRS, the accountant argued that the suit was time barred. The trial court rejected Feldman\u2019s theory. <em>Id. </em>at 290, 257 A.2d at 422-423. This Court affirmed, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-4\">\u201c[FJocusing attention on the date of July 22, 1964, when the appellant received the notice of the tax deficiency in the amount of $25,428.06 from the Appellate Division of the Internal Revenue Service, we are of the opinion that any reasonable and prudent man, being in the place of the appellants, would have known or certainly should have known at that time, that he had sustained legal harm as of that date, if not before. The appellants had by this time discharged the appellees as their accountants and they had known for over three and a half years that the Internal Revenue Service disagreed with their position. Certainly, when they received notice of the tax deficiency assessment on July 22, 1964, if they had not before, it became necessary for them to incur the expense of retaining legal counsel. We think, at the very least, from the date of this assessment of the tax deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service the statute of limitations began to run adversely to their action against their accounts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 296, 257 A.2d at 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\"><em>Feldman </em>was, as is true of all cases, decided on the facts and circumstances presented in that case; it was not intended to set forth an ironclad rule for summary judgment in limitation of action cases. Notably, there are significant factual differences between this case and <em>Feldman. </em>While in <em>Feld-man, </em>there was no dispute as to what the accountant had done, the effect of that action being the only matter in contention, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>it has always been hotly contested whether it was the respondents or Wolf and Piper &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Marbury who negligently advised the Kings. Moreover, unlike this case, the accountant in <em>Feldman, </em>aside from, at most telling Feldman, on one occasion, that he had nothing to worry about, was not actively involved in diverting Feldman\u2019s attention or hiding the problem. In fact, the Court in <em>Feldman </em>did not have to address whether the accountant acted negligently or fraudulently to conceal a cause of action because, as it noted, the accountant had been discharged after the act which caused the alleged damage. <em>Id. </em>at 296, 257 A.2d at 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">In <em>Leonhart, </em>Leonhart &amp; Company, a reinsurance firm, was advised by its accountant to change its accounting method. Although the company accepted that advice, the accountant did not adhere to the regulations of the Internal Revenue Service which required obtaining prior consent before such a change could be made. Subsequently, the company received notice from the IRS first that the change in accounting method was not approved and later of a substantial tax deficiency assessment. The company challenged the tax deficiency assessment to judgment in the United States Tax Court. That challenge being unsuccessful, it appealed to the United States Court of Appeals, again unsuccessfully. Unlike in <em>Feldman, </em>during the entire time that this issue was being litigated, the accountant continued as the company\u2019s accountant and repeatedly gave assurances that the IRS\u2019s position was incorrect and continued to represent the company on accounting matters. 265 Md. at 222, 289 A.2d at 3. Moreover, the accountant defended its professional advice to the company, advised the company to fight the case in tax court and even recommended legal counsel. When its challenge to the IRS assessment failed, the owners of the company, the Leon-harts, turned to the accountant for relief and filed a professional malpractice action against their accountant for failing to obtain the required permission from the IRS before changing accounting methods. By this time, however, the three-year statute of limitation had run and the trial court granted the accountant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Different from the present case, the Leonharts did not allege that their accountant acted negligently or fraudulently to prevent discovery of a cause of action. There, just the opposite occurred, they \u201cconceded that there was no fraud or concealment in the accountant\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, this Court in <em>Leonhart </em>was clear in noting that the issue of fraudulent concealment was not properly before the Court. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-4\">\u201c[Appellants conceded that Atkinson practiced no fraud or concealment, so the beginning date of limitations is not postponed by \u00a7 14.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>] Even without this concession appellants cannot succeed under that section since their replication does not affirmatively allege the following: (i) that they were kept in ignorance by the fraud of an adverse party that they had a cause of action; (ii) how, if fraud existed, they discovered it; (iii) why they did not discover it sooner; and (iv) what diligence they exercised to discover it. <em>Mettee v. Boone, </em>251 Md. 332, 339, 247 A.2d 390 (1968); <em>Piper v. Jenkins, </em>207 Md. 308, 319, 113 A.2d 919 (1955).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">265 Md. at 227, 289 A.2d at 6. Instead, the Leonharts relied almost exclusively on the doctrines of waiver and estoppel. Rejecting that reliance, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">\u201cThe appellants seemingly are attempting to raise a \u00a7 14 defense to a plea of limitations under the guise of equitable estoppel and waiver, by claiming reliance on [the accountant\u2019s repeated assurances that his advice was correct. In their brief the Leonharts argue that [the accountant] ought to be prohibited from using the statute as a bar since his conduct \u2018obscure(d) [their] perception of the wrong or prevented) discovery\u2019 of it. Here, [the Leonharts] have not alleged anything tantamount to constructive fraud, nor have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>they demonstrated that [the accountant] has been guilty of \u2018any unconscionable, inequitable or fraudulent act of commission or omission upon which (another) relied and has been misled to his injury.\u2019 <em>Jordan v. Morgan, Adm\u2019x, 252 </em>Md. 122, 132, 249 A.2d 124, 129 (1969). We do not think [the Leonharts] have alleged facts from which waiver or estoppel could be found. All they have shown is that after [the accountant] erroneously advised them, he continually maintained his position and recommended that the matter be pursued in the tax court. It was not alleged that the accountant at any time asked the Leonharts to forbear bringing suit against him. It was also not alleged that [the accountant] indicated he would waive the defense of limitations should the [the Leonharts] later make a claim, or that he induced them not to file suit by giving assurances that he would settle any claim they might make.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 227-228, 289 A.2d at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">As in <em>Feldman, </em>in <em>Leonhart, </em>there was no conflict of advice between parties whose function it was to give advice. Nor was there an issue concerning the act or omission constituting the professional malpractice, and it was not alleged that the accountant did some act that had the effect of preventing discovery of the accountant\u2019s malpractice. Instead, it was alleged only that the accountant\u2019s initial advice was wrong and that the mere continuing professional relationship should toll the statute of limitations, a position that the Court rejected. <em>Id. </em>at 222, 289 A.2d at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The factual posture of this case is significantly different. At issue here is the correctness of advice given by attorneys, hired for that purpose, the rationality of a client\u2019s reliance on counsel\u2019s advice in the course of litigation and, perhaps at stake is the viability of the attorney/client privilege. It is clear, moreover, that the present action is not confined to the initial advice given, but also extends to the failure of the respondents, whether by negligence or fraud, to advise their clients, the petitioners, adequately, including as to the parties to whom the petitioners may have been able to look for recovery of the damages that they sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>To be sure, an independent attorney, consulted for the purpose of evaluating the facts surrounding the land transfer at issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>to determine whether there was a cause of action, and, if so, against whom, should have considered and included the respondents among those against whom the petitioners may have had a claim for professional malpractice. If that attorney failed to include the respondents, whether negligently or fraudulently, or allowed the statute of limitations to run, he or she would be liable for the damages proximately caused thereby.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> That being the case, it follows, and would be illogical to conclude otherwise, that a rational jury could have concluded that the respondents, who maintained an attorney-client relationship with the petitioners from 1981 to 1994, took advantage of the confidential relationship they had with the petitioners by failing to inform them of their potential liability, thereby preventing or delaying discovery of the respondents\u2019 initial alleged negligence, despite the petitioners exercise of ordinary diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><em>Watson v. Dorsey, </em>an attorney malpractice action, likewise did not involve the issues of negligent or fraudulent concealment. There, Dorsey represented Mr. and Mrs. Watson in an ejectment case. In preparation for trial, the Watsons provided Dorsey with the names of witnesses and proffered the testimony to be offered by those witnesses. Dorsey, however, did not call the witnesses at trial. The Watsons lost their case and, on appeal, this Court affirmed. The Watsons subsequently sued Dorsey, alleging that he negligently failed to call certain witnesses at trial which resulted in their sustaining damage. Holding that the Watsons\u2019 malpractice action was barred by the statute of limitations, the trial court found that the statute of limitations began to run on the date that the Watsons lost their ejectment case, not the date that the judgment was affirmed on appeal. After evaluating the na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ture and circumstances of the complaint and weighing the facts particular to that case, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\">\u201cIt is clear to us that the nature of the Watsons\u2019 complaint against Dorsey makes it plain that they must be charged with knowledge that they had been wronged as soon as the ejectment case was decided against them. They felt that certain witnesses could testify as to certain things (which they enumerated to the lawyer) that would be favorable to their cause. Their lawyer did not call those witnesses and they lost their case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">\u201cThe connection between the failure to produce their witnesses and the loss of the case could not have failed to come into their consciousness immediately. Whether in fact there was a connection would seem to be at least open to doubt; but they must at once have thought that the failure to produce the testimony they told the lawyer was so important was a cause, and the loss of the case an effect. Yet they did not sue their lawyer until 45 months had passed, and the law required them to sue within 36 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">\u201cThe Watsons urge upon us that Dorsey continued to be their lawyer until after the ejectment case was affirmed by the Court of Appeals on June 3, 1968, that there was a relationship of trust and confidence between clients and lawyer and that it is unreasonable in this situation to say that the clients should sue the lawyer until the last available court has spoken. We agree that conceivably there may be situations of client and lawyer relationship where the client did not discover or could not reasonably have discovered during the continuation of the relationship that he had been wronged, but this case is not one of them. The basic test of the discovery rule consistently is the \u2018knew or should have known\u2019 test and the Watsons certainly should have realized the simple and obvious connection (if connection in fact there was) between the absent -witnesses and the loss of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 513, 290 A.2d at 533 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">In <em>Watson, </em>as in <em>Feldman </em>and <em>Leonhart, </em>there was no controversy concerning the act or omission constituting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>malpractice. Moreover, the Watsons knew not only the act that the attorney did not perform, but fully its significance, perhaps better than the attorney. Thus, the Watsons did not argue that they lacked sufficient information to discover their cause of action; rather, they argued that, irrespective of whether they knew or should have known, this Court should rule in their favor based upon the relationship of trust and confidence that existed between the parties, and that \u201cDorsey should be estopped to claim that their cause of action accrued before ... the Court of Appeals ruled, because he continued as their lawyer until that time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514, 290 A.2d at 533-534. As we have seen, if the confiding party acquires actual knowledge during the existence of the confidential relationship that the confidential relationship has been abused, or comes into possession of facts which put him or her upon inquiry notice, which, if pursued, would have disclosed the abuse, the statute of limitations begins to run. It is significant that the Watson\u2019s did not allege fraud or that their attorney negligently encouraged forbearance to sue by pursuing a baseless appeal or directing blame at a third party. <em>Id. </em>at 513-514, 290 A.2d at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Finally, the petitioners argue that the Court of Special Appeals erred in affirming the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the grounds that the contract claim was barred by limitations, and the equitable claim, seeking rescission of the Retainer Agreement and the Addendum, was precluded by laches. We agree with the petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Laches is an equitable doctrine, which applies when there is an unreasonable delay in the assertion of one\u2019s rights and that delay results in prejudice to the opposing party. <em>Inlet Assoc. v. Assateague House Condominium, Ass\u2019n, </em>313 Md. 413, 438-439, 545 A.2d 1296, 1309 (1988). When a case involves concurrent legal and equitable remedies, \u201cthe applicable statute of limitations for the legal remedy is equally applicable to the equitable one.\u201d <em>Schaeffer v. Anne </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number><em>Arundel County, </em>338 Md. 75, 81, 656 A.2d 751, 754 (1995) (citations omitted). Whether a delay in asserting rights constitutes laches usually depends on whether the delay was reasonable under the circumstances and, where a person is guilty of unreasonable delay, a court will not give its aid. <em>See, e.g., Coudon v. Whitaker, </em>133 Md. 482, 105 A. 734 (1919). For a delay to constitute laches, the delaying party must have had notice of a right or cause of action. Therefore, laches cannot be imputed to a party who, through no fault of his or her own, is ignorant of facts giving rise to a cause of action and has, as a consequence, failed to assert it. <em>See, Berman v. Leckner, </em>193 Md. 177, 185, 66 A.2d 392, 395 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>having concluded that an issue of fact exists as to whether the petitioner had notice of a malpractice cause of action or fraud on the part of the respondent, we hold that the trial court inappropriately applied the doctrine of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

On July 21, 1987, the King children retained Brown &amp; Sturm to represent them before the IRS. At that time, however, no oral or written agreement was made regarding Brown &amp; Sturm\u2019s fee for the representation. Without clarifying the fee arrangement with the King children, Brown &amp; Sturm provided legal services that included, consulting extensively with tax counsel regarding many aspects of the litigation, preparing pleadings for filing in the U.S. Tax Court, and reviewing IRS pleadings in the litigation. Subsequently, Brown proposed that the King children pay his law firm an eight percent (8%) interest in revenues generated by the King Farm in perpetuity for his representation of them in federal tax court. In a letter dated September 11, 1987, the King Children rejected this proposal. Instead, the King children asked Brown to bill them on an hourly basis. Brown refused, insisting on a reverse contingency fee agreement to which, in January of 1988, the King children ultimately agreed. Under the terms of the reverse contingency agreement, the King children agreed to pay Brown and his law firm ten percent (10%) of the difference between the deficiency assessment and penalties and the amount of taxes that were ultimately paid, if any. In addition, the King children agreed to pay Brown and his law firm five percent (5%) of any reduction in penalties assessed for alleged fraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b116-5\">. The settlement resulted in a compromised gift tax liability of approximately $10 million and $10 million allocated to interest. This amount was much less than the tax' amount predicted by Wolf in his June 30, 1982 letter, \"mimmum\u201d($27,312,000) and \"realistic\u201d ($33,943,000), and obviously much more than that predicted by Brown.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b116-6\">. At that time, however, the King children were unable to pay Brown's legal fee. Thus, on March 2, 1989, the parties executed an addendum to the retainer agreement, by which the King children agreed to pay ten percent (10%) per annum interest to defer the fee. Over the next several years, the King children paid Brown &amp; Sturm approximately $1.6 million, all of which was credited to interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">While this appeal was pending, the respondents brought suit against the petitioners in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to collect the $4.8 million in legal fees plus all interest due under the agreement. On February 17, 2000, finding: (1) that a confidential relationship existed between the respondents and the petitioners at the time that the Retainer Agreement was executed; (2) that the respondents attempted to take \"unfair advantage of the [petitioners] by overreaching;\u201d (3) that the respondents were \u201ccoercive in nature and deprived the [petitioners] of the ability to choose a fee agreement that was in their best interest;\u201d^) that the respondents \"acted contrary to the Rules of Professional Conduct and the standard of professional practice by failing to determine the reasonable exposure of the [petitioners] to tax liability and failing to use that amount as the benchmark figure in the Retainer Agreement;\u201d and (5) that respondents failed to sustain their burden of demonstrating that the fee arrangement was voluntary and fair, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County entered judgment in favor of the defendants. <em>Brown &amp; Sturm, et al. </em>v. <em>Frederick Road General Partnership, et al., </em>Civil No. 158302, Memorandum Opinion and Order, (Mont.County, Feb.17, 2000). That judgment is currently on appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b118-7\">. The petitioners in the case <em>sub judice </em>did not participate in that appeal. It was brought by William I.

Lawson King and Cordelia E. King.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b118-8\">. Bonsall and his accounting firm were also named as defendants in this action.

The respondents also argue that the petitioners did not preserve for appellate review the issue relating to the applicability of the \"specialty\u201d statute of limitations, and that the intermediate appellate court was correct when it held that, even if the issue were preserved, the petitioners\u2019 argument lacked merit. Having concluded that a material issue of fact exists as to whether the petitioners were on notice of a cause of action, we need not and, therefore, shall not address whether the statute of limitations for a specialty is applicable in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b124-6\">.

Sweeping aside as though irrelevant or unimportant all of the stark facts to the contrary, the Court concludes that \u201con the record in this case, a finder-of-fact could conclude that it was reasonable for the petitioners, untrained in the law and relying on the fiduciary relationship with their attorneys, to have failed to discover their cause of action against the respondents.\u201d On the record in his case, it seems to me, it was about as reasonable for petitioners, after December, 1988, to continue to rely on Brown\u2019s advice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>assurances as it would have been for a passenger on the <em>Titanic, </em>observing the ship plunging into the sea, to remain convinced that all was well.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Under the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d a cause of action accrues \u201cwhen the wrong is discovered or when with due diligence it should have been discovered. <em>Poffenberger v. Risser, </em>290 Md. 631, 634-35, 431 A.2d 677, 679 (1981). That rule, we further held, \u201ccontemplates actual knowledge \u2014 that is express cognition, or awareness implied from \u2018knowledge of circumstances which ought to have put a person of ordinary prudence on inquiry [thus, charging the individual] with notice of all facts which such an investigation would in all probability have disclosed if it had been properly pursued.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id, </em>at 637, 431 A.2d at 681 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Blondell v. Turover, </em>195 Md. 251, 257, 72 A.2d 697, 699 (1950)). I agree with the Court\u2019s view that, when the parties are in a confidential relationship, the confiding party \u201cis under no duty to make inquiries about the quality or bona fides of the services received, unless and until something occurs to make him or her suspicious.\u201d My disagreement is not so much with the statement of the law as with its application in this case. It was more than \u201csomething\u201d that occurred that should have made petitioners suspicious; it was a whole senes of things, culminating in the events of December, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Petitioners were on notice from the very beginning that Brown\u2019s scheme was possibly flawed. They were aware of Mr. Wolfs deep concern, and even the accountant, Bonsai, warned them of \u201cpossible tax consequences.\u201d They had every right, <em>at that time, </em>to regard Mr. Wolfs warnings as merely a difference of professional opinion and to proceed in accordance with Mr. Brown\u2019s advice, but they at least were aware that a highly qualified attorney believed that the scheme was flawed, that it likely would be challenged by IRS, and that, if challenged successfully, they would be subject to a substantial tax and penalty. Even when, as Mr. Wolf, and Mr. Brown, predicted, IRS did challenge the scheme, petitioners probably had the right to rely on Mr. Brown\u2019s assurance that all would be well in the end. At least, a jury could find that to be so. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>When, in a complete turn-about, however, Brown advised petitioners to throw in the towel and settle for $20 million, half of which was in penalties, their continuing blind faith in him for another six-and-a-half years is simply inexplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Petitioners are not unsophisticated, uneducated people. They are affluent individuals who obviously had lawyers and accountants at their command. They were privileged, of course, at their risk, to remain in a state of denial and accept Brown\u2019s statement that their position was prejudiced only by IRS\u2019s possession of Wolfs letter, but to hold that they were not, as a matter of law, on inquiry notice at that point strikes me as wholly unwarranted. This is not a credibility issue\u2014 who one believes. The test is an objective one \u2014 what would a person of ordinary prudence be expected to do when undisput-ably aware of these uncontradicted facts? Petitioners, who had been warned at the outset that the scheme was flawed, had just seen it collapse. Instead of making an independent, objective inquiry into Brown\u2019s excuse that Wolf was at fault, they blindly followed Brown\u2019s recommendation that they hire another lawyer to sue Wolf. It is not entirely clear from this record how IRS came into possession of Wolfs letter, but, however that occurred, it now seems to be accepted that the letter would have been inadmissible against petitioners, which presumably any competent attorney would have told petitioners had they inquired. If petitioners had consulted counsel in that regard and been so informed, they would certainly have had a basis not only to question Brown\u2019s assertion that the need to settle was prompted by Wolfs letter but to question as well virtually everything he had told them.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">To me, on this record, the Court\u2019s conclusion constitutes an unwarranted extension of the discovery rule. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Judge RODOWSKY has authorized me to state that he joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
