Undertaking to assert multiple theories of liability, she sued her employer, two supervisors, three union officials, and the coworker in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The issue before us is the legal sufficiency of the allegations in certain counts of an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The employer is the respondent, Mass Transit Administration (MTA), a unit of the Department of Transportation of the State of Maryland. The events with which we are concerned are said to have occurred at night at the MTA facility on Kirk Avenue near Twenty-fifth Street in Baltimore City where buses that are not in service are cleaned, refueled, and parked on a large, open air lot. The alleged harasser is Francisco \u201cRoy\u201d Ovid (Ovid), another respondent. Manikhi and Ovid were classified as \u201cA-Cleaners\u201d of buses; both worked the night shift at the Kirk Avenue facility. The respondents, Vernon Parsons (Parsons) and Wade Moragne-el (Moragne-el), collectively, the \u201cMTA Officials,\u201d are alleged to have been, respectively, the foreman of the night shift at Kirk Avenue and, as of 1995, the chief superintendent of that facility. Charles Pettus, Ennis Fonder, and Nelson Zollicoffer, the remaining respondents, are officials of Local 1300 of the Amalgamated Transit Union, A.F. of L.-C.I.O., and they are collectively referred to as \u201cthe Union Officials.\u201d The complaint seeks compensatory and punitive damages and counsel fees. There is no specific request for prospective relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The only count that survived dismissal on the face of the pleadings in the circuit court was one charging battery by Ovid. It was tried to a jury and resulted in a judgment for the defendant, apparently based on Manikhi\u2019s failure to convince the jury that a battery had occurred within the one-year period of limitations for that tort. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the dismissal. <em>Manikhi v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>127 Md.App. 497, 733 A.2d 372 (1999). We granted Manikhi\u2019s petition for certiorari. 356 Md. 495, 740 A.2d 613 (1999). This certiorari review concerns Manikhi\u2019s allegations of violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 20006,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and of Articles 24 and 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, as well as counts labeled \u201cFalse Imprisonment\u201d and \u201cIntentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.\u201d When discussing a particular claim, <em>infra, </em>we shall identify the respondents against whom the claim is asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Inasmuch as the instant appeal is from the grant of a motion to dismiss for insufficient allegations in a complaint, we would ordinarily proceed directly to summarizing those allegations before determining whether they \u201ccontain a clear statement of the facts necessary to constitute a cause of action.\u201d Maryland Rule 2-305. In the instant matter, however, there is a complication. Before we can determine whether the amended complaint states one or more causes of action, we must first determine whether an affidavit by Manikhi, which she purported to incorporate into her amended complaint, forms part of that amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The complaint initially filed by Manikhi was over sixty pages in length, consisting of 241 paragraphs. MTA moved to strike that complaint, arguing that it was \u201crambling\u201d and constituted \u201can assemblage of opinions, argument, recitations of evidentiary minutiae, and extraneous allegations.\u201d Commenting that she had been unable to discern a cause of action alleged within the first forty pages of the complaint, the circuit court (Judge Bonita J. Dancy) dismissed, with leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">This dismissal was proper. Maryland Rule 2-303(b) requires that \u201c[e]ach averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and direct\u201d and that it \u201cshall contain only such statements of fact as may be necessary to show the pleader\u2019s entitlement to relief.\u201d The rule further requires that a pleading \u201cshall not include argument, unnecessary recitals of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>evidence, or documents, or any immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In Maryland, contrary to federal practice, dismissals for failure to state a claim are not limited to those cases in which \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no state of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80, 84 (1957) (footnote omitted). <em>See </em>J.A. Lynch, Jr. &amp; R.W. Bourne, <em>Modern Maryland Civil Procedure </em>\u00a7 6.1, at 342-47 (1993) (distinguishing between pleading requirements in Maryland and federal practice); P.V. Niemeyer &amp; L.M. Schuett, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary </em>161 (2d ed.1992) (same); P.M. Sandler &amp; J.K. Archibald, <em>Pleading Causes of Action in Maryland </em>\u00a7 1.1, at 2 (2d ed.1991) (same). Instead, when drafting a Maryland circuit court complaint, it is the responsibility of counsel to distill from the client\u2019s narrative and any other relevant information acquired by investigation a concise statement of facts that will identify for the professional reader, be it adverse counsel or the court, the cause of action that is being asserted. That is the essence of \u201cthinking like a lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In her amended complaint Manikhi reduced the allegations to twenty-five pages and ninety-nine paragraphs. The amended complaint, however, expressly states that it incorporates by reference, as part of the complaint, the matters contained in an affidavit by Manikhi which is attached to the complaint. That affidavit, consisting of fifty pages and 185 paragraphs, substantially repeats the original complaint and precipitated another round of motions to strike and to dismiss. At the hearing on those motions the circuit court (Chief Judge Robert I.H. Hammerman) described the affidavit as a \u201cregurgitation\u201d of the original complaint and struck the affidavit from the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">By a footnote in her brief to the Court of Special Appeals Manikhi submitted that the affidavit materials were properly incorporated into the amended complaint. Ruling that Mani-khi\u2019s footnote argument did not address the basis of the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>court\u2019s ruling \u2014 violation of Rule 2 \u2014 303(b)\u2014the Court of Special Appeals considered Manikhi to have waived any issue concerning the striking of the affidavit. <em>Manikhi, </em>127 Md. App. at 509, 733 A.2d at 379. That court decided the appeal to it on the basis of the amended complaint, unenhanced by the contents of the affidavit. In her brief to this Court, Manikhi asks us to consider that the affidavit forms part of the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The circuit court did not err in striking the affidavit from the amended complaint. Incorporating the subject affidavit into the amended complaint made the amended complaint substantially indistinguishable from the original complaint. We have already held that the original complaint was properly dismissed, with leave to amend. Manikhi chose not to suffer judgment on the original complaint, but to amend. The incorporation stratagem is an effort to have it both ways. There was no abuse of discretion in striking the affidavit from the amended complaint, inasmuch as the incorporation stratagem seems clearly to have been designed to attempt to circumvent the trial court\u2019s ruling on the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The amended complaint consists of an introductory statement followed by separately numbered counts, many of which state additional facts. Each count incorporates the preceding and succeeding allegations. In most instances there is no effort to state when conduct or events occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">When setting forth below the material allegations of the amended complaint, we are mindful of the following rules:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">1. Well pleaded allegations are accepted as true for purposes of the motion to dismiss, <em>Sharrow v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>306 Md. 754, 768, 511 A.2d 492, 499-500 (1986);</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">2. The inferences most favorable to the plaintiff are drawn from well pleaded facts, <em>id.; </em>and</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>3. \u201c[A]ny ambiguity or want <em>of </em>certainty in [the] allegations must be construed against the pleader.\u201d <em>Read Drug &amp; Chem. Co. v. Colwill Constr. Co., </em>250 Md. 406, 416, 243 A.2d 548, 555 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Manikhi was first employed by MTA in 1989. She transferred to the Kirk Avenue facility in 1991. There she was subjected to repeated sexual harassment by Ovid. This abuse continued throughout 1991, 1992, 1994, and 1995. During 1993 Manikhi transferred to MTA\u2019s Eastern Avenue facility in order to escape Ovid\u2019s conduct. For reasons that are unexplained in the complaint, Manikhi transferred back to Kirk Avenue in 1994. On October 11, 1995, Ovid elbowed Manikhi and called her a \u201cbitch.\u201d From Manikhi\u2019s standpoint this was \u201c[t]he last straw.\u201d On or about October 13, 1995, Manikhi filed a sexual harassment complaint with MTA\u2019s internal equal employment opportunity (EEO) office. That complaint \u201cwas resolved in her favor\u201d by the MTA-EEO on December 8, 1995. Manikhi further alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">\u201c20. Even after the December 8, 1995, favorable EEO finding for Ms. Manikhi, Defendants did not take any measures to protect her from Defendant Ovid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">\u201c21. Ultimately, in order to get away from unlawful conduct against her, in 1996, Ms. Manikhi was forced to transfer to Northwest Division where she finally had to move to a B-Cleaner position, a lower position, which allows her to work alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">\u201c22. In or about August 1996, Defendant Ovid was criminally convicted of committing continuous harassment against [Manikhi] (which was reduced to a [probation before judgment] after he attended counseling), but\u2014 as they have from the beginning \u2014 Defendants have continually refused to believe [Manikhi] or protect her from Ovid, rather they have done everything they can to protect Defendant Ovid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">The allegations describing Ovid\u2019s sexually abusive conduct are graphic. They sufficiently allege persistent and unwelcome sexual harassment by Ovid. He is said to have exposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>himself, grabbed her breasts, thrust his pelvic area against her in close quarters, importuned her to have sex with him, and threatened to follow her home and have forced sex with her. Ovid and Manikhi are African-American, while Mani-khi\u2019s husband is a native of the Middle East. One of Ovid\u2019s recurring themes was that Manikhi craved sex with a black man.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Principal issues in this case are whether MTA Officials had actual or constructive notice of the sexual harassment prior to October 1995, and whether, after having notice, they failed to protect Manikhi from Ovid. The Court of Special Appeals held that there was no sufficient allegation of notice prior to the formal complaint of October 1995 and that there was no sufficient allegation that the sexual harassment continued after the favorable disposition on December 8 of the MTA-EEO investigation. <em>Manikhi, </em>127 Md.App. at 516-20, 733 A.2d at 383-85. We disagree. Taking as true the alleged facts set forth below, there was notice to MTA prior to October 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Manikhi made \u201ccomplaints\u201d about Ovid to one Reed Kreider, described as Manikhi\u2019s \u201cprior supervisor\u201d and the predecessor to Moragne-el as chief supervisor at the Kirk Avenue facility. As noted, Moragne-el did not become a supervisor until 1995. The inference is that these \u201ccomplaints\u201d were of sexual harassment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, Manikhi\u2019s \u201c[cjomplaints about Ovid\u2019s unlawful conduct were ignored by MTA supervisors Parsons and Moragne-el.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Inferentially at a time prior to October 13, 1995, Manikhi went to one Saunders, also an alleged foreman, who advised her that she could not file a grievance against Ovid, as another member of the union. Manikhi told Saunders that \u201cshe was tired of Defendant Ovid bothering her and asked if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>there was anything else she could do to make him leave her alone.\u201d In response Saunders furnished Manikhi with a paper that said \u201csomething about [one] employee cannot stop another employee from doing their job.\u201d A factor in determining whether a hostile environment is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment, and thereby to violate Title VII, is whether the discriminatory conduct \u2018\u201cunreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 2283, 141 L.Ed.2d 662, 676 (1998) (quoting <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S.Ct. 367, 371, 126 L.Ed.2d 295, 302-03 (1993)). Accordingly, the most favorable inference to Manikhi from the description of the paper furnished to her by her foreman, Saunders, is that Saunders understood that Manikhi was complaining of sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Manikhi also avers that on one occasion she was in the room used for lunch breaks and crying as a result of some conduct by Ovid that is not described. Parsons \u201ccame in smiling, and jokingly said \u2018did your boyfriend ... Ovid do something to upset you?\u2019 \u201d Manikhi yelled that Ovid was not her boyfriend and said to Parsons, \u201c \u2018[Y]ou let Ovid do anything he wants to do. I just want him to leave me alone.\u2019 \u201d The allegation that Parsons, who did not see the cause of Manikhi\u2019s crying, was able to associate it with Ovid, to whom Parsons facetiously referred as Manikhi\u2019s boyfriend, also carries the inference of unwelcome conduct based on Manikhi\u2019s gender. In the same vein is Manikhi\u2019s averment that Parsons, \u201csmiling and grinning,\u201d asked Manikhi if she were \u201cpeeping or spying\u201d on Ovid who, Parsons said, had told him that that was the fact of the matter. Manikhi denied her having so acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Additional allegations of the amended complaint will be set forth, <em>infra, </em>when we discuss the rulings on certain of the counts which Manikhi raises before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Manikhi charged MTA with violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>based on \u201cdiscriminatory harassment/hostile work environment\u201d (Count V) and \u201cretaliation\u201d (Count VI).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer \u201cto discriminate against any individual with respect to [her] ... terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s ... sex.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). In <em>Meritor Savings Bank FSB v. Vinson, </em>477 U.S. 57, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986), the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe language of Title VII is not limited to \u2018economic\u2019 or \u2018tangible\u2019 discrimination,\u201d but that it encompasses protection for employees from hostile environment sex discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 64, 106 S.Ct. at 2404, 91 L.Ed.2d at 58. The Court thereby endorsed decisions of federal courts of appeals that had held that a claim of hostile environment sex discrimination is actionable under Title VII. <em>Id. </em>at 66-67, 106 S.Ct. at 2405, 91 L.Ed.2d at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">To establish a claim for sexual harassment under this provision the plaintiff must prove the following four elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1i\">\u201c(1) the subject conduct was unwelcome; (2) it was based on the sex of the plaintiff; (3) it was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the plaintiffs conditions of employment and to create an abusive work environment; and (4) it was imputable on some factual basis to the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-8\"><em>See Spicer v. Virginia Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>66 F.3d 705, 710 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">\u201cConduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment \u2014 an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive \u2014 is beyond Title VII\u2019s purview.\u201d <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 370, 126 L.Ed.2d 295, 302 (1993). In determining whether the alleged harassment of an employee is sufficiently severe or pervasive to bring it within Title VII\u2019s scope, a court must examine \u201c \u2018all the circumstances, [including] the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity; whether it is physically threatening or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Beardsley v. Webb, </em>30 F.3d 524, 529 (4th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Harris, </em>510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. at 371, 126 L.Ed.2d at 302-03).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In the instant matter the conduct attributed to Ovid clearly satisfies the first three elements of a hostile environment violation of Title VII. For the reasons stated in Part II, <em>supra, </em>the fourth element of the violation is satisfied. Accordingly, Count V states a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">To plead \u201cretaliation\u201d in violation of Title VII the plaintiff must allege that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">\u201c(1) she engaged in statutorily protected expression or activity; (2) she suffered an adverse action by her employer; and (3) there is a causal link between the protected expression and the adverse action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\"><em>Knox v. Indiana, </em>93 F.3d 1327, 1333-34 (7th Cir.1996); <em>see also Munday v. Waste Mgt. of N.A., Inc., </em>126 F.3d 239, 242 (4th Cir.1997) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1116, 118 S.Ct. 1053, 140 L.Ed.2d 116 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">We shall assume that Manikhi\u2019s filing of an internal complaint was a \u201cprotected activity.\u201d <em>Compare Clover v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., </em>176 F.3d 1346, 1353 (11th Cir.1999) (participation in internal investigations is covered by Title VII only when that investigation is \u201cin response to [an EEOC] notice of charge of discrimination\u201d and where the employer is \u201caware that the evidence gathered in that inquiry will be considered by the EEOC as part of its investigation\u201d), <em>with </em>D.E. Larkin, <em>Participation Anxiety: Should Title VII\u2019s Participation Clause Protect Employees Participating in Internal Investigations, </em>33 Ga. L.Rev. 1181, 1187 (1999) (arguing that \u201ccourts should liberally construe\u201d Title VII because \u201ca restrictive reading of the anti-retaliation provision has a crashing impact on employees filing internal complaints and participating in internal investigations\u201d). On that assumption, the first ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>ment is satisfied. Manikhi seems to rely on what we might call a \u201cconstructive demotion\u201d theory to satisfy the second and third elements of a retaliation violation of Title VII. The Court of Special Appeals concluded, however, that Manikhi did not plead a \u201cretaliation\u201d claim under Title VII because she did not plead these two elements, <em>i.e., </em>that \u201cshe [did] not allege that the MTA took an adverse employment action against her\u201d and she \u201cfail[ed] to allege a causal connection between a protected activity and an adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Manikhi, </em>127 Md.App. at 520-21 &amp; n. 10, 733 A.2d at 385 &amp; n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">A \u201cretaliatory action\u201d does not rise to the level of an \u201cadverse employment action\u201d unless it constitutes an \u201c \u2018ultimate employment decision\u2019 \u201d which may include acts \u201c \u2018such as hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensating.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Mattern v.

Although the employee felt compelled to quit, the court nonetheless held that the employer\u2019s acts did not amount to retaliation \u201cbecause there was no adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243. There, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">\u201cWe agree with the defendants that, as a matter of law, this scenario does not rise to the level of an adverse employment action for Title VII purposes. In no case in this circuit have we found an adverse employment action to encompass a situation where the employer has instructed employees to ignore and spy on an employee who engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>in protected activity, without evidence that the terms, conditions, or benefits of her employment were adversely affected. <em>See Hopkins v.

Although Manikhi alleges that she was \u201cforced to transfer\u201d out of Kirk Avenue in order to escape \u201cunlawful conduct,\u201d no facts are alleged that tie the forced transfer to retaliation for filing the MTA-EEO complaint. The \u201cunlawful conduct\u201d referred to could well be a continuation of the previous unlawful conduct without any causal connection to the internal complaint. This would not be a retaliation violation, but it would be actionable under Count V of the complaint which we have sustained in Part III.A, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Further, even if one could infer that the \u201cunlawful conduct\u201d is retaliatory, that allegation is contradicted by the allegation that Manikhi sought the B-Cleaner position because it \u201callow[ed] her to work alone.\u201d Construing the ambiguity against the pleader results in the absence of any allegation of adverse employment action. Under that reading the demotion was voluntary. This reading is supported by the ambiguity in the allegations concerning the timing of the transfer and the timing of the demotion that is created by the adverb, \u201cfinally.\u201d One fair reading is that Manikhi transferred to the Northwest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Division and, after some period of service as an A-Cleaner, then moved to a B-Cleaner position in order to work alone.

This differs from the inquiry under Title VII as to whether or not the sexual harassment altered the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment. That standard comes from the [EEOC] regulations promulgated under Title VII. Second, a plaintiff can make an ultimate showing of sex discrimination either by showing that sexual harassment that is attributable to the employer under \u00a7 1983 amounted to intentional sex discrimination or by showing that the conscious failure of the employer to protect the plaintiff from the abusive conditions created by fellow employees amounted to intentional discrimination. To make this showing, it is not necessary to show that all women employees are sexually harassed.

The court explained that \u201c[t]he \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 standard permits courts to separate omissions that \u2018amount to an intentional choice\u2019 from those that are merely \u2018unintentionally negligent oversight[s].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gonzalez v.

The standard adopted by the Third Circuit in <em>Andrews, </em>895 F.2d 1469, for \u00a7 1983 liability on the part of a supervisor for coworker sexual harassment is whether the evidence shows that the supervisor \u201cacquiesced in the sexual discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1479. In <em>Volk, </em>845 F.2d 1422, the test applied by the Seventh Circuit was whether the sexual harassment \u201c \u2018occurred at the direction of these officials or with their express consent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1432 (citation and attribution omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In <em>Lipsett v.

The court stated that the plaintiff could meet the requisite element of \u201cdiscriminatory intent\u201d by showing that the supervisors\u2019 \u201caction or inaction was \u2018affirmatively] link[ed]\u2019 to that [harassing] behavior in the sense that it could be characterized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>as \u2018supervisory encouragement, condonation, or acquiescence\u2019 <em>or </em>\u2018gross negligence amounting to deliberate indifference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 896, 902 (citation omitted; quoting <em>Oklahoma City v.

In reversing summary judgment for the defendants, the First Circuit found that the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence from which to infer this affirmative link based on the supervisors\u2019 \u201cfailure ... to investigate and put a stop to the harassment,\u201d and their reliance on the male residents\u2019 version of events despite \u201cgood reason to suspect [that their version was a] pretext.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In the instant matter, giving to Manikhi the favorable inferences from the jumbled facts alleged in the amended complaint, there emerges the image of sexual harassment and a hostile workplace environment of which the MTA Officials should have been aware. The theme of Manikhi\u2019s allegations is that the MTA Officials would not protect her and that they did all that they could to protect Ovid. For example, in a conversation between Manikhi and Moragne-el that apparently took place after the October 1995 formal complaint, Moragneel advised Manikhi that he had spoken with Ovid and concluded that Manikhi had been harassing Ovid because Ovid had refused to have sex with Manikhi. She further avers that, in that same conversation, she hypothesized to Moragne-el that she had been beaten and raped by Ovid in the Kirk Avenue bus parking area and that, bruised in face and body, she reported the incident to Moragne-el. She further hypothesized that Ovid told Moragne-el that there had been sex, but it was consensual. Manikhi avers that Moragne-el responded to the hypothetical by saying that no rape would have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Manikhi also avers that a few days after her formal complaint Moragne-el \u201cyelled\u201d at her in the presence of Ovid and Parsons. He told her to resolve her differences with Ovid or she would be terminated. When Manikhi responded by telling Moragne-el of the specific types of physical sexual abuse to which she had been subjected by Ovid, Moragne-el again told her that she should reconcile her differences with Ovid or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>would be fired. Moragne-el is also alleged to have told Manikhi that he did not care what her coworkers had witnessed and that \u201c \u2018their word means nothing.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The complaint further alleges that Manikhi had filed a criminal complaint against Ovid. A trial that was set for November 16, 1995, was postponed. Manikhi alleges that Moragne-el -wrote in a letter dated December 15, 1995, that the case was \u201c \u2018thrown out\u2019 \u201d because it was \u201c \u2018not based upon any merit or substance.\u2019 \u201d He \u201cclaimed [that] the legal resolution from the court was for her to stop her harassment of\u2019 Ovid.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The amended complaint also avers that when Manikhi told Moragne-el that she \u201c \u2018would go outside the gates of MTA to seek, justice,\u2019 \u201d Parsons told her that she would \u201c \u2018do no such thing.\u2019 \u201d He said that \u201cthis was his base and he makes the decisions, and his decision for her is to stop harassing ... Ovid for sex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">In light of the allegations reviewed above and in Part II, <em>supra, </em>the amended complaint is legally sufficient for at least three reasons. First, as noted in Part II, Manikhi alleges actual notice to Moragne-el\u2019s predecessor as superintendent of the facility, and evidence of the above incidents would demonstrate a failure by the MTA Officials to protect Manikhi from further abuse. Second, the vehemence and intransigence of Moragne-el\u2019s alleged rejection of Manikhi\u2019s complaints, both during the pendency of the MTA-EEO investigation, and after its conclusion in Manikhi\u2019s favor, permit an inference of a sexually discriminatory and hostile work environment that was at least condoned at the level of state agents acting under color of law. Third, after the resolution of the MTA-EEO complaint, the MTA Officials continually refused to protect Manikhi from Ovid. She specifically alleges that after the MTA-EEO investigation she was promised that she would be \u201cclosely monitored,\u201d but she was not. Inferentially, monitoring would be done by Parsons, the immediate supervisor of Manikhi and Ovid. -</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">For the foregoing reasons Count VII states a claim upon which relief can be granted against Moragne-el and Parsons.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">No cause of action, however, lies against Ovid based on \u00a7 1983. Ovid was an A-Cleaner, as was Manikhi. He had no control or authority over her. His alleged actions were not under color of state law. <em>See Woodward v. City of Worland, 977 </em>F.2d 1392, 1400-01 (10th Cir.1992) (citing cases \u201cdeclining] to find liability under \u00a7 1983 against a co-employee for harassment when the harassment did not involve use of state authority or position\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>509 U.S. 923, 113 S.Ct. 3038, 125 L.Ed.2d 724 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">With respect to the Union Officials, Manikhi recognizes that they are private individuals who would not ordinarily be liable under \u00a7 1983. Manikhi argues, however, that the Union Officials acted in concert with, or conspired with, or aided and abetted, the MTA Officials in depriving Manikhi of her constitutional right to be protected from gender discrimination. We find that the allegations of the amended complaint fail to present well pleaded facts in support of that theory. Indeed, on this phase of the case, the allegations are vague, confused, and extremely ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">In her brief to this Court, Manikhi places principal reliance on a meeting between the Union Officials and her following the October 11, 1995 incident when Ovid elbowed Manikhi. She alleged that, over a period of three hours, the Union Officials tried to dissuade her from charging that Ovid had elbowed her and that he had been sexually harassing her. The Union Officials appealed to solidarity (Ovid was a \u201cunion brother\u201d), to racial identification (Manikhi was a \u201cblack sister\u201d), and to sympathy (Ovid was an old man who could lose his pension). The Union Officials told her that if she would do this \u201cthen the charges would be reduced to two coworkers having a disagreement.\u201d Although Manikhi \u201cinsisted that she wanted a hearing,\u201d the Union Officials \u201cdid not properly process her grievance.\u201d She alleges that the decision not to have a hearing was made jointly by the Union and MTA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Officials who agreed \u201cthat Ms. Manikhi would lose a day\u2019s work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">These allegations confuse Manikhi\u2019s complaint of sexual harassment by Ovid, which was resolved in her favor, with what we infer to be the settlement by the Union Officials of a disciplinary matter arising out of the altercation with Ovid on October 11. That the Union was motivated in effecting the grievance settlement by the desire to protect Ovid\u2019s job security was entirely consistent with the union\u2019s acting as an adversary to, and not in collusion with, management. One cannot infer from the grievance settlement that the Union Officials were acting in concert with the MTA Officials to deprive Manikhi of protection against sexual harassment when Manikhi alleges that her sexual harassment complaint was resolved in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">For these reasons we affirm the dismissal as to the Union Officials of Count III (Aiding and Abetting), Count IV (Civil Conspiracy), and Count VII (\u00a7 1983).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">In her conspiracy and her aiding and abetting \u201ccounts\u201d Manikhi names MTA as a defendant. MTA is a state agency and, as such, is not a \u201cperson\u201d under \u00a7 1983 and can have no \u00a7 1983 liability. <em>See Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 2312, 105 L.Ed.2d 45, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>58 (1989). As this Court has noted before, \u201can action for money damages under \u00a7 1983 cannot be maintained against a state, a state agency, or a state official sued in his official capacity.\u201d <em>Ritchie, </em>324 Md, at 355, 597 A.2d at 437; <em>see also Okwa v.

It is therefore unnecessary for us to enter the bog of whether an agency can conspire with, or aid and abet, its own agents under the facts alleged here. We hold simply that joint liability theories cannot be utilized under \u00a7 1983 to assert a money damages claim against a state agency when the state agency cannot be liable for damages if it were the sole defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Manikhi also claims under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Named as defendants in the Maryland Constitution count (Count XII) are Ovid and the Union and MTA Officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">This Court has held that \u201cthe principle of equal protection of the laws is included in Art.

Waldron, </em>289 Md. 683, 426 A.2d 929 (1981), where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">\u201cWhen evaluating an equal protection claim grounded on Article 24, we utilize in large measure the basic analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>provided by the United States Supreme Court in interpreting the like provision contained in the fourteenth amendment. ... Although the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and the equal protection principle embodied in Article 24 are \u2018in pari materia,\u2019 and decisions applying one provision are persuasive authority in cases involving the other, we reiterate that each provision is independent, and a violation of one is not necessarily a violation of the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 714, 426 A.2d at 946.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">One difference between the provisions concerns the remedy for a constitutional violation. \u201c[T]he right of recovery for Federal violations arises from statute \u2014 \u00a7 1983\u2014 whereas the redress for State violations is through a common law action for damages.\u201d <em>DiPino v.

In view of the strong public policy that is declared in Article 46, <em>see </em>note 9, <em>supra, </em>we hold that the equal protection component of Article 24, standing alone, embraces a prohibition against gender based discrimination in public employment at least to the extent found in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States. Inasmuch as we have already held in Part IV.A that a case has been stated against the MTA Officials under \u00a7 1983, a case likewise has been stated under Article 24 against them in Count XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Manikhi\u2019s state constitutional claim against the Union Officials was properly dismissed. We stated in <em>DiPino, </em>354 Md. at 50-51, 729 A.2d at 371, that Maryland \u201cConstitutional provisions have the more narrow focus of protecting citizens from certain unlawful acts committed by government officials. Indeed, <em>only </em>government agents can commit these kinds of Constitutional transgressions.\u201d (Emphasis added). The defendants in our prior constitutional tort cases have been public officials. The Court of Special Appeals, noting this fact, cited the following cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\"><em>\u201cSee DiPino, </em>[354 Md.] at 23, 729 A.2d 354 (local police officer); <em>Brown, </em>339 Md. at 102-04, 660 A.2d 447 (local police officers); <em>Ritchie, </em>324 Md. at 349, 597 A.2d 432 (Sheriff of Howard County); <em>Clea, [v.

To this list may be added <em>Okwa v. Harper, supra </em>(police officers of Maryland Transportation Authority). Because the Union Officials are not \u201cpublic officials\u201d or \u201cgovernment agents,\u201d but instead are individuals who represent employees under the collective bargaining agreement with MTA, their alleged misconduct cannot be comprehended by a constitutional tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The constitutional tort count of the amended complaint was also properly dismissed as to Ovid, who is not a public official. See Part IV.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">In the false imprisonment count of her amended complaint (Count II), Manikhi sues only Ovid. She avers that Ovid committed the tort on numerous occasions after March 1994. We need only find that one of the specific illustrations alleged by her is legally sufficient in order to sustain the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Manikhi avers that Ovid- would get on a bus where she was working, turn off the lights, and lock the back door, \u201ctrapping her in the stairwell of the bus.\u201d Ovid would go to the back of the bus \u201cand stand as close as he could get to her.\u201d \u201cOvid would tell her that he\u2019s tired of waiting for her to give\u201d him sex. Ovid would tell her that, inasmuch as she was trapped in the stairwell, she might as well do what he told her, which is graphically described.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">The Court of Special Appeals, in affirming the dismissal of this count, said that Manikhi</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">\u201cdoes not allege that on any particular occasion Ovid unlawfully deprived her of her liberty, without consent. It is insufficient that on one occasion he allegedly told her she could not get away.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-12\"><em>Manikhi, </em>127 Md.App. at 531, 733 A.2d at 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">In this Court, Manikhi emphasizes those allegations in her complaint that relate to Ovid\u2019s physical efforts to block Mani-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>khi\u2019s egress from the bus on which she was working, as distinct from the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 apparent emphasis on Ovid\u2019s verbal statement that she was trapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Ovid, by contrast, argues that Manikhi\u2019s \u201conly allegation is that Ovid allegedly told her she could not \u2018get away\u2019 from him,\u201d and that that \u201csimple statement ... does not equate ... to the use of force or a threat of force.\u201d Ovid argues that Manikhi made no \u201callegation that [she] attempted to object, to resist or to exit the stationary bus but was prevented by Ovid in some manner from doing so.\u201d In other words the asserted defect in Manikhi\u2019s complaint is that she was not restrained\u2014 she was free to go.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">As a substantive matter, \u201c[t]he necessary elements of a case for false imprisonment are a deprivation of the liberty of another without his consent and without legal justification.\u201d <em>The Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v. Paul, </em>256 Md. 643, 654, 261 A.2d 731, 738 (1970) (citing <em>Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Barrack, </em>210 Md. 168, 122 A.2d 457 (1956)). These three elements are alleged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">First, Manikhi denies consent. Second, since Ovid was also an A-Cleaner, one reasonably may infer that he did not possess legal authority for his actions. <em>Compare K-Mart Corp. v. Salmon, </em>76 Md.App. 568, 583-84, 547 A.2d 1069, 1076 (1988) (noting that \u201c[l]egal justification is the equivalent of legal authority,\u201d and providing the example of an arrest pursuant to a valid warrant as an example of such authority), <em>cert. denied, </em>314 Md. 496, 551 A.2d 867 (1989), <em>overruled on other grounds by Montgomery Ward v. Wilson, </em>339 Md. 701, 664 A.2d 916 (1995). Finally, Ovid\u2019s alleged actions \u2014 locking one of the bus doors, cutting off Manikhi\u2019s only other egress from that confined area by placing himself between her and the front door, turning out the lights of that confined area on a night shift, stating that she could not get away, and barraging her with lascivious puerilities \u2014 when taken together, constitute an implicit threat of force. Despite Ovid\u2019s assertion that Manikhi \u201cprovided no allegations ... that she attempted to leave the bus,\u201d a legally sufficient claim of false imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>does not require that Manikhi have attempted to get past Ovid under these circumstances in order to discover whether his implicit threat of force would be exercised. Instead, one may reasonably infer from Ovid\u2019s implicit threat that Manikhi\u2019s liberty was restrained. <em>See Mason v. Wrightson, </em>205 Md. at 487, 109 A.2d at 131 (noting that \u201c \u2018[a]ny exercise of force, or threat of force, by which in fact the other person is deprived of his liberty, compelled to remain where he does not wish to remain ... is an imprisonment\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Mahan v. Adam, </em>144 Md. 355, 365, 124 A. 901, 904 (1924))).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">For the foregoing reasons we shall reverse the dismissal of the false imprisonment count (Count II).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In an unnumbered count Manikhi sues all of the respondents, alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">A claim of IIED has four elements: \u201c(1) The conduct must be intentional or reckless; (2) [t]he conduct must be extreme and outrageous; (3) [t]here must be a causal connection between the wrongful conduct and the emotional distress; (4) [t]he emotional distress must be severe.\u201d <em>Harris v.

Manikhi elsewhere alleges that she suffered fear at work, that the misconduct required her constantly to be alert, and that it forced her to leave Kirk Avenue for another work site, although she later returned to Kirk Aven\u00fce. Moreover, \u201c \u2018in many cases the extreme and outrageous character of the defendant\u2019s conduct is in itself important evidence that the [severe emotional] distress has existed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris, </em>281 Md. at 571, 380 A.2d at 616 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46 cmt. j (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The conclusory allegations within the IIED count fail to state a claim, and there are no facts alleged anywhere in the amended complaint describing conduct of the MTA, its Officials, or the Union Officials that is \u201cextreme and outrageous.\u201d We shall assume, however, that Ovid\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. Nonetheless, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that, even taking these factors into account, the amended complaint fails to plead facts that, if true, would rise to the level of <em>severe </em>emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Previous cases indicate the high burden imposed by the requirement that a plaintiffs emotional distress be severe.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number><em>See Caldor, Inc. v.

Nowhere does the complaint state with reasonable certainty the nature, intensity or duration of the alleged emotional injury. <em>See Moniodis, </em>64 Md.App. at 15, 494 A.2d at 219 (noting that \u201cseverity [of emotional distress] is measured by factors including the intensity of the response as well as its duration\u201d (citing <em>Harris, </em>281 Md. at 571, 380 A.2d at 616)). For example, Manikhi does not state whether the medical treatment that she was forced to seek was of a psychological or physical nature, how long the treatment lasted, whether it was successful or is still continuing, whether it was periodic or intensive, and so forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Without such \u201cevidentiary particulars,\u201d <em>Harris, </em>281 Md. at 572, 380 A.2d at 617, the allegation that Manikhi was forced to seek medical treatment is akin to the plaintiffs assertion in <em>Bowden, supra, </em>that he went to a psychologist one time. In that case, this Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. On the same basis, and after taking into account all other incorporated allegations and inferences to be drawn therefrom, we affirm the dismissal of Manikhi\u2019s IIED count.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Manikhi contends that the Court of Special Appeals violated Rule 8-206(f) because Judge Eyler, the member of the appellate panel who authored that court\u2019s opinion, had been the judge <em>assigned </em>to a prehearing conference in the case. Rule 8-206(f) provides that \u201c[a] judge who <em>conducts </em>a prehearing conference shall not sit as a member of the panel assigned to hear the appeal in that case.\u201d (Emphasis added). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Respondents point out, and Manikhi does not dispute the fact that, after Manikhi\u2019s counsel requested a postponement of the conference, Judge Eyler instead canceled it. Because Judge Eyler did not \u201cconduct! ]\u201d the conference, the plain language of the rule does not require that he have recused himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Nonetheless, Manikhi submits that Judge Eyler \u201chad received Civil Appeal Prehearing Information Reports from all parties\u201d and that these \u201creports are not part of the record.\u201d It is true that Rule 8-206(b) prohibits parties from referring to information disclosed at a prehearing conference. <em>See Maryland Cas. Co. v. Lorkovic, </em>100 Md.App. 333, 362-63, 641 A.2d 924, 938 (1994) (noting that appellant included prehearing information report in record extract, that doing so violated Rule 8-206, and that the violation was \u201cserious\u201d because such a report could include confidential information about appellee); <em>Seidel v. Panella, </em>81 Md.App. 124, 130-31, 567 A.2d 134, 137-38 (1989) (same with respect to appellee\u2019s conduct), <em>cert. denied, </em>319 Md. 72, 570 A.2d 864 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">We shall assume that Judge Eyler did in fact receive the report. From that factual predicate Manikhi attempts to demonstrate that she was harmed. The background to this phase of her argument is that the defendants had removed this case to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, but it was remanded. In footnote 1 of the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals, that court attributes a description of the drafting of the original complaint as \u201cpainful and outrageous\u201d to the federal district court judge who remanded this case to state court. In fact, those words were uttered by MTA\u2019s counsel during the hearing before Judge Dancy, after remand. Manikhi appears to be contending that the misattribution is a sign that she was prejudiced by Judge Eyler\u2019s authorship of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion. This contention is entirely without merit. Footnote 1 does contain a misattribution,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but the error is minor and totally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>irrelevant. It has nothing to do with any possible confidential information that might have been contained in prehearing reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In sum, because no prehearing conference was conducted, the plain language of Rule 8 \u2014 206(f) did not require the judge who initially scheduled that conference to recuse himself from the panel that heard Manikhi\u2019s appeal, and Manikhi suffered no prejudice from the presence of that judge on the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS ON COUNT II (FALSE IMPRISONMENT) REVERSED AS TO RESPONDENT, FRANCISCO OVID, ON COUNT V (TITLE VII) REVERSED AS TO THE RESPONDENT, MASS TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION, AND ON COUNTS VII (\u00a7 1988) AND XII (MARYLAND CONSTITUTION) REVERSED AS TO THE RESPONDENTS, WADE MO-RAGNE-EL AND VERNON PARSONS.

We granted Ovid's cross petition for certiorari which raised the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\"Does the unappealed jury verdict against Petitioner and in favor of Respondent Ovid in regard to all battery incidents preclude Petitioner from using the same battery incidents as the basis for her petition requesting this Court to overturn the dismissal of her claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, as well as her claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, aiding and abetting and conspiracy?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">In that cross petition for certiorari Ovid argued that the judgment in his favor on the battery count also constituted issue preclusion as to false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">The judgments appealed from were entered on the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The record extract does not contain the testimony on which Manikhi relied to get to the jury, the trial court\u2019s instructions, or any special verdict at the trial on the battery count. In order to determine whether issue preclusion applies here, it would be necessary to identify the facts that necessarily had been decided by the jury verdict and to compare them with the allegations of the amended complaint. <em>See Butler v. State, </em>335 Md. 238, 272, 643 A.2d 389, 405 (1994) (stating that \"[t]o apply collateral estoppel, we must analyze what the jury actually found based on the jury instructions that were actually given\u201d); <em>Apostoledes v. State, </em>323 Md. 456, 464, 593 A.2d 1117, 1121 (1991) (\u201cA collateral estoppel analysis focuses on what the fact finder did find or must have found.\u201d); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 522, 495 A.2d 1, 18 (1985) (\"Before claiming the benefit of the doctrine, the party employing collateral estoppel must demonstrate that the issue of ultimate fact which has been decided in the previous case is the same as the issue in the instant proceeding.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1093, 106 S.Ct. 868, 88 L.Ed.2d 907 (1986); <em>Buford </em>v. <em>Bunn, </em>247 Md. 203, 208, 230 A.2d 636, 637-38 (1967) (stating that 7\u2018where it is sought to apply the estoppel of a judgment rendered upon one cause of action to matters arising in a suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>upon a different cause of action, the inquiry must always be as to the point or question actually litigated and determined in the original action\u2019 \u201d (emphasis omitted; quoting <em>LeBrun v. Marcey, </em>199 Md. 223, 227, 86 A.2d 512, 514 (1952))). Consequently, and without prejudice to Ovid\u2019s asserting the issue preclusion defense on remand, we do not rule on that defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\">. In <em>Foot, </em>the Court of Special Appeals cited <em>Gallagher v. Bituminous Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., </em>303 Md. 201, 492 A.2d 1280 (1985), for the particularity in pleading requirement. In <em>Gallagher, </em>this Court imposed that requirement with respect to a \"cause of action in this tort arising out of the nonpayment of [workers\u2019] compensation benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212, 492 A.2d at 1285.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b398-9\">. Many previous cases have found that a cause of action in IIED did not lie because the plaintiff could not satisfy the \"extreme and outrageous\u201d element. <em>See, e.g., Batson v. Shiflett, </em>325 Md. 684, 736-37, 602 A.2d 1191, 1216-17 (1992). We cite here only cases dealing with the requirement of severe emotional distress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b401-6\">. The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 footnote states, <em>\u201cAccording to the transcript </em>of the ... hearing in circuit court, the U.S. District Judge, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ordering the remand, characterized the drafting of the complaint as \u2018painful and outrageous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Manikhi, 127 </em>Md.App. at 505 n. 1, 733 A.2d at 377 n. 1 (emphasis added). The precise fact of the matter is that the federal district judge described the incoherence of Manikhi\u2019s complaint as \u201cpainful,\u201d initially agreed with MTA\u2019s counsel\u2019s description of it as \"outrageous,\u201d but then stated, \"I think it\u2019s \u2014 well, perhaps outrageous is too strong a word.\u201d After remand, at the hearing before Judge Dancy, the same counsel for MTA stated that the federal judge had described the complaint as \u201cpainful and outrageous.\u201d Thus, the transcript referred to in the court\u2019s footnote does indeed attribute these words to the federal district court judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
