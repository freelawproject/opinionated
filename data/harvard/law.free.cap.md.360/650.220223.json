This case is a direct appeal from a sentence of death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol, 1999 Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 414.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find no errors that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>tainted the proceedings. Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and the sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Ware and Kristi Gentry<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> met and began dating in 1991. Their relationship became serious, and Ware moved into the house in Severn where Kristi lived with her mother, Nina Gentry, in August of 1993. In September of 1993, however, according to Nina Gentry\u2019s testimony, the relationship became strained, and Ware moved out.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">On December 30, 1993, Nina Gentry returned home from work at midday and found Kristi, then 19, and her friend Cynthia Allen, 22, lying on the floor in the house. Each had been shot in the chest and at point-blank range in the head. Kristi was dead, and Cynthia died later in the hospital. Projectiles fired from a .380 caliber gun were found in the victims\u2019 bodies, and .380 caliber shell casings were found on the floor near the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Most of the critical testimony in the case concerned events occurring the morning of the day of the murders, a few hours before Nina Gentry discovered the victims. At approximately 9:00 a.m., Kristi\u2019s friend Adrian Washington telephoned Kristi at the house. Adrian testified that Kristi sounded scared and that she abruptly hung up the phone twice. He then received a call from an angry male caller who quickly hung up; Ware\u2019s statement to the police indicated that Ware used caller ID to return Adrian\u2019s call, and told Adrian not to call the house again. Then, Adrian received a call from Kristi, during which he heard Kristi say, \u201cDarris, I can\u2019t breathe. Get off me. You\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>After this call, Adrian immediately called his brother Thomas Washington, who in turn called the Gentrys\u2019 house. Thomas spoke to Ware, and the two argued. Thomas told Ware to stop what he was doing to Kristi, and Ware became angry. Ware asked Thomas whether he \u201cwas bulletproof\u2019 and threatened to \u201cget [him] and [his] punk-ass brother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">After this conversation, at about 10:00 a.m., Thomas telephoned Kristi\u2019s brother Kevin Gentry at his place of employment in Laurel. Along with a co-worker, Kevin then drove to his mother\u2019s house, where he confronted Ware, beating him. Afterward, Kevin testified, Ware left the house, went to his car, retrieved a gun and pointed it at Kevin, threatening to kill him. Ware subsequently drove away. When Kevin also drove away to return to work, he came upon Ware returning to the house in his car; according to Kevin, Ware stopped and got out of the car and brandished a gun, as Kevin attempted to run Ware over with his car. Ware escaped harm. Kevin then returned to work in Laurel, arriving there before 12:00 noon.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Deborah Amrhein, a sales clerk at the On Target shooting range and sporting goods store in Severn, told police she saw Ware in the store at about lunch time on December 30. A store manager testified that one box of .380 caliber ammunition of the type and make used by the killer was sold on December 30 at about 12:10 p.m. Neighbors of the Gentrys testified that they saw Appellant arrive back at the house between 12:00 and 12:30 p.m. In his statement to the police, Ware admitted that he owned a .380 caliber handgun. The murder weapon was never found.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">At about 12:00 noon, Edward Anderson, an inmate at the Maryland House of Corrections Annex in Jessup and a friend of Kristi, telephoned the house. He spoke to Cynthia, who told him that Ware was in the house and that Kristi and Ware were arguing. Anderson heard Kristi screaming. Then, Anderson heard three gunshots, followed by silence and the sound of someone hanging up the phone. Prison records indicated that this call terminated at 12:31 p.m. Anderson then called neighbors of the Gentrys and asked them to check on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>the house; neighbor Clyburn Cunningham, Jr. went to the house and rang the doorbell. There was no answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Nina Gentry had spoken to Kevin Gentry earlier in the morning when he came, upset, to see her at her workplace, after his encounter with Ware. Some time after noon, she decided to leave work and go to the house. After finding the victims, she called 911. Paramedics and police came to the house. While the police were in the house, Ware called, identified himself, and spoke to police officers. Ware asked if Kristi was there. A police officer asked Ware to come to the house; the officer then departed to look for Ware at an address where he was believed to live. The officer encountered Ware a short distance away, driving toward the house, and arrested him. We will supply additional facts as necessary in discussing the several issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Following this Court\u2019s reversal of Ware\u2019s convictions, he was retried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County on July 9 to July 22, 1999 and found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. A sentencing proceeding before the same jury was conducted pursuant to \u00a7 413, and Ware was sentenced to death pursuant to the jury\u2019s determination. On August 13, 1999, the court sentenced Ware to a term of ten years for the two handgun convictions, to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">II. Jury Selection Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Appellant argues that the trial court committed reversible error during jury selection. He makes three arguments: (a) that the trial judge committed reversible error in denying his motions to strike six prospective jurors for cause; (b) that the trial judge committed reversible error in striking two jurors for cause; and (c) that the trial judge committed reversible error in failing to strike, <em>sua sponte, </em>the entire venire panel on the ground that it had been tainted by exposure to media coverage of the case. The State argues that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling on the motions to excuse for cause. As to the court\u2019s failure to strike the entire panel, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>State maintains that, because this issue was never addressed to the trial court, the issue has not been preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">\n<em>A. Denial of Defense Motions to Strike for Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The jury selection proceeded in three stages. We glean from the record that, sometime before the trial began, prospective jurors completed a juror questionnaire.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The day before the trial began, the prospective jurors were brought before the judge individually for voir dire questioning. Several venirepersons were excused for cause at this time on the basis of the answers to the questionnaires alone. Each party moved to strike certain jurors for cause; some of these motions were granted, while others were denied or reserved. Finally, on the day of trial, the judge allowed renewal of motions to strike for cause that he had previously denied or reserved. The court then proceeded to select the jury, and the parties exercised their peremptory challenges. The defense exercised nineteen of the twenty peremptory challenges permitted by Maryland Rule 4-313(a)(2), and the State exercised the ten challenges permitted by the rule. Each side exhausted its allotted strikes for the alternates.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in failing to excuse six prospective jurors for cause, specifically, William Cooper, Sean Haynie, Thomas Leising, Joseph Satterthwait, James McLaughlin, and Sirkka Mitchell. As to Mitchell, Leising, and McLaughlin, the answer is simple. The record reflects that the trial court <em>granted </em>the defense motions to strike for cause. The trial judge denied the motions initially, but, when Appellant renewed his motions to strike for cause during the final stage of jury selection, the court excused these individuals. The remaining three prospective jurors, Cooper, Haynie, and Satterthwait, did not serve on the jury; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Appellant exercised a peremptory challenge to excuse each juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">We need not decide whether the trial judge erred in declining to excuse prospective jurors Cooper, Haynie, or Satterthwait because, even if there was error, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976). As noted, Appellant did not exhaust his peremptory challenges. \u201cIf disqualification for cause is improperly denied, but the accused has not exercised all allowable peremptory challenges, there is no reversible error.\u201d <em>White v. State, </em>300 Md. 719, 729, 481 A.2d 201, 205 (1984). Additionally, none of the challenged prospective jurors served on the jury; consequently, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that any alleged bias and/or knowledge of the case could not have influenced the verdict either as to the conviction or as to the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 728, 481 A.2d at 205 (stating that \u201cthe claimed bias of [a prospective juror unsuccessfully challenged for cause] did not influence the verdict because [the prospective juror] did not serve on the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">\n<em>B. Granting of Prosecution Motions to Strike for Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Appellant argues that the trial court should not have excused prospective jurors Marsha Santo and Donald Rabb for cause. In the case of Rabb, Appellant asserts that he should not have been excused because he indicated that he could put aside his personal reservations about the death penalty and deliberate as required by law. In the case of Santo, Appellant argues that the court erred in not permitting defense counsel to ask rehabilitative questions, and, as a result, the court had insufficient information to determine whether the prospective jurors could follow the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Santo and Rabb indicated that they would be unwilling to impose the death penalty. Rabb told the court that he absolutely would not impose the death penalty \u201cwhere a person went off and there was a love interest involved.\u201d The State represents in its brief that Santo \u201cappeared to indicate on her questionnaire that the death penalty should be imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>for every first degree murder, [but] when questioned, she responded that she did not believe she could impose the death penalty under any circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution require that the jury at a capital sentencing proceeding be fair and impartial. <em>See, e.g., Morgan v. Illinois, </em>504 U.S. 719, 728, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492 (1992); <em>Evans v. State, </em>333 Md. 660, 668, 637 A.2d 117, 121 (1994). The proper standard for determining when a prospective juror may be excluded for cause based on his or her views on the death penalty is whether the juror\u2019s views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his or her duties as a juror in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions and the juror\u2019s oath. <em>See Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 421, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985); <em>Evans, </em>333 Md. at 671, 637 A.2d at 122. The decision as to whether to excuse a juror for cause is ordinarily left to the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal except for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Witt, </em>469 U.S. at 426, 105 S.Ct. 844 (noting that deference is to be paid to trial judge\u2019s decision to strike juror for cause); <em>Bowie v. State, </em>324 Md. 1, 20, 595 A.2d 448, 457 (1991) (same). The trial court is in the best position to assess a juror\u2019s state of mind, by taking into consideration the juror\u2019s demeanor and credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The responses of jurors Santo and Rabb establish that they could not consider the death penalty under any circumstances. The record supports the trial judge\u2019s decision to excuse the prospective jurors for cause based on their opposition to capital punishment. Moreover, as to prospective juror Santo, Appellant acquiesced in the ruling.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Dietz v. Dietz, </em>351 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Md. 683, 689, 720 A.2d 298, 301-02 (1998); <em>Osztreicher v. Juanteguy, </em>338 Md. 528, 659 A.2d 1278 (1995); <em>Watkins v. State, </em>328 Md. 95, 99-100, 613 A.2d 379, 381 (1992); <em>Rocks v. Brosius, </em>241 Md. 612, 630, 217 A.2d 531, 541 (1966). The trial court did not abuse its discretion and properly excused both jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">\n<em>C. The Court\u2019s Failure to Strike, Sua Sponte, the Entire Panel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Appellant next argues that the record establishes that the pool of jurors knew from media accounts that Appellant had been convicted previously and that the jurors had discussed the matter in the courthouse. He maintains that, as a result, the trial court should have struck the entire panel on its own motion. Appellant never objected to the array. Appellant argues that, either as plain error or as coming within the relaxed application of preservation requirements in capital cases, this Court should consider the issue. The State maintains that a review of the record demonstrates no basis for the court to have disqualified the entire array. The State argues that it is unrealistic to expect potential jurors in the county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>not to have <em>some </em>knowledge of the case, particularly a capital case. If counsel believed that the publicity was so pervasive and overwhelming, he could have moved for automatic removal of the case under Maryland Rule 4-254(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Maryland Rule 4-312(a) addresses a party\u2019s challenge to the array. The rule provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">A party may challenge the array of jurors on the ground that its members were not selected, drawn, or summoned according to law or on any other ground that would disqualify the panel as a whole. A challenge to the array shall be made and determined before any individual juror from that array is examined, except that the court for good cause may permit it to be made after the jury is sworn but before any evidence is received.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Because defense counsel did not raise the issue at any time below, the issue is waived. We find no plain error and, accordingly, we reject Appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court should have, <em>sua sponte, </em>excused the entire panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">As we have indicated, it appears that a questionnaire was sent to all prospective jurors. On the questionnaire, the prospective jurors were asked about their knowledge of the case from news reports and other sources. It appears that an affirmative questionnaire answer indicating knowledge of the case prompted specific inquiry by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">Appellant points to the voir dire testimony of fourteen prospective jurors to support his argument that the entire panel was tainted. Upon questioning, prospective jurors Sat-terthwait, Norwood, Hendricks, Brown, Wilbur, Mitchell, and Bolick said that they had read something in the local newspaper about the case, that Ware had been tried previously, and the conviction reversed. Prospective jurors Pierce, Vanscoy, Matulevich, Stummer, and Levesque heard talk in the courthouse to the same effect. Two of these prospective jurors had heard that Appellant had been sentenced to death. All fourteen individuals stated that their knowledge would not prevent them from judging the case fairly and impartially on the basis of the evidence presented in court alone. Five of the fourteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>were stricken for cause, and six others were excused on peremptory challenges. The remaining three prospective jurors, Brown, Levesque, and Vanscoy, served on the jury. Vanscoy was excused before the end of the guilt/innocence phase and was replaced by an alternate; thus, she did not participate in the deliberations or verdict. Appellant never moved to strike any of these three for cause, and, as noted above, Appellant did not exhaust his peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Appellant does not appear to be complaining that any of the fourteen jurors were not excused for cause. His complaint appears to be that, based on the voir dire of those jurors, it is evident that the entire panel was tainted and should have been disqualified. The record does not support Appellant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">A criminal defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial jury is guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The Supreme Court has spoken several times to the application of this protection to criminal cases in which the venire has been exposed to pretrial publicity about the case. Juror knowledge of a case <em>alone </em>does not make the trial unfair:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">It is not required, however, that the jurors be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved. In these days of swift, widespread and diverse methods of communication, an important case can be expected to arouse the interest of the public in the vicinity, and scarcely any of those best qualified to serve as jurors will not have formed some impression or opinion as to the merits of the case. This is particularly true in criminal cases. To hold that the mere existence of any preconceived notion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused, without more, is sufficient to rebut the presumption of a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality would be to establish an impossible standard. It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-8\"><em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 722-23, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961). <em>See also Calhoun v. State, </em>297 Md. 563, 580, 468 A.2d 45, 52 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>This same notion was expressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Murphy v. Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 800, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 44 L.Ed.2d 589 (1975). There, the Court set out the standard for juror impartiality in pretrial publicity cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-4\">The constitutional standard of fairness requires that a defendant have a panel of impartial, indifferent jurors. Qualified jurors need not, however, be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.... At the same time, the juror\u2019s assurances that he is equal to [the task of laying aside his impression or opinion and rendering a verdict based on the evidence presented in court] cannot be dispositive of the accused\u2019s rights, and it remains open to the defendant to demonstrate the actual existence of such an opinion in the mind of the juror as will raise the presumption of partiality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 799-800, 95 S.Ct. 2031 (citations and internal quotations marks omitted). It is important to \u201cdistinguish between mere familiarity with petitioner or his past and an actual predisposition against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 801, n. 4, 95 S.Ct. 2031.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">In Maryland, we have had a number of occasions, in cases in which pretrial publicity was at issue, to state that a prospective juror is not disqualified automatically by pretrial knowledge of the case or preconceived opinions of the accused\u2019s guilt or innocence. Chief Judge Murphy, writing for the Court in <em>Couser v. State, </em>282 Md. 125, 138, 383 A.2d 389, 396-97 (1978), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">It is true, of course, that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights guarantee the right to an impartial jury to an accused in a criminal case; these constitutional guarantees do not, however, insure that a prospective juror will be free of all preconceived notions relating to guilt or innocence, only that he can lay aside his impressions or opinions and render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented in the case. <em>See Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961); <em>Newton v. State, </em>147 Md. 71, 127 A. 123 (1924); <em>Garlitz v. State, </em>71 Md. 293, 18 A. 39 (1889).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Applying these standards, we cannot say on the record before us that Appellant\u2019s right to a fair trial was violated by some unknown prospective jurors\u2019 purported knowledge of the case derived from pretrial publicity or discussion in the courthouse outside the courtroom. Appellant has failed to satisfy his burden to demonstrate the actual existence of such an opinion in the mind of any juror or such facts in the record as will raise a presumption of partiality. We hold that the trial court did not err in failing to strike, <em>sua sponte, </em>the entire jury panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">III. Trial Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">\n<em>A. Admission of Allegedly Irrelevant and Unfairly Prejudicial Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in admitting irrelevant and prejudicial evidence when it admitted evidence of threats made to two witnesses, Adrian and Thomas Washington, evidence that Appellant had hit Kristi previously, and evidence that Appellant carried a gun. Appellant argues that this evidence was admitted improperly because the evidence was irrelevant, and, even if relevant, its probative value was outweighed by the potential for unfair prejudice. Therefore, the evidence should have been excluded under Maryland Rule 5-403.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the evidence here at issue involves, at least arguably, some form of misconduct on the part of Appellant, Rule 5-404(b), the rule excluding so-called bad acts evidence, is also implicated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>\n<em>1. Testimony that Ware Threatened Thomas and Adrian Washington</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">On the day of the murders, Thomas Washington, who was the husband of a relative of Kristi Gentry, spoke to Ware by telephone while Ware was at the Gentrys\u2019 house. Appellant moved in limine to preclude Thomas from testifying to some statements Ware made in this telephone call. In particular, Appellant sought exclusion of Thomas\u2019s proffered statement that Ware had asked Thomas whether he \u201cwas bulletproof.\u201d Appellant argues that the evidence was irrelevant, that it was at best a threat against Thomas, and that any probative value was outweighed by the prejudice. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">At trial, Thomas testified, and Appellant objected: [THOMAS:] When we first started conversing it was pretty normal. But towards the end of our conversation it started getting more aggressive, and he started getting a little bit more boisterous with his attitude toward me, and I was trying to help out my family member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">[STATE\u2019S ATT\u2019Y:] Okay. And how did that conversation end?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">[THOMAS:] It ended with him basically asking me was I bulletproof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-9\">[DEF. ATT\u2019Y:] Objection. Move to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-10\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-11\">[STATE\u2019S ATT\u2019Y:] What did defendant say to you? [THOMAS:] He asked me was I bulletproof, he told me he knew where I lived and that he basically was going to get me and my punk-ass brother [i.e., Adrian Washington], [DEF. ATT\u2019Y:] Objection. Move to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-12\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-13\">We begin our analysis by repeating that the trial court is afforded great deference in its rulings on admissibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>of evidence and that rulings as to relevancy will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is a clear abuse of discretion. <em>See Hopkins v. State, </em>352 Md. 146, 158, 721 A.2d 231, 238 (1998). The trial judge\u2019s conclusion that Thomas\u2019s testimony was relevant is amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Appellant\u2019s statements to Thomas were made approximately three hours before the murders. Thomas\u2019s testimony is probative of the proposition that, within the pertinent time frame, Appellant was angry and in a violent frame of mind, and reacted during that time to objects of his anger with an impulse to shoot them. This proposition is probative of Appellant\u2019s motive to kill Kristi. While the testimony may have been prejudicial, it was not unfairly so under the facts of the case. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">\n<em>2. Testimony that Ware Had Assaulted Kristi Gentry on a Prior Occasion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Kevin Gentry testified that, three months before the altercation with Ware on December 30, 1993, he had told Ware that \u201cif he ever put his hands on my sister again, I would beat him up.\u201d Appellant argues that this testimony was inadmissible evidence of prior misconduct, carried no probative value, and was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">After the telephone conversation described above between Thomas and Ware, Thomas telephoned Kevin Gentry, Kristi\u2019s brother. Kevin testified as a prosecution witness that, after speaking to Thomas, he drove to the Gentry house, where he confronted Ware, engaged in an altercation with him, and ejected him from the house. The prosecutor asked Kevin, \u201cwhat prompted you to beat Mr. Ware up in that manner?\u201d The defense objected, and, at the bench, the State argued that the jury should know that Appellant had hit Kristi on a previous occasion, leading Kevin to warn him that he would be beaten if it happened again. The State proffered that the witness would testify that \u201con a previous occasion there was an altercation, and he told Ware, if you ever lay hands on my sister again, I am going to beat you up without any further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>conversation.\u201d The State argued that without this testimony, it would \u201clook[ ] like he just went in and beat Ware up for no reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The court overruled the objection, concluding that the evidence was not offered for its truth, but simply to show why Kevin acted as he did. The witness told the jury: \u201cIf he ever put his hands on my sister again, I would beat him up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Relying on Rule 5-404(b), Appellant argues that the testimony was irrelevant to any issue in the case, because the action the testimony was meant to justify was itself irrelevant to any issue in the case. He maintains that Kevin Gentry\u2019s testimony left the jury to speculate as to what Appellant had previously done to Kristi, when it occurred, and whether it demonstrated a propensity to engage in violence against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">At the outset, we note that evidence of the deterioration in Ware and Kristi\u2019s relationship came from many sources without objection. Several witnesses testified that the arguments between the two had escalated to the point of physical violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Kevin had testified that he knew Ware as his sister\u2019s boyfriend. When he arrived at the Gentry residence on December 30, 1993, Kevin saw Ware\u2019s car. Kevin rang the doorbell and, when Ware opened the door, Kevin began hitting Ware. The testimony in question was offered to explain Kevin\u2019s actions. The testimony was relevant to put Kevin\u2019s conduct in context. It was not offered for its truth, but simply to show why Kevin acted as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">The evidence that Kevin hit Ware the morning of the murders was relevant to show Ware\u2019s escalating anger towards Kristi on the day of the murder. In fact, several witnesses testified to this escalating anger and Appellant\u2019s build-up of rage towards Kristi. It is the function of the trial judge to assess the probative value of evidence and to weigh the probative value against the prejudicial effect. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>\n<em>S. Testimony that Ware Constantly Carried a Gun</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in admitting testimony of the State\u2019s witness, Sean LeBere, that Appellant had a gun and that he always carried it with him. Sean LeBere was an acquaintance of Ware\u2019s for six or seven months preceding the murders. LeBere testified that he saw Ware about two or three days per week during this period. The State asked LeBere, \u201cDuring the six or seven months before December 30th of 1993, did you ever see the Defendant with a gun?\u201d The defense objected on grounds of relevancy. The State argued that the evidence was relevant because the murders were committed with a gun, which was never found, and the testimony tended to show that Ware possessed a gun. Defense counsel argued that conduct beginning six to seven months before the murders was irrelevant and that \u201c[h]is habits are irrelevant.\u201d The court overruled the objection, and, in response to the question of how often LeBere had seen Ware with a gun, LeBere answered, \u201cHe always carried one with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Although conceding that evidence that he possessed a gun close to the time of the murders was relevant, Appellant argues that evidence that he did so continuously over a period of several months preceding the murders is not relevant and that it violates Maryland Rule 5-404(b). The State argues that LeBere\u2019s testimony that Ware always carried a gun was as relevant as the testimony of other witnesses that Ware had a gun a short time before the murders and that, in light of this other unobjected to testimony that Ware carried a gun frequently, any error in the admission of LeBere\u2019s testimony was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Appellant objected below on the grounds that the evidence was irrelevant and that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. Appellant\u2019s argument that the evidence ran afoul of Rule 5-404(b) was never made to the trial court and therefore was not preserved. <em>See Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 541-42, 735 A.2d 1061, 1068 (1999) (holding that a defendant waives the right to argue on appeal that testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>was inadmissible bad acts evidence when the only objection at trial was on grounds of relevancy).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">We hold that the trial court did not err in admitting the testimony. It was relevant to establish that Ware possessed a gun and as evidence of habit that he carried a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Evidence of a person\u2019s habit is explicitly deemed relevant by Rule 5-406 to prove action in conformity with the habit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALy\">Evidence of the habit of a person or of the routine practice of an organization is relevant to prove that the conduct of the person or organization on a particular occasion was in conformity with the habit or routine practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Evidence that a person has a habit of doing something is relevant to show that the person engaged in the conduct on a particular occasion. Here, evidence that Ware was in the habit of carrying a gun made it more likely that he had a gun on the day of the murders. This was habit evidence, admissible under Rule 5-406, and not evidence of a bad act to show character under Rule 5-404(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">\n<em>B. Admission of Testimony That Law Enforcement Officials Previously Testified to a Witness\u2019s Truthfulness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Ware argues that the testimony of Edward Anderson, a critical witness for the State, that certain law enforcement officials had testified at Anderson\u2019s hearing on his motion to reduce his sentence (in an unrelated case) that he had given them truthful information regarding these murders \u2014 the same information to which he testified in Ware\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>trial \u2014 was admitted in error. Ware argues that Anderson\u2019s credibility was a central issue in this trial and that, when the trial court permitted Anderson\u2019s credibility to be bolstered improperly through the opinions of a prosecutor and police detective that Anderson was telling the truth, the trial court committed reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Anderson, an inmate at the Department of Corrections serving a life sentence at the time of the murders, testified for the State. Anderson testified that he was a friend of Kristi Gentry and that Cynthia Allen was the mother of his child. On the day of the murders, Anderson testified, he had telephoned the Gentrys\u2019 house from prison and spoken to Kristi and Cynthia. Anderson testified that Cynthia told him, \u201cDar-ris is here,\u201d and that Ware and Kristi were \u201cfussing.\u201d Anderson also testified that he heard Kristi screaming, and then heard three gunshots, followed by silence; afterward, someone hung up the phone on the Gentrys\u2019 end.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">On cross-examination, Ware\u2019s counsel attempted to show that Anderson\u2019s testimony was motivated by a desire to obtain leniency in his own case. Anderson testified on cross-examination that, before Ware\u2019s first trial, his counsel had filed a motion for modification of his life sentence. He also testified that he brought to the attention of the sentencing judge the fact that he was testifying in the instant case. At the hearing on this motion, Anderson called as witnesses an Anne Arundel County police detective and a prosecutor from the Anne Arundel State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office to testify regarding Anderson\u2019s actions in informing them of the conversation that he had heard on the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">On redirect, the prosecutor inquired further regarding the testimony of the detective and prosecutor at the modification hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">[STATE\u2019S ATT\u2019Y:] And, Mr. Anderson, you were present when they testified?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">ANDERSON: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-10\">[STATE\u2019S ATT\u2019Y:] Okay. And you heard their testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>ANDERSON: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">[STATE\u2019S ATT\u2019Y:] And can you tell us whether or not they testified to anything other than the facts of what you had testified to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">[DEF. ATT\u2019Y:] Objection as to the characterization of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">THE COURT: I overrule that. You can answer that. ANDERSON: <em>They just testified that I was </em>\u2014 that <em>I was being truthful in bringing them this information. That\u2019s all.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Appellant argues that evidence that a prosecutor and a police detective had testified under oath that Anderson \u201cwas being truthful\u201d in the information that he presented was improper and highly prejudicial in that it vouched for his credibility and the truth of his testimony. Appellant cites <em>Bohnert v. State, </em>312 Md. 266, 539 A.2d 657 (1988), in which we held that a social worker\u2019s expert testimony that a child was a victim of sexual abuse, supported only by the child\u2019s averments, was tantamount to a declaration that the child was telling the truth and the defendant was lying, and therefore invaded the province of the jury. <em>See id. </em>at 276, 278-79, 539 A.2d at 662-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">It is the law of this State \u201cthat a witness, expert or otherwise, may not give an opinion on whether he believes a witness is telling the truth. Testimony from a witness relating to the credibility of another witness is to be rejected as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278, 539 A.2d at 663. In <em>Bohnert, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">In a criminal case tried before a jury, a fundamental principle is that the credibility of a witness and the weight to be accorded the witness\u2019 testimony are solely within the province of the jury. <em>Battle v. State, </em>287 Md. 675, 685, 414 A.2d 1266 (1980). Therefore, the general rule is that it is error for the court to make remarks in the presence of the jury reflecting upon the credibility of a witness. <em>Elmer v. State, </em>239 Md. 1, 10-11, 209 A.2d 776 (1965). It is also error for the court to permit to go to the jury a statement, belief, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>opinion of another person to the effect that a witness is telling the truth or lying. <em>Thompson v. Phosphate Works, </em>178 Md. 305, 317-319, 13 A.2d 328 (1940); <em>American Stores v. Herman, </em>166 Md. 312, 314-315, 171 A. 54 (1934). The Court of Special Appeals said in <em>Mutyambizi v. State, </em>33 Md.App. 55, 61, 363 A.2d 511 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>279 Md. 684 (1977):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\">Whether a witness on the stand personally believes or disbelieves testimony of a previous witness is irrelevant, and questions to that effect are improper, either on direct or cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 277, 539 A.2d at 662. <em>See </em>Joseph Murphy, Jr., Maryland Evidence Handbook \u00a7 603(C), at 250 (3d ed.1999) (stating that a witness is not permitted \u201cto express an opinion that another person\u2019s specific testimony is true or false\u201d). In <em>Bohnert, </em>this Court reversed the conviction. <em>See Bohnert, </em>312 Md. at 279, 539 A.2d at 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In the instant case, Anderson\u2019s testimony that the prosecutor and detective said he was being truthful when he brought information to them was inadmissible. <em>Bohnert,, </em>however, is distinguishable. In <em>Bohnert, </em>the State called a witness before the jury to bolster the credibility of another witness. In this case, we merely have the self-serving statement of the witness saying that others thought he was being truthful. Here we have Anderson basically saying: I am telling you the truth. I am telling you also that two others said I am telling the truth. Although distinguishable from <em>Bohnert, </em>we do not think the testimony was proper. Nevertheless, the form of the evidence reduced its prejudicial impact. Anderson made a self-serving statement to the effect that certain persons not present once affirmed, on an unknown basis, his truthfulness in making the statements he again made at trial. Such a statement, by a witness whose credibility is in question, is far less weighty than the expert testimony in <em>Bohnert, </em>and its effect on the jury was likely to be insignificant. Moreover, it is implicit that the police believed Anderson or they would not have gone to bat for him at the hearing on his motion to reduce his sentence. Although error, we hold that the error was harm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>less beyond a reasonable doubt. We are \u201csatisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of ... may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">\n<em>C. Prosecutor\u2019s Closing Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Appellant next asserts that the trial court erred in permitting improper closing argument. He argues that, in her closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor\u2019s argument depended on speculation regarding facts not in evidence and that the court erroneously denied Appellant\u2019s request to strike these comments and to instruct the jury to disregard the improper argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Jeffrey Allen, Cynthia Allen\u2019s husband, testified that Ware came to the Allens\u2019 house at about 12:45 on December 30, 1993 and that he had his hands \u201c[f]olded with one hand in his jacket.\u201d Ware departed shortly after he arrived. In her closing argument, the prosecutor described the shootings, noting that Cynthia Allen had been on the telephone talking to Edward Anderson. The prosecutor then continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APC\">But then, one more thought occurs to [Ware]. Who was Cynthia on the phone with when he fired those first shots? Jeffrey? There can\u2019t be any witnesses to this crime. I have eliminated Cynthia, I am going to get rid of the gun, but was it Jeffrey on the other end of the phone? Did he hear the gunshots?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">What does the Defendant do? He leaves the home. The murders happen at 12:31. We know that is when the phone was hung up. He arrives at Jeffrey Allen\u2019s house at about 12:45. Jeffrey Allen doesn\u2019t know that there is anything wrong yet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">Defense counsel objected, and a bench conference followed. Defense counsel contended that the State\u2019s argument was pure speculation as to what was in Ware\u2019s mind at the time he went to the Allen home. He also argued that there was no evidence as to whether Ware had a gun when he went over to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>the house. He argued that, since Ware was not charged with any offense against Jeffrey Allen, any reference to eliminating Allen should be stricken and the jury instructed to disregard the comment. The State argued that the comments were an appropriate response to the assertion in Appellant\u2019s opening statement that his actions after the crime were consistent with his innocence and that she was entitled to argue about why he went to the Allens\u2019 house. The court agreed with Appellant that it would be improper to imply that Ware had his gun in his pocket. The judge said, \u201cI am not going to allow you to say where is his gun, but everything else is okay.\u201d The prosecutor resumed her closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">Ladies and gentlemen, the Defendant goes to Jeffrey Allen\u2019s house. Jeffrey Allen tells you what he is wearing. The red ski jacket, the blue pants, and he tells you that his hands are in his pocket. Of course, that is significant, ladies and gentlemen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">The Defendant is satisfied that Jeffrey Allen is aware of nothing at that point and he leaves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Appellant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was unsupported by the evidence and that the State could not prove that Ware went to Allen\u2019s house armed and intending to kill Allen. He maintains that this inference argued by the State was pure speculation about possible other crimes and, as such, was highly prejudicial. The State\u2019s threshold position is that the issue is not preserved for our review, because defense counsel did not object after the prosecutor resumed her argument. On the merits, the State argues that the prosecutor never argued or inferred that Ware went to the Allen house to eliminate a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">We find that the issue is preserved, and we shall address the merits. Appellant objected to the argument and now asserts that the trial court erred in failing to strike the argument and to instruct the jury to disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">We begin by noting that, as a general rule, attorneys have great leeway in closing arguments. <em>See Degren v. State, 352 </em>Md. 400, 429, 722 A.2d 887, 901 (1999). Attorneys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>are permitted to comment on the evidence and to state all reasonable inferences that may reasonably be drawn from the evidence. <em>See Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 412-13, 326 A.2d 707, 714 (1974). This wide latitude, however, is not unlimited and does not include the right to discuss facts not in evidence. <em>See Degren, </em>352 Md. at 430, 722 A.2d at 901-02; <em>Collins v. State, </em>318 Md. 269, 279, 568 A.2d 1, 6 (1990). On the other hand, discussing facts not in evidence is not necessarily grounds for reversal. Judge Cathell, writing for the Court in <em>Degren, </em>noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">Not every improper remark, however, necessarily mandates reversal, and what exceeds the limits of permissible comment depends on the facts in each case. We have said that reversal is only required where it appears that the remarks of the prosecutor actually misled the jury or were likely to have misled or influenced the jury to the prejudice of the accused. This determination of whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments were prejudicial or simply rhetorical flourish lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. On review, an appellate court should not reverse the trial court unless that court clearly abused the exercise of its discretion and prejudiced the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\"><em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 430-31, 722 A.2d at 902 (citations, alterations, and internal quotations omitted). <em>See also Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 612 A.2d 258 (1992); <em>Jones v. State, </em>310 Md. 569, 530 A.2d 743 (1987), <em>judgment vacated on other grounds, </em>486 U.S. 1050, 108 S.Ct. 2815, 100 L.Ed.2d 916 (1988); <em>Reidy v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 169, 259 A.2d 66 (1969). \u201cThe permissible scope of closing argument is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court. The exercise of that discretion will not constitute reversible error unless clearly abused and prejudicial to the accused.\u201d <em>Booth v. State, </em>306 Md. 172, 210-11, 507 A.2d 1098, 1118, <em>judgment vacated in part on other grounds, </em>482 U.S. 496, 107 S.Ct. 2529, 96 L.Ed.2d 440 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Although there is no direct evidence regarding Ware\u2019s reason in going to Allen\u2019s house, the prosecutor recounted facts in evidence. Defense counsel, in his opening statement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>argued that Ware\u2019s actions on the day of the murders were consistent with innocence. The State was entitled to show, directly or circumstantially, that such was not the case. Ware\u2019s appearance at the Allen house could have been construed as circumstantial evidence supporting the theory that he went there to cover up the crime. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">\n<em>D. Exclusion of Testimony of Antonio Barnes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred when it sustained the State\u2019s objection to the testimony of Appellant\u2019s roommate, Antonio Barnes, that Appellant instructed Barnes to tell Kristi Gentry that Appellant was on his way to the Gentrys\u2019 house shortly before the murders. Appellant argues that the statement was not hearsay and was admissible as inconsistent with a premeditated intent to murder Kristi.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Antonio Barnes was called as a State\u2019s witness and testified on direct examination that he had known Ware for a couple of years and became his roommate in October, 1993. Barnes also testified on direct examination to Ware\u2019s possession of a gun and to the search of their apartment after the shootings. On cross-examination by Ware\u2019s counsel, Barnes said that around midnight on the night of December 29, 1993, he received a phone call from Kristi. Barnes agreed to tell Ware that she had called.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">When the State concluded its examination of Barnes, defense counsel informed the court that Barnes was to be recalled as a defense witness. As a courtesy to Mr. Barnes, the court permitted the defense examination of Barnes, out of turn, and in the State\u2019s case-in-chief. Barnes testified that he saw Ware at about 11:30 a.m. on December 30, 1993, when Ware returned to the apartment to change his clothing. As Ware left the apartment, he gave instructions to Barnes. The State objected when defense counsel asked Barnes to relate the instructions he had given to him. Defense counsel proffered that Barnes would testify that <em>Ware told him to tell Kristi, if she called, that he was on his way over. </em>Defense counsel argued that the State would be introducing evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>that would make Barnes\u2019 testimony relevant. The trial judge stated that, since Barnes had. been called out-of-turn and during the State\u2019s case, he did not know what the State was going to offer. The judge sustained the objection, ruling that Ware could recall Barnes as a witness later.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Trial judges have broad discretion in determining the order of presentation of evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See McCray v. State, </em>305 Md. 126, 133, 501 A.2d 856, 860 (1985) (recognizing that \u201ctrial judges have broad discretion in the conduct of trials in such areas as the reception of evidence\u201d). In sustaining the State\u2019s objection, the trial court properly exercised its discretion. The court merely excluded this evidence until a later point in the trial; defense counsel never re-offered the testimony. We perceive no abuse of this discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Appellant\u2019s sole argument before this Court is that the trial court erroneously excluded the testimony on hearsay grounds. Appellant is \"wrong in concluding that hearsay was the basis for the court\u2019s ruling. In fact, the judge never ruled that the evidence was inadmissible per se. The court merely ruled that it was irrelevant when offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The trial judge properly exercised his discretion in ruling that, when Appellant offered the evidence, it was not relevant and that Appellant could recall the witness at a later point in the trial. The discretion to vary the usual order of proof is well within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>See, e.g., McCray, </em>305 Md. at 133-34, 501 A.2d at 860; <em>State v. Hepple, </em>279 Md. 265, 270-71, 368 A.2d 445, 449 (1977). The judge had varied the order of proof in permitting the direct examination of Barnes by the defense during the State\u2019s case-in-chief. In sustaining an objection to part of the testimony, the judge properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>exercised his discretion in controlling the order of proof, thereby permissibly requiring Ware to recall the witness later in the trial if he so desired. Nothing prevented Ware\u2019s counsel from recalling the witness. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">\n<em>E. Evidence of Ware\u2019s Demeanor While Giving a Statement to the Police</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Appellant argues that the testimony of a police officer that Appellant \u201cwould ... sweat, ... tense up in his chair and ... try to push himself away from me and ... choke a little when he spoke\u201d during his interrogation was irrelevant and implied that Appellant was being untruthful when he was being questioned about the shootings. He argues a violation of due process. The State argues that the officer\u2019s testimony was nothing more than his observations of Ware during the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Officer Michael Praley testified for the State regarding the statement that Appellant made to him the on the day of the murders. In response to the prosecutor\u2019s question about Ware\u2019s demeanor, the officer responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">He was calm. But at times there was a \u2014 during my hours of interviewing him, the rhythm of questions leading to him shooting both these girls, I observed that he would \u2014 he would sweat, that he would tense up in the chair and that he would try to push himself away from me slightly and that he would choke a little as he spoke. * * * Like he would \u2014 in his voice would be a rasp and a choke and the words that he would speak.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">The officer said that he noted these observations when he questioned Ware specifically about the shooting, but that Ware was calm when he discussed matters that happened the night before the shootings.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Officer Praley testified to his observations of Ware\u2019s physical appearance and manner of speaking; he never expressed an opinion as to Ware\u2019s truthfulness. There were no accusations of lies or inconsistencies. As to Ware\u2019s demeanor, the significance was for the jury to assess. We perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>IV. Sentencing Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">\n<em>A. Evidence of Victims\u2019Families\u2019 Opposition to Death Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Appellant proffered evidence that some of the victims\u2019 family members did not wish to see a death sentence imposed because of the anxiety and uncertainty that would result from the possibility of a future successful attack upon the sentence. The trial court ruled that the evidence was not relevant and hence inadmissible. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Appellant argues that the evidence was admissible for two purposes. First, he argues that it was admissible as a potential mitigating circumstance under \u00a7 418(g)(8), the catch-all provision, and may not be restricted under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Second, he argues that it was admissible to respond to the victim impact evidence introduced by the State. His theory is that victim impact evidence may establish that a family member is plagued by grief, fear, and anxiety. Evidence that a family member opposes a death sentence is directly responsive because of its tendency to show that at least some of these emotions may be reduced in intensity or severity by a sentence of life without parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">In <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978), the United States Supreme Court held that a jury should \u201cnot be precluded from considering as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d A plurality of the Court also noted that \u201c[n]othing in this opinion limits the traditional authority of a court to exclude, as irrelevant, evidence not bearing on the defendant\u2019s character, prior record, or the circumstances of his offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605 n. 12, 98 S.Ct. 2954.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">Victim impact evidence is admissible during capital sentencing.

The Court held that \u201c[v]ictim impact evidence is simply another form or method of informing the sentencing authority about the specific harm caused by the crime in question, evidence of a type long considered by sentencing authorities.\u201d 501 U.S. at 825, 111 S.Ct. 2597. The sentencing authority, however, may not consider statements of the victim\u2019s family that amount to an opinion regarding the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the defendant. <em>See Booth v.

We cannot agree that <em>Payne </em>portends admissibility of any evidence other than that related to the victim and the impact of the victim\u2019s death on the members of the victim\u2019s family.

As used in this paragraph, \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means abduction, arson in the first degree, escape in the first degree, kidnapping, manslaughter, except involuntary manslaughter, mayhem, murder, robbery, carjacking or armed carjacking, or rape or sexual offense in the first or second degree, or an attempt to commit any of these offenses, or the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or another crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">(2) The victim was a participant in the defendant\u2019s conduct or consented to the act which caused the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">(3) The defendant acted under substantial duress, domination or provocation of another person, but not so substantial as to constitute a complete defense to the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">(4) The murder was committed while the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired as a result of mental incapacity, mental disorder or emotional disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">(5) The youthful age of the defendant at the time of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">(6) The act of the defendant was not the sole proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">(7) It is unlikely that the defendant will engage in further criminal activity that would constitute a continuing threat to society.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">(8) Any other facts which the jury or the court specifically sets forth in writing that it finds as mitigating circumstances in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Section 413(g). Appellant relies on the Section 413(g)(8) mitigator, the so-called catch-all mitigator. A Section 413(g)(8) mitigator is \u201canything relating to the defendant or to the crime which causes [the jury or any of its individual members] to believe that death may not be appropriate.\u201d <em>Harris v. State, </em>312 Md. 225, 253, 539 A.2d 637, 651 (1988) (quoting <em>Mills v.

In addition, the judge or jury, as the sentencing authority, is free to include as mitigating circumstances \u201c[a]ny other facts which the jury or the court specifically sets forth in writing that it finds as mitigating circumstances in the case.\u201d <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 734, 415 A.2d 830, 850 (1980). We reiterated this holding in <em>Calhoun, </em>pointing out that, under the Maryland statute, \u201cthe sentencing authority may articulate any factor it finds in mitigation.\u201d 297 Md. 563, 637, 468 A.2d 45, 81 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In addition to a victim impact statement included in the presentence report, a victim\u2019s family member may testify orally at sentencing. <em>See </em>\u00a7 780(a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The \u201cpermissible scope of victim impact testimony ... lies within the sound discretion of the presiding judge, as limited by Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 413(c)(1)(v).\u201d <em>Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 197, 699 A.2d 1170, 1189-90 (1997).

Opinions that Appellant should not receive a sentence of death have no bearing as to defendant\u2019s character, prior record, or the circumstances of the offense. They do not qualify as victim impact evidence or rebuttal thereto. Such evidence has no bearing on the actual harm caused by the particular crime. The testimony does not constitute mitigating evidence under the Maryland statute. Because the proffered evidence concerned the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Appellant, it was excluded properly by the trial court. We hold that the trial court did not err by excluding evidence of the victims\u2019 families opinion on the death penalty because it was not relevant, even under a loose evidentiary requirement of relevance. The trial court did not exclude evidence of a mitigating circumstance in violation of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Other jurisdictions that have considered the admissibility of such evidence have reached the same conclusion. <em>See, e.g., Robison v. Maynard, </em>943 F.2d 1216, 1217-18 (10th Cir.1991) (upholding exclusion of victim\u2019s sister\u2019s testimony that she opposed death penalty as not relevant to mitigation), <em>superseded by statute, </em>Okla.

Jury Instruction Regarding Youthful Age of the Defendant as a Mitigating Factor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Appellant argues that the jury instruction concerning the mitigating factor of the youthful age of the defendant was inadequate, in that the instruction may have left the jury with the impression that youthful age meant chronological age only. Appellant failed to request the instruction that he now requests and never objected to the instruction regarding youthful age that he now claims was error. Where there has been no timely objection to the giving of or failure to give an instruction, the issue is not preserved. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-325(e); <em>Richmond v. State, </em>330 Md. 223, 235, 623 A.2d 630, 636 (1993). The issue is waived. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-131; <em>State v. Tichnell, </em>306 Md. 428, 465-66, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>509 A.2d 1179, 1198 (1986); <em>Foster v. State, </em>305 Md. 306, 316, 503 A.2d 1326, 1331 (1986). We find no plain <em>error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Section 413(g) provides that, if the jury or court considering a death sentence finds beyond a reasonable doubt that an aggravating circumstance exists, then it must consider whether any mitigating circumstances exist. The statute sets out a non-exclusive list of possible mitigating circumstances. Section 413(g)(5) states as a statutory mitigator: \u201cThe youthful age of the defendant at the time of the crime.\u201d In explaining the sentencing form to the jury, the judge said: \u201cFor the purposes of the sentencing procedure, a mitigating circumstance is anything about the Defendant or the facts of this case that, in fairness or in mercy, may make the death sentence an inappropriate penalty for the defendant.\u201d The court identified the mitigating circumstances for the jury, and in regard to youthful age, stated: \u201cFive, the youthful age of the Defendant at the time of the crime.\u201d At the conclusion of the jury instructions, both sides told the court, at the bench, that there were no objections to the instructions as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Appellant, who was 22 years old at the time of the murders, argues that the youthful age mitigator in Maryland includes many factors other than chronological age, <em>see, e.g., Johnson v. State, </em>348 Md. 337, 353-54, 703 A.2d 1267, 1275 (1998), and that, without an explicit instruction regarding these other factors, the jury would likely assume that \u201cage\u201d means chronological age only. Appellant introduced the videotaped deposition of expert Laurie James Monroe as evidence of his background and upbringing. He argues that, if given a more detailed instruction, the jury could have considered this evidence, as well as Appellant\u2019s lack of experience with the criminal justice system and his \u201cpoor anger control evidencing immaturity,\u201d when deciding whether the mitigating circumstance of youthful age existed. Finally, Appellant argues that, despite the lack of objection, the sentence should be reversed because the instruction as given was plain error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>It is well settled in Maryland that youthful age as used in this statute includes considerations other than mere chronological age, <em>see Johnson, </em>348 Md. at 353-54, 703 A.2d at 1275; <em>Lovell v. State, </em>347 Md. 623, 659-60, 702 A.2d 261, 279 (1997), but instructions on mitigating circumstances for purposes of capital sentencing proceedings are not excepted from the general rule that a party must request a specific instruction before a court is required to give it. Appellant does not contend that the instruction as given contained any misstatement, but only that the instruction \u201cprovided the jury with no guidance in assessing the existence <em>vel non </em>\u201d of the youthful age mitigator. \u201cThe constitutional standard for reviewing an allegedly ambiguous jury instruction is \u201cwhether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Booth v. State, </em>327 Md. 142, 162, 608 A.2d 162, 171 (1992) (quoting <em>Boyde v. California, </em>494 U.S. 370, 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">It is clear from a review of the closing arguments of the State and Appellant that the jury was not misled into believing that the statutory mitigator of youthful age was limited to chronological age only. The State, in closing, conceded that the defendant\u2019s age of twenty-two \u201cis not extremely old or very old in terms of chronological age.\u201d The prosecutor then went on to argue the maturity of Ware, his actions in the military and service in Desert Storm, and the cold and calculating nature of the crime as evidence of maturity. In response, as to youthful age, defense counsel argued the immaturity of Appellant and that he was \u201cacting out of youth, out of the impetuousness of youth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">A court\u2019s obligation to give any particular instruction in a criminal case is governed by Maryland Rule 4-325. Rule 4-325(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">The court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding. The court may give its instructions orally or, with the consent of the parties, in writing instead of orally. The court need not grant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Rule 4-325(e) deals with objection and the right to assign error in connection with jury instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">No party may assign as error the giving or failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the jury. An appellate court, on its own initiative or on the suggestion of a party, may however take cognizance of any plain error in the instructions, material to the rights of the defendant, despite a failure to object.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">We have long interpreted these rules and their predecessors to mean that a court does not err when it omits an instruction or, in this case, further amplification, that was never requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The Supreme Court has established, in capital, sentencing proceedings, \u201cthat the senteneer may not be precluded from considering, and may not refuse to consider, any constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence, and that the State may structure the jury\u2019s consideration of mitigation so long as it does not preclude the jury from giving effect to it.\u201d <em>Weeks v.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\"><em>Angelone, </em>528 U.S. 225,-, 120 S.Ct. 727, 732, 145 L.Ed.2d 727, 68 U.S.L.W. 4060 (2000). In Ware\u2019s case, the jury was explicitly instructed to consider youthful age as a mitigating factor. The instruction given by the trial court was a correct statement of the law, and the jury did not ask for any supplemental instruction as to the meaning of youthful age.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the instruction in a way that prevented the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence of the statutory factor of youthful age. <em>See Buchanan v. Angelone, </em>522 U.S. 269, 276, 118 S.Ct. 757, 139 L.Ed.2d 702 (1998); <em>Mills v. Maryland, </em>486 U.S. 367, 108 S.Ct. 1860, 100 L.Ed.2d 384 (1988). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">\n<em>C. Jury Sentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in failing to take remedial action when Appellant elected to be sentenced by the jury despite his counsel\u2019s strong recommendation that he be sentenced by the court. Just before the sentencing hearing began, defense counsel told the court that counsel and Appellant disagreed as to the choice of the sentencing authority. Appellant argues that, under the circumstances, the court was obliged, <em>sua sponte, </em>to make an adequate inquiry of Appellant to ascertain that he was competent to make the decision to be sentenced by a jury, one that was against his counsel\u2019s recommendation. He also argues that, because he elected to be sentenced by a jury, against the advice of his counsel, and because he disagreed with his counsel about the advisability of being sentenced by the jury, the court should have conducted a hearing to determine whether counsel could continue to represent him. At a minimum, Appellant argues, the court should have granted him a postponement to allow his counsel to prepare for a jury sentencing. It is the State\u2019s position that the record demonstrates clearly Ware\u2019s competency, despite the strategic dispute with his attorneys, and that there was no need for the court to take any further action with respect to Ware\u2019s competency to elect the mode of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>On the day the sentencing proceeding began, Appellant was questioned by his counsel regarding his election to be sentenced by the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">[DEF.

The court denied the request for postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">Criminal defendants have a Fourteenth Amendment due process right not to be tried when they are incompetent. <em>See Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 77, 84, 622 A.2d 727, 730 (1993). In <em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 171, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975), Chief Justice Burger, writing for the Court, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-11\">It has long been accepted that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">Implementing the Supreme Court standard, Maryland Code (1982, 1994 Repl.Vol., 1999 Supp.) \u00a7 12-103(a) of the Health-General Article specifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-13\">If, before or during a trial, the defendant in a criminal case appears to the court to be incompetent to stand trial or the defendant alleges incompetence to stand trial, the court shall determine, on evidence presented on the record, whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-14\">The Code defines \u201cincompetent to stand trial\u201d as \u201cnot able: (1) [t]o understand the nature or object of the proceeding; or (2) [t]o assist in one\u2019s defense.\u201d <em>Id,., </em>\u00a7 12-101(e). As we noted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number><em>Thanos, </em>\u201c[a] defendant must, in other words, have \u2018present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and ... a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thanos, </em>330 Md. at 85, 622 A.2d at 730 (quoting <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">A defendant is presumed to be competent to stand trial. <em>See e.g. Colbert v. State, </em>18 McLApp. 632, 641, 308 A.2d 726, 731 (1973). However, \u00a7 12-103(a) of the Health-General Article places a duty on the trial court if, during trial, a defendant appears to the court to be incompetent or the defendant alleges incompetency to determine whether the defendant is in fact competent to stand trial. The court\u2019s duty is triggered in one of three ways: (1) upon motion of the accused; (2) upon motion of the defense counsel; or (3) upon a <em>sua sponte </em>determination by the court that the defendant may not be competent to stand trial. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>67 Md.App. 347, 358-59, 507 A.2d 1134, 1140 (1986). In addition, we have held that \u201ca finding of competency to stand trial does not automatically result in a conclusion that an accused is also competent to waive substantial rights, such as the right to plead not guilty, the right to a jury trial, and the right to assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Mann v. State\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County, </em>298 Md. 160, 169, 468 A.2d 124, 129 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Under \u00a7 413(b), sentencing shall be by jury and, if waived, before the court alone.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See Bruce v. State, </em>328 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>594, 602, 616 A.2d 392, 396 (1992). Whether a defendant is to be sentenced by the court or the jury is a decision for the defendant. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-246; <em>Gilliam v. State, </em>331 Md. 651, 670, 629 A.2d 685, 694 (1993); <em>Bruce, </em>328 Md. at 602-07, 616 A.2d at 396-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Ware argues that the absence of a record demonstrating a competent basis for his eleventh hour decision to elect a jury sentencing despite his attorneys advice to the contrary obligated the court to conduct, <em>sua sponte, </em>a competency examination. Ware\u2019s entire argument appears to be that the court must inquire, <em>sua sponte, </em>into the competency of a defendant; based solely on a defendant\u2019s election to be sentenced by a jury, when the choice is contrary to the recommendation of his counsel. His argument is meritless. Where there is no independent reason to question or doubt defendant\u2019s competency, no hearing or inquiry is required. <em>Cf. State v. Cowans, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 68, 717 N.E.2d 298, 311 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">We had occasion to discuss the trial court\u2019s obligation to inquire, <em>sua sponte, </em>into a defendant\u2019s competency in <em>Thanos. </em>Thanos was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Over the objection of his counsel, he waived a jury on the guilt/innocence stage and the sentencing. <em>See Thanos, </em>330 Md. at 84, 622 A.2d at 730. On appeal, as to his competency to waive a jury, he argued that he was not competent to make the decision to waive a jury trial and that the court should have deferred to his attorney\u2019s preference for a jury trial. His back up argument was that, even if the choice to waive a jury trial and jury sentencing were his to make, he did not do so knowingly, voluntarily, or intelligently. Thanos also argued that the \u201ctrial court failed to recognize its <em>sua sponte </em>obligation to inquire into his competency given his strange behavior at trial and sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85, 622 A.2d at 730. We found no error on the trial court\u2019s failure to conduct a compe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>tency hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 87, 622 A.2d at 731. The record disclosed that Thanos had the present ability to consult with his counsel with a reasonable degree of rational understanding as well as a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings against him. We also rejected his claims related to jury trial and sentencing waiver, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">We find no merit in these contentions. Thanos has made no claim that the trial court erred in explaining his right to be tried and sentenced by a jury. In both cases, the trial judge patiently spelled out to Thanos the alternatives and consequences involved in proceeding before a judge rather than a jury. As we noted in <em>Treece, </em>a decision need not be wise to be legally \u201cintelligent.\u201d All that matters is that Thanos was \u201cmade aware of available alternatives and of the advantages and disadvantages of one choice as compared to another.\u201d Because Thanos was so informed, his arguments that he did not knowingly waive trial and sentencing by jury, and that the court should have deferred to his counsel\u2019s position on the issue of jury trial waiver, are merely extensions of his claims that he was incompetent to stand trial, which is devoid of merit for the reasons discussed in part II, <em>supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 94, 622 A.2d at 735 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">As in <em>Thanos, </em>Ware\u2019s competency to be sentenced by a jury was never raised before the trial court or even during the trial. It is noteworthy that, when questioned by the court, defense counsel explicitly stated that he was <em>not </em>suggesting that Appellant was incompetent. The record shows that defense counsel and the trial judge engaged Appellant in a colloquy concerning his election of a jury sentencing, the nature of the decision, Appellant\u2019s mental treatment/medical history, his knowledge of the procedure based on <em>Ware I, </em>and the absence of any influence of alcohol or drugs. Appellant\u2019s mere preference for a jury sentencing is hardly an indication that he was incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">We hold that the trial court did not err in failing to conduct, <em>sua sponte, </em>a competency examination. There is nothing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>the record to indicate that Appellant lacked the present ability to consult with his attorneys with a reasonable degree of rational understanding or factual understanding of the proceedings. Appellant\u2019s decision to proceed with jury sentencing in light of defense counsel\u2019s recommendation to the contrary is insufficient in and of itself to trigger a competency examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Appellant next argues that, when the trial court learned of Ware\u2019s sudden shift in sentencing strategy and defense counsel\u2019s self-professed unpreparedness, the trial court was required to conduct a hearing to determine whether counsel could effectively represent Appellant during the sentencing phase and whether this so-called conflict necessitated the withdrawal of counsel. Appellant concludes that it was highly doubtful that Appellant could receive effective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase. Again, we point out that at no time before the trial court did defense counsel ask to withdraw from representing Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">If Appellant is raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, it is more properly raised in post-conviction proceedings. <em>See Perry v. State, </em>344 Md. 204, 227-28, 686 A.2d 274, 285 (1996). Regarding Appellant\u2019s claim that the trial court should have inquired into Ware\u2019s relationship with his counsel, based on the record before us, we believe that it would have been highly inappropriate for the trial court to have interfered with that relationship at that stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Appellant argues that the trial judge\u2019s refusal to postpone the sentencing to allow counsel additional time to prepare was an abuse of discretion requiring reversal. It is settled that the decision whether to grant a postponement is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>See, e.g., Wilson v. State, </em>345 Md. 437, 451, 693 A.2d 344, 351 (1997); <em>Evans v. State, </em>304 Md. 487, 514, 499 A.2d 1261, 1275 (1985). Defense counsel had at least eighteen months to prepare for sentencing; he told the court as much. Appellant never specified, at trial or on appeal, how his sentencing case might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>have been presented differently if he had had more time. We find no abuse of discretion in denying the postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">\n<em>D. Denial of Motion to Preclude Death Penalty Proceeding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to preclude the State from seeking the death penalty based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct that resulted in the reversal of his conviction in <em>Ware </em>7.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Appellant filed two pretrial motions addressed to the capital sentencing proceeding: a motion to dismiss the death notice due to prosecutorial misconduct and a motion to bar subsequent prosecution of the case. Both motions were based entirely on the alleged misconduct of the prosecutor before and during Ware\u2019s first trial as it relates to Edward Anderson and any State\u2019s promise of leniency for his testimony. The trial judge denied the motions, ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">As to the motions, the three motions that [defense counsel] argued, the first was the motion to dismiss the death notice due to prosecutorial misconduct, the court denies. As to the motion to bar subsequent prosecution because of prosecutorial misconduct, the court denies. And as to the motion to preclude the testimony of prospective witness Anderson, the court denies that.[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] All of those motions were predicated on prosecutorial misconduct, and if there is to be any sanctions along the lines that the defense is urging, it will have to come from the Appellate Courts, not from this court. So for those reasons, the court denies these motions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQN\">Appellant\u2019s argument is two-fold before this Court. He argues that fundamental fairness requires that the State be precluded from again seeking the death penalty. He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>argues that Maryland\u2019s common law of double jeopardy bars the State from seeking the death penalty. The essence of his argument is that a genuine sanction for serious prosecutorial overreaching is necessary, beyond that of a reversal of the conviction and new trial, to create strong incentive for prosecutors to \u201cplay by the rules.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Both arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> protects against successive prosecution as well as cumulative punishment and is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See State v. Griffiths, </em>338 Md. 485, 489, 659 A.2d 876, 878 (1995); <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 166, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977); <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 793, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969). Even though the Maryland Constitution has no express double jeopardy provision, there is protection against it under Maryland common law. <em>See Gianiny v. State, </em>320 Md. 337, 347, 577 A.2d 795, 799 (1990); <em>Pugh v. State, </em>271 Md. 701, 705, 319 A.2d 542, 544 (1974); <em>State v. Barger, </em>242 Md. 616, 619, 220 A.2d 304, 306 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The aspect of double jeopardy law that we are concerned with in this case is retrial following reversal upon a defendant\u2019s successful appeal.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> A retrial following a reversal has always been permitted, <em>see e.g., Lockhart v. Nelson, </em>488 U.S. 33, 38, 109 S.Ct. 285, 102 L.Ed.2d 265 (1988); <em>Ball v. United States, </em>163 U.S. 662, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 41 L.Ed. 300 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>(1896), with the exception of a reversal based upon the insufficiency of the evidence. <em>See United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 130, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980); <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 11, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978); <em>Mackall v. State, </em>283 Md. 100, 113, 387 A.2d 762, 769 (1978); <em>Fields v. State, </em>96 Md.App. 722, 744, 626 A.2d 1037, 1048 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Appellant looks to the mistrial/retrial species of double jeopardy as support for his argument that retrial should be barred as a sanction for prosecutorial misconduct. He seeks not only an application of the principles of <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982), but an extension of the principles articulated in that case. <em>Kennedy </em>dealt only with the species of federal double jeopardy where a mistrial is declared at the request of the defendant. In the mistrial/retrial situation, the general rule is that the protection against double jeopardy is waived when a defense-requested mistrial is granted, <em>see United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 93, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978), and <em>Cornish v. State, </em>272 Md. 312, 318, 322 A.2d 880, 884 (1974), unless, under the very narrow exception set out in <em>Kennedy, </em>the mistrial motion was precipitated by judicial overreaching or deliberate prosecutorial misconduct intended to provoke or goad the defendant into making the motion. In <em>Kennedy, </em>the Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">the circumstances under which such a defendant may invoke the bar of double jeopardy in a second effort to try him are limited to those cases in which the conduct giving rise to the successful motion for a mistrial was intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">456 U.S. at 679,102 S.Ct. 2083.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The Court was careful to point out that retrial following reversal on appeal \u2014 the situation presented in the instant case \u2014 is governed by a different principle. \u201cThis Court has consistently held that the Double Jeopardy Clause imposes no limitation upon the power of the government to retry a defendant who has succeeded in persuading a court to set his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>conviction aside, unless the conviction has been reversed because of the insufficiency of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676 n. 6,102 S.Ct. 2088. <em>Kennedy </em>provides no support for the proposition that barring capital re-prosecution is an appropriate response to the State\u2019s failure to disclose exculpatory evidence in violation of its obligation under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Appellant has not identified any case where the United States Supreme Court has extended <em>Kennedy </em>to situations where convictions have been reversed on appeal due to prosecutorial misconduct and the retrial has been barred by double jeopardy. The short answer is that the standard announced in <em>Kennedy </em>has nothing to do with this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Appellant concedes that his capital re-sentencing proceeding was not barred by the Double Jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution. No motion for mistrial based on prosecu-torial misconduct was ever made, nor was a mistrial declared. Instead, Appellant was convicted and sentenced to death, followed by a reversal on appeal. He is asking this Court \u201cto mold Maryland\u2019s law of double jeopardy under common law principles [to hold that] ... where as here the State violates the rules in a manner potentially leading to the execution of a human being, the appropriate sanction is to preclude the possibility that the accused will be put to death as a result of subsequent proceedings in the same case.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 65. Thus, we must decide whether Maryland common law double jeopardy principles bar a capital re-sentencing proceeding when the defendant never asked for a mistrial on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Appellant urges this Court to adopt, as a matter of common law, a stricter approach to double jeopardy than that taken in <em>Kennedy, </em>in order to sanction prosecutorial misconduct, at least in death penalty cases. To punish a prosecutor for creating grounds for reversal by violating the precepts of <em>Brady, </em>however, is not among the purposes of double jeopardy protection. \u201c[T]o require a criminal defendant to stand trial again after he has successfully invoked a statutory right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>appeal to upset his first conviction is not an act of governmental oppression of the sort against which the Double Jeopardy Clause was intended to protect.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 91, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978). As we stated in <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>297 Md. 432, 440-41, 468 A.2d 1, 5 (1983):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adi\">[Judicial misconduct] is significant for purposes of double jeopardy when a mistrial is declared at the behest of the defendant____ When a defendant\u2019s trial is completed and his conviction later reversed on appeal, different rules pertain. With some exceptions, the defendant who successfully challenges his conviction may be retried, under the rationale that \u201cthe defendant wiped the slate clean and the parties may start anew.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>288 Md. 618, 625, 420 A.2d 1241, 1244 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1115, 101 S.Ct. 928, 66 L.Ed.2d 845 (1981).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-7\"><em>Cf. Booth v. State, </em>301 Md. 1, 481 A.2d 505 (1984) (holding that pretrial prosecutorial misconduct does not result in double jeopardy bar unless intentionally calculated to result in mistrial); <em>Bell v. State, </em>286 Md. 193, 205-06, 406 A.2d 909, 915-16 (1979) (holding that, even when prosecutorial misconduct results in mistrial, double jeopardy does not bar retrial unless misconduct committed intentionally to force mistrial).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Although we do not condone the actions of the prosecutor in <em>Ware I, </em>we believe that Appellant was accorded the relief to which he was entitled \u2014 reversal of his conviction on appeal. Under the circumstances presented herein, Maryland common law principles of double jeopardy do not bar the State from seeking the death penalty at re-sentencing. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to preclude re-prosecution of the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">A <em>Brady </em>violation has been treated consistently as a \u201cviolation of an accused\u2019s due process right to a fair trial where the failure undermined confidence in the trial\u2019s outcome.\u201d <em>Ex Parte Mitchell, </em>977 S.W.2d 575, 578 (Tex.Ct.Crim. App.1997). The remedy for a <em>Brady </em>/due process violation is the reversal of the judgment of conviction and remand of the case for further proceedings, including retrial. <em>See Kyles v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number><em>Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995); <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985); <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. We see no sound reason to impart a different standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Other state courts similarly have declined to extend state law so as to bar, on double jeopardy grounds, retrials following reversals based on prosecutorial misconduct. <em>See e.g. Fugitt v. State, </em>253 Ga. 311, 319 S.E.2d 829, 833-34 (1984); <em>State v. Chase, </em>335 N.W.2d 630, 632 (Iowa 1983); <em>State v. Swartz, </em>541 N.W.2d 533, 540-41 (Iowa Ct.App.1995); <em>State v. Sage, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 173, 510 N.E.2d 343, 353-54 (1987); <em>Ex parte Mitchell, </em>977 S.W.2d at 580-81. The same is true for some federal courts. <em>See e.g. Beringer v. Sheahan, </em>934 F.2d 110, 114 (7th Cir.1991) (holding that a \u201cdefendant who did not move for a mistrial on the basis of intentional prosecutorial misconduct cannot invoke the double jeopardy clause to bar the state from retrying him after his conviction is reversed on that ground\u201d). <em>But see United States v. Wallach, </em>979 F.2d 912, 916 (2d Cir.1992) (holding that double jeopardy bars retrial after reversal of conviction where there has been intentional prosecutorial misconduct \u201cundertaken, not simply to prevent an acquittal, but to prevent an acquittal that the prosecutor believed at the time was likely to occur in the absence of his misconduct\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">\n<em>E. The Constitutionality of Maryland\u2019s Death Penalty Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Appellant argues that Maryland\u2019s death penalty statute is unconstitutional. Specifically, he argues that the statute is unconstitutional because the statute (a) requires the defendant to prove mitigating circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence; (b) requires the defendant to establish that non-enumerated mitigating circumstances are mitigating circumstances; and (c) requires a sentence of death where aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances by only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>a preponderance of the evidence. We have addressed these claims over the years and have rejected them. <em>See Conyers v. State (Conyers </em>II), 354 Md. 132, 198-99, 729 A.2d 910, 945 (1999); <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>324 Md. 551, 582-83, 597 A.2d 1359, 1374 (1991) (finding no merit in challenges to defendant\u2019s burden regarding statutorily recognized and other mitigating factors or to burden of proof). Appellant presents no arguments that persuade us to reconsider those earlier decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">\n<em>F.

State, </em>330 Md. 77, 97, 622 A.2d 727, 737 (1993). We make the following determinations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">(1) The sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">(2) The evidence supports the jury\u2019s findings of a statutory aggravating circumstance under \u00a7 413(d); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">(3) The evidence supports the jury\u2019s findings that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">BELL, C.J., dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-14\">.

Anderson was permitted to testify in front of the jury, the trier of fact, that certain law enforcement officers, <em>ie., </em>a prosecutor with the Anne Arundel County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office and a police detective, testified at his sentence reduction hearing that \u201c[he] was being truthful in bringing them this information [about] the petitioner\u2019s involvement in the murders with which he was charged.\u201d The petitioner challenged Anderson\u2019s credibility by attempting to prove that the motivation for his testimony was leniency. Thus, the petitioner\u2019s cross examination of Anderson concerned Anderson filing a motion for modification of sentence prior to the petitioner\u2019s first trial, his bringing to the attention of the sentencing judge that he was a State\u2019s witness in the petitioner\u2019s trial, and the fact that a prosecutor and a police detective involved in the investigation of the murder with which the petitioner was charged were called to testify at Anderson\u2019s modification hearing. Consequently, Anderson\u2019s testimony in this regard was designed to, and did, bolster his credibility for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Having determined that Anderson\u2019s testimony concerning the prosecutor and the police detective was inadmissible and, thus, that its admission was error, the majority then holds that the error was harmless. It reasons that the distinction it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>drawn reduces the prejudicial impact of the evidence. 360 Md. at 679, 759 A.2d at 779. Then it asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">\u201cAnderson made a self-serving statement to the effect that certain persons not present once affirmed, on an unknown basis, his truthfulness in making the statements he again made at trial. Such a statement, by a witness whose credibility is in question, is far less weighty than the expert in <em>Bohnert, </em>and its effect on the jury was likely to be insignificant. Moreover, it is implicit that the police believed Anderson or they would not have gone to bat for him at the hearing on his motion to reduce his sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Id. at 679, 759 A.2d at 779. I do not agree and, so, dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Once again, I find myself engaged in what sometimes seems like a never-ending battle to protect the integrity and vitality of the harmless error rule. See my dissenting opinions in <em>Jensen v. State, </em>355 Md. 692, 718, 736 A.2d 307, 320 (Md.1999); <em>Evans v. State, </em>333 Md. 660, 711, 637 A.2d 117, 136 (1994); <em>Bruno v. State, </em>332 Md. 673, 696, 632 A.2d 1192, 1204 (1993); <em>Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 591, 602 A.2d 677, 696 (1992). This is so despite the clarity of the statement of the rule in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976), and the frequency with which it has been repeated with approval and thus reaffirmed, since. But as this case and those that precede it, to some of which I have just referred, demonstrate, to state the rule accurately is not necessarily to apply it appropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">The test of harmless error focuses on the effect of erroneously admitted, or excluded, evidence on the verdict rendered by the jury. As enunciated in <em>Dorsey, </em>the rule is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">\u201cWhen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>plained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678 (footnote omitted). Once it has been determined that error was committed, reversal is required unless the error did not influence the verdict; the error is harmless only if it did not play any role in the jury\u2019s verdict. The reviewing court must exclude that possibility \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Moreover, an appellate court reviewing a trial court verdict must apply the harmless error rule consistently with its role; it should not take on the role of the trier of fact and substitute its judgment for that of the jury or the trial court whose verdict is under review. That would be to usurp the function of the trier of fact and that is not allowed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Daniels v.

In this regard, what I said in dissent in <em>Rubin </em>has relevance here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">\u201cNo matter how strong a case for conviction the State may present, even when the defense presents no evidence, the court may not direct a verdict for the State. See Maryland Rule 4-324, which, while providing that a defendant may move for judgment of acquittal, Rule 4-324(a), and the court may direct the entry of judgment in his or her favor if there is insufficient evidence, as a matter of law, Rule 4-324(b), makes no provision for the making of a motion for judgment by the State. Compare Maryland Rule 2-519, the civil counterpart. <em>Lyles v. State {State v. Lyles}, </em>308 Md. 129, 135, 517 A.2d 761, 764 (1986). This is so because it is the trier of fact, whether the court or a jury, that must determine if the State has met its burden of proof. To make that determination, the trier of fact is required to find the facts and when, as is usually the case, there are credibility issues, to resolve them. That, in turn, involves weighing the evidence. Appellate courts do not find facts or weigh evidence, \u2018what evidence to believe, what weight to be. given it, and what facts flow from that evidence are for the jury ... to determine.\u2019 <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 224, 571 A.2d 1251, 1260-[6]1 (1990). <em>See Gore v. State, </em>309 Md. 203, 214, 522 A.2d 1338, 1341 (1987); <em>Wilson v.

Even when an appellate court assesses the sufficiency of the evidence, it does not weigh it, <em>see Clemson v. Butler Aviation-Friendship, </em>266 Md. 666, 671, 296 A.2d 419, 422 (1972); <em>Gray v. Director, Patuxent Institution, </em>245 Md. 80, 84, 224 A.2d 879, 881 (1966), it only determines if any evidence exists, on the basis of which a rational trier of fact could find the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number><em>Jackson v. </em>Virginia,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2788, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573 (1979); <em>Bloodsworth v. State, </em>307 Md. 164, 167, 512 A.2d 1056, 1057 (1986). There is no reason that a harmless error analysis should permit it to do more.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4F\">325 Md. at 596-97, 602 A.2d at 698-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Citing <em>Dorsey, </em>the majority declares itself \u201csatisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of ... may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.\u201d 276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678. Although mouthing the proper test, its rationale for so concluding belies its proper application. To the majority, it is significant and, indeed obvious, that Anderson\u2019s testimony, because Anderson\u2019s credibility is in issue, was \u201cfar less weighty\u201d when compared with the expert testimony in <em>Bohnert </em>and, more important, \u201cits effect on the jury was likely to be insignificant.\u201d In so concluding, rather than determining whether the evidence likely, or could have, influenced the jury verdict, the majority places itself in the shoes of the jury and, in that posture, determines the weight that it would give the evidence, attributing that weight to the jury that decided the case. Thus, rather than apply the <em>Dorsey </em>test, it applies the test as explained in <em>Ross v. State, </em>276 Md. 664, 674, 350 A.2d 680, 686-87 (1976). In so doing, the majority expands the harmless error rule in a manner that is both unwarranted and unsupportable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">As I explained in <em>Rubin,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">\u201cThe essence of this test is the determination whether the cumulative effect of the properly admitted evidence so out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>weighs the prejudicial nature of the evidence erroneously admitted that there is no reasonable possibility that the decision of the finder of fact would have been different had the tainted evidence been excluded (quoting <em>Ross, </em>276 Md. at 674, 350 A.2d at 686-87).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">\u201cThus excising the evidence admitted in error, and focusing on what remains, it concludes that a reasonable doubt simply could not have been generated from that evidence. Under that formulation, the test for harmless error is: whether, excluding the offending evidence, that which remains is sufficient to sustain the conviction and/or is, in fact, such that the case for conviction is \u201coverwhelming.\u201d It requires, in addition to the threshold determination of sufficiency, that an appellant court weigh the evidence. So, the majority reasons, where the evidence is sufficient to convict and it is also strong enough to meet its definition of \u201coverwhelming,\u201d only one verdict, guilty, is possible, as a matter of law; hence, that evidence cannot generate a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-6\">\u201cAlthough the <em>Ross </em>formulation of the test has been stated in subsequent cases, <em>see Trusty v. State, </em>308 Md. 658, 668-69, 521 A.2d 749, 754 (1987), and even applied, <em>see Mills v. State, </em>310 Md. 33, 48-49, 527 A.2d 3, 10 (1987) (dicta), I have found no case which has provided a reasoned justification for it. It is significant, I think, that the error in <em>Ross </em>was held not to be harmless and that a factor influencing that holding was that the case was tried by a jury. 276 Md. at 674, 350 A.2d at 686-87. <em>See also State v. Fuller, </em>308 Md. 547, 554, 520 A.2d 1315, 1318 (1987) (where trier of fact considered erroneously submitted evidence, case remanded to determine if, without that evidence trier of fact would reach same conclusion). In any event, that approach, in my opinion, is contrary to the role of an appellant court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a2z-dedup-0\"><em>Rubin, </em>325 Md. at 595-96, 602 A.2d at 698 (Bell, J. dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Furthermore, applying the harmless error rule as the majority does fails to recognize that the harmless error inquiry is not simply a sufficiency of the evidence inquiry, although when the exclusion of the evidence erroneously admitted results in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>an insufficiency of the evidence to convict, the error can never be harmless. To be sure, such an inquiry is required to be made whenever there is a reversal of a conviction on appeal, its function is to determine if a new trial is required, not, except as indicated above, to determine if the error is sufficiently egregious to warrant reversal of the conviction. Moreover, because it is the trier of fact, in this case, the jury, and not an appellate court, that must find the facts and resolve credibility issues,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">\u201cwhat appears, on the cold record, to be an insurmountable case for the State, when viewed from the jury\u2019s perspective, having seen it unfold through live witnesses, in the dramatic atmosphere of the courtroom may be quite a close case or result in a defense verdict. How, or why, a jury may decide to resolve credibility or fact issues in a particular manner is a matter only it knows. One thing is certain, the jury is under no obligation to decide any case consistently with what is, objectively, the strongest case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-6\"><em>Rubin, </em>325 Md. at 593, 602 A.2d at 697 (Bell, J. dissenting). Furthermore, harmless error is the exception to the general rule; it was never intended to be the general rule. In that regard, we have said that the test of harmless error \u201chas been and should be carefully circumscribed.\u201d <em>Younie v. State, </em>272 Md. 233, 248, 322 A.2d 211, 219 (1974). And the continuing validity of the majority\u2019s harmless error analysis makes what was said in <em>People v. Jablonski, </em>38 Mich.App. 33, 195 N.W.2d 777, 780 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">\u201cContinued expansion of the harmless error rule will merely encourage prosecutors to get such testimony in, since they know that, they have a strong case, such testimony will not be considered to be reversible error, yet if they have a weak case, they will use such testimony to buttress the case to gain a conviction and then hope that the issue is not raised on appeal,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">more significant and a matter of concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">Acceptance of the distinction the majority draws between <em>Bohnert </em>and the instant case does not warrant a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>result with regard to the harmless error analysis. It may well be that the quality of the testimony of a witness seeking to buttress his own credibility is less than that of a witness deemed to be independent, testifying as an expert. I might also agree that the effect of the latter on the jury might be greater. Neither of these propositions answers the issue in this case, however. There can be a disparity in the quality of the testimony and in impact and yet the testimony of both could, and, I submit, probably would, affect the jury\u2019s verdict. Who knows what factors guide the resolution of credibility issues by individual jurors? That respected members of the law enforcement community attest to the witness\u2019 truthfulness likely will be viewed by the jury as important and worthy of credit. The source of the testimony, i.e., Anderson, may well be, or, in this case, could have been considered by the jury to be, less important than the fact that was the substance of that testimony, i.e., a prosecutor and a police detective believed what Anderson had to say about the petitioner\u2019s involvement in the crime with which the petitioner was charged.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-14\">. <em>Bohnert </em>v. <em>State, </em>312 Md. 266, 278, 539 A.2d 657, 663 (1988) makes clear \"that a witness, expert or otherwise, may not give an opinion on whether he believes a witness is telling the truth. Testimony from a witness relating to the credibility of another witness is to be rejected as a matter of law.\u201d We also said in <em>Bohnert, </em>\"[i]t is . . . error for the court to permit to go to the jury a statement, belief, or opinion of another person to the effect that a witness is telling the truth or lying.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277, 539 A.2d at 662.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b744-6\">.
