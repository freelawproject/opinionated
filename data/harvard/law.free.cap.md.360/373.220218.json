Childress, Respondent, for violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The petition alleged that Respondent violated Maryland Rule 8.4(d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by engaging \u201cin conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d Bar Counsel recommends that the Respondent\u2019s license to practice law be suspended for one year with his readmission conditioned upon the payment of the costs of these proceedings, continued psychiatric treatment, and quarterly reports from the treating psychiatrist to Bar counsel for two years following the termination of his suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-709(b), we referred the matter to Judge G.R. Hovey Johnson of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to make findings of fact and proposed conclusions of law. Following an evidentiary hearing, Judge Johnson found that Respondent had violated Rule 8.4(d). Respondent filed exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">We glean the following findings of facts and proposed conclusions of law from the report of the hearing judge. Respondent, James F. Childress, is a graduate of Princeton University. He graduated from the University of Georgia Law School in 1989. He was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 1989, and to the District of Columbia Bar. In 1992 Childress was employed by the United States Department of Commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>as a patent and trademark attorney. He continued in this capacity until April, 1996, when he was laid off for the conduct underlying this proceeding. At the time of the alleged misconduct, Respondent resided in Arlington, Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">On April 14, 1995, Respondent was arrested in Bethesda, Maryland, at Montgomery Mall, and subsequently charged by a federal grand jury with one count of interstate travel with intent to engage in a sexual act with a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b) (1994). In October, 1995, following a jury trial in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Respondent was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five months, five months home detention, a period of supervised release and a $5,000 fine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result of his conviction, on March 12, 1996, Respondent was suspended from the practice of law in the District of Columbia. <em>See In the Matter of James F. Childress, Esquire, </em>No. 96-BG-159 (D.C. Mar. 12, 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Respondent appealed his conviction to the United. States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. He contended that at the time he was indicted, tried and convicted, the conduct in which he admittedly engaged was not a crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b). <em>See United States v. Childress, </em>104 F.3d 47, 49 (4th Cir.1996). In December, 1996, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the judgment of conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The statute under which Respondent was convicted, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b), defined the term \u201csexual act\u201d through an apparently mistaken cross-reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2245 (1994). That section refers to sexually abusive \u201cconduct that results in the <em>death of a person.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The Fourth Circuit considered the argument that Congress had meant to cross-reference a different section that defined \u201csex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>ual act\u201d more broadly.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Childress, </em>104 F.3d at 53. The court determined, however, that the statute, as written at the time of Respondent\u2019s offense, did not prohibit his conduct and accordingly, reversed the judgment of conviction. <em>See id. </em>Respondent requested reinstatement, and the D.C. Bar Counsel took no exception. As a result, on January 30, 1997, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ordered that Respondent be reinstated to practice law in that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Maryland Bar Counsel initiated disciplinary proceedings stemming from Respondent\u2019s conduct during the years 1993 through 1995. During that time Respondent used his home computer to communicate with individuals he believed to be young girls via \u201cchat rooms\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> located on America Online. The girls Respondent targeted were generally between the ages of thirteen and sixteen years old. During some of these conversations, Respondent would ask whether the person was interested in meeting and having sex. For the purpose of convincing the girls to meet him, Respondent would frequently represent that he was younger than his actual age, stating that he was twenty-four years old rather than his actual age of thirty-two. He was able to persuade five young girls to meet with him. These meetings would generally occur in a public place in the Washington D.C. area. On one occasion, Respondent met two girls at the Village Center in Columbia, Maryland. The three drove around in Respondent\u2019s car. Respondent also met with a thirteen-year-old girl on three separate occasions in the Manassas, Virginia area. The two drove around and talked. During the meetings with the girls, no sexual contact ever took place and Respondent did not engage in any conversations of a sexual nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">On April 12, 1995 Respondent signed onto America Online and entered the chat room \u201cX Little Girl Gift,\u201d using the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>screen name \u201cSylliboy.\u201d Once in the chat room, he began chatting with \u201cONE4FUN4U,\u201d a person claiming to be a 14-year-old girl. ONE4FUN4U was actually FBI Special Agent Patricia Lynn Ferrante. Respondent suggested that the two meet. When asked by Ferrante what Respondent would like to do when they met, he responded with a graphic suggestion of sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The next day Ferrante and Respondent had a similar conversation; at this time Ferrante told Respondent she was thirteen years old. They also arranged to meet at the Montgomery Mall in Bethesda, Maryland at 2:00 p.m. on April 14, 1995. The following day, Respondent traveled from his home in Arlington, Virginia to the Montgomery Mall, where he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">After his arrest Respondent voluntarily sought help for his problems. He started seeing a psychiatrist regularly and began taking medication to control a mental disorder from which he suffered \u2014 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Currently, Respondent is married and sees a psychiatrist on an as-needed basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">As indicated, this Court referred the matter to Judge Johnson. At the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Susan Fiester testified regarding Respondent\u2019s mental health. She testified that Respondent suffers from depression, tinnitus, and OCD. Dr. Fiester expressed the opinion that each of these conditions contributed to Respondent\u2019s behavior. The OCD caused Chil-dress to be hyper-sensitive to the transmittal of germs and diseases, specifically sexually transmitted diseases. The hearing judge recounted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">According to Fiester, although Childress suffered from these mental disorders, he was able to succeed in school and in a professional setting. Childress\u2019 rituals had no impact on his practice of law, even when his illnesses were not being treated. Fiester testified that she has no knowledge of any recent contact between Childress and minor females and that there is no likelihood of a return of the actions giving rise to this matter. Currently, Fiester testified, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Childress is not suffering from any significant mental disorders and has a good prognosis for potentially coming off medication permanently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The depression manifested in Respondent a sense of inadequacy when he interacted with women. He subsequently began to feel more comfortable with young girls as he felt they were \u201cnon-judgmental\u201d and less likely to carry sexually transmitted diseases. Respondent testified that he kept a \u201csafe sex kit\u201d in his car that contained condoms, dental dams, latex gloves, alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Respondent filed the following exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings. He excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s factual finding that Respondent\u2019s sexually graphic conversations were with more than one young girl. He also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">This Court has original and complete jurisdiction over disciplinary proceedings. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 17, 741 A.2d 1143, 1152 (1999). We therefore make an independent, in-depth review of the entire record, with particular attention to the evidence relating to the disputed factual findings. <em>See Bar Ass\u2019n of Baltimore City v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 516, 307 A.2d 677, 680-81 (1973). The hearing court\u2019s findings of fact, however, are deemed <em>prima facie </em>correct and will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Goldsborough, </em>330 Md. 342, 347, 624 A.2d 503, 505 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">We turn first to Respondent\u2019s exception to the court\u2019s factual finding that \u201c[sjome of the discussions with minor females involved graphic conversations regarding sex.\u201d Respondent argues the record reflects that he had only one sexually explicit conversation with a young girl. He contends that the only other sexually graphic conversation was with Agent Ferrante, who is not a young girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Our independent review of the record reveals that the hearing judge was not clearly erroneous in making this finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>of fact. When viewed in isolation the statement made by the hearing judge could indicate that the females Respondent had sexually graphic conversations with were in fact minors. When read in context however, it is apparent that he was referring to females Respondent <em>believed </em>to be minors. In the sentence immediately preceding the one at issue, the hearing judge states that Respondent used his home computer to communicate with people he believed to be young girls. It is clear that the hearing judge was referring to all conversations at issue before him, specifically the highly graphic sexual conversations with Agent Ferrante, whom Respondent believed to be thirteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Moreover, the record also reflects that Respondent had sexually explicit conversations with more than one young girl. Respondent admitted at the hearing to having a sexual conversation with a young girl named \u201cTina97\u201d in which he described in graphic detail what he would like to do with her. He testified that the only other graphic conversation occurred with Agent Ferrante. On cross-examination, however, Bar Counsel reminded Respondent of \u201cBeckeyl4,\u201d a fourteen-year-old girl with whom he discussed one of her sexual fantasies and having orgasms. While the record does not include the details of this conversation, it certainly appears to be a second \u201cgraphic conversation regarding sex,\u201d which would make the hearing judge\u2019s statement accurate. Therefore, Respondent\u2019s first exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">We turn next to Respondent\u2019s exception to the hearing court\u2019s conclusion that Rule 8.4(d) was violated. First, Respondent argues that contrary to the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion, Respondent did not violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b). Second, he argues that Respondent\u2019s conduct was not in and of itself prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The hearing judge concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">We hold, however, that based upon the transcripts of the criminal case against Childress and the testimony presented at oral, arguments before this Court, there is clear and convincing evidence that Childress committed criminal acts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>namely crossing state lines with the intent to commit a sexual act with a minor. Those findings of fact were never disturbed on appeal. The conviction against Childress was vacated due to an error of statutory construction \u2014 a technicality unrelated to the facts of the case. We hold, therefore, that there is clear and convincing evidence that Childress committed a criminal act, notwithstanding his conviction having been reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The issue then arises whether Childress\u2019 conduct rises to a level that is \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\">We find <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Alison, </em>317 Md. 523, 565 A.2d 660 (1989), persuasive on this point. As stated in <em>Alison, </em>a lawyer, upon admission to the Bar, accepts and agrees to be held to a higher standard of rules of conduct that are significantly more stringent than the requirements of law held to society at large:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">A lawyer\u2019s conduct should conform to the requirements of the law, both in professional service to clients and in the lawyer\u2019s business and personal affairs. A lawyer should use the law\u2019s procedures only for legitimate purposes and not to harass or intimidate others. A lawyer should demonstrate respect for the legal system and for those who serve it, including judges, other lawyers and public officials. (Preamble to the Rules of Professional Conduct.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 535.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">Behavior that may seriously impair public confidence in the entire profession, without extenuating circumstances, may be determined to be prejudicial to the administration of justice. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Baldwin, </em>308 Md. 397, 519 A.2d 1291 (1987) (holding attorney who failed to report and remit to State income taxes withheld on employee\u2019s wages was conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice). We find that Childress\u2019 behavior was prejudicial to the administration of justice, as the exhibition of such behavior is likely to impair public confidence in the profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>sion, impact on the image of the legal profession, and engender disrespect for the court. Therefore, we hold that Childress did in fact violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) \u2014 Misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Respondent argues that the hearing judge erred in determining that he violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b) despite the decision by the Fourth Circuit to the contrary. In reversing Respondent\u2019s conviction, the Fourth Circuit held that the plain language of \u00a7 2423(b) did not prohibit Respondent\u2019s conduct. The Fourth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">At the time of Childress\u2019 arrest, indictment, trial, conviction, and sentencing, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b) by referring to \u00a7 2245, did not proscribe criminal liability for the conduct in which Childress engaged. The district court erred, in the absence of contemporaneous legislative history, in treating \u00a7 2423(b)\u2019s cross reference to \u00a7 2245 as a mistake. At the time of Childress\u2019 conviction, application of the statute as written mandated a reversal of Childress\u2019 conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6W\"><em>Childress, </em>104 F.3d at 53. It is clear that the Fourth Circuit held that Respondent\u2019s acts did not constitute a crime under federal law at the time he committed them. Therefore, Respondent is correct that the hearing judge erred in concluding that by his conduct, he violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Respondent next argues that he did not violate Rule 8.4(d) because his conduct was purely personal, unrelated to the practice of law and, therefore, is not prejudicial to the administration of justice. Respondent argues that his conduct had absolutely no relationship to his practice of law; that it did not involve clients, client funds, his law office, the courts, the judicial system, or anything else even remotely related to the legal profession. He construes the ambit of Rule 8.4(d) to address conduct that relates in some manner to an attorney\u2019s practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Respondent identifies three types of cases in which this Court has found a violation of Rule 8.4(d) based on private conduct: cases involving drugs, cases involving physical violence, and tax cases. As support, he cites <em>Attorney Grievance </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number><em>Comm\u2019n v. Painter, </em>356 Md. 293, 305, 739 A.2d 24, 31 (1999) (attorney\u2019s conduct in beating wife, along with criminal convictions for handgun violations and battery is conduct prejudicial to administration of justice), <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gilbert, </em>356 Md. 249, 252, 739 A.2d 1, 2 (1999) (attorney\u2019s possession of crack cocaine is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bres-chi, </em>340 Md. 590, 600, 667 A.2d 659, 664 (1995) (attorney\u2019s criminal conduct in failing to file federal income tax returns is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">In response, Bar Counsel asserts that Respondent\u2019s characterization of his conduct as purely private conduct might be more persuasive if Respondent\u2019s conduct was limited to adults, or at least individuals he believed were adults. Respondent\u2019s conduct involved his solicitation of young girls over the Internet, where he would tell them that he wished to have sex with them, and it was important that they not tell their parents about the conversation or the meeting. The conduct was not limited to Internet communications, but included meetings in Virginia and Maryland, without the knowledge of the girls\u2019 parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">This Court has recognized that a lawyer is subject to professional discipline under the Rules of Professional Conduct for conduct the lawyer engages in outside his or her role as a lawyer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Painter, </em>356 Md. at 305, 739 A.2d at 31 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>(repeated acts of domestic violence against wife); <em>Breschi, </em>340 Md. at 600, 667 A.2d at 664 (willful failure to file tax returns); <em>Gilbert, </em>356 Md. at 252, 739 A.2d at 2 (possession of crack cocaine); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Wolfram, Modern Legal Ethics \u00a7 3.3.4, at 97 (1986) (\u201cA traditional view is that a lawyer is subject to professional discipline for conduct that the lawyer engaged in outside his or her role as a lawyer.\u201d) Under the Rules of Professional Conduct, an act or omission by an attorney which violates the rules of professional misconduct is not limited to conduct which occurred in the course of an attorney-client relationship. Maryland Rule 16-701(k) defines misconduct as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL5\">\u201cMisconduct\u201d means an act or omission by an attorney, individually or in concert with any other person or persons which violates the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>as adopted by Rule 16-812, <em>whether or not the act or omission occurred in the course of an attorney-client relationship.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">We have also held that a criminal conviction is not a condition precedent for a finding of a violation of Rule 8.4(d) and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. <em>See e.g. Breschi, </em>340 Md. at 600, 667 A.2d at 664 (holding that willful failure to file tax return and timely pay taxes \u201cis inherently \u2018conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice\u2019 because it violated federal law.\u201d This was so \u201c[r]e-gardless of whether Respondent was criminally prosecuted or eventually paid what he owed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">It is thus apparent that under certain circumstances, a lawyer may be sanctioned for conduct unrelated to the practice of law. It is also clear that a criminal conviction is not a condition precedent for disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Respondent maintains that his conduct differs from the above cited cases in that his conduct was not criminal, he committed no acts of violence, he caused no harm to anyone, and his actions were in no way connected with the practice of law. In short, he maintains that \u201c[hjowever distasteful that conduct might be, it simply was not \u2018prejudicial to the administration of justice\u2019 in any conceivable sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">While it is true that a review of our cases might suggest that Rule 8.4(d) has been applied only to conduct which is related to the practice of law, directly or indirectly, or where there has been a criminal conviction or conduct which is criminal in nature, in this case we need not address the margins of Rule 8.4(d) and whether a lawyer\u2019s non-criminal, purely private conduct might be a basis for discipline under the Rule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is so because Respondent\u2019s admitted conduct is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>arguably criminal conduct. Additionally, the harm, or potential harm, in a stranger soliciting sex over the Internet to young girls, after imploring them to keep the meeting a secret from their parents, is patent.'</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Respondent admitted proposing sexual intercourse with \u201cCat666,\u201d a child he believed to be under the age of fourteen. Bar Counsel alleged in the Petition for Discipline the underlying conduct which was the basis for the disciplinary proceeding. The hearing judge found that Respondent\u2019s conduct was criminal and thus was conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. As we have indicated, the hearing judge was wrong in finding that Respondent violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b). That does not end the inquiry, however, in that Respondent\u2019s conduct may still have been criminal. For example, in Virginia, it is illegal for anyone over the age of eighteen to propose the performance of sexual intercourse to a child under fourteen. <em>See </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-370 (1950, 1995 Supp.).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In Maryland, \u201cit is' unlawful for an adult wilfully to contribute to, encourage, cause or tend to cause any act, omission, or condition which results in a violation, renders a child delinquent, in need of supervision, or in need of assistance.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol., 1999 Supp.) \u00a7 3-831 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.

Under these circumstances, it is appropriate to remand this matter to Judge Johnson for further proceedings, without prejudice to Respondent\u2019s right to raise any defense to any of these issues. Following those further proceedings, Judge Johnson should submit a supplemental report.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED.
