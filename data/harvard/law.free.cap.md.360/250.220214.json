He appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the Circuit Court erred because it refused to compel the State to provide the defense with a copy of Petitioner\u2019s pre-trial recorded statement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and yet permitted the State, over Petitioner\u2019s objection, to adduce at trial the testimony of one of Petitioner\u2019s police interrogators concerning his version of the inculpatory content of that statement. The intermediate appellate court rejected Petitioner\u2019s argument and affirmed his convictions. We granted certiorari<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to consider the following questions posed by Petitioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">I. Whether the State is required to provide to the defense the defendant\u2019s recorded statement where, instead of introducing the recording at trial, it adduces the substance of the statement through the testimony of a police officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">II. Whether, where the State has failed to provide to the defense the defendant\u2019s recorded statement, it may introduce the substance of that statement at trial through a police officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">III. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in this case in holding that the admission of the oral summary at trial was not error under Maryland Rules 5-1002 and 5-1004.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">We hold that the State was required to furnish the defense with Petitioner\u2019s recorded statement under Maryland Rule 4-263(b)(2)(A) and reverse. We need not, and do not, decide any other aspect of Petitioner\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">On the evening of <em>2 </em>August 1996, Officers Lewis J. Man-gione, Jr. and Zachary Miller, of the Bel Air Police Department, responded to a call for a burglary at a house on Old Orchard Road in Harford County. Officer Mangione chased one suspect running from the house. During that pursuit, Officer Mangione noticed a vehicle speeding away with its headlights off and signaled Officer Miller to stop the car.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Officer Miller pursued the vehicle, stopped it, and arrested Petitioner, who was the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle. According to Officer Miller, Petitioner was visibly nervous and explained his unusual operation of the motor vehicle by stating that he became concerned when he realized he was driving the wrong way on Rock Spring Road.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the backseat of the vehicle, Officer Miller observed a large knife, screwdriver, and various household goods. These items were subsequently inventoried at the Bel Air Police Department and identified as stolen property taken from various locations in Harford County and elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Corporal John Baker interviewed Petitioner on 2 August 1996, advised him of his Miranda<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> rights, and obtained his signature on an advice-of-rights form. It is not entirely clear from the record whether this interrogation was recorded. Corporal Baker conducted a second interrogation in the presence of Petitioner\u2019s then counsel,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on 14 August 1996, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Harford County Sheriffs Department. The second interrogation apparently was videotaped. Subsequently, Corporal Baker obtained warrants to search Petitioner\u2019s home, a bedroom in Petitioner\u2019s parents\u2019 home where he sometimes stayed, and his booth at Pilgrim\u2019s Variety, a flea market. The searches resulted in the seizure of hundreds of'stolen items. Petitioner was ultimately charged in the instant case on 23 January 1998 by criminal information in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County with first-degree burglary and fourteen counts of theft over $300 as to those recovered items taken from Anne Arundel County victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Before trial, Petitioner\u2019s counsel requested discovery of a copy of the State\u2019s recording of Petitioner\u2019s statement. Petitioner\u2019s counsel reasoned that the recorded statement was vital for possible suppression purposes<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and to prepare cross-examination of Corporal Baker should he testify, as expected.' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The following courtroom exchange on 24 July 1998 captures the ebb-and-flow on this subject:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">[DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, Your Honor, there are motions on the table with respect to the warrants, but if I can address one other issue. I made several requests of the State for access to the videotape statements of my client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">The State had indicated that they were not planning to use my client\u2019s statements against him in the case in chief. However, there is still an issue as to whether or not the statements resulted in physical evidence being obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">I can\u2019t confidently suggest to my client whether we should waive that issue or litigate it, without having access to that videotape to see what my client said. I don\u2019t believe that I can confidently cross-examine any State\u2019s witness prior to having access to the videotape or the audiotapes in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">Police reports from Harford County clearly indicate that the statement was in fact videotaped and/or audiotaped and it is my understanding that the Harford County Sheriff Department or the Bel Air Police Department has yet to deliver that tape to [the] State\u2019s Attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">THE COURT: If they are not using statements of your client in their case in chief, what right do you have to it at this point? I am missing your point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-9\">[DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I am under the impression, Your Honor, that they could also use his statements to possibly suppress any specific reference, any items I would like discovered as a result of the statements he made. Or if his' statements won\u2019t be used to inculpate himself with respect to an admission or confession, those statements certainly did lead to the acquisition of physical evidence. Again, it is my impression, Your Honor, that I am entitled to seek suppression of that physical evidence through that manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-10\">THE COURT: What is the illegality? What is the basis for the illegality?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>[DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: It would basically be a <em>Miranda </em>violation, Your Honor, and possibly a voluntary suspicion [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">THE COURT: State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">[THE STATE]: Your Honor, some of what was said I believe is accurate and some is inaccurate. There were statements made. At a certain point in time there was an interrogation done by the Bel Air Police in conjunction with the Harford County Sheriffs Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">The Defendant did make several statements in reference to his participation in some things. I think it is inaccurate to say that certain statements would not be used as part of the State\u2019s evidence. I think several of the statements would not be relevant to the State\u2019s case and would not be used of course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">However, the sum and substance of what those statements were, have in fact been provided to [Petitioner\u2019s counsel]. There does \u2014 on Tuesday I said there appeared to be, I can now say with confidence that I have ascertained that there was a videotape done of this interrogation. A videotape we believe exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-9\">I have been in contact with the Harford County Sheriffs Office; they would have possession of it. They have individuals that are trying to find it. As recently as yesterday evening, I spoke with a Lieutenant Sandaman up there at Harford County who reasonably was confident that they could find it; they simply don\u2019t have it yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-10\">Certainly, in an ideal world we would have had that. It should be provided. I certainly agree that the Defense would be entitled to use it, or at least to inspect it if we were to use that particular piece of evidence. I think the significance here are the statements themselves. The sum and substance of the statements have been given to them. All the videotape is going to show is him saying it, as opposed to somebody else saying he said it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-11\">THE COURT: All right. You answered my question. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>[THE STATE]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">THE COURT: Anything else, [Petitioner\u2019s counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">[DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, subsequent to that issue, Your Honor, again we -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">THE COURT: Under the rules of discovery the State is required to give you the substance of any oral statements. The proffers have been given to you. I don\u2019t understand the purpose for the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">[DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: The purpose of the hearing, Your Honor, would be that I have the substance of the statements. I believe the statements are possibly suppressible in themselves. As such, I believe this investigation may have gone any further. I am not aware of any independent investigation that was in effect at the time Mr. Johnson gave statements that might have led the State to any number of \u2014 might have led the State to discover his alleged complicity in any event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">For that reason, Your Honor, I believe that I am entitled to review those videotapes or that audiotapes [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-10\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t understand what the issue is. I really don\u2019t. You have got the statements. You know what he said. If you are saying that somehow [ ] <em>Miranda </em>was violated, fine. We will have a hearing on that. If you are saying that he was coerced into giving a statement, fine. We will have a hearing on that. I want to know what your position is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-11\">[DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Based on what my client has told me, I dispute the accuracy of the substance of the statements that have been provided to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-12\">THE COURT: Well, that can be tested through cross-examination, the accuracy of the statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-13\">[DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Again, I feel that I am handicapped by not having access to the tapes prior to the cross-examination. Again, I believe that \u2014 I understand what the Court is saying and I defer to the Court. But, for the record, I believe I should be entitled to access to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>videotape prior to such time that I get to cross-examine any officer that was involved in taking those statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">THE COURT: Well, I don\u2019t think at this point of the trial \u2014 well, we haven\u2019t even started the trial yet, we are just still on motions. I don\u2019t understand any basis that you have proffered for any preliminary motion with regard to statements. So your request for a hearing on that is denied, based on what you have told me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">At the bench trial, before Corporal Baker was allowed to testify, Petitioner\u2019s counsel expressed his belief that the \u201cState has agreed, has been asked not to use any of Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements in their case in chief, Your honor.\u201d The State responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">Your Honor, we have touched on this several times and he keeps mentioning that and I indicated even earlier this morning that there was not an agreement that we would not use statements in this case in chief. I said that there were certain statements that he made that weren\u2019t relevant to this case and certainly would not be used on that basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">I don\u2019t know where the belief that we would not use statements in the case in chief came from; each time he has reiterated that view, Your Honor, I have reiterated that that was not the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Petitioner\u2019s counsel retorted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">It is my understanding, Your Honor, that we did waive motions on the <em>Miranda </em>issue because I believe the State did tender to me the statements that they were not going to use of my client\u2019s. Inculpatory statements in their case in chief. It was with that understanding that I didn\u2019t pursue the <em>Miranda </em>issue at the motions hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">The following colloquy ensued between the trial judge and Petitioner\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-12\">THE COURT: As I recall it, as I recall that issue when it came up, I posed a question of whether or not you \u2014 well, not whether or not, but suggesting to you that you could cross-examine any witness concerning those statements. That is what I thought you were going to do. But, if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>say they want to use his statements, why can\u2019t they use his statements? What law dictates that they can\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">[DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: No, Your Honor. I suppose there is case law. I waived to get a \u2014 I permanently waived the <em>Miranda, </em>issue at the motions hearing, based on the premise that they weren\u2019t going to use those statements\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">THE COURT: This whole case is premised on misunderstandings. If you want to cross-examine the witnesses, you have every right to do it. I am going to overrule the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Corporal John Baker was then permitted to explain his version of the interrogations. As to the first interrogation on 2 August, Corporal Baker testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">I conducted an interview with Mr. Johnson and asked him if he would state what had occurred that evening. He stated that he and his nephew had been sitting at the parking lot at Klein\u2019s, which is a superthrift, on North Main Street in Bel Air.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">Then some juveniles on bicycles started harassing them. He said his nephew became agitated, exited the vehicle and started chasing these individuals on foot. Mr. Johnson stated he was driving around looking for his nephew when he observed the police in the area of Howard Street and Old Orchard Road and then fled the area with his lights out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">I asked him about the other things that had occurred during the time when he was being stopped and he stated that he was keeping his lights out so that he could retrieve some marijuana that he had hidden in his vehicle and tried to throw it out the window so he wouldn\u2019t be caught with it, but instead he stuffed it in the console.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-11\">He stated that he wanted to come clean with what he had done and to try and help the police, but only after he had talked with an attorney and then invoked his right. At that time all questioning ceased with Mr. Johnson.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Regarding the 14 August interrogation of Johnson, he testified, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>[THE STATE]: Who was present?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">[CORPORAL BAKER]: There was myself, Detective Agnor, Farrell, Smith would be from the Harford County Sheriffs Department. Agnor and Farrell would be from the Newark, Delaware Police Department. There was Mr. Johnson and his [then] attorney, [ ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">[THE STATE]: Prior to the interview was Mr. Johnson read his <em>Miranda </em>rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">[CORPORAL BAKER]: He was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights by [ ], his attorney. He was again issued a <em>Miranda </em>by police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">[THE STATE]: Did he affirmatively waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">[CORPORAL BAKER]: Yes, sir, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-10\">[THE STATE]: How was that done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-11\">[CORPORAL BAKER]: He conferred with his attorney and after conferring with his attorney he agreed to be interviewed by all officers that were there, involved in this, and to tell what he knew in reference to the burglaries and what his involvement was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-12\">[THE STATE]: What, if anything, did Mr. Johnson state to you during that interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-13\">[CORPORAL BAKER]: At 1036 hours that morning he was interviewed by myself and Detective Smith of the Sheriffs Department at the Harford County Sheriffs Department. He stated that he mostly acted as a fence for his nephew, Robert Mark Rinkowitz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-14\">He referred to him always as Mark. He stated that Mark would commit these burglaries, bring the property to him to sell. He stated that he would sell some of these items at a flea market in Aberdeen and some he would take to other types of sales or other places where items could be bought and sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-15\">Also he said that Mark had four people working for him. All he could think of were a couple of first names. He stated that in reference to what we arrested on, on the 2nd of August, 1996, he drove Mark around the neighborhood of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Old Orchard Road. He then parked on the parking lot of Klein\u2019s Superthrift.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Petitioner\u2019s defense at trial was that his nephew (Mr. Rin-kowitz), who had stayed at Petitioner\u2019s parents\u2019 home and also worked at the Pilgrim\u2019s Variety flea market, was the guilty party. Marcus Johnson, Petitioner\u2019s father, testified that Rinkowitz maintained a separate booth at the flea market that was across the aisle from Petitioner\u2019s booth. During the execution of the warrant, officers took items from both booths. He also testified that Rinkowitz had been living in his home and storing goods in his basement, but at the time of the search he was staying elsewhere and stopped by two or three times per week. Petitioner\u2019s father stated that his son stayed at his parents\u2019 house \u201cvery seldom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The trial judge-found Petitioner guilty of fourteen counts of theft over $300. On 2 October 1998, the court imposed a sentence of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment for the conviction of theft over $300 under count 2 of the charging document, to be served consecutive to a sentence imposed in the Circuit Court for Harford County, and concurrent sentences of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment each for the remaining convictions, the latter suspended in favor of five years\u2019 probation upon release.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial court did not err when it denied defense counsel\u2019s request for a copy of Petitioner\u2019s recorded statement. The court explained that the defense was not entitled to a copy of the recording because the substance of the content of Petitioner\u2019s recorded statement had been provided, and furthermore, the State did not offer the actual recording as evidence at trial. The court reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">The substance of appellant\u2019s statements during the interviews was provided to appellant\u2019s counsel, pursuant to Rule 4-263(a)(2). Appellant nevertheless insists that the State intended to use his recorded statement at trial and, thus, he was entitled to view the videotape under Rule 4-263(b)(2). To the contrary, it is undisputed that the State did not intend to use the tape---- Moreover, the State did not use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the recorded statement at the trial. Rule 4-263(b)(2) is applicable only when \u201cthe State intends to use\u201d a statement made by appellant. The statement was not used; consequently, Rule 4-263(b)(2) was not applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">II.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Petitioner contends that the trial court\u2019s ruling denying him the right to obtain his recorded statement violated Maryland Rule 4-263(b)(2)(A).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He argues that the Circuit Court should have required disclosure of the recorded statement because the State intended to use the content of the statement at trial through the testimony of Corporal Baker, one of his interrogators. He urges us to enforce the plain meaning of Maryland Rule 4 \u2014 263(b)(2)(A) to require the State to furnish a copy of the recorded statement, not merely the substance of the content of the statement. Petitioner argues that, without the recorded statement, he was unable to determine whether the statement was lawfully obtained or to prepare for cross-examination and his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The State argues that it provided the discoverable information required to be disclosed by the rule. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The State complied with the [rule.] ... [ ] [Because] [ ] the State did not intend, to use the video-recorded statement, the State was not required to produce that recorded statement pursuant to Rule 4-263(b)(2)(A); and, [ ] by providing the substance of Johnson\u2019s oral statement obtained on August 14, 1996, the State complied with Rule 4-268(b)(2)(B).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhJ\">Furthermore, the State asserts that the Court of Special Appeals was correct in its attempted distinction for discovery purposes between the videotaped statement as a physical item and the substance of the content of that statement, and then pointing out that only the latter was introduced in evidence through the testimony of Corporal Baker.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">As to criminal cases, Maryland Rule 4-263(b)(2) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">Rule 4-263. Discovery in circuit court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">$ $ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">(b) Disclosure upon Request.

As to all statements made by the defendant to a State agent that the State intends to use at a hearing or trial, furnish to the defendant, but not file unless the court so orders: (A) a copy of each written or recorded statement, and (B) the substance of each oral statement and a copy of all reports of each oral statement;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">With respect to the interpretation of the Maryland Rules, this Court has stated that, \u201c[t]he canons and principles which we follow in construing statutes apply equally to an interpretation of our rules.\u201d <em>State v. Romulus, </em>315 Md. 526, 533, 555 A.2d 494, 497 (1989). In order to effectuate the purpose and objectives of the rule, we look to its plain text. <em>See Adamson v. Correctional Medical Serv., Inc., </em>359 Md. 238, 250-51, 753 A.2d 501, 507-08 (2000); <em>Huffman v. State, </em>356 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Md. 622, 628, 741 A.2d 1088, 1091 (1999). To prevent illogical or nonsensical interpretations of a rule, we analyze the rule in its entirety, rather than independently construing its sub-parts. <em>See Marsheck v. Board of Trustees of the Fire &amp; Police Employees\u2019 Retirement System of the City of Baltimore, </em>358 Md. 393, 403, 749 A.2d 774, 779 (2000). If the words of the rule are plain and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ceases and we need not venture outside the text of the rule. <em>See Adamson, </em>359 Md. at 250-51, 753 A.2d at 507-08; <em>Marsheck, </em>358 Md. at 402-03, 749 A.2d at 779; <em>Huffman, </em>356 Md. at 628, 741 A.2d at 1091.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The venerable plain meaning principle, central to our analysis, does not, however, mandate exclusion of other persuasive sources that lie outside the text of the rule. <em>See Adamson, </em>359 Md. at 251-52, 753 A.2d at 508; <em>Marsheck, </em>358 Md. at 403, 749 A.2d at 779. We have often noted that looking to relevant case law and appropriate secondary authority enables us to place the rule in question in the proper context. <em>See Adamson, </em>359 Md. at 251-52, 753 A.2d at 508; <em>Marsheck, </em>358 Md. at 403, 749 A.2d at 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Specific to the rule at issue here, we have noted that Maryland Rule 4-263 was derived from former Maryland Rule 741. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>327 Md. 81, 90, 607 A.2d 923, 927 (1992). Thus, our case law interpreting the same language in former Rule 741(b)(2) as appears in Rule 4 \u2014 263(b)(2) is instructive here. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The scope of pretrial disclosure mandated by Maryland Rule 4-263 must be determined in light of the underlying policies of the rule. <em>See id. See also, Baynor v. State, </em>355 Md. 726, 735-36, 736 A.2d 325, 330 (1999); <em>Hutchins v. State, </em>339 Md. 466, 473, 663 A.2d 1281, 1285 (1995); <em>White v. State, </em>300 Md. 719, 734, 481 A.2d 201, 208 (1984). We have explained that the rale serves dual purposes. In terms of fundamental fairness, broad discovery aids the defendant in preparing his or her defense and protects him or her from surprise at trial. <em>See Hutchins, </em>339 Md. at 473, 663 A.2d at 1285. Maryland Rule 4-263 is also designed \u201cto force the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>defendant to file certain motions before trial, including a motion to suppress an unlawfully obtained statement.\u201d <em>White, </em>300 Md. at 734, 481 A.2d at 208. As a predicate to the defendant\u2019s obligation to file a motion to suppress, the State must comply with the Rule\u2019s mandated pretrial disclosure of documents or items and information. In <em>Warrick v. State, </em>302 Md. 162, 169, 486 A.2d 189, 193 (1985), we noted that \u201c[t]he defendant cannot be expected to file such motions prior to trial unless he can obtain the necessary information to prepare for the suppression or exclusion hearing,\u201d (citing the Joint Committee of the Maryland Judicial Conference and of the Maryland State Bar Association, Report and Recommendations to Implement the American Bar Association\u2019s Standards for Criminal Justice at 26 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">A plain meaning reading of Maryland Rule 4-263(b)(2)(A) answers the threshold question in this case. There is no doubt that Petitioner\u2019s counsel made pre-trial requests to receive a copy of his client\u2019s recorded statement, in accordance with the Rule. The State did not provide the recorded statement, yet the alleged substance of the content of that statement was subsequently introduced by the State at trial, over objection, through Corporal Baker\u2019s testimony. The State attempts to rationalize its non-observance of the Rule by countering that it did not intend to use or play the actual recording <em>itself </em>at trial, but rather intended only that Corporal Baker testify as to his recollection of the content (or a summary) of what Petitioner said in the statement. The State claims that using the \u201cstatement\u201d within the meaning of Maryland Rule 4-263(b)(2), thus triggering any obligation to provide the recording to a defendant before trial, means, in these circumstances, playing the tape at trial. This reasoning is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">That the State used Petitioner\u2019s recorded statement against him through the testimony of Corporal Baker is beyond cavil. Moreover, as stated <em>supra, </em>Corporal Baker\u2019s testimony was clearly inculpatory. The State made it clear at the pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>motions hearing, and at trial before Corporal Baker testified, that it intended to use a version of the content of Petitioner\u2019s statement during its case in chief. Implementing that intent, the prosecutor asked Corporal Baker at trial what the Petitioner stated during the interrogations and Corporal Baker stated his recollection of what transpired. Necessarily, Corporal Baker\u2019s testimony was dependent on Petitioner\u2019s recorded statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The State shall not be allowed so disingenuously to circumvent the pre-trial disclosure mandated by Rule 4-263(b)(2)(A) by the device of using a derivative version of Petitioner\u2019s statement through Corporal Baker\u2019s testimony. We hold that, upon request of the defendant, the State must furnish a defendant\u2019s apparently available recorded statement made to a State agent, even if the State intends only to use the content of the recorded statement at trial, irrespective of whether the physical recording itself is intended for use as direct evidence at trial. For us to hold otherwise would render Rule 4-263(b)(2)(A) a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The State\u2019s argument that it provided the \u201csubstance\u201d of Petitioner\u2019s oral statement, pursuant to Rule 4-263(b)(2)(B), does not relieve it of its companion obligation to produce the recorded statement under Rule 4-263(b)(2)(A).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Maryland Rule 4 \u2014 263(b)(2) cannot be parsed as the State wishes. To allow the State to satisfy its discovery obligations under Rule 4-263(b)(2)(B), in lieu of Rule 4-263(b)(2)(A), would grant the State largely unchecked discretion to summarize, edit, or characterize the content of a defendant\u2019s recorded statement in any form it chooses. This violates the spirit and letter of discovery of a recorded statement as provided by the rule. When a recorded statement is available, the \u201csubstance\u201d of the oral delivery of the statement, as determined by the State, may not substitute for, or even be able to describe, the nuances, qualities, or manner in which the interrogation was conducted. A principal purpose of the rule is to provide \u201cfor the discovery of statements which might possibly have been unlawfully obtained.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>327 Md. at 92, 607 A.2d at 928. Mere production of the \u201csubstance\u201d of a defendant\u2019s recorded statement risks thwarting defense counsel\u2019s ability to determine the lawfulness of the interrogation or the evidence that stems from it.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">We have previously issued a warning regarding the potential consequences of failing to disclose a defendant\u2019s statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">[T]he State should err on the side of disclosure in any case where there reasonably exists the possibility that the statement was unlawfully obtained. This word of caution is issued because if the statement was discoverable and wasn\u2019t provided, the trial court may, within its discretion, impose a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>sanction for the discovery violation under 4-263(i). Subsection (i) authorizes the trial judge to order the violating party \u201cto permit the discovery of the matters not previously disclosed, strike the testimony to which the undisclosed matter relates, grant a reasonable continuance, prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the matter not disclosed, grant a mistrial, or enter any other order appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d Thus, the State should consider the possible repercussions of failing to disclose a statement that the defendant had reasonable grounds to argue was subject to a pretrial suppression motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><em>Brown, </em>327 Md. at 95, 607 A.2d at 930. This warning is even more applicable when a recorded statement, given to a State agent, appears available.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">We evaluate whether the State\u2019s failure to produce the recorded statement was harmless error under the following standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">[Wjhen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u2018harmless\u2019 and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded \u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict. (Footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-9\"><em>Hutchins, </em>339 Md. at 475-76, 663 A.2d at 1286 (citing <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">We have no difficulty concluding that Petitioner was prejudiced by the State\u2019s failure to produce the recorded statement prior to Corporal Baker\u2019s testimony. \u201cCommon sense and judicial experience teach that a defendant\u2019s prior statement in the possession of the government may be the single most crucial factor in the defendant\u2019s preparation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Percevault, </em>490 F.2d 126, 129-30 (2d Cir.1974). The wisdom of this observation is proven true again in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Without providing Petitioner with the recorded statement, the dual purposes of Rule 4-263 could not be fulfilled here. As Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel explained to the trial court, without the recorded statement, Petitioner was unable to prepare for his defense, i.e., to effectively cross-examine or impeach the State\u2019s witness or to protect himself from surprise. <em>See Hutchins, </em>339 Md. at 473, 663 A.2d at 1285. We noted in <em>Carr v. State, </em>284 Md. 455, 460-61, 397 A.2d 606, 608-09 (1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"az-dedup-0\">Every experienced trial judge and trial lawyer knows the value for impeaching purposes of statements of the witness recording the events before time dulls treacherous memory. Flat contradiction between the witnesses] testimony and the version of the events given in his reports is not the only test of inconsistency. The omission from the reports of facts related at the trial, or a contrast in emphasis upon the same facts, even a different order of treatment, are also relevant to the cross-examining process of testing the credibility of a witnesses] trial testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">(citing <em>Jencks v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 657, 667, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1013, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103, 1111 (1957)). Although the issues and facts in <em>Carr </em>are different from this case, we think the observations in <em>Carr </em>as to the value of an available recorded statement to a defense counsel are worth noting here. The determination of what material contained on the recording is useful to the defense is best left to defense counsel and his or her client. <em>See Leonard v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 631, 638-39, 421 A.2d 85, 89 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Furthermore, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel was unable to determine if an issue existed as to whether his client\u2019s statement was obtained unlawfully. The effect was that he could not maintain an evidence-specific motion to suppress without viewing the recorded statement. <em>See Warrick, </em>302 Md. at 169, 486 A.2d at 192-93. In <em>Brown, </em>we explained that the State\u2019s fulfillment of Maryland Rule 4-263 necessarily triggers the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>defense\u2019s obligation to seek suppression of evidence unlawfully obtained. We opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">Admissions, statements, or confessions that might have been unlawfully obtained are subject to a pretrial motion to suppress under [Maryland] Rule 4-252(a)(4). Under Rule 4-252 an allegation that an admission, statement, or confession was unlawfully obtained must be raised by pretrial motion or it is waived. In limiting by rule required State disclosure to statements made to State agents, and in excluding by decision statements made to State agents during the commission of che crime, this Court has, as have the federal courts, made it clear that oral statements which must be disclosed under 4-263 are those statements which might possibly have been unlawfully obtained and suppressible under 4-252.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\"><em>Brown, </em>327 Md. at 94, 607 A.2d at 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">This Court is not satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the failure to furnish the recorded statement did not contribute to the rendition of a guilty verdict in the present case. We have no way of knowing, based on the record, what weight the trial judge gave to Corporal Baker\u2019s testimony as to the content of the recorded statement. Although we imagine the significance of that testimony could be considerable, the trial judge\u2019s articulated findings do not specify what weight he gave it.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

The Court of Special Appeals noted that Petitioner retained new counsel, after the interrogations, to represent him at the pre-trial hearings and the bench trial in the instant case in Anne Arundel County. In fact, Petitioner was represented by attorneys from the Public Defender's Office for Anne Arundel County in this case. Pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>sumably, Petitioner's counsel present at the 14 August 1996 interrogation in Harford County was not from the Anne Arundel County\u2019s Public Defender\u2019s Office as Petitioner had not been charged with any crimes in Anne Arundel County at the time of his interrogations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">. No written, evidence-specific, pre-trial motion to suppress was filed in this case, although, apparently according to a local custom or practice, the document entering the appearance of Petitioner\u2019s counsel who ultimately represented him at the pre-trial hearings and trial, filed on 11 March 1998, included a very terse and generic incorporation by reference of, among other things, a form \"Motion To Suppress Evidence ... on file with the Clerk of the Court and the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney....\u201d The title of this document, \"Appearance,\u201d gives no indication of the above included language. No copy of the referenced motion is included in the record. Moreover, it is apparent that such an omnibus motion to suppress could not have identified any specific documents or information that may have been sought to be suppressed in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The trial was scheduled to commence on 21 July 1998. Petitioner\u2019s counsel requested a postponement on the morning of 21 July, at which time the trial was rescheduled for 24 July 1998. Petitioner\u2019s counsel then proceeded to make a number of oral motions on 21 July, including one seeking compelled disclosure of Petitioner\u2019s recorded statement. Oral argument on that point continued on 24 July 1998. On 24 July 1998, after denial of Petitioner\u2019s motions, a bench trial commenced, continuing on 28 July, and, concluding on 4 August 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b293-8\">. Because the gravamen of Petitioner\u2019s appellate argument is, in part, that he was unable to make (or lulled into not making) an appropriate motion to suppress as to the statement based on the State\u2019s representation that it did not intend to use the statement at trial, we consider our analysis here to be directed at a discovery ruling, rather than a suppression matter. Accordingly, we are not limited in our consideration of the record below, as ordinarily would be the case were we considering a suppression ruling. <em>See Riddick </em>v. <em>State, </em>319 Md. 180, 183, 571 A.2d 1239, 1240 (1990) (\u201cWhen the question of the dishonor of a constitutional right arises by the denial of a motion to suppress, the relevant facts which we consider \u2018are limited to those produced at the suppression hearing\u2019 \u201d) (citing <em>Simpler v. State, </em>318 Md. 311, 312, 568 A.2d 22, 22 (1990)). <em>See also Trusty v. State, </em>308 Md. 658, 670-71, 521 A.2d 749, 755 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b293-9\">. Petitioner also argues that the Circuit Court should have required disclosure of the recorded statement under Maryland Rule 4-263(a)(2). We find it unnecessary to address that issue in light of our holding regarding Md. Rule 4-263 (b)(2)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\">. Respondent relies on our decision in <em>Baynor </em>to argue that providing the defense with the substance of Johnson's statement amounts to the necessary \u201csimple but fair statement of relevant information\u201d regarding the acquisition of the defendant\u2019s statement. <em>Baynor, </em>355 Md. at 736, 736 A.2d at 330, <em>citing Warrick v. State, </em>302 Md. 162, 171, 486 A.2d 189, 193 (1985). The State\u2019s reliance on <em>Baynor </em>is misplaced. The specific issue in <em>Baynor </em>stemmed from the petitioner\u2019s assertion that the State was required to provide a verbatim transcript of the questions posed to the petitioner and the answers he provided in an unrecorded statement, which included an exculpatory comment, made by the petitioner prior to the recording of his statement. <em>See Baynor, </em>355 Md. at 737, 736 A.2d at 330-31. We were satisfied, based on the specific facts in <em>Baynor, </em>that the information the petitioner requested was not relevant to the statement the State intended to use at trial, within the meaning of Maryland Rule 4-263(a)(2)(B). Our decision in <em>Baynor </em>was resolved by integrating the issues of the relevance of the statement at issue with whether the State actually intended to use the statement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Incidentally, in <em>Baynor, </em>we held that under Maryland Rule 4-263(a)(2), the State was not required to disclose the entire interrogation of the defendant when some questions were asked before the tape recorder was turned on. <em>Baynor, </em>355 Md. at 738-40, 736 A.2d at 331-2. In <em>Baynor, </em>the State <em>did </em>provide the petitioner with his recorded statement which it intended to use a trial. Contrary to the facts in <em>Baynor, </em>the State in the present case did not furnish the actual, existing recorded statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\">. We note again that Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel was not present when the statement was recorded. Although Petitioner\u2019s prior attorney (whose appearance was not entered in this case) apparently was present for the 14 August 1996 interrogation, even he was not there when the 2 August statement was given.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\">.
