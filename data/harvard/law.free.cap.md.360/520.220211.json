Ms. Flaherty\u2019s request sought the telephone records of \u201cthe Governor and his staff\u2019 over a two-year period, including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">\u201c[a]ll phones in the Governor\u2019s Mansion [Government House]; his State House offices; all phones in Shaw House (an annex office in Annapolis); all phones in the Washington and Baltimore offices; all car phones and cellular phones used by the governor and anyone on his staff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Mr. Babington\u2019s request for appointment or scheduling records was limited to the Governor but also spanned a two-year period. He requested</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-11\">\u201c[a]ll calendars indicating the persons, times, dates, and locations of meetings involving Governor Glendening in his official capacity as governor. This should include meetings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>in his State House office as well as those in Baltimore and other places where the governor conducts business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Both requests were granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The Office of the Governor (the Office) provided Ms. Flaherty with the aggregate cost of the telephone calls specified in her request; however, it denied the release of any \u201ccall detail,\u201d including the date, time, and length of each call. The Office asserted executive privilege, citing \u00a7 10-618(b) of the Act and this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Hamilton, Superintendent v. Verdow, </em>287 Md. 544, 414 A.2d 914 (1980), as well as cases in other states holding that telephone and scheduling records are exempt from disclosure under their corresponding public information acts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Office released the Governor\u2019s public agendas to Mr. Babington but denied the remainder of his request, stating that the appointment or scheduling records were not \u201cpublic records\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10-611(g) of the Act, and also invoking executive privilege, citing \u00a7 10-618(b) and Hamilton.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Negotiations between the parties continued throughout much of 1997, and during that time the Post narrowed its request. With respect to telephone records, the Post limited its request to the telephone records of calls by the Governor, Chief of Staff Major E. Riddick, Jr., Senior Advisor Susan Smith-Bauk, and Secretary of State John F. Willis, over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>six-month period from February 1, 1996, through July 31, 1996. In addition, Mr. Babington\u2019s original request for appointment records was also limited to the same six-month period. Despite these changes, the Office still refused to comply with the Post\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">As a result, on December 4, 1997, the Post brought suit in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County against the Office of the Governor and Governor Parris Glendening. Under the Post\u2019s complaint, the records sought were those asked, for after the Post had narrowed its request, namely records of telephone calls by specified individuals and appointments of the Governor, covering only the six-month period. The Office and the Governor filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that all of the records fell within \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(b) and the doctrine of executive privilege. They also argued that public disclosure of the Governor\u2019s daily schedules, even after the fact, would pose a threat to the personal security of the Governor and those around him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, they claimed that some of the documents were also exempt from disclosure under other sections of the Act, specifically the exemptions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>records containing confidential personnel information (\u00a7\u00a7 10-616(d) and (i)), confidential commercial information (\u00a7 10-617(d)), confidential employee information (\u00a7 10-617(e)), or confidential financial information (\u00a7 10-617(f)). The defendants argued that these specific exemptions under the Act would require redactions that were \u201cvirtually impossible to accomplish.\u201d Finally, they argued that the Post\u2019s request for the telephone records of Secretary of State Willis was barred because he had not been joined as a party to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Pursuant to an order of the court, the Governor and his office submitted <em>in camera </em>sample copies of the appointment schedules and telephone records, as well as affidavits from the Governor and numerous staff members, including Joanne Trumbule, the Governor\u2019s Director of Scheduling, Robert Plat-ky, the Director of Financial Administration for the Office of the Governor, and State Police Lieutenant Gary Shields, Commander of the Governor\u2019s Protection Unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The Post filed a cross motion for summary judgment, arguing that the documents at issue were not \u201cinteragency or intra-agency letter[s] or memorand[a]\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10-618(b) of the Act, and that, as purely factual material, the documents were not privileged. According to the Post, any threat to the Governor\u2019s security as a result of the release of the requested records, even if true, did not constitute an \u201cindependent justification recognized under the [Act] for withholding public records.\u201d Finally, the Post contended that the exemptions claimed for commercial information, financial information, and personnel records did not apply to the records at issue and that, alternatively, even if parts of the records were within such exemptions, the defendants were not justified in withholding all of the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">A hearing was held on the motions for summary judgment in May 1998. In early July 1998, the Circuit Court issued an opinion and order denying the motions. The court held that the doctrine of executive privilege was incorporated into the Act in both \u00a7 10-618(b), as argued by the Office and the Governor, and also in \u00a7 10-615(1), which requires non-disclo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>sure when \u201cby law, the public record is privileged or confidential.\u201d As a result, the court held that whether the documents fit within the definition of \u201cmemorandum\u201d under \u00a7 10-618(b) was irrelevant if the documents were privileged under the doctrine of executive privilege. Citing <em>Hamilton, Superintendent v. Verdow, supra, </em>287 Md. 544, 414 A.2d 914, the Circuit Court found that a purpose of that privilege \u201cis to promote the efficient operation of the government by allowing the Governor to solicit advice from a wide range of people without fear that public disclosure will restrain the free flow of that advice.\u201d The court also stated that the privilege was not absolute, and that the evidence was insufficient to determine whether the records might be privileged under \u00a7 10-618(b) and/or \u00a7 10-615(1). Accordingly, the court ordered the defendants to produce all telephone and scheduling records to the Post for which the defendants were not claiming privilege, submit to the court for an <em>in camera </em>review all records claimed to be privileged, and submit to the court a proposed redacted version of those records with a detailed memorandum explaining why the redacted information was privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Two weeks after the Circuit Court\u2019s opinion and order, the Post filed a motion requesting the court to set a compliance deadline for the defendants. One week later, the defendants filed a motion for clarification and reconsideration, again asking the court to recognize a categorical executive privilege as to all documents at issue and asserting that compliance with the opinion and order would be excessively burdensome. After a hearing, the court granted the Post\u2019s motion and set the compliance deadline for September 5, 1998, which was subsequently extended to September 11, 1998. The court denied the defendants\u2019 motion for reconsideration, stating that \u201c[t]he court does not believe that the Governor is entitled to a broad claim of executive privilege on all telephone and calendar records,\u201d but that he \u201cmay be entitled to executive privilege if [he] can prove that disclosure of particular information will adversely affect [his ability] to effectively carry-out his Constitutional duties.\u201d The court also held that the telephone records of Secretary of State John F. Willis were not within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>the scope of the court\u2019s July opinion and order because the Post had failed to name the Secretary of State as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The Office and the Governor on September 11, 1998, submitted a limited group of records to the Post, including the telephone records from the business line in Mr. Riddick\u2019s home, other telephone records at issue with call detail redacted so that only the cost was revealed, and reimbursement receipts for personal calls made by Mr. Riddick and Ms. Smith-Bauk for the six months at issue. They submitted to the court, for <em>in camera </em>review, unredacted copies of the telephone and calendar records with proposed redactions highlighted, as well as a memorandum and affidavits in support of those redactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">On September 15,1998, the Post filed a motion to unseal the <em>in camera </em>explanations for the redactions, and thereafter argument on this motion was heard before the Circuit Court. The court issued its final order on October 23,1998, in which it held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">\u201cthat the Defendants, with limited exceptions, have failed to make a particularized showing as to executive privilege, and further have failed to satisfy the statutory burden of demonstrating that the records at issue are exempt from mandatory disclosure under the Maryland Public Information Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZO\">The court granted the Post\u2019s motion to unseal the <em>in camera </em>explanations, and ordered that the Office and the Governor produce to the Post \u201ccomplete and unredacted copies of all of the telephone and calendar records at issue.... \u201d Finally, in anticipation of an appeal, the court stayed the execution of the order and retained the records submitted <em>in camera </em>for ninety-six hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The Office and the Governor immediately filed a notice of appeal and sought a stay of the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment. The Court of Special Appeals granted the motion to stay the judgment. Before any further proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, this Court issued a writ of certiorari. <em>Office of the Governor v. Washington Post, </em>352 Md. 309, 721 A.2d 988 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">As noted earlier, <em>supra </em>note 3, the Maryland Public Information Act in \u00a7 10 \u2014 611(g) defines \u201cpublic record\u201d as \u201cthe original or any copy of any documentary material that: (i) is made by a unit or instrumentality of the State government or of a political subdivision or received by the unit or instrumentality in connection with the transaction of public business ----\u201d Section 10-613(a) provides that, unless a record is</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">exempted by law, a custodian \u201cshall permit a person ... to inspect any public record at any reasonable time.\u201d Sections 10-615 through 10-619 provide for exemptions and permissible denials.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">A threshold question in this case, raised during the course of questioning by the Court at the initial oral argument, is whether the Act is applicable to the Office of the Governor. This issue had not been raised below and had not been briefed by the parties. As might be expected, however, the defendants suggest that the Act is not applicable and the plaintiff contends that it is fully applicable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The Maryland Act, originally enacted and codified in 1970 as Maryland Code (1957, 1975 Repl.Vol.), Art. 76A, \u00a7\u00a7 1 through 5, was to some extent modeled after the Federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, enacted in 1966. The Federal Act has been construed as not applying to the Office of the President. <em>See Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, </em>445 U.S. 136, 100 S.Ct. 960, 63 L.Ed.2d 267 (1980). By analogy, it was suggested that the State Act should not apply to the Office of the Governor. Because the text and history of the Maryland Act differ from the language and history of the Federal Act in several significant ways, however, we believe that this analogy is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The records subject to the Federal Act, unlike those subject to the Maryland Act, are \u201cagency records.\u201d Although that term was not originally defined in the Federal Act, by amendments to the Act in 1974 \u201cagency\u201d was defined as follows (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(f)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201cany executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">This section of the Federal Act was construed by the Supreme Court in <em>Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, supra, </em>445 U.S. 136, 100 S.Ct. 960, 63 L.Ed.2d 267. In that case, a journalist, William Safire, sought written transcripts of telephone conversations between Henry Kissinger<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and certain White House officials concerning \u201cleaks,\u201d and any calls mentioning Mr. Satire\u2019s name. The Supreme Court upheld the denial of the request, holding that, although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Federal Act includes the \u201cExecutive Office of the President\u201d as an agency subject to the Act, it did not apply to the President\u2019s immediate assistants and advisers, designated collectively as the Office of the President. The Court reached this conclusion based upon the House Conference Report for \u00a7 552(f) of the Federal Act which stated: \u201cthe President\u2019s immediate personal staff or units in the Executive Office whose sole function is to advise and assist the President\u201d are not included within the term \u201cagency.\u201d <em>Kissinger, </em>445 U.S. at 156, 100 S.Ct. at 971, 63 L.Ed.2d at 285, quoting H.R.Conf. Rep.No. 93-1380, p. 15 (1974). As Mr. \u201cSatire\u2019s request was limited to a period of time in which Kissinger was serving as Assistant to the President,\u201d the Court held that the telephone records were not \u201cagency records\u201d at the time they were made. 445 U.S. at 156, 100 S.Ct. at 971, 63 L.Ed.2d at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Although this issue has not been revisited in the Supreme Court, the scope of the Federal statute has been addressed by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That court has viewed the 1974 amendment to the Federal Act as a codification of its earlier holding in <em>Soucie v. David, </em>448 F.2d 1067 (D.C.Cir.1971). In <em>Soucie, </em>the court held that the Office of Science and Technology was an \u201cagency\u201d subject to the Federal Act because it had \u201csubstantial independent authority,\u201d and, therefore, its \u201csole function\u201d was not \u201cto advise and assist the President.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1073, 1075. In <em>Meyer v. Bush, </em>981 F.2d 1288, 1297 (D.C.Cir.1993), the court held that President Reagan\u2019s Task Force on Regulatory Relief, headed by then Vice President Bush, and composed of several Cabinet members, was not an \u201cagency\u201d subject to the statute because it did not have \u201c \u2018substantial independent authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Rushforth v. Council of Economic Advisers, </em>762 F.2d 1038 (D.C.Cir.1985) (Council of Economic Advisers is not an agency subject to Federal Act); <em>Pacific Legal Found, v. Council on Envtl. Quality, </em>636 F.2d 1259 (D.C.Cir.1980) (Council on Environmental Quality is an agency subject to the statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The Maryland Act applies to \u201cpublic records,\u201d not \u201cagency records.\u201d The coverage of the Act is dependent upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>scope of the term \u201cpublic records,\u201d and not upon whether the governmental entity holding the records is an \u201cagency\u201d rather than some other type of governmental entity. Although this Court has examined the status of particular entities in order to determine if their records were covered by the Act, such examinations were for the purpose of deciding whether the entities were private or governmental. In each of these cases, the entities argued that they were private and that, for this reason, their records were not \u201cpublic records\u201d subject to disclosure under the Act. In each case, this Court held that the entities were governmental instrumentalities for purposes of the Act and that, therefore, their records were covered by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">For example, in holding that the Maryland Insurance Guaranty Association was a governmental instrumentality for purposes of the Act, this Court in <em>A.S. Abell Pub. Co. v. Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 32, 464 A.2d 1068, 1071 (1983), emphasized that the Act broadly covers any part of Maryland government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah0\">\u201cThe Public Information Act provides that the public is entitled to information regarding the affairs of government .... To that end, the Public Information Act provides that the public has the right to inspect the public records of any branch of the State government.... Moreover, the Public Information Act expressly states that its provisions \u2018shall be broadly construed in every instance with the view toward public access,\u2019.... Thus, the provisions of the Public Information Act reflect the legislative intent that citizens of the State of Maryland be accorded wide-ranging access to public information concerning the operation of their government. Accordingly, in determining whether MIGA is an agency or instrumentality of the State within the scope of the Public Information Act, the language ... must be liberally construed in favor of inclusion in order to effectuate the Public Information Act\u2019s broad remedial purpose.\u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">And in <em>Moberly v. Herboldsheimer, </em>276 Md. 211, 228, 345 A.2d 855, 864 (1975), interpreting the Public Information Act to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>encompass the hospital records of a corporation known as the Memorial Hospital of Cumberland, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">\u201cIf the General Assembly did not intend this interpretation when it enacted this far reaching statute, it should so state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">According to \u00a7 10-611(g) of the State Government Article, the Maryland Public Information Act applies to \u201cany documentary material that ... is made by a unit or instrumentality of the State government ... or received by the unit or instrumentality in connection with the transaction of public business.\u201d Unlike the Federal Act, there is no statutory language or legislative history suggesting that any unit of the Maryland Government is exempt from the Public Information Act\u2019s coverage. The grounds for the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Federal Act in <em>Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, supra, </em>do not exist with regard to the Maryland Act. On the contrary, the cases interpreting the Maryland Act have broadly construed the terms \u201cpublic record\u201d and \u201cinstrumentality of the State government.\u201d The offices of the Governor and his staff in the State House and Shaw House in Annapolis, as well as their offices in Baltimore and Washington, are clearly encompassed by the statutory language \u201cunit or instrumentality of the State government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">There are, however, certain records requested by the Post which, in our view, are not \u201cpublic records\u201d for purposes of the Public Information Act. They are the records of telephone calls made from telephones in the \u201cGovernor\u2019s Mansion\u201d or, as it is officially named, \u201cGovernment House.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">As previously discussed, apart from the statute\u2019s express exemptions, the coverage of the Maryland Public Information Act is ordinarily dependent upon whether records are those of a \u201cgovernment instrumentality\u201d or are \u201cprivate.\u201d <em>A.S. Abell Pub. Co. v. Mezzanote, supra, </em>297 Md. at 30-31, 464 A.2d at 1070; <em>Moberly v. Herboldsheimer, supra, </em>276 Md. 211, 345 A.2d 855. Moreover, \u201cthere is no single test for determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>whether a statutorily-established entity is an agency or instrumentality of the State for a particular purpose,\u201d and \u201c[a]ll aspects of the interrelationship between the State and the ... entity must be examined,\u201d <em>Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. at 35, 464 A.2d at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">It seems obvious that bills or records of telephone calls, made by a government official or members of the official\u2019s family from their personal telephones in the family\u2019s private home, would not be considered \u201cpublic records\u201d within the meaning of the Act. In light of one\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy in his or her own home, such records would be \u201cprivate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Article II, \u00a7 21, of the Constitution of Maryland provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he Governor shall reside at the seat of government....\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The State, in the implementation of this provision, provides a home, named \u201cGovernment House,\u201d for the Governor and his family in the City of Annapolis. <em>See </em>Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 9-601 through 9-606 of the State Government Article (relating to the Government House Trust).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">In light of the nature of Government House and the role of the Government House Trust, the Governor and his family might not have the identical expectations of privacy while living there as one has in his or her privately owned home. Nonetheless, we do not believe that the Governor and his family must relinquish all normal expectations of privacy in their home simply because, in accordance with constitutional and statutory provisions, their home and furnishings, including telephone service, are supplied by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Unlike Chief of Staff Riddick, the Governor does not have a designated \u201cbusiness line\u201d in Government House. The record in this case discloses that, with regard to the telephone bills for calls made from Government House, it would be almost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>impossible to determine which member of the family made particular calls or, even if it could be determined that a particular call was made by the Governor, whether it was personal or related to state business.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">We do not believe that the General Assembly, in defining \u201cpublic record\u201d as a record \u201cmade by a unit or instrumentality of the State government\u201d (\u00a7 10-611(g)), intended to include the home telephone bills of the Governor and his family. Consequently, records of calls from telephones in Government House are not covered by the Act and need not be disclosed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Before addressing the defendants\u2019 principal arguments that the records sought by the Post fall within the Public Information Act\u2019s exemptions, we can dispose of some matters based on availability and the scope of the Post\u2019s requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">The Post requested the telephone records of the Governor, Mr. Riddick, and Ms. Smith-Bauk from telephones in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>the State House and the Shaw House, which are both in Annapolis, from telephones in the Washington and Baltimore offices of the Governor, and from any cellular telephones used by these three individuals. The defendants produced in the Circuit Court a detailed account of the telephone system employed by the State, and the limitations of that system. In reviewing the record, we conclude that the Circuit Court should have excluded certain documents, or portions of documents, from disclosure based upon the unavailability of the documents or the Post\u2019s own limitations on the scope of its requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The first group of these documents consists of the telephone records from offices outside of the State House.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The telephone system in use in the Baltimore office, known as the \u201cPBX system,\u201d includes a \u201ccollection device\u201d which records all incoming and outgoing local and long distance calls to and from that office. The only other telephone records from the Baltimore office are the bills from the long distance service provider, documenting only outgoing long distance charges. The petitioners produced several affidavits in the Circuit Court stating that, although the \u201cexternal\u201d long distance bills have been retained, the \u201cinternal\u201d information collected by the PBX system is no longer available.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Louis LaRicci, the Deputy Director of the Division of Telecommunications in the Office of Information Technology within the Department of Budget and Management, stated in his affidavit that the billing information for the Governor\u2019s Baltimore office, for the period from February 1, 1996, to July 31, 1996, \u201cwas disposed of in the ordinary course of the Division\u2019s business.\u201d Carol Cordial, the Assistant Director of the Division of Telecommunications, stated in her affidavit that the telephone records for the Baltimore office are \u201cwritten over automatically by the system\u201d every twelve months and that, therefore, \u201cnc internal data currently is retained\u201d for that office. The Post has not disputed these statements. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>internal billing information from the Baltimore office is unavailable. Obviously, a custodian cannot properly be ordered to produce records under the Act when those records simply do not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Although the long distance bills for the Baltimore office are currently in the possession of the Division of Telecommunications, they also need not be produced. The Post\u2019s request was limited to the telephone records of the Governor, Ms. Smith-Bauk, and Mr. Riddick. The bills from the long distance service provider for the Baltimore office indicate only the line from which the calls originated and the number to which the calls were placed. They do not indicate who placed each call. Moreover, the record shows that the Governor, Mr. Riddick, and Ms. Smith-Bauk were rarely in the Baltimore office during the time period in question. As Mr. Riddick stated in his affidavit, \u201cI did not work in that office any more than a few times each month during the six months at issue.\u201d Ms. Smith-Bauk stated that she \u201cdid not often use ... [the office] or the telephones there.\u201d The three officials\u2019 possible use of the telephones in the Baltimore office during the time period in question, to make long distance calls, is far too speculative for treating the bills as telephone records of the Governor, Ms. Smith-Bauk, and Mr. Riddick. Accordingly, the long distance telephone bills for the Baltimore office are beyond the scope of the Post\u2019s request for telephone records.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">For the same reason, the telephone records of calls originating in Shaw House and the Washington, D.C., office are beyond the scope of the telephone records request. The record clearly shows that none of the three officials have either offices or designated telephone lines at these locations. In addition, Chief of Staff Riddick stated in his affidavit that \u201cI cannot recall if I ever was in the Washington office from February through July 1996, and I certainly was not there with any regularity.\u201d Ms. Smith-Bauk said essentially the same thing in her affidavit. The record is clear that the use of the telephones in both Shaw House and the Washington office by the three officials would have been rare, if it occurred at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>all, during the period in question. Consequently, the request for telephone billing records from these locations should also have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The telephone records from the State House are numerous and complex. These records document only long distance calls. Carol Cordial, the Assistant Director of the Division of Telecommunications, explained this system in detail in her affidavit. To summarize, the offices of the Governor and Ms. Smith-Bauk are located within the same suite of offices, which is served by eighteen separate telephone lines. Five other people work in that suite and use the telephones. Because use of the different telephone instruments within the entire suite is not restricted, anyone within the suite can use any one of the instruments and, therefore, could access all eighteen lines. As a result, the telephone bills reveal the lines from which individual calls are made but do not, and cannot, reveal who placed each call. Mr. Riddick\u2019s office, which is located in a separate suite, is also served by numerous telephone lines (seven in all), which can be accessed on separate instruments. Three assistants to Mr. Riddick also work in this suite and use the telephones. Again, the records from Mr. Riddick\u2019s office do not reveal who placed the individual calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">To repeat, the Post\u2019s telephone records request was limited to the calls of the Governor, Mr. Riddick, and Ms. Smith-Bauk. Based on the scope of the request as well as the uncontradicted evidence, we believe that the trial court erred by not limiting the number of telephone lines at issue in the State House. Although it is difficult to determine who placed each call listed on the voluminous telephone bills, the lines at issue can be limited based upon the individual to whom the specific lines were assigned, and by whom they were most easily accessed and most frequently used. The Governor could access five lines directly from his immediate office, and Ms. Smith-Bauk could access six lines directly from her office (three of which were the same as three of the lines that the Governor could access). Finally, Mr. Riddick could access six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>lines from his office. Fourteen lines in all, they were designated in the record below as lines A, B, C, D, E, N, O, P, S, U, V, W, X, and Y. These are the lines from which it is reasonable to conclude that the three officials made most, if not all, of their calls while in the State House.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Therefore, we have limited the telephone records at issue to: (1) the fourteen lines from the State House as designated above, and (2) the cellular telephones assigned to the Governor, Ms. Smith-Bauk, and Mr. Riddick. These records are available and are, generally, within the scope of the Post\u2019s request. Nevertheless, redactions within these records would seem to be in order because some individual entries appear to be beyond the scope of the Post\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In the records and documents submitted to the Circuit Court for <em>in camera </em>review, several items were designated as \u201cOther Persons\u2019 Calls,\u201d meaning that they were made by persons other than the Governor, Ms. Smith-Bauk, and Mr. Riddick. Kelly Derthick, Executive Assistant to the Governor, Jennifer Crawford, Special Assistant to the Governor, and Anne Budowski, Senior Assistant to Chief of Staff Riddick, stated in their affidavits that they reviewed the telephone records from the State House and that they identified calls which they made themselves or which were placed by staff members other than the three officials. Ms. Budowski and Andrea Leahy-Fucheck, then Legal Counsel to the Governor, also stated in their affidavits that they reviewed the schedules of the Governor and the Chief of Staff and were able to identify time periods during which the two officials were out of the office and therefore could not have placed telephone calls. All of these calls were specifically identified and placed within the \u201cOther Persons\u2019 Calls\u201d category in the material submitted to the trial court <em>in camera. </em>Unless, upon remand, the Circuit Court believes that it needs further information regarding the source of these calls, they would seem to be beyond the scope of the Post\u2019s request and should be redacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The material submitted to the Circuit Court <em>in camera </em>also categorized individual calls placed on the cellular phones assigned to the Governor, Ms. Smith-Bauk, and Mr. Riddick. Similar to the calls identified as being made by \u201cother persons\u201d in the State House, calls from the three cellular phones assigned to the Governor were frequently made by the Maryland State Police troopers in the Executive Protection Unit and did not involve conversations of the Governor. Captain Gary Shields, Commander of the Executive Protection Unit, stated in his affidavit that he reviewed the bills from the Governor\u2019s three cellular phones and, \u201c[b]ased on the identification of the numbers called, the length of the calls, and their relationship to other calls,\u201d he was \u201creasonably certain\u201d that calls categorized in the \u201cIn Camera Schedule\u201d under the heading \u201cExecutive Protection Unit\u201d were calls by the troopers and not by the Governor. Again, unless the trial court on remand believes that it needs more information, these calls appear to be beyond the scope of the Post\u2019s request and should be redacted from the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">As noted earlier, <em>supra </em>note 4, the Governor\u2019s scheduling records include wholly personal meetings and family engagements. The defendants argue that such records should be exempt from disclosure. According to the Post\u2019s brief in this Court, \u201c[t]he Post advised the Circuit Court that it would not object to the redaction of calendar items corresponding to family events ... so long as there was a proper evidentiary showing supporting such redactions.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s brief at 45, n.29). The Circuit Court made no specific ruling that the defendants\u2019 evidentiary showing in this regard was insufficient. Upon remand, unless the trial court desires more evidence that a particular calendar item is entirely personal or family, these items should be redacted based on the Post\u2019s representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">We next address the defendants\u2019 arguments that various portions of the records fall within specific Public Information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Act exemptions in \u00a7\u00a7 10 \u2014 616(d) and (i) (letters of reference and personnel records), 10-617(d) (commercial information), 10-617(e) (home addresses and telephone numbers of state or local government employees), and 10-618(b) (interagency or intra-agency letters or memoranda).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Preliminarily, however, it would be useful to underscore certain well-established general principles governing the interpretation and application of the Maryland Public Information Act. This Court recently reiterated in <em>Kirwan v. The Diamondback, </em>352 Md. 74, 80-81, 721 A.2d 196, 199 (1998), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">\u201c[t]he Maryland Public Information Act establishes a public policy and a general presumption in favor of disclosure of government or public documents. The statute thus provides (\u00a7 10-612(a) and (b) of the State Government Article):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYU\">\u2018(a) <em>General Right to information. </em>\u2014 All persons are entitled to have access to information about the affairs of government and the official acts of public officials and employees.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">(b) <em>General construction. </em>\u2014 To carry out the right set forth in subsection (a) of this section, unless an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of a person in interest would result, this Part III of this subtitle shall be construed in favor of permitting inspection of a public record, with the least cost and least delay -to the person or governmental unit that requests the inspection.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfU\">Accordingly, as we pointed out in <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 84, 721 A.2d at 200, \u201cthe statute should be interpreted to favor disclosure.\u201d <em>See also, e.g., Office of the Attorney General v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number><em>Gallagher, </em>359 Md. 341, 343, 753 A.2d 1036, 1037 (2000) (\u201cthe Act is to be construed in favor of disclosure\u201d); <em>Office of State Prosecutor v.

Montgomery County, </em>300 Md. 759, 771, 481 A.2d 221, 227 (1984) (\u201cWithout doubt the bias of the Md. Act is toward disclosure\u201d); <em>Faulk v.

Dept. of Health, </em>128 Md.App. 194, 226-227, 736 A.2d 1185, 1201-1202 (1999). Concomitantly, \u201ccourts must interpret the exemptions narrowly,\u201d <em>Fioretti v. Board of Dental Examiners, supra, </em>351 Md. at 77, 716 A.2d at 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Moreover, \u201cthe public agency involved bears the burden in sustaining its denial of the inspection of public records.\u201d <em>Fioretti </em>351 Md. at 78, 716 A.2d at 264. <em>See Cranford v.

An <em>in camera </em>inspection by the trial court, while not always necessary, may in some cases be \u201cneeded in order to make a responsible determination on claims of exemptions.\u201d <em>Cranford, </em>300 Md. at 779, 481 A.2d at 231. In addition, if parts of a record are exempt but other parts can be revealed, the Act favors severability. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii); <em>Cranford, </em>300 Md. at 774, 481 A.2d at 228-229.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In the material submitted to the Circuit Court for <em>in camera </em>review, the defendants identified certain appointment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>or scheduling records and telephone records which, they claimed, fell within the Act\u2019s exemptions set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 10-616(d) and (i). Section 10-616 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">\u201c(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Unless otherwise provided by law, a custodian shall deny inspection of a public record, as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">\u201c(d) <em>Letters of reference. </em>\u2014 A custodian shall deny inspection of a letter of reference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">\u201c(i) <em>Personnel records. </em>\u2014 (1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a custodian, shall deny inspection of a personnel record of an individual, including an application, performance rating, or scholastic achievement information.

But the mere fact that the Governor, or one of his staff, telephoned or met with an identified person to obtain information about a prospective appointee is certainly not \u201ca letter of reference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">With regard to the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exemption, this Court in <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 82-83, 721 A.2d at 200, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9u\">\u201cThe term \u2018personnel record\u2019 is not expressly defined in the statute. Nonetheless, the language of subsection (i) discloses what type of documents the Legislature considered to be personnel records. The statute lists three categories of documents which are: (1) an application for employment; (2) performance rating; and (3) scholastic achievement. Although this list was probably not intended to be exhaustive, it does reflect a legislative intent that \u2018personnel records\u2019 mean those documents that directly pertain to employment and an employee\u2019s ability to perform a job.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The Court went on in <em>Kirwan </em>to point out that records which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7j\">\u201cdo not relate to [the employee\u2019s] hiring, discipline, promotion, dismissal, or any matter involving his status as an employee .... do not fit within the commonly understood meaning of the term \u2018personnel records.\u2019 \u201d 352 Md. at 83, 721 A.2d at 200.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">We concluded in the <em>Kinvan </em>opinion by stating that, in light of the Act\u2019s policy favoring disclosure, the General Assembly did not intend \u201cthat <em>any </em>record identifying an employee would be exempt from disclosure as a personnel record.\u201d 352 Md. at 84, 721 A.2d at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>The identification of the telephone number which the Governor or a member of his staff called, or the identification of someone with whom the Governor met, concerning a possible future appointment to a judgeship or position in the executive branch of state government, would not amount to a \u201cpersonnel record\u201d as defined in <em>Kirwan. </em>The simple record of what number was called, or with whom the Governor met, about possible <em>future </em>employment would not relate to the discipline, promotion, dismissal, status, job performance, or achievement of an existing or former employee. Again, while the substance of the conversations might in some cases fall in the category of \u201capplication for employment\u201d or relate to \u201chiring,\u201d the fact that the Governor or a staff member telephoned or met with an identified individual would not be a \u201cpersonnel record\u201d under any \u201ccommonly understood meaning of the term,\u201d <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 83, 721 A.2d at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Section 10-617(d) of the Public Information Act states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">\u201c(d) <em>Commercial information. </em>\u2014 A custodian shall deny inspection of the part of a public record that contains any of the following information provided by or obtained from any person or governmental unit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">(1) a trade secret;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">(2) \u2022 confidential commercial information.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">The defendants argue that the affidavits of the Governor and Chief of Staff Riddick identified specific telephone calls which involved \u201ceconomic development projects,\u201d or \u201csensitive and confidential negotiations over\u201d such economic development projects, or \u201cconfidential efforts to resolve a strike in Maryland,\u201d or \u201csensitive discussions relating to a major public transportation project.\u201d (Petitioners\u2019 brief at 47-48). The defendants maintain that \u201cthe circuit court should have found those calls to be exempt from disclosure under ... the specific statutory exemption for confidential commercial information ... [in] \u00a7 10-617(d).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 47).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Again, while records, memoranda, or notes of what was said during these conversations might amount to \u201cconfidential commercial information,\u201d the fact that the Governor or Mr. Riddick made a telephone call to a particular number is not itself, standing alone, \u201ccommercial\u201d information. In order to so qualify, the defendants would need to explain, for <em>in camera </em>consideration by the court, why the record of each such allegedly sensitive telephone call, if turned over to the Post, would place the Post in the position of potentially jeopardizing government projects or negotiations at critical stages of development. When the trial court, on remand, reconsiders any exemption claimed under \u00a7 10-617(d), as now asserted or as amplified on remand, it may consider in the balancing test how the staleness that now inheres by virtue of the passage of time affects the \u201cconfidential\u201d nature of any assertedly protected information.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The Public Information Act in \u00a7 10-617(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahd-dedup-0\">\u201c(e) <em>Public employees. </em>\u2014 Subject to \u00a7 21-504 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, a custodian shall deny inspection of the part of a public record that contains the home address or telephone number of an employee of a unit or instrumentality of the State or of a political subdivision unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">(1) the employee gives permission for the inspection; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">(2) the unit or instrumentality that employs the individual determines that inspection is needed to protect the public interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The defendants assert that, in the Circuit Court, they \u201cspecifically identified 94 telephone calls to State employees at home where the telephone records thus list the employee\u2019s home telephone number. * * * [Defendants] did not argue for complete redaction of those calls; they argued only that the employees\u2019 home telephone numbers must be redacted, leaving all other data about the calls.\u201d (Petitioners\u2019 brief at 49).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The Post counters that the defendants \u201cfailed to present the court with any evidentiary support for the claim \u2014 which, at a minimum, would have needed to include the names of the alleged employees whose numbers were being withheld, so that the validity of the proposed redactions could be tested.\u201d (Respondents\u2019 brief at 43, n.26).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The record discloses that affidavits by the Governor\u2019s Legal Counsel and by the Senior Assistant to Chief of Staff Riddick, submitted in connection with the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, stated, either as a matter of the affiants\u2019 personal knowledge or of the knowledge of other staff members -with whom they spoke, that the descriptions of various categories, including the category of employees\u2019 home telephone numbers, were accurate. The trial judge did not specifically find that the evidence was insufficient to show that the 94 numbers were home telephone numbers of state employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">With two exceptions which are inapplicable here, the statute flatly exempts from disclosure the home telephone numbers of state or local government employees. The only evidence submitted to the trial court indicates that the 94 numbers called were in fact home telephone numbers of state government employees. On remand these numbers should be redacted unless the trial court concludes that it needs more information. In this connection, we point out that, if the trial court requires the submission of the state employees\u2019 names in order to verify that the numbers are in fact telephone numbers of state employees, such submission should be <em>in camera. </em>It would largely defeat the exemption for public employees\u2019 home telephone numbers if their names were made public, thereby allowing anyone to look up their telephone numbers in a telephone directory. Under these circumstances, the exemption would effectively apply only to public employees with unlisted home telephone numbers. This would obviously not be consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Section 10-618 of the Maryland Public Information Act gives a custodian discretion to deny inspection of parts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>specified categories of public records if the custodian believes that such inspection would be contrary to the public interest. One of those categories consists of \u201cinteragency or intra-agency letter[s] or memorand[a].\u201d Thus, \u00a7 10-618(a) and (b) state as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\">\u201c \u00a7 10-618. Permissible denials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Unless otherwise provided by law, if a custodian believes that inspection of a part of a public record by the applicant would be contrary to the public interest, the custodian may deny inspection by the applicant of that part, as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">(b) <em>Interagency and intra-agency documents. </em>\u2014 A custodian may deny inspection of any part of an interagency or intra-agency letter or memorandum that would not be available by law to a private party in litigation with the unit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">This permissible exemption for interagency and intra-agency letters or memoranda to some extent reflects that part of the executive privilege doctrine encompassing letters, memoranda or similar internal government documents containing confidential opinions, deliberations, advice or recommendations from one governmental employee or official to another official for the purpose of assisting the latter official in the decision-making function. <em>Cranford v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>300 Md. at 772-774, 481 A.2d at 227-228. <em>See also Hamilton, Superintendent v. Verdow, supra,, </em>287 Md. at 553-562, 414 A.2d at 920-924.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">We shall later, in Part V of this opinion, consider whether any of the telephone and scheduling records might be exempt from disclosure under the doctrine of executive privilege and \u00a7 10-615(1) of the Maryland Public Information Act. Regardless of whether some of the records might be exempt as \u201cprivileged\u201d material under \u00a7 10-615(1), however, it seems obvious that a bill from a telephone company or a simple scheduling record does not constitute \u201can interagency or intraagency letter or memorandum\u201d under \u00a7 10-618(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Preliminarily, a bill from a telephone company is not created by any governmental agency or unit. Under the language of the federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5), which contains an exemption for interagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters and which is worded the same as \u00a7 10-618(b) of the Maryland Act, the courts have held that the exemption is limited to documents created by government agencies or agents, or by outside consultants called upon by a government agency \u201cto assist it in internal decisionmaking.\u201d <em>County of Madison v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>641 F.2d 1036, 1040 (1st Cir.1981). <em>See, e.g., Van Bourg, Allen, Weinberg &amp; Roger v. NLRB, </em>751 F.2d 982, 985 (9th Cir.1985) (\u201cexemption 5 by its terms applies only to internal agency documents or documents prepared by outsiders who have a formal relationship with the agency,\u201d and does not apply to affidavits submitted to the NLRB by private parties in the course of an investigation); <em>Ryan v. Department of Justice, </em>617 F.2d 781 (D.C.Cir.1980); <em>Wu v.

A bill from a telephone service provider, charging for the listed telephone calls made, is not a document from a government agency or agency consultant employed to assist the agency in its decision-making function.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Moreover, bills from telephone companies and simple listings of the persons who have appointments with the Governor are not, under any ordinary meaning of the statutory language, letters or memoranda. For example, in <em>Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court, </em>53 Cal.3d 1325, 283 CaLRptr. 893, 813 P.2d 240 (1991), the Supreme Court of California construed, <em>inter alia, </em>an exemption from disclosure in the California Public Records Act for \u201cCorrespondence of and to the Governor or employees of the Governor\u2019s office.\u201d 53 Cal.3d at 1336-1337, 283 Cal.Rptr. at 893-894, 813 P.2d at 246. The Court rejected the Governor\u2019s argument that \u201chis calendars and schedules\u201d constituted correspondence within the meaning of the exemption, pointing out that \u201ccorrespondence\u201d means \u201ccommunication by letters.\u201d 53 Cal.3rd at 1337, 283 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>at 900, 813 P.2d at 247.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Cf.

Montgomery County, supra, </em>300 Md. at 771-776, 481 A.2d at 227-229, only certain types of letters and memoranda fall within the exemption in \u00a7 10-618(b). As a threshold matter, however, to come within the exemption a document must be an \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency letter or memorandum.\u201d Even if those terms are given a broad scope, the telephone bills and scheduling records here involved fail to meet this threshold test.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Finally, the defendants rely on some cases from other jurisdictions which are based on statutory language or exemptions which are different from the language and exemptions of the Maryland Public Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">A principal case relied on by the defendants is <em>Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 1325, 283 Cal.Rptr. 893, 813 P.2d 240. As pointed out by the Supreme Court of California in that opinion, the California Public Records Act contains \u201ca \u2018catchall\u2019 exemption that permits the government agency to withhold a record if it can demonstrate that \u2018 ... <em>the public interest served by not making the record public clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record.\u2019\u2019 </em>\u201d 53 Cal.3d at 1338, 283 Cal.Rptr. at 895, 813 P.2d at 247-248, emphasis in original. The Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Court of California decided that the Governor\u2019s \u201ccalendars and schedules\u201d fell within this exemption, holding \u201cthat the public interest served by not disclosing the Governor\u2019s appointment calendars and schedules clearly and substantially outweighs the public interest in their disclosure.\u201d 53 Cal.3d at 1347, 283 Cal.Rptr. at 907, 813 P.2d at 254. <em>See also Courier-Journal v. Jones, </em>895 S.W.2d 6 (Ky.App.1995), adopting the holding of the <em>Times Mirror </em>case in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Nevertheless, as the defendants acknowledge, the Maryland Public Information Act does not contain a general \u201ccatchall\u201d public interest exemption. Instead, for a record to be exempt from disclosure because of the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d it must fall within one of the specific categories set forth in \u00a7 10-618. <em>See Kirwan v. The Diamondback, supra, </em>352 Md. at 87-88, 721 A.2d at 202-203; <em>Cranford v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>300 Md. at 770, 481 A.2d at 226-227. The records at issue in the present case fall within none of the categories delineated in \u00a7 10-618.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The defendants also rely on <em>Bureau of Nat. Affairs v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>742 F.2d 1484, 1496 (D.C.Cir.1984), in which the court held that government officials\u2019 telephone message slips and certain appointment calendars that \u201cwere not <em>distributed </em>to other employees, but were retained solely for the convenience of the individual officials,\u201d did not constitute \u201cagency records\u201d within the meaning of the federal Freedom of Information Act. The court also held that \u201cdaily agendas,\u201d indicating the schedule of the head of the Department of Justice\u2019s Antitrust Division, which was circulated to certain members of his staff, were \u201cagency records\u201d and were disclosable. 742 F.2d at 1495. <em>See also Washington Post v. U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number><em>Dept. of State, </em>632 F.Supp. 607 (D.D.C.1986) (records of the Secretary of State\u2019s schedule are \u201cagency records\u201d and disc-losable under the federal statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">The records which were held to be nondisclosable in the <em>Bureau of Nat. Affairs </em>case are dissimilar from the records involved in the case at bar. We do not have before us telephone message slips or an official\u2019s appointment calendar which is not distributed to any other employees, and we express no opinion as to the disclosability of such material under Maryland law. In addition, the records held to be disclosable in the <em>Bureau of Nat. Affairs </em>case appear to be similar to the Governor\u2019s scheduling records involved in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Nonetheless, the precise statutory issue in the <em>Bureau of Nat. Affairs </em>case, namely whether certain documents made by a governmental unit constitute \u201cagency records,\u201d does not arise under the Maryland Act. As discussed in Part II A of this opinion, <em>supra, </em>the federal statute applies only to \u201cagency records.\u201d In light of the legislative history underlying this term and the ease law construing it, not all records made by or received by a federal governmental unit or instrumentality constitute \u201cagency records.\u201d The Maryland Act, on the other hand, uses the term \u201cpublic record\u201d which includes <em>\u201cany </em>documentary material\u201d which is \u201cmade by a unit or instrumentality\u201d of the government and \u201cis in <em>any </em>form.... \u201d (Emphasis added). Consequently, cases deciding whether governmental documents are \u201cagency records\u201d within the meaning of the federal statute are not very pertinent in determining whether a governmental document is disclosable under the Maryland Public Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The defendants argue that the \u201cprivacy interests\u201d of the public officials and the persons called would be invaded by a disclosure of the Governor\u2019s office telephone records, and they cite, <em>inter alia, </em>the New Jersey Superior Court\u2019s opinion in <em>North Jersey Newspaper Co. v. Passaic County Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>245 N.J.Super. 113, 584 A.2d 275 (1990), <em>modified and remanded for further proceedings, North Jersey Newspa</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number><em>pers Co. v. Passaic County Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>127 N.J. 9, 601 A.2d 693 (1992). The Superior Court in that case held that telephone billing records of public officials were public records under the New Jersey \u201cRight-To-Know Law\u201d but that they were exempt from disclosure because of \u201cthe privacy interests of elected officials in the telephone calls they make while performing their public duties.... \u201d 245 N. J.Super. at 121, 584 A.2d at 279. The Supreme Court of New Jersey, however, in modifying and remanding the case, held that the New Jersey \u201cRight-To-Know Law\u201d gave a right of access only to records \u201c \u2018required by law to be made, maintained or kept,\u2019 \u201d and that telephone bills did not fall within such category. 127 N.J. at 13-14, 601 A.2d at 695. The Maryland Public Information Act is not limited to public records which are required by law to be made, maintained, or kept, and thus the ultimate holding in the <em>North Jersey Newspapers </em>case has little relevance in cases under the Maryland Act. Furthermore, unlike the public information acts in some states, \u201cthe Maryland Public Information Act does not contain an exemption for particular cases whenever the disclosure of a record might cause an \u2018unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kirwan v.

This Court in the <em>Hamilton </em>case thus explained (287 Md. at 558, 414 A.2d at 922):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>\u201cThe necessity for some protection from disclosure clearly extends to confidential advisory and deliberative communications between officials and those who assist them in formulating and deciding upon future governmental action. A fundamental part of the decisional process is the analysis of different options and alternatives. Advisory communications, from a subordinate to a governmental officer, which examine and analyze these choices, are often essential to this process. The making of candid communications by the subordinate may well be hampered if their contents are expected to become public knowledge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">After reviewing cases in the United States Supreme Court and other courts, we pointed out in <em>Hamilton </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">\u201cthe cases throughout the country, both federal and state, have recognized the doctrine of executive privilege which, in addition to state and military secrets, gives a measure of protection to the deliberative and mental processes of decision-makers.\u201d 287 Md. at 561, 414 A.2d at 924.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The Court went on in <em>Hamilton </em>to hold that the privilege \u201cis for the benefit of the public and not the governmental officials who claim the privilege\u201d (287 Md. at 563, 414 A.2d at 924), that the privilege is not absolute, and that in \u201cmany situations the courts have engaged in a balancing process, weighing the need for confidentiality against the ... need for disclosure and the impact of nondisclosure upon the fair administration of justice.\u201d 287 Md. at 563, 414 A.2d at 925. We also held in <em>Hamilton </em>that when a government official makes a formal claim of executive privilege for confidential communications \u201cof an advisory or deliberative nature, there is a presumptive privilege, with the burden upon those seeking to compel disclosure.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Turning to factual documents as opposed to documents of an advisory or deliberative nature, we held in <em>Hamilton </em>that \u201c[ojrdinarily, \u2018memoranda consisting only of compiled factual material\u2019\u201d are disclosable, 287 Md. at 564, 414 A.2d at 925, quoting <em>EPA v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 87, 93 S.Ct. 827, 836, 35 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>L.Ed.2d 119, 132 (1973). We recognized in <em>Hamilton, </em>287 Md. at 564-565, 414 A.2d at 925-926, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ait-dedup-0\">\u201cmaterial cannot always \u2018easily be separated into fact finding and decision making categories,\u2019 <em>Boeing Airplane Company v. Coggeshall, supra, </em>280 F.2d at 662. Moreover, some factual material is entitled to a degree of protection under the privilege, although not to the same extent as opinions and recommendations. This would include facts obtained upon promises or understandings of confidentiality, investigative facts underlying and intertwined with opinions and advice, and facts the disclosure of which would impinge on the deliberative process. <em>See, e.g., </em>(relating to one type or another of such factual material): <em>EPA v.

Superior Court, </em>the California Court\u2019s general observations regarding an analytical approach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>when considering assertions of executive privilege as to purely factual documents are worth mentioning (58 Cal.3d at 1341-1342, 283 Cal.Rptr. at 903, 813 P.2d at 250 (citations omitted)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\">\u201cIn determining whether a document falls within the ... [deliberative process/executive privilege exemption], the federal courts' have also recognized \u2018that it requires different treatment for materials reflecting deliberative or policy-making processes on the one hand, and purely factual, investigative matters on the other.\u2019 The courts have readily acknowledged, however, that the fact/opinion dichotomy may be misleading, and have refused to apply it in a mechanical or unthinking manner. The privilege, as one appeals court has written, \u2018is intended to protect the deliberative <em>process </em>of government and not just deliberative <em>material.\u2019 </em>Accordingly, in some circumstances \u2018the disclosure of even purely factual material may so expose the deliberative process ... that it must be deemed exempted.... \u2019 Decisions holding the exemption to be applicable even to \u2018purely factual material\u2019 are legion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">\u201cIn short, the courts\u2019 focus ... is less on the nature of the records sought and more on the effect of the records\u2019 release. The key question in every case is \u2018whether the disclosure of materials would expose an agency\u2019s decision-making process in such a way as to discourage candid discussion within the agency and thereby undermine the agency\u2019s ability to perform its functions.\u2019 Even if the content of a document is purely factual, it is nonetheless exempt from public scrutiny if it is \u2018actually ... related to the process by which policies are formulated\u2019 or \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with \u2018policy-making processes.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Although in the present case we need not go as far as the California Court in <em>Times-Mirror </em>did in applying the above analysis to its facts and legal context (because we are remanding this matter for further consideration), an example of how that court applied the analysis may be illustrative for the Circuit Court\u2019s consideration on remand (53 Cal.3d at 1343, 283 Cal.Rptr. at 904, 813 P.2d at 251):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>\u201cDisclosing the identity of persons with whom the Governor has met and consulted [may be] the functional equivalent of revealing the substance or direction of the Governor\u2019s judgment and mental processes; such information [may] indicate which interests or individuals he deemed to be of significance with respect to critical issues of the moment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">In light of the above-summarized principles, it is clear that the trial court correctly rejected the defendants\u2019 blanket claim of executive privilege encompassing all of the telephone and scheduling records here involved. Bills from telephone service providers and listings of scheduled appointments are not communications \u201cof an advisory or deliberative nature,\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>287 Md. at 563, 414 A.2d at 925. Accordingly, under <em>Hamilton, </em>\u201ca presumptive privilege\u201d does not attach to them upon the claim of executive privilege, and the burden was upon the defendants to establish that the records were privileged. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Considering the defendants\u2019 assertion of an executive privilege exemption on an item-by-item basis requires application of the balancing test discussed in <em>Hamilton, </em>287 Md. at 564-567, 414 A.2d at 925-927. Although the weight in the <em>Hamilton </em>balancing test given the request of the person seeking the governmental record was grounded in the discovery rights of a party in pre-existing litigation,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the initial weight accorded the plaintiffs request in the balancing test in the present case has been pre-determined legislatively by the Maryland Public Information Act\u2019s general, but explicit, disposition favoring disclosure. Because the records at issue here reflect only factual material, and there yet has been no contention made that they \u201cinclude facts obtained upon prom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>ises or understandings of confidentiality, [or] investigative facts underlying and intertwined with opinions and advice,\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>287 Md. at 565, 414 A.2d at 926,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> an <em>in camera </em>review and balancing test application are appropriate. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10 \u2014 623(c)(2). As noted earlier, the defendants\u2019 assertion of a blanket executive privilege, with its attendant presumption in favor of non-disclosure, fails because the records sought to be protected patently do not represent the content of confidential communications of an advisory or deliberative nature. <em>Hamilton, </em>287 Md. at 563, 414 A.2d at 925. Rather, the defendants\u2019 claimed exemptions seek to protect records from which such content may be inferred or discovered. Such a basis for the claimed exemption falls at best at the fringes or perimeter of potentially protectable records for which an <em>in camera </em>review and balancing test are necessary to assure proper vindication of the competing interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The defendants assert that the telephone and scheduling records constitute \u201cfacts the disclosure of which would impinge on the deliberative process.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>287 Md. at 565, 414 A.2d at 926. They make various arguments in support of this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">First, the defendants seem to argue that disclosure of the names of persons with whom the Governor met or who were telephoned by the Governor, Mr. Riddick, or Ms. Smith-Bauk, would violate the privacy rights of those officials and the persons with whom they spoke, and would make persons reluctant in the future to give the Governor advice since their names might be revealed.

That is not necessarily dispositive of defendants\u2019 claim here.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Furthermore, although the substance of what an adviser tells a public official may be entitled to some protection under the executive privilege doctrine, nothing in <em>Hamilton, </em>or the cases there relied upon, suggests that executive privilege permits nondisclosure of every adviser\u2019s name. The <em>Hamilton </em>case involved a confidential report from the Governor\u2019s Chief Legislative Officer and Legal Counsel which contained opinions and recommendations for the Governor\u2019s use, and we held that the report, or parts of the report, fell within the doctrine of executive privilege and might not have to be disclosed. Giving free range to the defendants\u2019 argument in the case at bar, a Governor could keep secret the name of his Chief Legislative Officer and Legal Counsel, or the names of some other staff members who advise him. We do not believe that the privilege for confidential communications of an advisory or deliberative nature extends so far as to keep secret the names of all advisers.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The defendants have yet to present evidence supporting their assertion that the mere public disclosure of the Governor\u2019s Office telephone bills or of the Governor\u2019s prior appointments will have a chilling effect upon the willingness of persons to render advice to the Governor. And, as stated above, we recognize no general executive privilege for public officials\u2019 office telephone bills or scheduling records. Nevertheless, this case is being remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings. Our opinion does not preclude the defendants from attempting to show the trial court, on remand, that because of identified special circumstances, disclosure of a specific telephone number, or certain specific numbers, or disclosure of specific scheduling records, will interfere with the deliberative process in the Governor\u2019s Office. If the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>court concludes that the defendants have made a sufficient showing as to any specific telephone call or any specific appointment, it should redact the records accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The defendants argue that some of the telephone calls and meetings with the Governor relate to economic development projects and efforts \u201cto attract businesses to locate headquarters or operations in Maryland. * * * With access on demand to the Governor\u2019s telephone records, reporters easily could identify a series- of telephone calls to a particular company, inferring negotiation activity. * * * [T]he simple contact by a reporter to such a company could scare away that potential source of economic development.\u201d (Petitioners\u2019 brief at 28-24). The defendants make a similar argument with regard to recruiting persons for high level state employment such as a presidency of a state university. At the time the Post brought this suit in December 1997, it was seeking telephone bills and scheduling records for a six-month period from February 1, 1996, through July 31, 1996. In other words, the Post was seeking records of telephone calls and appointments for one and a half to two years in the past. The records sought are now four years old. Present disclosure of four-year-old telephone or scheduling records may or may not upset current economic development negotiations or recruitment negotiations which might fail if they are not kept confidential. Current disclosure of telephone numbers or meetings relative to such negotiations that have expired or been consummated may or may not have a sufficiently inhibitory effect on the Governor\u2019s ability to maintain similar negotiations in the future. Our decision in this case is without prejudice to the defendants\u2019 making a showing to the Circuit Court on remand that a particular four-year-old telephone number or scheduling record either is still involved in current confidential economic development or recruitment negotiations and that present disclosure of that number or record will interfere with the negotiations, or that such disclosure is likely to interfere substantially with the Governor\u2019s ability to have such negotiations in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>To reiterate, we reject the defendants\u2019 argument that the factual records here involved are generally subject to executive privilege and, therefore, are nondisclosable under \u00a7 10-615(1) of the Act. Nonetheless, if the defendants upon remand are able to demonstrate that certain specific records or portions thereof are privileged under the principles set forth in <em>Hamilton, </em>287 Md. at 564-565, 414 A.2d at 925-926, and in this opinion, the Circuit Court should permit redactions of that material.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

The defendants in the Circuit Court also \u2018\u2018identified for redaction all personal calls placed by any one of the three officials at issue from their office locations,\u201d arguing that because a personal \"call does not involve State business, the record of the call should not be considered a public record\u201d (petitioners\u2019 brief at 46-47). We do not agree totally. Although the content of such calls may be private, the bill from a telephone company to the State, for calls made from state offices by state officials or employees on state telephones during their working hours, clearly falls within the definition of \"public record\u201d in the Act. It is a document received by a unit of government, and, in our view, it is \"in connection with the transaction of public business.\u201d Although employees must occasionally make personal telephone calls from their employers' phones during working hours, the frequency of and the amount of time spent on such calls is clearly a matter of legitimate concern to the employer. This is true regardless of whether there exists a reimbursement record. The taxpayers and citizens of Maryland, as the employers of state officials and employees, have a legitimate interest in the frequency and length of personal telephone calls made on state office telephones. That interest may be vindicated, however, by disclosure of the aggregated totals of time spent and charges incurred on calls devoted to personal business versus public business. Thus, absent evidence of abuse, this degree of disclosure would be sufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\">.

I believe that the doctrine of separation of powers, which, unlike its federal counterpart, is incorporated expressly in the Constitution of Maryland through the Declaration of Rights, does not permit the Legislature to create laws that can be used directly to require the Governor to make his nonpublic activities public, while acting as Governor, including his duties of appointment, scheduling of private interviews and many of the other duties inherent to the position of Chief Officer of the heretofore separate and independent executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Today, the majority imposes a heavier burden on the Governor than the federal courts, including the Supreme Court of the United States, have imposed upon the President, even though the federal courts view the doctrine of separation of powers as an implied doctrine. The doctrine is nowhere stated in the Constitution of the United States, the Bill of Rights, or the constitutional amendments enacted thereafter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Conversely, Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\">Article 8. Separation of powers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">That the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers of Government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other; and no person exercising the functions of one of . said Departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Maryland\u2019s recognition of the separation of powers is found not just in the express provisions of Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights. The Maryland Constitution, Article II, Section 17, adopted in the Constitution of 1867, provides: \u201cTo guard against hasty or partial legislation and encroachment of the Legislative Department upon the co-ordinate Executive and Judicial Departments, every Bill ... [shall] be presented to the Governor.\u201d The initial clause of this provision notes that the reason for empowering the Governor with the veto power is to protect the separation of powers in Maryland. The comparable bill signing and veto provision in the United States Constitution, on the other hand, makes no mention of the importance of guarding against \u201cencroachment of the Legislative Department upon the co-ordinate Executive and Judicial Departments.\u201d It merely states that bills will be presented to the President for signing and provides the procedure to be followed should he or she refuse to sign a bill. <em>See </em>U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 7, cl. 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">It is my view that, especially in light of Maryland\u2019s express constitutional provisions, the majority is not sufficiently deferential to the mandates of the separation of powers doctrine. What the majority inflicts upon the doctrine and the Governor with its decision in this case may well come home to roost. No distinction between the executive and judicial branches is made in the applicability of Article 8.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Unlike the federal system, where separation of powers is implied, there is more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>room for interpretation recognizing the confidentiality needs of the judicial branch. There is little room to maneuver in Maryland when the doctrine, by express constitutional provision, includes all branches. The federal courts, unlike the majority today, recognize that the separation of powers, implied in the federal Constitution, protects the private office where the Chief Executive conducts public business from direct requests for records under the federal Freedom of Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">It is important to address the beginnings of the separation of powers doctrine in Maryland as an express constitutional provision. The first phrase, \u201c[t]hat the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers of Government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other,\u201d was in the original 1776 Declaration of Rights as Article 8.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It, along with the Constitution of Maryland, was passed on August 14, 1776. Significantly, the separation of powers doctrine was not included in the Declaration of Rights as an afterthought. It was an important aspect of the original constitution, and subject to some opposition. The Maryland Gazette of October 24, 1776, contained a poem, entitled <em>\u201cThe Song of the Man in the Moon,\u201d </em>apparently expressing displeasure with the inclusion of the provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAU\">I saw in labour to bring forth</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6cp\">A government of fame and worth:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">But when \u2018twas born, the granny said,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">The monster had a triple head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">Surely agreeable to nature,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">One head\u2019s enough for any creature;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>But if that head should be divided,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">How will the quarrel, be decided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">John C.

This resolution apparently was approved and embodied in the Article 6 restatement of the separation of powers doctrine in the 1851 Constitution, now found in Article 8. Alfred S. Niles, <em>Maryland Constitutional Law </em>10-11 (1915), indicates the importance our Framers, and this Court, placed on these early constitutional provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">The first constitution of Maryland was framed in the same year as [the] Declaration of Independence was adopted....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">This constitution, as amended from time to time, remained the fundamental law of our State until 1851, when a second constitution was adopted, which was succeeded by the Constitution of 1864, and that by the Constitution of 1867, which [in 1915 and now] is still in force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">\u201cConstitutions are not to be interpreted according to the words used in particular clauses.

It is the grand bulwark of all our rights, and every citizen has the deepest interest in its most sacred preservation. Each of these several departments should be kept, and should feel it to be its highest honor, to keep strictly within the constitutional boundaries assigned to it. The Legislature should not encroach upon the judiciary, nor upon the Executive; nor should either of those departments trench upon each other, or upon the legislative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Niles later discusses the adoption of the constitutional provision giving the Governor the veto power:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">In the Constitution of 1867 under Article [II], Section 17 the Governor\u2019s function in approving \u2014 or not \u2014 legislation was in significant part to guard against ... encroachment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>the Legislative Department upon the co-ordinate Executive and Judicial Department, ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><em>Id. </em>Niles specifically references this language as a distinct reason for the veto power in Maryland and contrasts it with the language of the federal constitutional provisions granting the veto power: \u201cIn the Federal Constitution, no reason is given for the existence of this power. In the Maryland Constitution, it is stated to be \u2018to guard against ... encroachments of the Legislative Department upon the [other] Departments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119. At the time that the veto language was being added by the 1867 Constitution, the 1867 Constitutional Convention, commenting on the Declaration of Rights and the new veto power, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">Sec. 17. The most important change of all concerning the Executive office, is investing it with the Veto Power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">The words in which this power is given are nearly the same as in the Constitution of the United States.

There is no way to know, however, why the citizens of Maryland rejected the proposed Constitution of 1968, which, among other things, attempted to abolish Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights, last readopted in the Constitution of 1867. \u201cThe proposed 1967-68 Constitution did not contain an explicit separation of powers provision relying, as does the United States Constitution, on the structure of the government to create the inference of separation. The proposed constitution was rejected by voters.\u201d Dan Friedman, <em>The History, Development, and Interpretation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, </em>71 Temp. L.Rev. 637, 688 n.194 (1998) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>As I perceive the history surrounding the adoption of the original separation of powers provision in the Declaration of Rights and the Constitution of 1776, it was based on the colonists\u2019 experiences in attempting to deal with, and suffering from, the rule of the Governor and his Council, an entity that exercised the power and control of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. To an extent, the colonists had suffered the same abuses from afar by the English Parliament. Moreover, prior to the adoption of the 1776 Declaration of Rights, the colonists had been subjected to a legislative body that acted like Parliament. The powers of the colonial legislature were described in an early Maryland case that construed a pre-Declaration of Rights colonial statute from 1773. In <em>Partridge v. Dorsey\u2019s Lessee, </em>3 H. &amp; J. 302, 322 (1810), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">At the time the Act of Assembly passed, the power and jurisdiction of the General Assembly of Maryland ... were as great and transcendent, as the power and jurisdiction of the Parliament of England, within the scope of their authority. And Sir Edward Coke informs us, \u201cthe power and jurisdiction of Parliament is so transcendent and absolute, that it cannot be confined, either for causes or persons, within any bounds.\u201d ... He [Sir William Blackstone] also declares, that \u201call mischiefs and grievances, operations and remedies, that transcend the ordinary course of the laws, are within the reach of this extraordinary tribunal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The citizens of the new Maryland had experienced numerous years of that type of governance, whereas the fledgling federal government had not, as a separate entity, been subject to the same problems because the federalist system did not then exist. The colonies formed the federal government in order, in part, to better withstand and fight the past abuses of Parliament and the colonial governors. At the time of the creation of the federal government, and later its constitutional framework, the federal system had no direct experience with the abuses of power when all functions of government repose in one entity. The states, particularly Maryland, as I interpret the events of 1776, considered the separation of powers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>be more important than the federal government ever did. The experience of the colonies had been first-hand. Because it was more important to them, Marylanders were not willing to rest upon an assumption that the doctrine would be implied from the form of the government they were adopting. They wanted it written in constitutional stone, not suggested by constitutional implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">With all due respect to the majority, the doctrine\u2019s history in this state calls for a <em>more </em>rigid adherence than that afforded to the federal implication of separation of powers, not the lesser standard the majority adopts with its position in this case. As the older cases note, the doctrine of separation of powers always has been a sacred trust in Maryland. Rather than affording it the status to which this Court previously has said it is entitled, the majority today relegates the doctrine to an unimportant requirement that the Legislature can ignore when it chooses. Although it opens the Governor\u2019s office to a highly-reputable newspaper in this case, the door remains open to any scandal rag searching for controversy in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The majority distances itself from most of this Court\u2019s basic, albeit early, cases on the subject of separation of powers. In <em>State v. Chase, </em>5 H. &amp; J. 297 (1821), we were faced with a challenge to the Legislature\u2019s imposition of additional <em>judicial </em>duties on judges. We upheld the power of that entity to impose judicial duties on the judicial branch but, in dicta, rejected any power to impose nonjudicial duties. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APq\">We hold it to be perfectly clear, that the Legislature may rightfully and constitutionally, impose upon the Judges any new and additional judicial duties....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">Such a right is inseparable from the genius of our institutions, and from the nature of things it must be so; if it were otherwise, Courts of justice would answer but half the purposes of their institution; and all Judges are supposed to accept their appointments, with a knowledge, and tacit consent, that their labors may from time to time be increased or diminished, according to public exigency \u2014 seldom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>diminished to be sure, though sometimes increased with no very sparing hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\">New judicial duties may often be unnecessarily imposed, <em>and services, not of a judicial nature, may sometimes be required. In the latter case, a Judge is under no legal obligation to perform them.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 304 (emphasis added). In <em>Crane, </em>1 G. &amp; J. at 472-73, the Court of Appeals opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">The Constitution of this State ... is the immediate work of the people, in their sovereign capacity, and contains standing evidences of their <em>permanent will. </em>It portions out supreme power, and assigns it to different departments, prescribing to each the authority it may exercise, and specifying that from the exercise of which it must abstain. The public functionaries move then in a subordinate character, and must conform to the fundamental laws or prescripts of the creating power. When they transcend defined limits, their acts are unauthorized, and being without warrant, are necessarily to be viewed as nullities. If considered as valid acts, the distinction between unlimited and circumscribed authority is done away, the derivative exerts original power, and of constitutional law nothing is left but the name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">The legislative department is nearest to the source of power, and is manifestly the predominant branch of government. Its authority is extensive and complex, and being less susceptible on that account of limitation, is more liable to be exceeded in practice.... The check to legislative encroachment is to be found in the declaration, that the legislative, executive, and judicial powers ought to be kept separate and distinct; and in the solemn obligations of fidelity to the Constitution, under which all legislative functions are performed. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-8\"><em>See also Mayhew, </em>2 Gill at 497; <em>Prout v. Berry, 2 </em>Gill 147, 149 (1844) (\u201c[T]he Legislature possessed no power in any given determination of the Court of Appeals, to declare what would be the rights of the parties; for however consistent with justice and equity such a declaration may have been, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Legislature could exercise no judicial power.\u201d); <em>Mitchell v.

State ex rel. Fiery, </em>8 Gill 145 (1849), the Legislature passed an Act in 1845 requiring the Washington County Court to grant an appeal in that case. In holding that the Legislature violated the constitution by attempting to exercise judicial power, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">[W]e think it manifest that the Act of 1845, ch. 358, is the exercise of such an unconstitutional power, by the General Assembly of Maryland, as renders it wholly inoperative and void____ [T]he legislative and judicial powers, under the Constitution of this State, are confided to different branches of the government; the Legislature are incompetent to exercise judicial powers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 148. We again stressed the importance of separation of powers in <em>Regents of the University of Maryland v. Williams, </em>9 G. &amp; J. 365, 410 (1838):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">The province of the legislative department of government is to make laws, confining itself within the limits prescribed by the Constitution. It cannot usurp the powers confided to either of the other departments....

Oliver, </em>7 G. <em>&amp; </em>J. 191 (1835), the Legislature passed a bill negating a decree in a private action. The Court said: \u201cCan the Legislature exercise such a power?

An Adjutant General had been appointed to lifetime tenure in <em>Watkins v. Watkins, 2 </em>Md. 341 (1852). While he was in office, the Constitution of 1851 was passed, which limited the term of the Adjutant General to six years. It also required the Governor to appoint officers \u201cwith the advice and consent of the senate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 354. The Governor appointed a new Adjutant General while the Legislature was not in session and thus the Governor had not received the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>\u201cadvice and consent\u201d of the Senate. When the new Adjutant General attempted to take office, the old Adjutant General (both were named Watkins) refused to turn over the office, claiming life tenure because he had been appointed when the constitution so provided. The newly-appointed Adjutant General sought a Writ of Mandamus directing the former Adjutant General to surrender the office. The trial court declined and we affirmed, noting</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\">that in all human contrivances confidence must be reposed somewhere, and that under the distribution of the powers of the government in our State, it is not given to the judiciary to <em>compel </em>action on the part of a co-ordinate branch of government.

County Commissioners of Talbot County, </em>108 Md. 188, 69 A. 801 (1908), emphasized the great importance this state has often afforded to the sanctity of the separation of powers as a governmental foundation. The case involved a longstanding dispute over which county should pay to erect and repair a bridge over the Kent Narrows, which would replace a solid causeway erected in those waters by Queen Anne\u2019s County, but which allegedly had interfered with the ability of residents of Talbot County to navigate the Narrows. After other attempts to resolve the dispute legislatively, the General Assembly enacted legislation requiring that both counties be financially responsible for the construction of the ultimate replacement bridge. After Talbot County refused to pay its share of the cost, the Legislature enacted another statute that required Talbot County to assess its citizens\u2019 property to produce a specified amount of money, which would then be used to reimburse Queen Anne\u2019s County for one-half of its expenditures. We held that the statute violated the separation of powers provision of our Declaration of Rights. We asked ourselves \u201cwhether the Legislature has ... attempted to exercise functions that belong to the judicial department of government, or in other words, has it attempted to pronounce a judgment or decree?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196, 69 A. at 804. We answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">[The setting of the amount due] is done without any judicial inquiry as to how much the bridge actually cost ... or as to what the actual cost of maintaining the bridge may be.

Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. 211, 334 A.2d 514 (1975), in which the Legislature had created a statutory scheme of a <em>de novo </em>appeal with a right to a jury trial that, in essence, empowered juries to issue administrative permits as part of the judicial process. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa6\">[T]he Department of Natural Resources appealed to this Court, asserting that this type of extensive and nullifying judicial de novo review, under \u00a7 9-308(b), is not permitted by the Maryland Constitution because \u201cthe judicial branch of government may not usurp the province of the administrative prerogative.\u201d We agree....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">That aspect of the Constitution which is spotlighted by this case is the fundamental doctrine of separation of pow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ers, a principle expressly or impliedly recognized in the basic law of every state in this nation. This doctrine has long been a cornerstone of this State\u2019s concept of government and finds forthright expression in Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights contained in the Constitution of Maryland in these words:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">\u201cThat the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers of Government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other; and no person exercising the functions of one of said Departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\"><em>Although Maryland\u2019s statement of the separation of powers is \u201ca more concrete barrier than any which the Supreme Court has had to hurdle under the Federal Constitution,\u201d </em>R.

We then noted that in response to the many practical needs of government, the number of administrative agencies has flourished. Additionally, within the agencies there has occurred \u201csome mingling, blending and overlapping of the legislative, executive and judicial functions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220, 334 A.2d at 521. This \u201celasticity\u201d of the separation of powers doctrine, we noted, was sensible and permissible. We went on to state, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al_l\">[T]his constitutional \u201celasticity\u201d cannot be stretched to a point where, in effect, there no longer exists a separation of governmental power, as the Maryland Constitution does not permit a merger of the three branches of our State government, nor does it \u201cmake any one of the three departments subordinate to the other, when exercising the trust committed to it.\u201d <em>Painter v. Mattfeldt, </em>119 Md. 466, 472, 87 A. 413[, 416] (1913). When the Legislature confers, by enactment, powers upon one of the other branches of government which are beyond those permitted under the Constitution, <em>or any of the three branches of government takes unto itself </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number><em>powers denied to it or those strictly within the sovereignty of another branch, </em>the courts of this State must step in and declare such encroachments to be constitutionally prohibited....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">... \u201cThe basic proposition that a constitutional court should not be required to perform nonjudicial functions is probably beyond challenge.\u201d 4 Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise, </em>\u00a7 29.10 (1958). Because courts cannot be required to exercise nonjudicial duties it has been held by this Court that it is beyond the power of the Legislature to require the judiciary to: approve accounts of county officers before payment, <em>Robey v. Prince George\u2019s County Comm\u2019rs, </em>92 Md. 150, 48 A. 48 (1900); perform duties tantamount to a board of review in assessing property for tax purposes, <em>Baltimore City v. Bonaparte, </em>93 Md. 156, 48 A. 735 (1901); appoint a board of visitors to supervise the county jail, <em>Beasley v. Ridout, </em>94 Md. 641, 52 A. 61 (1902); provide for referendum concerning issuance of liquor licenses, <em>Board of Supervisors v.

Thus, in regard to administrative agencies, which, while often functioning as fact-finding bodies, perform essentially nonjudicial duties, a Maryland court\u2019s \u201cinquiry is [almost always] limited to finding whether there was illegality or unreasonableness in the ... action \u2014 when that inquiry is finished, judicial scrutiny ends....\u201d <em>Balto.

Deaver, </em>22 Md. 187 (1864) and <em>Mayor of Baltimore v. Howard, </em>15 Md. 376 (1860), this Court has long been a paramount guardian of the separation of powers doctrine. The majority opinion, in my view, disregards this long history of reverence to the principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Moreover, in the case <em>sub judice </em>we are not being asked to <em>restrain </em>a function of the Executive Branch; respondent seeks to have us <em>compel </em>the Governor to cooperate in the furnishing of information to it. <em>See Watkins, </em>2 Md. at 346. This information is not sought as evidence in adversarial litigation between other parties; it is sought in a direct suit against the Governor. There is no conflict between the power of the judicial branch to require the disclosure of information necessary to resolve conflicts between citizens effectively and the reluctance of the executive to furnish the necessary information. Maryland\u2019s judicial branch, along with the federal judiciary, admittedly has that power as explained in <em>United States v. Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 711-13, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 3109-10, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">It is the manifest duty of the courts to vindicate [constitutional] guarantees, and to accomplish that it is essential that all relevant and admissible evidence be produced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">In this case we must weigh the importance of the general privilege of confidentiality of Presidential communications in performance of the president\u2019s responsibilities against the inroads of such a privilege on the fair administration of criminal justice.

[Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">We are not asked here to enforce a judicial summons on the Governor in ongoing litigation, criminal or otherwise. We are asked to compel him to aid respondent on a fishing expedition that no one, other than respondent, knows for which fish the expedition is being mounted. Asserting our constitutional power to restrain action is quite different from the power respondent asks us to exercise \u2014 to compel an action which is to the detriment of the Chief Executive and his or her power to formulate policy and gather information necessary to perform his or her functions effectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">A question also exists: How do we enforce a decision such as that rendered in this case? A restraint on executive action generally can be self-enforced. By necessity, the Governor operates through subordinates who can be restrained. But a mandatory directive ordering a Governor to act in this particular way, I suggest, is a pig that will have difficulty trying to fly. If he declines, are we going to hold him in contempt? If he does not open his doors to the Washington Post, will the House of Delegates impeach him and the Senate try him pursuant to Article II, section 7, and Article III, section 16 of the Maryland Constitution? Moreover, what constitutional principle are we furthering in this confrontation between the executive and judicial branches, a conflict created not by us, but by the legislative branch of government? What constitutional purpose is it to serve?</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">We need to understand that this confrontation does not involve only the legislative branch; it is also a constitutional confrontation between the judicial and executive branches, a confrontation created by the dubious applicability of this legislation to the nonpublie aspects of the inner workings of the Office of the Governor, as contrasted with the general functions of the subordinate executive branch departments. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>indicated by our cases, we have not been reluctant to protect our own powers as a judiciary under Article 8. Interestingly, the Open Meetings Act, Maryland Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol.), section 10 \u2014 503(a)(1)(ii) of the State Government Article, contains an express exception for judicial functions, stating that the Act \u201cdoes not apply to ... a judicial function.\u201d No similar provision exists in sections 10-611 through 10-628 of the State Government Article, entitled \u201cAccess to Public Records.\u201d What intellectual exercises will we use to secure our work from premature disclosure? How will we be able to maintain the independence necessary for our work if in contemporary time the methods and facts of our deliberations are to be made public upon request? It is easy to say we will protect the 'deliberative nature of our work because we have the inherent power to do so. How will we, in the future, explain that what is good for the executive goose is not good for the judicial gander?</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Even the federal courts, in respect to the federal government, which had no history of centralized power abuses similar to that of the colonial governments, construe the implied constitutional requirement of separation of powers with more deference than the majority in this case affords our express provisions. In <em>Association of American Physicians &amp; Surgeons, Inc. v. Clinton, </em>997 F.2d 898 (D.C.Cir.1993), a case concerning a federal statute that limits acts of nepotism, at issue was the applicability of that statute to the functions the President delegated to his wife as a member of a federal task force. One issue was whether the statute\u2019s language, which made it applicable to <em>agencies </em>of the government, applied to the Executive Office of the President. The court noted that under other acts, including the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), federal courts had held that the White House and the Executive Office of the President were not intended to be included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">Although [the statute] defines agency as \u201can executive agency,\u201d we doubt that Congress intended to include the White House or the Executive Office of the President. <em>Cf. Franklin v. Massachusetts, </em>[505 U.S. 788], 112 S.Ct. 2767, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>2775, 120 L.Ed.2d 636 (1992) (holding that President is not \u201cagency\u201d for purposes of Administrative Procedure Act); <em>Meyer, </em>981 F.2d at 1298 (President\u2019s advisors are not \u201cagency\u201d under FOIA); <em>Armstrong v. Bush, </em>924 F.2d 282, 289 (D.C.Cir.1991) (President not APA \u201cagency\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 905. That court also discussed the importance of upholding the separation of powers in view of the relationship between the President and his closest advisors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">Application of FACA[, the antinepotism statute,] to the Task Force clearly would interfere with the President\u2019s capacity to solicit direct advice on <em>any </em>subject related to his duties from a group of private citizens, separate from or together with his closest governmental associates. That advice might be sought on a broad range of issues in an informal or formal fashion. Presidents have created advisory groups composed of private citizens (sometimes in conjunction with government officials) to meet periodically and advise them (hence the phrase \u201ckitchen cabinets\u201d) on matters such as the conduct of a war. Presidents have even created formal \u201ccabinet committees\u201d composed in part of private citizens. This case is no different. Here the President has formed a committee of his closest advisors\u2014 cabinet secretaries, White House advisors, and his wife \u2014 to advise him on a domestic issue he considers of the utmost priority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">Applying FACA to the Task Force does not raise constitutional problems simply because the Task Force is involved in proposing legislation. Instead, difficulties arise because of the Task Force\u2019s operational proximity to the President himself \u2014 that is, because the Task Force provides advice and recommendations directly to the President. The Supreme Court has recognized that a President has a great need to receive advice confidentially:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">[There is a] valid need for protection of communications between high Government officials and those who advise and assist them in the performance of their manifold duties; the importance of this confidentiality is too plain to require further discussion. Human experience teaches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of the decisionmaking process. Whatever the nature of the privilege of confidentiality of Presidential communications in the exercise of Art. II powers, the privilege can be said to derive from the supremacy of each branch within its own assigned area of constitutional duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\"><em>United States v. Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 705-06, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 3106, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974) (footnotes omitted); <em>see also Nixon v. Administrator of Gen. </em>Servs., 433 U.S. 425, 441-49, 97 S.Ct. 2777, 2789-93, 53 L.Ed.2d 867 (1977).... Article II not only gives the President the ability to consult with his advisors confidentially, but also, as a corollary, it gives him the flexibility to organize his advisors and seek advice from them as he wishes. In <em>Meyer v. Bush, </em>981 F.2d at 1293-97, for example, we held that the President could create a Task Force composed of cabinet secretaries and other close advisors to study regulatory reform without having to comply with FOIA....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">The ability to discuss matters confidentially is surely an important condition to the exercise of executive power. Without it, the President\u2019s performance of any of his duties \u2014 textually explicit or implicit in Article II\u2019s grant of executive power \u2014 would be made more difficult. In designing the Constitution, the Framers vested the executive power in one man for the very reason that he might maintain secrecy in executive operations....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">This Article II right to confidential communications attaches not only to direct communications with the President, but also to discussions between his senior advisors. Certainly Department Secretaries and White House aides must be able to hold confidential meetings to discuss advice they secretly will render to the President.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 908-09 (second alteration in original) (footnote omitted). As is readily discernable from <em>Clinton, </em>great efforts are made to preserve the power of the Executive Office and the separa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>tion of powers at the federal level, even though the Framers chose not to include it expressly in the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">A challenge was made to the adequacy of the response to a disclosure request made under the FOIA in <em>Meyer v. Bush, </em>981 F.2d 1288 (D.C.Cir.1993). The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia first identified the Government\u2019s position: \u201cThe government declined to produce these documents on the grounds that neither the Vice President nor the Task Force are \u2018agencies\u2019 under FOIA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291. The court quoted the portion of FOIA that defined an agency as \u201c \u2018any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, <em>or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), </em>or any independent regulatory agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The court then discussed several of the cases involving the separation of powers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ7\">In <em>Kissinger v. Reporters Comm, for Freedom of the Press, </em>445 U.S. 136, 100 S.Ct. 960, 63 L.Ed.2d 267 (1980), the Supreme Court followed the legislative history and held that the Act did not cover \u201cthe President\u2019s immediate personal staff <em>or </em>units in the Executive Office whose sole function is to advise and assist the President.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156, 100 S.Ct. at 971.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">... The President does not create an \u201cestablishment\u201d subject to FOIA every time he convenes a group of senior staff or departmental heads to work on a problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1292, 1296 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\"><em>Kissinger, </em>445 U.S. 136, 100 S.Ct. 960, 63 L.Ed.2d 267, which involved three appeals from denied requests for information under the FOIA, is perhaps the most interesting and comprehensive of the cases involving the FOIA. William Satire, a columnist, requested that the State Department produce transcripts of Henry Kissinger\u2019s telephone conversations during a specified period. Satire\u2019s request was limited to telephone conversations in which his name was mentioned or Kissinger discussed information \u201cleaks\u201d with certain White <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>House officials. His request, though broad, was much more constrained than the blanket request by respondent in the case at bar, which requests virtually all available telephone records, diaries, appointments, and memos, without any specificity. The second request was by the Military Audit Project (MAP) for all records of conversations Kissinger made while he was Secretary of State and National Security Advisor. The third request was from the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP), and others, requesting Kissinger\u2019s telephone notes made when he was National Security Advisor and Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">The Supreme Court held that the requesting parties \u201cwere not entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 100 S.Ct. at 967, 63 L.Ed.2d</p>\n<p id=\"AvOt\">267. It stated, as relevant to the case before this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"avc-dedup-0\">The plaintiff requesters contend that even though the Federal Records and Records Disposal Acts do not contemplate a private right of action, the FOIA nevertheless supplies what was missing from those Acts \u2014 congressional intent to permit private actions to recover records wrongfully removed from Government custody. We are, however, unable to read the FOIA as supplying that congressional intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 150, 100 S.Ct. at 968, 63 L.Ed.2d 267. After disposing of the MAP and RCFP claims on other grounds irrelevant to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Supreme Court addressed Safire\u2019s claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">As outlined above, the Act only prohibits the withholding of \u201cagency records.\u201d We conclude that the Safire request sought disclosure of documents which were not \u201cagency records\u201d within the meaning of the FOIA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">The FOIA <em>does </em>render the \u201cExecutive Office of the President\u201d an agency subject to the Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(e). The legislative history is unambiguous, however, in explaining that the \u201cExecutive Office\u201d does not include the Office of the President.... Safire\u2019s request was limited to a period of time in which Kissinger was serving as Assistant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>President. Thus these telephone notes were not \u201cagency records\u201d when they were made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 155-56, 100 S.Ct. at 971, 63 L.Ed.2d 267 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">I discern little difference in the FOIA\u2019s use of the word \u201cagency\u201d and the use of the words \u201cunit or instrumentality of the State government\u201d in section 10-611(g)(1)(i) of the State Government Article. As indicated, the FOIA defined \u201cagency\u201d to include \u201cany executive department ... or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government....\u201d The Maryland Act applies to \u201cinstrumentalities of government.\u201d While, apparently, the majority can make a distinction, I cannot. In my view, neither Act contemplated that the Office of the Chief Executive, be it the President or the Governor, would be covered by the respective disclosure laws. With respect to the FOIA, which was the forerunner to the state Act, the federal courts clearly have held as such, and have done so, at least in part, in reliance on the separation of powers implied by the federal Constitution. In Maryland, there need be no reliance on implication. The doctrine is firmly and expressly ingrained in our Declaration of Rights and our history. It is simply incongruous to me that the majority pays less respect to an express principle in the Maryland Constitution supported by our colonial history than the federal courts pay to the principle only implied by the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">That the federal decisions are based substantially on such principles is further supported by other cases involving the scope of related statutes. The Supreme Court, resolving the scope of tne federal Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by determining whether judicial review of an action of the President is possible under the Act on the ground that the President is an agency, stated in <em>Franklin v. Massachusetts, </em>505 U.S. 788, 796, 800-01, 112 S.Ct. 2767, 2773, 2775, 120 L.Ed.2d 636 (1992):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">The APA provides for judicial review of \u201cfinal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>court.\u201d At issue in this case is whether the \u201cfinal\u201d action that appellees have challenged is that of an \u201cagency\u201d such that the federal courts may exercise their powers of review under the APA. We hold that the final action complained of is that of the President, and the President is not an agency within the meaning of the Act. Accordingly, there is no final agency action that may be reviewed under the APA standards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">... The President is not explicitly excluded from the APA\u2019s purview, but he is not explicitly included, either. Out of respect for the separation of powers and the unique constitutional position of the President, we find that textual silence is not enough to subject the President to the provisions of the APA. [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Finally, in <em>Armstrong v. Bush, </em>924 F.2d 282, 289 (D.C.Cir. 1991), that court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">When Congress decides purposefully to enact legislation restricting or regulating presidential action, it must make its intent clear. The Supreme Court has recognized that \u201c[i]n traditionally sensitive areas, such as legislation affecting the federal balance, the requirement of clear statement assures that the legislature has in fact faced, and intended to bring into issue, the critical matters involved in decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">... The answer to whether the APA should apply to the President depends on an analysis of several factors, involving the President\u2019s \u201cconstitutional powers, the multifarious responsibilities of his office, and his direct political accountability as the only elected official with a national constituency.\u201d In the absence of any affirmative evidence that these issues were considered in the legislative process and that Congress passed the APA with the understanding that it would regulate presidential as well as other executive branch action, we refuse to hold that the President is an \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of the APA. [Citation omitted; alteration in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>In my view, the Legislature did not intend to include the Office of the Governor, as opposed to the subordinate executive branch agencies, when it used the terms \u201cunit or instrumentality of the State government,\u201d any more than Congress intended to include the Executive Office of the President when it used the term \u201cagency\u201d of the government in the FOIA. Like the President\u2019s position relative to the FOIA, the office of the Governor is not expressly included in the Maryland Act. \u201cTextual silence\u201d should not be enough to subject him to the Maryland statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Had the General Assembly passed a public information statute that was limited in its applicability to require the Office of the Governor, and it alone, to provide virtually unlimited disclosure of his activities to the press or the public, it clearly would be an unwarranted interference with the activities of a coordinate branch of government and, in my view, would have been violative of Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights. I see little difference in the effect of the Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute at issue. To me, the application of the statute to the Office of the Governor violates the separation of powers, a fundamental foundation of the government of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">We have to look no further than the history of violence that occurred in the 1960\u2019s when riots broke out in Maryland, resulting in the Governor deploying the National Guard to preserve the peace. Obviously, he had to confer with military advisors and receive advice on the deployment of troops. Of obvious necessity, in my view, was the need to keep such information, the meetings themselves and the decisions made, confidential. With the majority\u2019s decision in this case, any member of the press or the public, including those contemplating riots, could demand access to that information even in real time. We should not presume that the world is full of people with harmless intent. The protection of these types of executive decision-making activities is guaranteed, as I perceive it, by Maryland\u2019s constitutional separation of powers provision, that the majority today, in my view, regulates to relative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>impotence. If the separation of powers doctrine does not apply here, then where?</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">I would reverse and hold that, although the statute may apply to subordinate executive branch entities, it does not apply to the Office of the Governor. Chief Judge BELL has authorized me to state that he concurs with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-8\">.

We went on to hold that this presumptive privilege extended even to \u201c \u2018the limited intrusion represented by an <em>in camera </em>examination of the conversations by a court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v.

Even where the confidential communications or documents sought are factual in nature, a balancing process is used, wherein the government\u2019s need for confidentiality is weighed against the litigant\u2019s need for disclosure. <em>See Hamilton, </em>287 Md. at 564, 414 A.2d at 925. Although compiled or severable factual material ordinarily is available for discovery, we reasoned, in <em>Hamilton, </em>that \u201cmaterial cannot always \u2018easily be separated into fact finding and decision making categories,\u2019 <em>\u201did. </em>at 564, 414 A.2d at 925-26 (citations omitted), recognized that \u201csome factual material is entitled to a degree of protection under the privilege,\u201d including \u201cfacts obtained upon promises or understandings of confidentiality, investigative facts underlying and intertwined with opinions and advice, and facts the disclosure of which would impinge on the deliberative process,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 564-65, 414 A.2d at 926, and concluded that, in these situations, \u201cthe government\u2019s asserted reasons for nondisclosure are weighed against the litigant\u2019s need for discovery in light of the particular circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565, 414 A.2d at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The <em>Hamilton </em>Court further explained that <em>\u201cin camera </em>inspection by the trial judge does not automatically follow whenever a claim of executive privilege is made,\u201d since \u201cthe <em>in camera </em>inspection itself is an intrusion upon the privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566, 414 A.2d at 926. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">Thus, when a formal claim of executive privilege is made, with an affidavit stating that the demanded materials are of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>a type that fall within the scope of the privilege, they are presumptively privileged even from <em>in camera </em>inspection. <em>The burden is on the party seeking production to make a preliminary shewing that the communications or documents may not be privileged or, in those cases where a weighing approach is appropriate, that there is some necessity for production. ... Consequently, absent such a preliminary showing by the party demanding disclosure, the claim of executive privilege should be honored without requiring an in camera inspection.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 566-67, 414 A.2d at 926-27 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The Governor\u2019s Office has asserted executive privilege with respect to the documents at issue in this case, i.e., the requested telephone records and appointment calendars. That assertion has been accompanied by affidavits by Governor Glenden-ing and members of his staff, explaining how the documents fall within that privilege. I respectfully disagree with the majority opinion\u2019s dismissal of the validity of that claim. While the individual entries in the documents in question are generally \u201cfactual\u201d in nature, in compilation they disclose the deliberative processes of the Governor\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In <em>Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court, 53 </em>Cal.3d 1325, 283 Cal.Rptr. 893, 813 P.2d 240 (1991), the California Supreme Court considered a closely analogous case in which a newspaper sought disclosure of the Governor of California\u2019s appointment calendars and schedules under the California Public Records Act, Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 6250 (West 1995). In that case, like this one, the Governor had conceded that his appointment calendars were public records within the meaning of the California Public Records Act, but asserted that they were exempted from disclosure. <em>See Times Mirror, </em>283 Cal. Rptr. 893, 813 P.2d at 250 n. 12. The California Supreme Court, citing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hamilton, see id., </em>283 Cal.Rptr. 893, 813 P.2d at 248 n. 10, held that disclosure of the documents was not in the public interest and based its reasoning, in part, on the deliberative process privilege. <em>See id., </em>283 Cal.Rptr. 893, 813 P.2d at 252. While the majority is correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>in pointing out that the California statute contained a public interest exemption not present in the Maryland Public Information Act, the California court\u2019s reasoning is equally applicable to the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\">Disclosing the identity of persons with whom the Governor has met and consulted is the functional equivalent of revealing the substance or direction of the Governor\u2019s judgment and mental processes; such information would indicate which interests or information he deemed to be of significance -with respect to critical issues of the moment. The intrusion into the deliberative process is patent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\"><em>Id., </em>283 Cal.Rptr. 893, 813 P.2d at 251. The court concluded that \u201cwhile the raw material in the Governor\u2019s appointment calendars and schedules is factual, its essence is deliberative.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has followed similar analysis in the context of whether the President\u2019s Task Force on National Health Care Reform was required to comply with the open meeting requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">If public disclosure of the real information-gathering process is required, the confidentiality of the advice-giving function inevitably would be compromised. <em>If you know what information people seek, you can usually determine why they seek it. </em>A group directly reporting and advising the President must have confidentiality at each stage in the formulation of advice to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>Association of Am. Physicians and Surgeons, Inc. v. Clinton, </em>997 F.2d 898, 910 (D.C.Cir.1993) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Similarly, in <em>Taylor v. Worrell Enterprises, Inc., </em>242 Va. 219, 409 S.E.2d 136 (1991), the Virginia Supreme Court held that itemized long distance telephone bills for calls placed by the Governor\u2019s office that were sought by a newspaper publisher were exempt from disclosure under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 2.1-340 (Michie 1999). Like the Appellee in this case, the publisher in <em>Worrell </em>argued that disclosure of the phone bills would not encroach on the Governor\u2019s decision-making process because the content of the calls would remain confidential. <em>See id. </em>at 138. However, the plurality opinion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rejected that contention, explaining that \u201cdata which show the time and the originating and terminating location of a call is information concerning the activity of the Governor\u2019s office,\u201d since \u201c[t]he data, standing alone, could provide a basis for public speculation\u201d and \u201can information base for further investigation which could subject recipients of such calls to inquiries regarding the calls and their content.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plurality went on to express its concern about the potential chilling effect that release of the information could have on both the Governor and the individuals that he might want to consult via telephone, arguing that \u201c[a] lack of candor or an unwillingness to participate in the decision making process is as likely to flow from the compelled disclosure of the fact of consultation as from the disclosure of the content of the consultation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Concern with the potential chilling effect that disclosure of deliberative documents could have on the ability of executive officials to execute the duties of the Governor\u2019s office underlies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>much of the jurisprudence on executive privilege. As the court in <em>Times Mirror </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\">If the law required disclosure of a private meeting between the Governor and a politically unpopular or controversial group, that meeting might never occur. Compelled disclosure could thus devalue or eliminate altogether a particular viewpoint from the Governor\u2019s consideration. Even routine meetings between the Governor and other lawmakers, lobbyists or citizens\u2019 groups might be inhibited if the meetings were regularly revealed to the public and the participants routinely subjected to probing questions and scrutiny by the press.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-5\"><em>Times Mirror, </em>283 Cal.Rptr. 893, 813 P.2d at 251. The United States Supreme Court has also recognized the importance of the expectation of executive confidentiality:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">The expectation of a President to the confidentiality of his conversations and correspondence, like the claim of confidentiality of judicial deliberations, for example, has all the values to which we accord deference for the privacy of all citizens and, added to those values, is the necessity for protection of the public interest in candid, objective, and even blunt or harsh opinions in Presidential decisionmaking. A President and those who assist him must be free to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making decisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except privately. These are the considerations justifying a presumptive privilege for Presidential communications. The privilege is fundamental to the operation of Government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-7\"><em>United States v. Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 708, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 3107, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">This potential for disruption of the essential communicative, investigative, and deliberative functions of the Governor\u2019s office are equally in force in this case. In fact, these policy concerns are particularly compelling in the face of the sweeping scope of the Appellee\u2019s demand for production of doeu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>ments in this case and the lack of any specifically identified public interest by the Appellee in these particular materials. The majority stresses the age of the documents that are being sought in this case as undermining the potential chilling effect of their disclosure on the Governor\u2019s ability to access a broad spectrum of viewpoints, <em>see </em>maj. op. at 563-65, but this is hardly a determinative factor. I see no reason to believe that a government official or community member might not be just as hesitant to engage in a confidential communication whether it was likely to be disclosed immediately or in four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Nonetheless, that is not to say that there is <em>no </em>situation under which the types of records sought here should be obtainable. Under the balancing test outlined in <em>Hamilton, </em>287 Md. at 564-65, 414 A.2d at 925-26, it is conceivable that the doctrine of executive privilege might not shield telephone or appointment records that were subject to a more focused and limited request that would have substantially less of an impact on the deliberative process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That simply is not the situation here, where Appellee has requested all of the Governor\u2019s schedules and telephone records for himself and several members of his staff, covering a six month period, without offering any evidence to dispute the Governor\u2019s initial showing that the requested documents are protected by executive privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Given the doctrine of executive privilege outlined by this Court in <em>Hamilton, </em>and given the policy concerns with the chilling of the important constitutional functions of the Governor and his staff, I would reverse the decision of the Circuit Court and hold that, as a matter of law, the Appellee has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>made a sufficient showing of necessity to overcome the presumption of executive privilege for the requested documents. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-9\">. Section 10-615 states, in relevant part, that \u2018\u2018[a] custodian shall deny inspection of a public record or any part of a public record if: (1) by law, the public record is privileged or confidential.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-10\">.

Verdow, </em>287 Md. 544, 546, 414 A.2d 914, 916 (1980). <em>Hamilton </em>dealt with an assertion of privilege in the context of discovery in a tort suit brought in federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship. <em>See id. </em>at 547, 414 A.2d at 917.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\">.

DR Partners v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Clark County, </em>6 P.3d 465 (Nev.2000) (holding that deliberative process privilege was not implicated by disclosure of county officials' cellular telephone records). While the Nevada Supreme Court disagreed with the premise of <em>Times Miiror </em>and <em>Rogers, see id. </em>at 470, it also distinguished those opinions on the facts of the cases, noting that, in <em>DR Partners, </em>the newspaper seeking disclosure of the records was specifically investigating possible government waste and the County had not properly accounted for payment for private use of governmental cellular phone service by government officials in the records in the trial court proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 470-71.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b627-7\">.

The Chief Justice, who concurred in the result, argued that the separation of powers and executive privilege issues had not been properly raised for appellate review, but concluded that the phone bills were \u201cmemoranda\u201d and were, therefore, statutorily exempt from disclosure. <em>See id. </em>at 140.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b629-7\">. <em>Cf.
