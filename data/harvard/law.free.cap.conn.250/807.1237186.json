He appealed his conviction directly to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant raises two claims. First, he claims that the trial court improperly permitted the prosecutor to comment, during closing arguments, on the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>failure to call his prior attorney to testify. Second, he claims that the trial court\u2019s instructions on self-defense inadequately advised the jury that the defendant\u2019s subjective belief that he was in imminent danger, even if mistaken, could justify his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">We decline to review the defendant\u2019s first claim because it was not preserved properly at trial, and the defendant may not prevail on that claim under either the plain error doctrine or <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We conclude that the defendant\u2019s second claim is meritless and, therefore, affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In the early morning hours of November 5, 1994, the defendant and the victim, Jahmal Hall, began arguing in the vicinity of North Main and East Farm Streets in Waterbury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Domingo Alves, a close family friend of Hall, placed himself between Hall and the defendant. Alves put his hands out, one toward Hall and one toward the defendant, in an effort to separate them. Hall stood calmly, but the defendant kept pushing against Alves, trying to reach Hall. Alves then lightly put both his hands on the defendant\u2019s chest to stop him from advancing. The defendant removed a gun from his pocket. When Alves saw the gun, he took a step back from the defendant. Hall stood still and appeared to be frightened. The defendant shot Hall once in the torso, then ran to his car. While driving away, the defendant told his cousin, James Bryan, who was waiting in the car, \u201cI told him stop messing with me.\u201d Jahmal Hall later died from the gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">At trial, the defendant claimed that he had shot Hall in self-defense. He testified that, on the night in question, he had been drinking and dancing at clubs with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>Bryan. According to the defendant, Hall had given him a dirty look after the defendant danced with Hall\u2019s ex-girlfriend. The defendant claimed that, later that night, as he started to drive home, Hall yelled obscenities at him. The defendant then stopped the car and went to talk to Hall. The defendant further testified that a group with at least three large men, including Alves, who were friends with Hall, surrounded the defendant and began pushing and shoving him. The defendant testified that he had taken out the gun to scare these men away. According to the defendant, the gun then had discharged, either because someone had banged into it or because the defendant\u2019s finger had slipped on the trigger. After the gunshot, the defendant ran to his car. The defendant stated that he did not know whether the bullet had hit anyone until the day after the shooting, and that he had not intended to injure anybody.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">William Henry Reid also testified for the defense. Reid stated that he had seen the defendant and Hall arguing on the night of the murder. Reid stated that a group of four or five individuals, all the same size as or larger than the defendant, had approached the defendant and Hall. According to Reid, those individuals had surrounded the defendant and began clutching and grabbing at him. Reid testified that he had heard a gunshot and had seen the defendant run to his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim on appeal is that the trial court improperly permitted the prosecutor to comment, during closing arguments, on the defendant\u2019s failure to call an attorney (1993 attorney) who had represented him in 1993 to testify with respect to the defendant\u2019s diminished mental capacity. The defendant claims that the prosecutor\u2019s comment improperly allowed the jury to draw an adverse inference that the 1993 attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>testimony would have been unfavorable to the defendant; see <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas </em>Co., 147 Conn. 672, 675, 165 A.2d 598 (1960); and also violated his attorney-client privilege and right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The following additional facts are relevant to the disposition of the defendant\u2019s first claim. In support of the defendant\u2019s claim that he acted in self-defense, the defendant presented evidence of his diminished mental capacity. Gregory St. John, an attorney who had represented the defendant in juvenile court on various matters from 1986 through 1990, testified that the defendant had been difficult to represent because the defendant was \u201cslow.\u201d In St. John\u2019s opinion, it required a great amount of time and effort to explain matters to the defendant. St. John testified that he had never requested a competency evaluation for the defendant because he did not believe such an exam was necessary. Rosita Saucier, a guidance counselor with Waterbury Adult Education, also testified that the defendant did poorly on a 1993 standardized test of adult basic education.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">On cross-examination, the defendant testified that, when facing criminal charges in 1993, he had been represented by counsel. During the court\u2019s charging conference; see Practice Book \u00a7 42-19; the prosecutor requested permission to comment, during closing arguments, on the defendant\u2019s failure to call the 1993 attorney to testify about the defendant\u2019s diminished mental capacity. The defendant\u2019s attorney objected on relevancy grounds, but the trial court granted the prosecutor\u2019s request.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During closing arguments, the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>stated: \u201cSt. John told you [that he has had] clients who, just, you know, it\u2019s difficult to get through to them when it\u2019s something they don\u2019t want to hear. And maybe that could explain what happened. That was between 1986 and 1990. We know that the defendant was represented by an attorney in 1993. We haven\u2019t heard from that attorney. We haven\u2019t heard from anybody close to that time because the only time that it matters what the defendant\u2019s ability to form an intent was is November 4 and 5 of 1994. We don\u2019t need to worry about any other time.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">\u201cAnd we have had, in my submission, no evidence from any kind of professional whatsoever that the defendant was unable to form the intent to kill.\u201d The defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the 1993 attorney at this point or request any curative instruction from the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>On appeal, the defendant claims that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the 1993 attorney improperly urged the jury to draw an adverse inference with respect to the defendant\u2019s failure to call that attorney to testify. See <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New </em>Haven, supra, 147 Conn. 675. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the trial court improperly granted the prosecutor permission to make this reference without the court first finding that the requirements of <em>Secondino </em>had been met.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant also claims that the prosecutor\u2019s comment violated his attorney-client privilege and right to counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We reject both of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">First, we decline to address the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was improper because it had not been established that the requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number><em>Secondino </em>were met. Because the defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments on this ground at trial, he asserts that his claim is reviewable in this court under the plain error doctrine. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. We conclude, however, that the prosecutor\u2019s comment does not rise to the level of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The plain error doctrine of Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 requires a defendant to demonstrate \u201cthat the claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 849, 661 A.2d 539 (1995). \u201cWe repeatedly have observed that plain error is not even implicated unless the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s comment does not constitute plain error. The prosecutor did not ask the jury to draw an adverse inference based on the absence of testimony from the 1993 attorney and, therefore, <em>Secondino </em>was not implicated. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Malave, </em>250 Conn. 723, 739, 737 A.2d 442 (1999). As we stated in Malave: \u201cSo long as counsel does not directly exhort the jury to draw an adverse inference by virtue of the witness\u2019 absence, the argument does not fall within the <em>Secondino </em>rule . . . .\u201d Id. The prosecutor\u2019s comment in this case merely highlighted the weakness of St. John\u2019s testimony, which related only to the years 1986 through 1990, in support of the defense of diminished mental capacity in 1994, the year that the crime in this case occurred. It was a proper comment on the weight of that evidence. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnotti, </em>198 Conn. 209, 220, 502 A.2d 404 (1985) (asking \u201c \u2018[w]hat about the [defense\u2019s case\u2019 \u201d was \u201ca comment ... on the overall quality of the defendant\u2019s evidence and [did not call] specific attention to the [defendant\u2019s] failure ... to testify\u201d). Commenting on the weight of the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>and the weakness of the defendant\u2019s case constitutes proper argument. Thus, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim under the plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">We also do not reach the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor\u2019s comment violated the defendant\u2019s attorney-client privilege and right to counsel. Although the defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments on these grounds at trial, he now contends that the claimed violations of the attorney-client privilege and right to counsel are reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">In <em>Golding, </em>we held that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. The first two requirements involve a determination of whether the claim is reviewable; the second two requirements involve a determination of whether the defendant may prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">The defendant is not entitled to a review of his claim under <em>Golding </em>because it is not of constitutional magnitude. While the defendant claims that the prosecutor\u2019s comment violated his constitutional right to counsel, \u201cmerely placing a constitutional tag on a nonconstitutional claim does not make it so.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>242 Conn. 318, 329, 699 A.2d 911 (1997). During her argument, the prosecutor merely suggested that there were no witnesses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>whether the defendant\u2019s 1993 attorney or others, who testified about the defendant\u2019s mental capacity in 1993 or at any other time close to the date of the crime, i.e., November 5, 1994. The prosecutor\u2019s comment highlighted the defendant\u2019s failure to support his theory of diminished mental capacity with any contemporaneously relevant evidence. The defendant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel and attorney-client privilege for communications; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cascone, </em>195 Conn. 183, 186, 487 A.2d 186 (1985); were not compromised by this comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Furthermore, we have held that \u201c[w]e will not afford <em>Golding </em>review to claims of prosecutorial misconduct [in closing argument] where the record does not disclose a pattern of misconduct . . . that was so blatantly egregious that it infringed on the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>231 Conn. 235, 246, 645 A.2d 999 (1994). \u201c[C]ounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Therefore, \u201cwe must review the comments complained of in the context of the entire trial. . . . [T]he burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that the remarks were so prejudicial that he was deprived of a fair trial and the entire proceedings were tainted.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>227 Conn. 711, 746, 631 A.2d 288 (1993). In this case, the prosecutor mentioned the 1993 attorney only once, as one possible witness to the defendant\u2019s mental capacity in 1993. Even if we assume that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was improper, it was not so egregious as to infringe upon the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Finally, we note that, prior to making her comment, the state\u2019s attorney sought and received permission from the trial court. This permitted judicial review and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>gave the defendant fair notice of the comment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Malave, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comment during closing arguments did not improperly urge the jury to draw an adverse inference with respect to the absence of testimony from the 1993 attorney. Thus, the defendant\u2019s claim is not reviewable under the plain error doctrine. We also conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim that the comment violated his attorney-client privilege and right to counsel is not entitled to review under <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court\u2019s instructions on self-defense were improper.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>In reviewing a challenge to the trial court\u2019s instructions, \u201cwe must consider the jury charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury. . . . The test is whether the charge as a whole presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>233 Conn. 502, 509, 659 A.2d 1194 (1995). \u201cWhen considering a claim of failure to deliver a requested charge . . . [t]he court . . . has a duty not to submit to the jury, in its charge, any issue upon which the evidence would not reasonably support a finding. \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Diggs, </em>219 Conn. 295, 298-99, 592 A.2d 949 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly failed to give his requested instruction pertaining to the defense of mistake of fact.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cThe defense of mistake of fact is available under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-6 (a), which provides in relevant part: \u2018A person shall not be relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he engages in such conduct under a mistaken belief of fact, unless: (1) Such factual mistake negates the mental state required for the commission of an offense . . . or (3) such factual mistake is of a kind that supports a defense of justification. \u2019 A mistake of fact exists \u2018when one makes an erroneous perception of the facts as they actually exist. . . . The defense arises only where the defendant misperceives an objective state of existing fact . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Beltran, </em>246 Conn. 268, 273-74, 717 A.2d 168 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">An instruction on the defense of mistake of fact is required only when evidence supporting it is placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>before the jury. Id., 274. In this case, as in <em>Beltran, </em>the defendant did not present any evidence at trial that he had shot Hall under any mistaken belief that he was being attacked. The state\u2019s case was that the defendant shot Hall during a verbal argument and with little provocation. The defendant, on the other hand, testified that a group of large men had surrounded him and were physically attacking him when he shot Hall. The defendant testified that he believed that deadly force was necessary to protect himself from imminent harm. Reid also testified that the defendant was being attacked when the shot was fired. The defendant did not present any evidence showing that he misperceived that he was being attacked. His request to charge, however, was based on the fact that he may have misperceived a threat when none had existed. The defendant, therefore, was not entitled to an instruction with respect to the defense of mistake of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Moreover, the trial court\u2019s charge adequately instructed the jury that it was required to consider the defendant\u2019s subjective belief that he was in danger. The charge did not purport to require the defendant\u2019s subjective belief to be correct, but only reasonable. The court instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he statute on self-defense focuses on the person claiming self-defense. It focuses on what he reasonably believed under the circumstances and presents a question of fact for the jury. In other words, what is important is what the defendant reasonably believed under the circumstances in this case. . . . Self-defense thus requires the jury to measure the justifiability of the defendant\u2019s actions from a subjective perspective, that is, what the defendant reasonably believed under the circumstances presented in this case, and on the basis of what the defendant perceived the circumstances to be.\u201d The trial court properly instructed the jury to focus on the defendant\u2019s subjective belief that he was in danger. The jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>therefore, properly was instructed that an honest and reasonably held belief that deadly force is necessary to repel an imminent attack would be justifiable self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C.

It focuses on what he reasonably believed under the circumstances and presents a question of fact for the jury. In other words, what is important is what the defendant reasonably believed under the circumstances in this case. The test for the degree of force in self-defense is a subjective-objective test, meaning it has some subjective aspects and some objective aspects. Self-defense thus requires the jury to measure the justifiability of the defendant\u2019s actions from a subjective perspective, that is, what the defendant reasonably believed under the circumstances presented in this case, and on the basis of what the defendant perceived the circumstances to be. [General Statutes \u00a7] 53a-19 (a) requires, however, that the defendant\u2019s belief must have been reasonable and not irrational or unreasonable under the circumstances. That is, would areasonable person in the defendant\u2019s circumstances have reached that belief? That is the objective aspect of the test. It is both a question of what his belief was and whether it was reasonable. In this case, if you find proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the persons the defendant claimed were surrounding him on the street immediately before the shot was fired were not using or about to use deadly, physical force or to inflict great bodily harm upon him, and if you further find proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had no reasonable belief that those persons were using or about to use deadly, physical force or about to inflict great bodily harm upon him, then . . . you would, under those conditions, reject the defense of self-defense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\"> The defendant submitted a written request to charge that included the following language: \u201cIn judging the danger to himself, however, the defendant is not required to act with infallible judgment. Ordinarily one exercising the right of self-defense is required to act instantly and without time to deliberate and investigate. Under such circumstances, of course, it\u2019s possible, often possible, to mistake an actual threat when none in fact existed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b842-7\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AaI\">dissenting. In the present case, the trial court permitted the prosecutor in his closing argument to urge the jury to draw an adverse inference from the accused\u2019s decision not to call as a witness an attorney who had previously represented him. In my view, this ruling violated the defendant\u2019s right to counsel under both the federal constitution and our state constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">On November 5, 1994, the defendant, Jermaine Woods, was responsible for a fatal shooting. On trial for murder, the defendant argued that \u2014 because of his diminished mental capacity \u2014 he had believed that he was acting in self-defense. The majority explains that \u201cGregory St. John, an attorney who had represented the defendant . . . from 1986 through 1990, testified [on direct examination by defense counsel] that the defendant had been difficult to represent because the defendant was \u2018slow.\u2019 In St. John\u2019s opinion, it required a great amount of time and effort to explain matters to the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">In its closing argument to the jury, the state emphasized that St. John had not interacted with the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>for several years prior to 1994, the year of the shooting. The state then referred to the defendant\u2019s testimony, during cross-examination, that: (1) he had entered a plea bargain in an unrelated criminal matter in 1993; and (2) he had been represented by counsel at that time. With the express permission of the court, the state then made the following argument: \u201cWe know that the defendant was represented by an attorney in 1993. <em>We haven\u2019t heard from that attorney. . . . </em>[T]he only time that it matters what the defendant\u2019s ability to form an intent was is November 4 and 5 of 1994. We don\u2019t need to worry about any other time.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In my view, this argument violated the defendant\u2019s right to counsel, which is protected by the sixth amendment of the United States constitution<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ajm\">\u201cTh[e] constitutional right to . . . effective assistance of counsel is one of those \u2018fundamental principles of liberty and justice which he at the base of all our civil and political institutions.\u2019<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>[287 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>U.S. 45, 67, 53 S.

[T]he denial of [this right] . . . could convert the appointment of counsel into a sham and nothing more than a formal compliance with the Constitution\u2019s requirement that an accused be given the assistance of counsel. <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>308 U.S. 444, 446, 60 S.

Together, they form a single fabric.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s ruling in the present case was a dagger that slashed this fabric to shreds. In the process, it converted into a sham the cluster of constitutional guarantees associated with the right to counsel and the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>178 Conn. 626, 424 A.2d 293 (1979), this court considered facts that are less egregious than those that are presently before us. The defendant in <em>Tost\u00e9 </em>argued that the trial court erred by admitting the testimony of a psychologist who had \u201cexamined the defendant pursuant to a defense motion but was called to testify as a state\u2019s witness.\u201d Id., 627-28. More specifically, \u201c[t]he defendant contended] that the admission of [the psychologist\u2019s] testimony violated the attorney-client privilege <em>and, thus, the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to the assistance of counsel.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 628. The court adopted this argument, concluding that \u201c[t]he court\u2019s admission of [the psychologist\u2019s] testimony as a state\u2019s witness was in error.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">If it violates the right to counsel to admit into evidence the adverse testimony of a psychologist retained to assist defense counsel in preparing his case, then it follows a fortiori that it must violate the right to counsel to permit the state to urge the jury to infer that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>testimony of a former attorney would have been unfavorable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In short, by invading the sanctity of the relationship between the defendant and his former attorney, the trial court in the present case violated the defendant\u2019s right to counsel under the federal constitution and our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The majority attempts to justify its refusal to review the defendant\u2019s claim with the argument that he did not properly object at trial. This is simply untrue. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel made a timely objection that was clear and unambiguous, albeit not phrased in the terminology of constitutional discourse.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is beyond question that the trial court had ample notice of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Even if I were mistaken in my belief that the defendant\u2019s argument adequately is preserved, we would nevertheless be obligated to reach the defendant\u2019s claim under <em>Golding, </em>which sets forth the rules that govern our review of unpreserved arguments. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). The majority claims that <em>Golding </em>review is inappropriate because the defendant\u2019s claim is \u201cnot of constitutional magnitude.\u201d Since both the federal constitution and our state constitution explicitly protect the right to counsel, the majority\u2019s argument is unavailing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, <em>Golding </em>review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>is particularly appropriate in the present case because the defendant\u2019s specific objection at trial alerted the trial court to the issue that the majority declines to reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">For these reasons, I would reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and order a new trial. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-10\"> For the text of these constitutional provisions, see footnotes 3 and 4 of this dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b842-11\"> In the brief that he submitted to this court, the defendant also emphasized the following evidence: \u201cRosita Saucier, a guidance counselor with Waterbury Adult Education, also testified to [the defendant\u2019s] level of function, as measured by his grade equivalent scores on the standardized Test of Adult Basic Education. . . . These scores were abysmal.

More contemporary developments suggest that this state\u2019s commitment to securing the right to counsel has not diminished since 1818. Not only was Connecticut the first state to adopt the public defender system; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>154 Conn. 631, 635, 228 A.2d 132 (1967); but the right to counsel was secured to criminal defendants in this state long before the mandate of <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.
