Although the parties to this appeal raise several issues, the dispositive issue is whether the plaintiff, who has brought two separate actions within the applicable statute of limitations period, may bring a third action, under \u00a7 52-592 (a), when: (1) the third action is brought after the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>statute of limitations period has expired; (2) the third action is brought within one year of the determination of the last action filed within the applicable limitations period; and (3) the third action is <em>not </em>brought within one year of the determination of the first action filed within the applicable limitations period. We conclude that such an action is, as a matter of law, time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">THE BACKGROUND FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The following facts, which reasonably could have been found by the trial court, and the following procedural history, are relevant to this appeal. On November 30,1983, the plaintiffs, Peabody, N.E., Inc., and Peabody International Corporation (collectively, Peabody), entered into a contract with the defendant, the department of transportation (state), for the reconstruction of Route 8 and the Commodore Hull Bridge over the Housatonic River from Shelton to Derby (project). In turn, on February 8,1984, Peabody, as general contractor, entered into a subcontract with Standard Structural Steel Company (Standard), primarily for the project\u2019s structural steel work, in the amount of $8,765,000. The project was originally scheduled to be completed by January 21, 1987, or 1104 days after the project\u2019s commencement. During the project, however, as a result of various factors which, according to the trial court, were caused by the state \u2014 for instance, changes in the bridge\u2019s design \u2014 Standard\u2019s contractual obligations were severely altered. Consequently, the length of the contract extended to 2562 days and Standard\u2019s subcontract price increased to $11,968,612.05. A certificate of acceptance of the project was finally issued on September 23, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Prior to the completion of the project, on or about August 31, 1990, Standard submitted to Peabody a two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>volume written claim, with an accompanying six page summary, for additional compensation for extra work and expenses caused by the design changes. The total amount of this claim was $15,104,244.71. Peabody notified the state of Standard\u2019s claim and forwarded two copies of Standard\u2019s two volume claim to the state\u2019s director of construction for the bureau of highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Negotiations took place between the state and Peabody, and between Peabody and Standard, to determine the cause and legitimacy of Standard\u2019s extra costs. Eventually, on June 20, 1991, the state and Peabody reached a partial settlement which provided, inter alia, that the state would pay to Peabody $886,424, which Peabody would, in turn, pay to Standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">On July, 2, 1991, Standard filed an action against Peabody in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (federal action). See <em>Standard Structural Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Peabody N.E., Inc., </em>Docket No. 2-91-CV-586. On July 29, 1991, Peabody filed an answer and third party complaint. By way of the third party complaint, Peabody sought to implead the state as a third party defendant, essentially denying liability to Standard and alleging that, \u201c[t]o the extent that [Peabody is] found responsible to Standard for all or part of the claims set forth in the [complaint],\u201d the state is liable to Peabody.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The state moved for a dismissal of Peabody\u2019s third party action on the ground that the federal district court lacked jurisdiction over the action because the action was barred by the eleventh amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 12,1992, the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>granted the motion to dismiss, concluding that the court lacked jurisdiction over the action because, although General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 4-61 (a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> constitutes an abrogation of eleventh amendment immunity for purposes of suit in <em>state </em>court, it does not do so for purposes of suit in <em>federal </em>court.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Standard, which had become insolvent during the pendency of its federal action, was placed into bankruptcy and, eventually, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) became its successor in interest as to any claims pertaining to the project. On May 20,1993, the FDIC filed an action against Peabody in. state court, based upon essentially the same allegations that Standard had asserted in its federal action. See <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Peabody N.E., Inc., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. CV93-525754-S (January 22, 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">On June 2, 1993, Peabody filed an answer and third party complaint, impleading the state into the state action and marking the commencement of Peabody\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>state action (first state action). Peabody\u2019s third party complaint is virtually identical to its analogous complaint in the federal action, with the addition of a paragraph providing: \u201cTo the extent [Standard/FDIC] incurred the damages and expenses as alleged, such damages and expenses were caused by acts and/or omissions of the State of Connecticut and not by any acts and/or omissions of Peabody.\u201d Again, Peabody alleged that the state is liable to Peabody \u201c [t] o the extent that [Peabody is] found responsible to Standard . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">On January 13, 1995, the state filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that: (1) Peabody had not given to the state sufficient notice of a claim of the kind or in the manner required under \u00a7 4-61; and (2) Peabody\u2019s complaint did not allege facts sufficient to make out a disputed claim under Peabody\u2019s contract with the state because the claims asserted by Peabody were actually those of Standard. On January 22, 1996, the trial court denied the state\u2019s motion, holding, inter alia, that the court did have jurisdiction over the action under \u00a7 4-61.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The state appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to this court upon the granting of certification by the Chief Justice pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as to the following issue: \u201cWhether sovereign immunity bars, and deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction over, a general contractor\u2019s construction claim under ... \u00a7 4-61, when that claim\u2019s purpose is to pass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>through to the State the general contractor\u2019s potential liability to a subcontractor, even though: (a) the general contractor has denied any liability to the subcontractor, (b) no such liability has been proven, and (c) the subcontractor has no contractual privity with the State?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">We answered this certified question in <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Peabody, N.E., Inc., </em>239 Conn. 93, 103, 680 A.2d 1321 (1996), in which we held that the allegations contained in Peabody\u2019s third party complaint were, on their face, insufficient to allege a waiver of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity, because they failed to allege that Peabody itself had a disputed claim under its contract with the state as required by \u00a7 4-61. We concluded that \u201ca contractor cannot implead the state in an action against the contractor by a subcontractor unless the contractor admits liability to the subcontractor and incorporates the subcontractor\u2019s claim into its own, so that the contractor then has a disputed claim under its own direct contract with the state.\u201d Id., 105. Accordingly, we reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case with direction to grant the state\u2019s motion to dismiss the third party complaint and to render judgment thereon. Id. On November 11, 1996, on remand, the trial court dismissed Peabody\u2019s first state action.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In July, 1996, Peabody agreed to settle Standard\u2019s claim, paying $3.1 million to FDIC. Subsequently, on August 12, 1997, Peabody filed an action against the state in state court (present action). <em>See Peabody, N.E., Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Transportation, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at New Britain, Docket No. CV 970482290S (May 1, 1998) (22 Conn. L. Rptr. 90). Although this action was brought almost three years after the expiration of the three year statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>limitations provided under \u00a7 4-61,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Peabody brought this action pursuant to \u00a7 52-592 (a). According to Peabody, because the first state action was finally dismissed on November 11, 1996, Peabody may bring the present action because it filed its complaint on July 30, 1997, which was within one year of the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">On September 12, 1997, the state once again filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that, inter alia, \u201cfar more than one year [had] passed since \u2018the original action\u2019 . . . filed by Peabody based on those claims [federal action] was dismissed by the United States District Court for lack of jurisdiction . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>On May 1,1998, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision dismissing Peabody\u2019s claim on the ground that Peabody had \u201cfailed to comply with the notice provision of \u00a7 4-61 (a).\u201d The court stated that \u201c[n]one of the . . . documents submitted by Peabody demonstrate that it provided written notice of its intention to file the present action, and the factual bases for same, to the agency head of the [state].\u201d Because this failure deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction, the trial court did not address the other grounds for dismissal relied upon by the state, including the state\u2019s argument that \u00a7 52-592 (a) does not operate to save the present action. Peabody appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment and, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c), we transferred the appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">On appeal, Peabody claims that: (1) the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 4-61 was, for various reasons, improper;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (2) under the proper interpretation of \u00a7 4-61, the trial court improperly dismissed Peabody\u2019s action on the ground that Peabody had failed to provide adequate notice both of its intent to file the present action based on Standard\u2019s claims and the factual bases for such claims; and (3) the trial court improperly concluded that a motion to dismiss is an appropriate vehicle by which to determine the sufficiency of the allegations regarding notice contained in Peabody\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The state claims that the dismissal of Peabody\u2019s action should be affirmed because: (1) the action was not brought within the applicable limitations period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>provided in \u00a7 4-61, which ended on September 22,1994, three year's after the issuance of the certificate of acceptance of the project; (2) Peabody\u2019s pleadings do not allege the facts necessary to a finding that Peabody had complied with the notice provisions of \u00a7 4-61; and (3) the facts, documents and related arguments upon which Peabody relies to demonstrate its notice and the state\u2019s alleged waiver of such notice were not properly submitted to the trial court and are not properly before this court. Additionally, the state argues that, for various reasons, Peabody cannot bring this action pursuant to \u00a7 52-592 (a), because, inter alia, the present action was not brought within one year of the federal action, which is, for purposes of the saving statute, the \u201coriginal action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We agree with the state that the present action cannot be brought under \u00a7 52-592 (a) and is, therefore, untimely. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">THE SAVING STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Although the parties raise several issues on appeal, the issue of whether the present action is time barred is dispositive of this appeal. Our conclusion that Peabody cannot rely on \u00a7 52-592 (a) therefore obviates the need for consideration of the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Essentially, the state advances two arguments supporting its assertion that the present action may not be brought under \u00a7 52-592 (a). First, it claims that the action set forth in Peabody\u2019s complaint is not \u201cfor the same cause\u201d as the action set forth in either of Peabody\u2019s complaints in the first two actions, one of which must be considered the \u201coriginal action\u201d for purposes of the statute. Alternatively, the state asserts that, even if the present action <em>were </em>for the same cause as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>first state action, the present action must then also be for the same cause as the federal action, as the complaints in those two prior actions are nearly identical. The state claims that the federal action, which was the first to be brought, is therefore, for purposes of \u00a7 52-592 (a), the \u201coriginal action.\u201d According to the state, because that action was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction more than five years prior to the filing of the complaint in the present action, Peabody may not rely upon \u00a7 52-592 (a). We agree with the state\u2019s second argument.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Section 52-592, our saving statute, provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf any action, commenced within the time limited by law, has failed one or more times to be tried on its merits because of insufficient service or return of the writ due to unavoidable accident or the default or neglect of the officer to whom it was committed, or because the action has been dismissed for want of jurisdiction, or the action has been otherwise avoided or defeated by the death of a party or for any matter of form . . . the plaintiff . . . may commence a new action . . . <em>for the same cause </em>at any time <em>within one year after the determination of the original action </em>or after the reversal of the judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-592 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Although a more comprehensive recitation of the procedural history of this case appears at the outset of this opinion, because that history has such a significant bearing on this issue, we provide a brief summary. Peabody\u2019s federal action was commenced on July 29,1991, and dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on June 12, 1992. Peabody brought the first state action on June 2, 1993, well within the three year limitations period of \u00a7 4-61. The trial court denied the state\u2019s motion to dismiss, from which judgment the state appealed to this court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>In <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Peabody, N.E., Inc., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 105, we reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case with direction to grant the state\u2019s motion to dismiss, which the trial court did on November 11, 1996. Finally, Peabody brought the present action on August 12, 1997, more than five years after the dismissal of the federal action, and nearly three years after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period, but less than one year after the dismissal of the first state action, which was brought within the statute of limitations period. For Peabody to be able to maintain this action, therefore, we must conclude that, for purposes of \u00a7 52-592 (a), the \u201coriginal action\u201d was the first state action rather than the federal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">To resolve this issue we must determine: (1) whether the federal action and the first state action are \u201cfor the same cause,\u201d as required by \u00a7 52-592 (a); and (2) if they are, which action, the federal action or the first state action, is the \u201coriginal action\u201d under \u00a7 52-592 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">We assume, without deciding, that the present action is, as Peabody claims, \u201cfor the same cause\u201d as the first state action, as required by \u00a7 52-592 (a). We must determine, therefore, whether the federal action is for the same cause as the first state action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If it is not, our analysis of this issue ends because the present action would satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 52-592 (a) because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>it was brought within one year of the dismissal of the first state action, which would be the original action under the statute, as it would be the first action brought within the applicable statute of limitations period \u201cfor the same cause\u201d as the present action. If we conclude, however, that the federal action <em>is </em>for the same cause as the present action, we must then determine which of the two first actions \u2014 the federal action or the first state action \u2014 must be considered the original action for purposes of \u00a7 52-592 (a). A comparison of Peabody\u2019s complaints in the first two actions compels us to conclude that they are both for the same cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The complaint filed in the federal action and that filed in the first state action are virtually identical. The only substantive difference between the two complaints is the following paragraph, which was included in the state complaint but which had not appeared in the federal complaint: \u201c4. To the extent [Standard] incurred the damages and expenses as alleged, such damages and expenses were caused by acts and/or omissions of the [state] and not by any acts and/or omissions of Peabody.\u201d In both complaints, Peabody relies upon the same facts, makes the same allegations, and seeks the same relief.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In fact, Peabody does not dispute that the two actions are for the same cause, electing instead to argue that this court should adopt a new definition of \u201coriginal action\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 52-592 (a). See part IIB of this opinion. In light of the foregoing, therefore, we conclude that both the federal action and the first state action are for the same cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">We must now determine which action is the original action for purposes of \u00a7 52-592 (a). In <em>Pintavalle </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>Valkanos, </em>216 Conn. 412, 581 A.2d 1050 (1990), this court considered, in depth, the meaning of \u201coriginal action\u201d as that phrase is used in \u00a7 52-592 (a). In that case, the plaintiffs first action was dismissed due to improper service of process. The plaintiff then brought a second action beyond the applicable statute of limitations period, relying on \u00a7 52-592 (a). This second action was dismissed for failure to prosecute. Id., 414. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought a third action, again under \u00a7 52-592 (a), claiming that, because this third action was commenced within one year of the dismissal of the prior action that had been brought under \u00a7 52-592 (a), the statute \u201csaved\u201d the third action. Id., 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The trial court in <em>Pintavalle </em>granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that the third action, which had not been brought within the applicable two year statute of limitations period, was time barred. Id. Additionally, the trial court held that the third action was not saved by \u00a7 52-592 (a) because it had not been brought within one year of the dismissal of the first action. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">This court noted that the dispositive issue in <em>Pintavalle </em>was the meaning of the term \u201coriginal action\u201d in \u00a7 52-592 (a). Id. The defendant argued that the first action filed by the plaintiff within the applicable statute of limitations period must be considered the original action. Id. This interpretation would have prohibited the plaintiff from relying on \u00a7 52-592 (a), because the third action was not filed within one year of the dismissal of the first action. The plaintiff, by contrast, argued that \u201coriginal action\u201d refers to either the next preceding action, or the first action over which the court has jurisdiction. Id. Either interpretation would have saved the third action.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Despite the plaintiffs arguments to the contrary, in <em>Pintavalle, </em>we agreed with the defendant\u2019s reading of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the phrase \u201coriginal action.\u201d First, we noted that the Appellate Court had addressed the same issue in <em>Marangio </em>v. <em>Shop Rite Supermarkets, Inc., </em>11 Conn. App. 156, 525 A.2d 1389, cert. denied, 204 Conn. 809, 528 A.2d 1155 (1987) and, \u201c[r]elying upon canons of statutory construction and upon the interplay between the words \u2018new action\u2019 and \u2018original action\u2019 in \u00a7 52-592 (a), the court concluded that \u2018original action\u2019 means the first action brought by the plaintiff within the period of the applicable statute of limitations. Id., 159-60. The Appellate Court noted that \u2018[t]he statute does not say \u201cmay continue the action by bringing suit within one year,\u201d or use any words other than those which contemplate an end to the <em>original action </em>and the commencement of a <em>new </em>action within one year of the end of the <em>original action.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) <em>Pintavalle </em>v. <em>Valkanos, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 416. We were persuaded by the reasoning of the Appellate Court and concluded that \u00a7 52-592 (a) did not save the plaintiffs third action in <em>Pintavalle. </em>Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In addition to the logic of the <em>Marangio </em>opinion, we placed great reliance on the plain language of the statute, noting that, according to Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, \u201c \u2018[original\u2019 is defined as \u2018of or relating to a rise or a beginning: existing from the start . . . .\u201d <em>Pintavalle </em>v. <em>Valkanos, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 417. Therefore, the plain language of the statute supported the construction advanced by the defendant in <em>Pintavalle. </em>Consequently, we held that, \u201cunder the provisions of \u00a7 52-592 (a) \u2018original action\u2019 means the first action filed within the time allowed by the applicable statute of limitations.\u201d Id., 419. We noted that \u201c[t]his interpretation is consistent with the plain meaning of the statute and protects the policy concerns underlying statutes of limitation.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Returning to the present appeal, we note that the dispositive factor in this case, as it was in <em>Pintavalle, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>is the interpretation of \u201coriginal action\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 52-592 (a). Therefore, we rely on our oft-stated principles of statutory construction. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [O]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Dohmann, </em>247 Conn. 274, 286, 722 A.2d 1205 (1998); <em>Ferrigno </em>v. <em>Cromwell Development Associates, </em>244 Conn. 189, 195, 708 A.2d 1371 (1998).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fimiani </em>v. <em>Star Gallo Distributors, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 635, 642, 729 A.2d 212 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The roots of \u00a7 52-592 (a) reach as far back as 1862. Public Acts 1862, c. XIV,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> however, included the phrase \u201coriginal suit\u201d rather than \u201coriginal action.\u201d In subsequent years, the saving statute was amended several times. In 1902, in addition to other changes not relevant to this issue, the legislature replaced the phrase \u201coriginal suit\u201d with \u201coriginal action.\u201d See General Statutes (1902 Rev.) \u00a7 1127. Because we are unable to research <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the legislative history of statutes of such age, however, the legislature\u2019s intent regarding the meaning to be ascribed to \u201coriginal action,\u201d as well as the circumstances surrounding the statute\u2019s enactment or amendment, remains unknown. We are left, therefore, with essentially the same tools that were available to us when we decided <em>Pintavalle: </em>the plain language of the statute and the general policy it is meant to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u201cAs with any issue of statutory interpretation, our initial guide is the language of the statute itself.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Peabody, N.E., Inc., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 102; <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners, P.C. </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 756, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996); see also <em>Fimiani </em>v. <em>Star Gallo Distributors Inc., </em>supra, 248 Conn. 642. Neither the plain language of the statute pertaining to the phrase \u201coriginal action,\u201d nor the common sense reading that we gave that phrase in <em>Pintavalle, </em>have changed since we decided that case less than nine years ago. As we have noted numerous times, and as we reiterated in Pintavalle: \u201c \u2018The words of a statute are to be given their commonly approved meaning unless a contrary intent is clearly expressed.\u2019 <em>Kilpatrick v. Board of Education, </em>206 Conn. 25, 28, 535 A.2d 1311 (1988).\u201d <em>Pintavalle </em>v. <em>Valkanos, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 416. We perceive no contrary intent in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">We also have stated that, \u201c[i]n the absence of ambiguity, statutory language should be given its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>175 Conn. 504, 509, 400 A.2d 721 (1978).\u201d <em>Pintavalle </em>v. <em>Valkanos, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 416-17. We do not read any ambiguity in the statute. We see no reason to read \u201coriginal\u201d to mean anything other than \u201cof or relating to a rise or a beginning: existing from the start\u201d; Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary; which is the dictionary definition we relied on in <em>Pintavalle, </em>and which comports with the plain and ordinary meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>word as it is used in common parlance. Consequently, we reaffirm our holding in <em>Pintavalle </em>that, \u201c[i]n the context of \u00a7 52-592 (a), \u2018original action\u2019 is used to refer to <em>the first </em>action filed by the plaintiff within the period of the applicable statute of limitations.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Pintavalle </em>v. <em>Valkanos, </em>supra, 417.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Peabody argues that the second tool of statutory construction available to us \u2014 that is, the policy underlying the statute \u2014 militates in favor of its interpretation of \u201coriginal action.\u201d Peabody places great reliance on the remedial nature of \u00a7 52-592 (a), stating that \u201cthe case law is clear that [\u00a7] 52-592 is a remedial statute to be given a liberal interpretation, so that litigants\u2019 rights to a trial on the merits are not defeated by strict construction of procedural rules.\u201d For support, Peabody quotes from this court\u2019s decision in <em>Isaac </em>v. <em>Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>210 Conn. 721, 733, 557 A.2d 116 (1989), in which we stated: \u201cThe [saving] statute is designed to insure to the diligent suitor the right to a hearing in court till he reaches a judgment on the merits. Its broad and liberal purpose is not to be frittered away by any narrow construction. . . . We, likewise, decline to \u2018fritter away\u2019 the strong remedial purpose of our saving statute, \u00a7 52-592.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Initially, we note that <em>Isaac </em>was decided more than one and one-half years <em>before </em>this court decided <em>Pintavalle. </em>Therefore, the language in <em>Isaac </em>and the remedial nature of the saving statute was fully within the contemplation of this court when we rendered our decision in <em>Pintavalle. </em>We see no more reason today to ignore the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>plain language of the statute and to defer to the remedial nature of the statute than we did then.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Peabody seeks to distinguish <em>Pintavalle </em>from the present case by relying on the different procedural postures of the appeals in the two cases.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Peabody notes that, in both cases, the first action was filed within the applicable statute of limitations period. In <em>Pintavalle, </em>however, the plaintiff brought the second action pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>to \u00a7 52-592 (a), and, after the action\u2019s dismissal, brought a third action, relying again on the saving statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">By contrast, Peabody adverts to the fact that, in the present case, the second action to be brought chronologically \u2014 that is, the first state action \u2014 was brought within the three year limitations period of \u00a7 4-61 and, therefore, Peabody relied only once on \u00a7 52-592. In essence, according to Peabody, every plaintiff should be able to rely <em>one time </em>on the saving statute, as long as the action is commenced within one year of the determination of an action properly filed within the applicable statute of limitations period, and as long as the action meets all of the other requirements of the statute. This argument is one that this court has not previously had the opportunity to address. We do so now, considering it against the holding of <em>Pintavalle, </em>as well as against the puipose of the saving statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Although Peabody acknowledges that it is not binding on this court, Peabody cites a Superior Court decision with a similar procedural history in the trial courts as the present case, in which the trial court \u201cconstrue [d] \u2018original action\u2019 to include the most recent lawsuit filed by the plaintiff within the statute of limitations period.\u201d <em>Ayala </em>v. Zachary, Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Docket No. 094633 (May 25, 1990) (1 Conn. L. Rptr. 671, 672). The trial court in <em>Ayala </em>stated that \u201c[t]his construction recognizes the remedial nature of the accidental failure of suit statute by extending the limitation period while at the same time addressing the concerns . . . about indefinite extensions of the applicable statute of limitations.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">First, we note that this case is controlled by <em>Pintavalle </em>and not by a decision of the Superior Court. Second, we disagree that the policy considerations underlying \u00a7 52-592 militate in favor of recognizing Peabody\u2019s interpretation of the statute. We recognize, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>we have for more than one century, that \u00a7 52-592 (a) \u201cis remedial in nature and, therefore, warrants a broad construction.\u201d <em>Ruddock </em>v. <em>Burrowes, </em>243 Conn. 569, 575, 706 A.2d 967 (1998); see also, e.g., <em>Lacasse </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>214 Conn. 464, 470, 572 A.2d 357 (1990); <em>Isaac </em>v. <em>Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 728; <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Jackman, </em>167 Conn. 96, 98, 355 A.2d 234 (1974); <em>Ross Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Surkis, </em>163 Conn. 388, 393, 311 A.2d 74 (1972); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Baningoso, </em>134 Conn. 382, 387, 58 A.2d 5 (1948); <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Sikes, </em>56 Conn. 589, 591-92 (Superior Court 1888). We do not believe, however, that a statute should be read so broadly or interpreted so expansively that the plain language of the statute, or this court\u2019s relatively recent construction of that language, should be ignored. As we stated previously herein, the language is not ambiguous. In the absence of an express legislative intent to read the language in a way different from the common, ordinary usage of the language, we decline to depart from that ordinary usage or from this court\u2019s recent precedent, especially in light of the absence of legislative activity in response to that precedent. See footnote 14 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">We disagree with Peabody, therefore, that every plaintiff should be able to rely on the saving statute. Section 52-592 (a) was not meant simply to add an additional year to the end of the applicable statute of limitations period. Rather, it was designed to allow plaintiffs to cure certain defects in their actions if they seek to do so within a reasonable period of time. If they file their complaints very early in the statute of limitations period, the period generally will provide them time to discover the types of defects that would satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 52-592 (a). Such plaintiffs would not have to rely on that statute, however, as there likely would be enough time remaining under the statute of limitations to cure the defect. If, however, the original action is brought near the end of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>of limitations period, the period within which an action for the same cause may be brought extends to one year after the determination of the original action. We conclude that \u00a7 52-592 (a) is not available to every plaintiff whose action fails for any of the reasons enumerated in the statute, but, rather, is available to those plaintiffs who bring their original actions within the last year of the applicable statute of limitations periods.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We note, however, that, even in such cases, the period within which to file a complaint would not necessarily extend the statute of limitations period by one year but would, instead, extend the filing period only to one year from the date of the failure of the original action.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">We acknowledge the strong policy favoring the adjudication of cases on their merits rather than the disposal of them on the grounds enumerated in \u00a7 52-592 (a). See, e.g., <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Coppola, </em>243 Conn. 657, 665, 707 A.2d 281 (1998) (\u201c[o]ur practice does not favor the termination of proceedings without a determination of the merits of the controversy where that can be brought about with due regard to necessary rules of procedure\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Calise, </em>174 Conn. 567, 574, 392 A.2d 440 (1978) (\u201c[i]t is the policy of the law to bring about a trial on the merits of a dispute whenever possible and to secure for the litigant his day in court\u201d). We note, however, that this policy is not without limits. If it were, there would be no statutes of limitations. Even the saving statute does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>guarantee that all plaintiffs have the opportunity to have their cases decided on the merits. It merely allows them a limited opportunity to correct certain defects in their actions within a certain period of time. If an action, brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-592 (a), fails, even for the statutorily enumerated reasons, and if more than one year has passed since the determination of the original action, the plaintiff will not be able to maintain an action, even though the case was not decided on its merits. Therefore, although there is a preference that cases be adjudicated on their merits, the legislature has provided only a limited mechanism by which plaintiffs may \u201csave\u201d deficient actions. One of those requirements is that the action be brought within one year of the determination of the original action, that is, the first action filed within the applicable statute of hmitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Finally, we turn to the facts of the appeal before us. As we concluded previously herein, the federal action, which was brought first, and the first state action, which followed, were virtually identical and, therefore, if either can be considered \u201cfor the same cause\u201d as the present action, both must be. Therefore, according to our interpretation of the phrase \u201coriginal action\u201d in \u00a7 52-592 (a), the federal action, which was \u201cthe first action filed by the plaintiff within the period of the applicable statute of limitations\u201d; <em>Pintavalle </em>v. <em>Valkanos, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 417; is the original action for purposes of that statute. Because the present action was filed more than five years after the dismissal of the original action, we conclude that it fails to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 52-592 (a). Moreover, we reiterate that this action was commenced nearly three years after the expiration of the statute of hmitations provided in \u00a7 4-61. Consequently, the present action is, as a matter of law, time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In this opinion NORCOTT and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-592 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) If any action, commenced within the time limited by law, has failed one or more times to be tried on its merits because of insufficient service or return of the writ due to unavoidable accident or the default or neglect of the officer to whom it was committed, or because the action has been dismissed for want of jurisdiction, or the action has been otherwise avoided or defeated by the death of a party or for any matter of form; or if, in any such action after a verdict for the plaintiff, the judgment has been set aside, or if a judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>of nonsuit has been rendered or a judgment for the plaintiff reversed, the plaintiff, or, if the plaintiff is dead and the action by law survives, his executor or administrator, may commence a new action, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, for the same cause at any time within one year after the determination of the original action or after the reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u201c(b) When any action has been brought against an executor or administrator or continued against an executor or administrator after the death of the defendant and has failed for any of the causes listed in subsection (a) of this section, the plaintiff, or his executor or administrator in case a cause of action survives, may commence a new action within six months after the determination of the original action.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u201c(c) If an appeal is had from any such judgment to the Supreme Court or Appellate Court, the time the case is pending upon appeal shall be excluded in computing the time as above limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u201c(d) The provisions of this section shall apply to any defendant who files a cross complaint in any action, and to any action between the same parties or the legal representatives of either of them for the same cause of action or subject of action brought to any court in this state, either before dismissal of the original action and its affirmance or within one year after the dismissal and affirmance, and to airy action brought to the United States circuit or district court for the district of Connecticut which has been dismissed without trial upon its merits or because of lack of jurisdiction in such court.

Sometimes, when we have made such a determination, the legislature instructs us that we have misconstrued its intentions. We are bound by the instructions so provided. . . . More often, however, the legislature takes no further action to clarify its intentions. Time and again we have characterized the failure of the legislature to take corrective action as manifesting the legislature\u2019s acquiescence in our construction of a statute. ... In light of our role as surrogates for the legislature, proper respect for the separation of powers has led us to exercise prudence with respect to the overruling of cases that involve the construction of a statute.

It does so by ignoring the plain meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 52-592 (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the remedial purpose of the statute, and the mandate of liberal construction that governs our interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Section 52-592 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf any action, commenced within the time limited by law, has failed one or more times to be tried on its merits [for any of various enumerated reasons], the plaintiff . . . may commence a new action . . . for the same cause at any time within one year after the determination of the original action . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">In the present case, the plaintiff asserted a third party complaint against the defendant on two separate occasions; each of these complaints was timely. After both of these complaints had been dismissed<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (and after the statute of limitations had expired), the plaintiff asserted this direct action against the defendant. By the time the plaintiff asserted the direct action, more than one year had passed since the <em>earlier </em>third party complaint was dismissed, but less than one year had passed since the <em>later </em>third party complaint was dismissed. In my view, the plaintiff was entitled to commence the direct action, which it asserted \u201cwithin one year after the determination of\u2019 an action \u201ccommenced within the time limited by law\u201d (i.e., the later third party complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>This result comports with the plain meaning of \u00a7 52-592 (a), which permits a plaintiff to \u201ccommence a new action . . . for the same cause\u201d within one year of the dismissal of <em>\u201cany </em>action, commenced within the time limited by law . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) As a matter of rudimentary syntax and common sense,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it makes no difference whether the plaintiff has asserted prior, unsuccessful actions. Significantly, the statute does not say that the new action must be commenced within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>one year of the dismissal of <em>the first action </em>that the plaintiff commenced within the time limited by law. If the legislature had wished to create such a regime, it knew very well how to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">To shift focus somewhat, \u00a7 52-592 (a) also permits a plaintiff to \u201ccommence a new action . . . for the same cause\u201d within one year of the dismissal of \u201cany action, commenced within the time limited by law, [that] has failed <em>one or more times </em>to be tried on its merits.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) In order to make coherent sense of the entire statute, the terms \u201cfor the same cause\u201d and \u201cany action\u201d must \u201cinclude the most recent lawsuit filed by the plaintiff within the statute of limitations period.\u201d <em>Ayala </em>v. <em>Zachary, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Docket No. 094633 (May 25, 1990) (1 Conn. L. Rptr. 671, 672). This interpretation is necessary in order to give meaning to the statutory phrase \u201cone or more times.\u201d Moreover, \u201c[t]his construction recognizes the remedial nature of [\u00a7 52-592 (a)] by extending the limitation period while at the same time addressing the concerns . . . about indefinite extensions of the applicable statute of limitations.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">My reading of the statute also comports with the fundamental principle that statutes of limitation exist, in part, \u201cto promote justice by preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>476 U.S. 467, 481 n.13, 106 S. Ct. 2022, 90 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1986). In the present case, the plaintiff gave the defendant timely notice that it intended to pursue its claim. Significantly, the defendant has not claimed that it has been prejudiced, that it was the victim of deception, or even that it had any reason to believe that the plaintiff would not pursue its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>If there were any doubts concerning any of my conclusions about the meaning of \u00a7 52-592 (a), the rule that we must liberally construe remedial statutes would be sufficient to dispel them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Predictably, the majority has ignored this mandate. Moreover, the majority does no more than pay lip service to what it describes as \u201cthe strong policy favoring the adjudication of cases on their merits rather than the disposal of them on the grounds enumerated in \u00a7 52-592 (a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The majority declines to read \u00a7 52-592 (a) in a manner that makes sense of the statutory language or acknowledges either the mandate of liberal construction or the strong public policy favoring adjudication of cases on the merits. Instead, my colleagues in the majority have placed heavy reliance upon <em>Pintavalle </em>v. <em>Valkanos, </em>216 Conn. 412, 581 A.2d 1050 (1990). The majority has put its eggs in the wrong basket.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">To begin with, the facts of <em>Pintavalle </em>are materially different from the facts of the present case. In <em>Pintavalle, </em>the plaintiff asserted only one action within the statute of limitations. That action was dismissed. Id., 414. Several months <em>after </em>the statute of limitations had expired, the plaintiff commenced a second action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This latter action was dismissed as well. Id. More than one year after the plaintiffs only timely action had been dismissed (but <em>less </em>than one year after the plaintiffs untimely second action had been dismissed), the plaintiff asserted a third action. Id., 414-15. The plaintiff claimed that this third action fell within the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>\u00a7 52-592 (a) because \u201cthe legislature intended to permit plaintiffs to bring a potentially unlimited number of suits as long as each action is brought within one year of the failure of the prior action.\u201d Id., 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The court in <em>Pintavalle </em>properly recognized that the plaintiff\u2019s argument \u201cdefeat[s] the basic purpose of statutes of limitation, namely, promoting finality in the litigation process.\u201d Id., 417. This conclusion has absolutely nothing at all to do with the present case. Because the plaintiff in this case asserted the action upon which it relies<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>before </em>the statute of limitations had expired, the direct action is saved by operation of \u00a7 52-592 (a). In sharp contrast to the position advocated by the plaintiff in <em>Pintavalle, </em>my interpretation of \u00a7 52-592 (a) contains a built-in time limit: the protection afforded by the statute expires one year after the determination of the latest action \u201ccommenced within the time limited by law.\u201d This is a far cry from the \u201cpotentially limitless extension\u201d that the <em>Pintavalle </em>court rejected. <em>Pintavalle </em>v. <em>Valkanos, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The majority emphasizes the following line from <em>Pintavalle: </em>\u201cunder the provisions of \u00a7 52-592 (a), \u2018original action\u2019 means the first action filed within the time allowed by the applicable statute of limitations.\u201d Id., 419. The majority has taken this line out of context. In the very next sentence, the <em>Pintavalle </em>court emphasized that \u201c[t]his interpretation is consistent with the plain meaning of the statute <em>and protects the policy concerns underlying statutes of limitation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. As I have explained, the policy concerns underlying this interpretation of \u00a7 52-592 (a) are limited to the kind of \u201cpotentially limitless extension\u201d sought by the plaintiff in <em>Pintavalle. </em>Id., 417. For this reason, we must recognize a similar limitation upon the meaning that the <em>Pintavalle </em>court ascribed to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Moreover, the line that the majority has extracted from <em>Pintavalle </em>has nothing to do with the facts of that case, in which the plaintiff asserted only <em>one </em>action within the statute of limitations. Accordingly, everything that the court said about <em>\u201cthe first action </em>filed within the time allowed by the applicable statute of limitations\u201d is pure dicta, wholly irrelevant to the resolution of the controversy between the parties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Id., 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Significantly, my interpretation of \u00a7 52-592 (a) is consistent with the holding of <em>Pintavalle. </em>The plaintiff in that case commenced his third action more than one year after the trial court had dismissed the only action that the plaintiff had asserted within the statute of limitations. Accordingly, the <em>Pintavalle </em>court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff could not take refuge in the shelter of \u00a7 52-592 (a) comports with my analysis of the plain meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Finally, the dicta in <em>Pintavalle </em>upon which the majority hangs its hat finds no support in the language of \u00a7 52-592 (a). The statute refers to two different actions: (1) \u201cany action, commenced within the time limited by law\u201d (the original action) and (2) a \u201cnew action . . . for the same cause [commenced] at any time within one year after the determination of the original action . . . .\u201d It is apparent that the legislature used the term \u201coriginal action\u201d in order to refer back to <em>\u201cany action </em>commenced within the time limited by law\u201d \u2014 which could be the first timely action that the plaintiff asserted or the twenty-first.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) There is nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>in the text of the statute to support the <em>Pintavalle </em>court\u2019s dicta that the \u201coriginal action\u201d must be the plaintiff\u2019s first timely action.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the legislators had meant what the dicta in <em>Pintavalle </em>says they meant, then they would have drafted a radically different statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If there were any doubt that we should reject the dicta in <em>Pintavalle, </em>the mandate of liberal construction would be sufficient to dispel it.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In my view, the majority has disregarded the text of \u00a7 52-592, the purpose of statutes of limitation in general and of \u00a7 52-592 (a) in particular, and the mandate of liberal construction. Worst of all, the majority\u2019s mindless formalism does violence to the strong public policy that \u2014 as the majority concedes \u2014 animates \u00a7 52-592 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-9\"> Section 52-592 was amended by Public Acts 1998, No. 98-20, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, which added subsection (e).
