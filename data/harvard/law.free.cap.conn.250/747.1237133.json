The trial court dismissed that petition, and the Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">The commissioner filed a subsequent petition for termination, which the trial court granted, terminating the parental rights of the respondent mother, Julie M., to Jessica M.

After examining the record and considering the briefs and oral arguments of the parties, we have determined that this appeal, through no fault of the parties, has been rendered moot and should be dismissed. See <em>Conetta </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>246 Conn. 281, 295, 715 A.2d 756 (1998) (when events occur that preclude appellate court from granting practical relief through disposition of merits, case is moot); <em>Blesso Fire Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Eastern Connecticut State University, </em>245 Conn. 252, 256, 713 A.2d 1283 (1998) (same). We further have determined that the judgments of the Appellate Court and the trial court in this matter should be vacated. See <em>U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. </em>v. <em>Bonner Mall Partnership, </em>513 U.S. 18, 22, 115 S. Ct. 386, 130 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1994) (when appeal rendered moot through no fault of parties, established federal practice is for appellate court to grant motion for vacatur of judgment under appellate review); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Munsingwear, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 36, 39, 71 S. Ct. 104, 95 L. Ed. 36 (1950) (same); compare <em>U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. </em>v. <em>Bonner Mall Partnership, </em>supra, 29 (mootness by reason of settlement does not require appellate court vacatur of judgment under appellate review); see also <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>DeMilo &amp; Co., </em>233 Conn. 254, 269, 659 A.2d 148 (1995) (citing aforementioned cases with approval).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The appeal is dismissed and the judgments of the Appellate Court and the trial court are vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-11\"> We granted the petition of the commissioner of children and families for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court; <em>In re Jessica M., </em>49 Conn.

I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the motion of the commissioner of children and families (commissioner) to vacate the judgments of the Appellate Court and Superior Court should be granted. The majority grants the motion on the basis that vacatur is automatic when an appeal becomes moot through no fault of the parties. I believe, however, that there remains a question whether the commissioner\u2019s voluntary actions caused the mootness, and that the application of a balancing test is necessary to determine whether vacatur is appropriate in light of public policy interests. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The majority\u2019s decision to grant the commissioner\u2019s motion to vacate relies on federal cases that discuss automatic vacatur when an appeal becomes moot through no fault of the parties. The majority relies on the dictum of the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Munsingwear, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 36, 71 S. Ct. 104, 95 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1950) (Munsingwear), that \u201c[t]he established practice of the [United States Supreme] Court in dealing with a civil case from a court in the federal system which has become moot while on its way [up to the Supreme Court] or pending [a] decision on the merits is to reverse or vacate the judgment below and remand with a direction to dismiss.\u201d Id., 39. Munsingwear\u2019s holding, however, was that vacatur was <em>not </em>available because the government, as the party seeking vacatur, had \u201cslept on its rights\u201d; id., 41; by failing to appeal the unfavorable decision. See generally id., 39-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">In later discussing <em>Munsingwear, </em>the United States Supreme Court observed that \u201cthe decision ... at most . . . [stands for] the proposition that vacatur should have been sought, not that it necessarily would have been granted.\u201d <em>U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. </em>v. <em>Bonner Mall Partnership, </em>513 U.S. 18, 23, 115 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>386, 130 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1994) <em>(Bancorp). </em>In <em>Bancorp, </em>the court observed that vacatur is not always automatic and noted that the language in <em>Munsingwear </em>calling automatic vacatur the \u201cestablished practice\u201d was dictum. See id. In <em>Bancorp, </em>the court stated that, in <em>Munsingwear, </em>it had acknowledged that the \u201c \u2018established practice\u2019 . . . was not entirely uniform\u201d; id.; and that <em>\u201cpost-Munsingwear </em>practice [has not] been [unfailingly] uniform.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Id., 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In <em>Bancorp, </em>the United States Supreme Court considered whether vacatur was available when the mootness resulted from a party\u2019s voluntary actions. The court observed that the remedy of vacatur is not justified in cases in which the moving party causes mootness through its own voluntary actions \u2014 in <em>Bancorp, </em>by settlement \u2014 save under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d Id. When \u201cthe losing party has voluntarily forfeited his legal remedy by the ordinary processes of appeal or certiorari, [he has surrendered] his claim to the equitable remedy of vacatur.\u201d Id., 25. Vacatur, the court explained, is equitable relief, and the party seeking vacatur must demonstrate \u201cequitable entitlement to the extraordinary remedy of vacatur.\u201d Id., 26. The court in <em>Bancorp </em>stated: \u201cJudicial precedents are presumptively correct and valuable to the legal community as a whole. They are not merely the property of private litigants and should stand unless a court concludes that the public interest would be served by a vacatur.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.; accord <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>DeMilo &amp; Co., </em>233 Conn. 254, 272-73, 659 A.2d 148 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">In <em>DeMilo &amp; Co., </em>this court held that when a party\u2019s appeal from an unfavorable judgment is dismissed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>moot, vacatur is not automatic, and courts should adopt a balancing approach in considering vacatur. See <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>DeMilo &amp; Co., </em>supra, 233 Conn. 272-73. I believe that Appellate Court decisions are valuable and that proper procedures to review such opinions should be followed. There should be no \u201cend runs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Before applying any balancing approach to this case and deciding whether the commissioner has met her burden of proving that vacatur is equitable, this court first should consider the commissioner\u2019s claim that she did not voluntarily cause the appeal in this case to become moot. At present, it is unclear from a review of the record before us whether the commissioner voluntarily caused the mootness of her appeal in this case. During the trial, Jessica M. was living with a foster family. While the trial court denied the commissioner\u2019s petition to terminate parental rights, it also found Jessica M. to be neglected and ordered her committed to the commissioner\u2019s care for one year. The commissioner appealed based on the trial court\u2019s failure to terminate parental rights. During the pendency of this appeal, the commissioner filed a subsequent petition to terminate parental rights. Whether the commissioner was required at that time by statute to file the second petition is not clear from a review of the record. It does not appear that Jessica M. was again in the custody of her parents or that other circumstances called for the commissioner to file the second petition immediately. Whether the second petition constitutes a voluntary action by the commissioner forfeiting her initial appeal is an issue that I believe this court should address before deciding to grant vacatur.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Accordingly, I dissent from the decision of the majority to vacate the judgments of the Appellate Court and Superior Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\"> In fact, the <em>Munsingwear </em>language \u201cdoes not appear to have gained adherence in the courts of the states . . .
