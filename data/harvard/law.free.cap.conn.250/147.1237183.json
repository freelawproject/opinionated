We conclude that, as a nonparty, a bail bondsman does not have a right of appeal under \u00a7 52-263.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The record discloses the following factual and procedural history. The defendant in the underlying criminal case, Ralston Salmon, was arrested and charged with violating General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-279 (a) and (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 21a-277 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He posted a surety bond of $150,000 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>was released. B &amp; B Bail Bonds Agency, Inc. (bondsman), was the surety that furnished the bond. When the defendant later failed to appear for a court date, the trial court, on January 7, 1997, ordered the forfeiture of the bond. The court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-65a,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> simultaneously ordered the rearrest of the defendant and a stay of execution on the forfeiture for six months. The bondsman located the defendant in Jamaica, but was not permitted to remove him without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>extradition authorization from Connecticut. Accordingly, the bondsman requested that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office extradite the defendant to Connecticut, which it refused to do. The stay of execution subsequently lapsed, and the forfeiture of the bond became due. After the state settled its claim with the bondsman for $75,000, the bondsman moved in the trial court for both a rebate of the bond forfeiture and a release from the bond. The trial court denied these motions, and the bondsman appealed from the denial of the motion for release to the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">The Appellate Court, acting sua sponte, placed the matter on its calendar on the question of \u201cwhy the appeal should not be dismissed because review by way of an appeal is not available to a nonparty.\u201d After hearing argument on that question, the Appellate Court dismissed the appeal. We granted the bondsman\u2019s petition for certification on this issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following oral argument, we decided, sua sponte, to consider the case en banc; see footnote 1 of this opinion; and to request supplemental briefs by the parties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Before this court, the bondsman claims that the Appellate Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 52-263 was incorrect. Specifically, the bondsman claims that review by way of appeal pursuant to \u00a7 52-263 is available based on our construction in prior cases of the term \u201cparty\u201d contained in \u00a7 52-263. We disagree, and conclude that review by way of appeal pursuant to \u00a7 52-263 is available only to parties to an underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">We first must determine the parameters of the \u201cparty\u201d requirement of \u00a7 52-263. Such a determination is a matter of statutory construction and, therefore, a matter of law over which this court\u2019s review is plenary. <em>Wright Bros. Builders, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>247 Conn. 218, 226, 720 A.2d 235 (1998). \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 431, 692 A.2d 742 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">We begin our analysis by examining the plain language of \u00a7 52-263, which provides in relevant part: \u201cUpon the trial of all matters of fact in any cause or action in the Superior Court, whether to the court or jury, or before any judge thereof when the jurisdiction of any action or proceeding is vested in him, <em>if either party </em>is aggrieved by the decision of the court or judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>upon any question or questions of law arising in the trial. . . he may appeal to the court having jurisdiction from the final judgment of the court or of such judge . . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) On its face, the statute explicitly sets out three criteria that must be met in order to establish subject matter jurisdiction for appellate review: (1) the appellant must be a party; (2) the appellant must be aggrieved by the trial court\u2019s decision; and (3) the appeal must be taken from a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The relevant language concerning \u201ceither party\u201d has remained unchanged since the statute was first enacted in 1929 as Public Acts 1929, c. 301, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because records of legislative history are not available for that time, the legislature\u2019s intent in using the phrase \u201ceither party\u201d is unknown. We previously have interpreted the party requirement of \u00a7 52-263, however, to mean a party to the underlying action. <em>In Bergeron v. Mackler, </em>225 Conn. 391, 392, 623 A.2d 489 (1993), the plaintiffs in error-brought a writ of error concerning the disqualification of tire law firm that they had retained to represent them as nonparty witnesses in a marital dissolution. In addressing the claims made pursuant to the writ of error, this court noted in a footnote that \u201c[t]he claim sought to be reviewed by the plaintiffs in error <em>could </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>not have been reviewed by this court by way of appeal because they were not parties in the underlying marital dissolution action. </em>Only an aggrieved <em>party </em>may appeal from a final judgment of the trial court. See Practice Book [\u00a7 61-1, formerly \u00a7 4000]. Consequently, a writ of error is the proper vehicle for review of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Bergeron </em>v. <em>Mackler, </em>supra, 391-92 n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Our prior interpretation in <em>Bergeron </em>is consistent with the usual meaning of the term \u201cparty.\u201d \u201cOrdinarily, the word \u2018party\u2019 has a technical legal meaning, referring \u2018to those by or against whom a legal suit is brought. . . the party plaintiff or defendant, whether composed of one or more individuals and whether natural or legal persons.\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, citing <em>Golatte </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>394 F. Sup. 1203, 1207 (D.C. Ala. 1975) . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>Reliable Refuse Co., </em>212 Conn. 661, 669, 563 A.2d 1013 (1989). This definition of party, which we also have labeled \u201cparty status in court\u201d; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 225-26, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992); includes only those who are parties to the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The bondsman argues, however, that judicially created exceptions exist whereby an appellant need not establish that he was a party to the underlying action in order to establish subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 52-263. As support for this contention, the bondsman, first, relies upon our interpretation of \u201cparty\u201d in <em>Day </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>245 Conn. 437, 441-42, 716 A.2d 47 (1998), and second, argues that interpreting the party requirement of \u00a7 52-263 as limited to parties to the underlying action would conflict in varying degrees with our prior decisions in <em>CFM of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chowdhury, </em>239 Conn. 375, 685 A.2d 1108 (1996), <em>Lougee </em>v. <em>Grinnell, </em>216 Conn. 483, 582 A.2d 456 (1990), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>and <em>In re Mongillo, </em>190 Conn. 686,461 A.2d 1387 (1983).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We are unpersuaded. To the extent that those precedents imply that a person or legal entity that is not a party to the underlying action constitutes a party for purposes of appellate review pursuant to \u00a7 52-263, those precedents are mistaken and are hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The bondsman first contends that, in <em>Day </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 442, we created a standard by which de facto parties satisfy the \u201cparty\u201d requirement for appellate review. We disagree that our decision in <em>Day </em>requires us to establish a broader definition of \u201cparty\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 52-263 than we adopt today. In <em>Day, </em>we interpreted the term \u201cparty\u201d in the context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>of General Statutes \u00a7 31-301b of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Section 31-30 lb provides in relevant part: <em>\u201cAny party </em>aggrieved by the decision of the Compensation Review Board upon any question or questions of law arising in the proceedings may appeal the decision ... to the Appellate Court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In that case, an employee retained the services of a law firm in the prosecution of a workers\u2019 compensation claim and agreed to pay the law firm 20 percent of the employee\u2019s gross recovery. Shortly before resolution of the matter two years later, the employee discharged that law firm and retained a different attorney. In a fee approval hearing, the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner awarded compensation to the law firm, and that sum was reduced on appeal to the workers\u2019 compensation review board. <em>Day </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>supra, 438-39. This court concluded that the law firm was an aggrieved, de facto party under \u00a7 31-301b, because, for purposes of that statute, \u201c[i]n short, a party is a litigant with a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Our adoption of a broader construction of the term \u201cparty\u201d that includes de facto parties in the context of appeals from the workers\u2019 compensation review board pursuant to \u00a7 31-301b does not, however, compel a similar construction of the term \u201cparty\u201d in the context of \u00a7 52-263. The circumstances surrounding our decision in <em>Day </em>are distinguishable from the present case in three critical respects. First, the plain language of the two statutes differ; whereas \u00a7 31-301b permits an appeal to be brought by <em>\u201cany </em>party,\u201d \u00a7 52-263 explicitly provides that <em>\u201ceither </em>party\u201d may seek appellate review if aggrieved. According to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990), although the word \u201cany\u201d can be considered synonymous with \u201ceither,\u201d \u201cevery\u201d or \u201call,\u201d it generally is understood to mean \u201cone out of many; an indefinite number.\u201d In contrast, \u201ceither\u201d is defined as \u201ceach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>two; or the other of two alternatives.\u201d Id. The use of the word \u201ceither\u201d in the context of \u00a7 52-263, therefore, implies a narrower universe of possible appellants than where the term \u201cany\u201d is used; \u201ceither party\u201d being limited to those persons or entities that are on one of two sides of a matter before the court, that is, the side of the plaintiff or of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Second, <em>Day </em>involved an appeal from the decision of an administrative agency, whereas \u00a7 52-263 concerns the appellate review of decisions of the trial court. We previously have concluded that in addition to its ordinary technical legal meaning, the term \u201cparty\u201d may have a broader, commonly approved usage signifying \u201c[a] person concerned or having or taking part in any affair, matter, transaction, or proceeding, considered individually, and ... is not restricted to strict meaning of plaintiff or defendant in a lawsuit.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 227. Accordingly, where appropriate in the context of appeals from the decisions of administrative agencies, we have construed the term \u201cparty\u201d more broadly than its ordinary, technical legal meaning.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Our prior, broader interpretation of a workers\u2019 compensation statute has no bearing, however, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>our construction of \u00a7 52-263. We are also mindful that the purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is remedial. <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>243 Conn. 438, 447, 705 A.2d 1012 (1997). In light of that remedial purpose, a broader construction of provisions pertaining to the workers\u2019 compensation commission is appropriate, whereas a similar reading would not be appropriate in the context of appellate jurisdiction to review decisions of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Third, and perhaps most significantly, a writ of error was not available to the aggrieved law firm in <em>Day, </em>whereas a person in the shoes of the bondsman in the present case would have a right of review by way of a writ of error. A writ of error may be brought to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-272 et seq., and Practice Book \u00a7 72-1. As we noted in <em>Day </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 442, \u201ca writ of error only may be brought from a final judgment of the superior court . . . .\u201d See also Practice Book \u00a7 72-1 (a). As a result, although a writ of error categorically is not available to an appellant such as the de facto party in <em>Day, </em>who would be seeking review of a decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board, it certainly is available to address a perceived error concerning the denial of a bail bondsman\u2019s motion for rebate or release in the context of a criminal trial in the Superior Court. For all of these reasons, we disagree with the bondsman that our decision in <em>Day </em>should govern our analysis of \u00a7 52-263.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">We next address the bondsman\u2019s claim that <em>CFM of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chowdhury, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 375, provides authority for the contention that a nonparty to the underlying action has a right of appellate review pursuant to \u00a7 52-263. At issue in <em>Chowdhury </em>was whether a sanctions order addressed to the plaintiffs attorney constituted a final judgment for purposes of res judicata such that a subsequent judge would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>precluded from vacating the order. Id., 376. In that case, both the plaintiff and its attorney appealed<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to the Appellate Court pursuant to \u00a7 52-263, and the defendant cross appealed the vacating of the order. Concluding that the sanction order was a final judgment, the Appellate Court decided in the defendant\u2019s favor, reversing the portion of the judgment that had vacated the sanction. Id., 377. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney, who was the cross appellee before the Appellate Court on the defendant\u2019s claim concerning the sanction order, then requested certification by this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-197f,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which we granted. <em>CFM of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chowdhury, </em>235 Conn. 933, 667 A.2d 1270 (1995). We subsequently affirmed the judgment of the Appellate Court. <em>CFM of Connecticut </em>v. <em>Chowdhury, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The bondsman argues that we must overrule <em>Chowdhury </em>under the construction of the term \u201cparty\u201d that we adopt today. This argument is flawed because the defendant in the underlying action in <em>Chowdhury </em>properly had brought the cross appeal pursuant to \u00a7 52-263 before the Appellate Court, and, as a result, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney was properly before that court as the cross appellee. We entertained the appeal in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>case pursuant to \u00a7 51-1971, and thus, did not consider the plaintiffs attorney to be a party pursuant to \u00a7 52-263, but instead, pursuant to \u00a7 51-1971 Accordingly, <em>Chowdhury </em>does not stand for the proposition that the plaintiffs attorney, as a nonparty to the underlying action, properly could obtain a right of review pursuant to \u00a7 52-263.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As a result, our decision in <em>Chowdhury </em>does not conflict with the analysis of \u00a7 52-263 set forth in this opinion. In any event, moreover, to the extent that <em>Chowdhury </em>may be read to expand the meaning of the term \u201cparty\u201d as used in \u00a7 52-263, we disavow any such reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">We next address together, <em>Lougee </em>v. <em>Grinnell, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 483, and <em>In re Mongillo, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 686, which the bondsman also asserts are at odds with our interpretation of the term \u201cparty.\u201d We begin our analysis by reviewing the relevant procedural history of each case. In <em>Lougee </em>v. <em>Grinned, </em>supra, 484, the appellee was the plaintiff in a Texas action who sought the testimony of the Connecticut appellant, a former employee of the defendant in the Texas action. Because the appellant could not be compelled to testify in Texas on behalf of his former employer, the appellee sought to subpoena the appellant to appear at a deposition in Connecticut. The appellant moved in the Superior Court of this state to quash the subpoena, which motion was denied. The appellant then appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court. Id., 485-86. Before reaching the merits of the appeal, we set out to determine whether the appeal was properly before this court as an appealable final judgment, noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>that an order issued upon a discovery motion in a civil case ordinarily does not constitute an appealable final judgment. Id., 486. We stated that \u201cthe sole judicial proceeding instituted in Connecticut concerned the propriety of [the appellee\u2019s] deposition subpoena, a proceeding that will not result in a later judgment from which [the appellant] can then appeal. Thus, this appeal falls within the first prong of the test of finality of judgment stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983): (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lougee </em>v. <em>Grinnell, </em>supra, 487. Having so concluded, we went on to address the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The appeal in <em>In re Mongillo, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 687-88, was brought by an attorney who the trial court had fined for tardiness, after untimely arriving for the call of the court docket. The attorney represented two defendants whose cases were called prior to his arrival. The attorney appealed the imposition of the fine to the Appellate Session of the Superior Court, which transferred the matter to this court. Id., 489-90. We addressed the merits of the claim without discussing the subject matter jurisdiction of the court to entertain the appeal, concluding that the imposition of the fine constituted an abuse of discretion. Id., 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The bondsman contends that these cases compel the conclusion that a nonparty to the underlying action has a right of review pursuant to \u00a7 52-263. We disagree. The question of party status pursuant to \u00a7 52-263 was never explicitly addressed in either <em>Lougee </em>or <em>In re Mongillo. </em>\u201cIt is the general rule that a case resolves only those issues explicitly decided in the case. See <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>179 Conn. 415, 416 n.1, 426 A.2d 1324 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>DellaCamera, </em>166 Conn. 557, 561, 353 A.2d 750 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Darwin, </em>161 Conn. 413, 421-22, 288 A.2d 422 (1971).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>190 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Conn. 84, 91, 459 A.2d 1005 (1983). \u201cUnder the accepted rule, the doctrine of stare decisis contemplates only such points as are actually involved and determined in a case, and not what is said by the court on points not necessarily involved therein <em>.'\u2019\u2019Riley </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>145 Conn. 1,5, 137 A.2d 759 (1958). For example, \u201c[i]n <em>DellaCamera . . . </em>this court declared a state statute unconstitutional after it had noted that previous cases had construed and applied the statute. The <em>DellaCamera </em>court stressed that no constitutional attack had been raised in the earlier cases and that therefore the earlier decisions could not stand for the proposition that the statute was constitutional. <em>State </em>v. <em>DellaCamera, </em>supra, [166 Conn.] 560-61.\u201d <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 416-17 n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">These principles apply to both <em>Lougee </em>and <em>In re Mongillo, </em>in neither of which did we explicitly address the question of party status prior to addressing the merits of the appeal. Both of these cases were decided before we stated explicitly in <em>Bergeron </em>v. <em>Madder, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 391-92 n. 1, that someone not a party to the underlying action had no right of review pursuant to \u00a7 52-263. As a result, they should not be understood to support the proposition that a nonparty to the underlying action is a party for purposes of \u00a7 52-263. Thus, properly understood, these cases do not prevent us from concluding that the term \u201cparty\u201d is limited to parties to the underlying action for purposes of establishing a right to review pursuant to \u00a7 52-263, as we do today.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">With the definition of the term \u201cparty\u201d established for purposes of \u00a7 52-263, we return to the first question posed in our request for supplemental briefs, that is, whether we should adopt a bright-line test requiring the appellant, in order to establish a right of appellate review pursuant to \u00a7 52-263, to establish in the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>sequence that: (1) it was a party to the underlying action; (2) it was aggrieved by the trial court decision; and (3) the appeal is from a final judgment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We today expressly adopt this bright-line test. We state this primarily for purposes of clarification, because we previously have considered each one of the three criteria to be an independent threshold requirement to be satisfied in order to establish jurisdiction for review by way of appeal pursuant to \u00a7 52-263. See, e.g., <em>Bergeron </em>v. <em>Mackler, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 391-92 n.1 (\u201c[b]ecause they were not parties to the marital dissolution proceedings, [the plaintiffs in error] could not have had the claim reviewed by way of an appeal\u201d); <em>Milford </em>v. <em>Local 1566, </em>200 Conn. 91, 96, 510 A.2d 17 (1986) (\u201crequisite element of appealability is that the party claiming error be \u2018aggrieved\u2019 by the decision of the trial court\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 30 (\u201cthreshold question [is] whether the appeal is taken from a final judgment\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>A bright-line test will aid litigants, who wish to challenge trial court orders through the appellate process, to determine the proper procedural method for such a challenge \u2014 an appeal, or a writ of error. The clarity yielded by a bright-line test, moreover, is helpful because the procedural decision ordinarily must be made in a very short time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The bondsman contends that we should not adopt this bright-line test, arguing, first, that the present method of analysis is satisfactory, and second, that if it is to be adopted, the question of final judgment should be addressed first among the three requirements. We are not convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The bondsman\u2019s argument that the present method of analysis is satisfactory without the adoption of a bright-line test is unpersuasive because it rests on the incorrect assumption that, under the present system, a nonparty to the underlying action should and would have a right to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 52-263 in limited circumstances.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because we have established that the proper interpretation of the term \u201cparty\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 52-263 includes only parties to the underlying action, this argument fails. The bondsman also contends that the final judgment criteria must be addressed first among the three criteria because interlocutory orders are not normally appealable final judgments and, therefore, only when the appealability as a final judgment is established should the court proceed to evaluate the other criteria. This argument also is without merit. Because each criteria must be met independently, there is no reason why the final judgment criteria should not be addressed subsequent to a determination of party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>status and aggrievement. Moreover, as a practical matter, in applying the bright-line test in a particular case, if we were to determine that review pursuant to \u00a7 52-263 would not be available because of a failure to satisfy the final judgment criteria, it would be appropriate for us simply to assume without deciding that the first two criteria had been established, and go on to determine the jurisdictional issue on final judgment grounds. As a result, the bondsman\u2019s argument in this regard is of no moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Lastly, we address the question of whether the adoption of the bright-line test for establishing jurisdiction should be prospective only in its application.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The bondsman contends that the test should be applied prospectively because to do otherwise would be unfair to it and others that are similarly situated. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\u201cWe start our analysis with the observation that [t]he courts of the states are free to determine the extent to which new decisions are to have retrospective effect.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Neyland </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>195 Conn. 174, 179, 487 A.2d 181 (1985). We previously have reviewed the analytical framework adopted by the federal courts for determining the propriety of a retroactive or prospective application of a particular decision. In <em>Neyland </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 179, we noted the United States Supreme Court\u2019s construction of a three factor test to determine whether a particular judicial decision should be applied prospectively, which was established in <em>Chevron Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97, 106-107, 92 S.

Ct. 669, 66 L.

While the United State\u2019s Supreme Court\u2019s decision to limit prospectively the holding in <em>Northern Pipeline Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Marathon Pipe Line Co., </em>458 U.S. 50, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1982), casts some doubt on the rule of automatic retroactivity expressed in <em>[Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.], </em>several courts have found the reasoning of <em>[Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.] </em>persuasive.

We concluded that \u201c[w]hile we need not go so far as to hold that jurisdictional rulings of this court may never be applied nonretroactively, we do hold the <em>[Chevron Oil Co.] </em>test inapplicable to jurisdiction issues and find no exceptional circumstances or overriding needs of public policy similar to those present in <em>Northern Pipeline Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Marathon Pipe Line Co., </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>[458 U.S. 50], to merit a conclusion of nonretroactivity.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accord <em>Hodge </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>178 Conn. 308, 320-23, 422 A.2d 280 (1979).\u201d <em>Neyland </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 182-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In the present case, our decision concerns the application of a subject matter jurisdictional statute.

(2) sustain that interest throughout the course of the appeal . . . and (3) be able to obtain some practical benefit or relief. . . . <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>174 Conn. 8, 9-10, 381 A.2d 531 (1977). In short, aparty is a litigant with a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 223, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Applying this rule to the facts of <em>Day, </em>we held that a law firm representing a plaintiff in a worker\u2019s compensation case was \u201ca de facto party\u201d for purposes of appealing from a reduction of its fee, even though it had been neither the plaintiff nor the defendant in the underlying action. <em>Day </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>supra, 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">According to the majority in the present case, \u201c[t]his court concluded [in <em>Day] </em>that the law firm was [a] . . . defacto party . . . because,/or <em>purposes of [the] statute [at issue in Day], </em>\u2018[i]n short, a party is a litigant with a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.\u2019 <em>[Day </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>supra], 440.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The majority emphasizes that the law firm in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number><em>Day </em>asserted an appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301b, whereas the appellant in the present case wishes to assert an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 52-263. This is a distinction without a difference, for the following reason: the general rule that we set forth in <em>Day </em>is not limited to the context of \u00a7 31-301b. In fact, the language that the majority quotes from <em>Day </em>is itself a quotation from <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 223, a case that <em>did not involve an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 </em>31-301b.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The majority attempts to rationalize its effort to distinguish <em>Day </em>on the ground that the statute at issue in <em>Day </em>refers to <em>\u201cany </em>party,\u201d whereas the statute at issue in the present case refers to <em>\u201ceither </em>party.\u201d The majority\u2019s argument proceeds as follows: \u201c \u2018either\u2019 is defined as \u2018each of two; or the other of two alternatives. \u2019 [Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990)]. The use of the word \u2018either\u2019 . . . implies a narrower universe of possible appellants than where the term \u2018any\u2019 is used; \u2018either party\u2019 being limited to those persons or entities that are on one of two sides of a matter before the court, that is, the side of the plaintiff or of the defendant.\u201d The only flaw with this argument is that the same lexicon upon which the majority relies states with unmistakable clarity that the word \u201ceither\u201d is \u201c[o]ften used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>. . . with reference to more than two, <em>in which case it may mean . . . \u2018any\u2019 </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The majority also cites Black\u2019s Law Dictionary for the proposition that the \u201ctechnical legal meaning\u201d of the term \u201cparty\u201d is \u201cthose by or against whom a legal suit is brought . . . the party plaintiff or defendant . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The majority correctly observes that this definition is cited in, inter alia, <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 225-26. What the majority neglects to mention, however, is that <em>Rose </em>also contains the following passage: \u201cWhile \u2018party\u2019 has an ordinary, technical usage ... it has a \u2018commonly approved usage\u2019 as well. . . . Where a word in a statute has more than one possible meaning, and one meaning might lead to practical difficulties or constitutional infirmities, we should consider whether the legislature intended to adopt the other meaning. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary [also] defines \u2018party\u2019 as \u2018[a] person concerned or having or taking part in any affair, matter, transaction or proceeding, considered individually\u2019 and further notes that \"\u2019party\u201d is not restricted to strict meaning of plaintiff or defendant in a lawsuit.\u2019 Interpreting \u2018party\u2019 in this broad manner avoids any possible encroachment on the due process rights of persons who, although not technically \u2018parties\u2019 to the underlying [actions], are nevertheless aggrieved . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Finally, I wish to emphasize the majority\u2019s determination that the appellant is entitled to assert an appeal by way of a writ of error. See footnote 20 of the majority opinion. In my view, it would have been exceedingly unfair (and probably unconstitutional) to change our law as the majority has done today, then preclude the appellant from asserting an appeal that it would have been entitled to assert under the law as it existed at the time that it was aggrieved. For this reason, I join <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>this aspect of the majority opinion, notwithstanding my belief that the appellant is entitled to assert an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 52-263.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Accordingly, I dissent in part and concur in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-8\"> Attributed to Mark Twain in <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Commission </em>v. <em>Chemey Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 214, 67 S.
