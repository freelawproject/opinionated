App. 678, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>679-80, 707 A.2d 324 (1998). The Appellate Court concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion in striking the testimony because the expert witness possessed a special knowledge of the drug not common to the average person, and his testimony would have assisted the jury in considering the issue of intoxication. Id., 684. Nevertheless, the Appellate Court concluded that the error was harmless because, even if the jury had believed the evidence of intoxication and had concluded that the defendant was so intoxicated that he could not form the specific intent to cause serious bodily harm pursuant to \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1), the jury would have returned the same verdict of guilty of manslaughter in the first degree. Id., 686.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court determined that the only distinction would be that the jury would have returned a verdict of guilty mder subdivision (3) of \u00a7 53a-55 (a) instead of subdivision (l).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">We conclude that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the trial court had abused its discretion in striking the testimony of the defendant\u2019s expert witness regarding the substance known as illy and its effects.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court upholding the defendant\u2019s conviction, although we do so on different gromds.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The Appellate Court determined that the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. \u201cOn September 3, 1994, the defendant spent the evening drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana and illy. The next day, the defendant went to a cookout hosted by friends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>where he and two friends smoked \u2018blunts.\u2019<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Later in the day, the defendant met his friend Andre Cinicola, who had a .40 caliber semiautomatic pistol in a shoulder holster. The defendant put on the holster and weapon and covered them with a leather jacket. Id., 680. The defendant decided to go to Congress Avenue in New Haven to purchase marijuana. The defendant drove a Mazda Miata and Cinicola rode in the passenger seat. While on Congress Avenue, the defendant and Cinicola were told \u201cthat members of a gang known as the Stickup Boys were nearby driving in a blue Mustang. The Stickup Boys were a gang that had recently engaged in a shooting and robbing spree in the inner city neighborhoods and housing projects in the New Haven area.\u201d Id. The defendant and Cinicola drove off in search of the blue Mustang.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Minutes later, the defendant came upon a blue Mustang with tinted windows, and a high speed chase ensued. \u201cThe defendant positioned the Miata alongside the driver\u2019s side window of the Mustang. Cinicola took the pistol from the defendant and fired [a total of] four shots at the Mustang. . . . One of the bullets struck the driver in the head, either killing or incapacitating him instantly and causing him to lose control of the car. The Mustang crashed into a nearby office building. The defendant also lost control of the Miata, which [then crashed into] a utility pole located seventy feet from the Mustang. The last portion of the chase and shootout was observed by three New Haven police officers who were [stationed] near the location of the car crashes.\u201d Id., 680-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The police officers found Cinicola on the sidewalk next to the Miata and the defendant trapped in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>driver\u2019s seat. Two passengers in the backseat of the Mustang had minor injuries. The driver of the Mustang, George Goforth, had been killed by a single gunshot wound to the head. The front seat passenger, Roshwanda Crenshaw, was killed by a single gunshot wound to the chest. Ballistic testing confirmed that the bullet that killed Crenshaw was fired from Cinicola\u2019s gun. The bullet that killed Goforth passed through his skull and was never recovered. Id., 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u201cThe murder weapon was recovered near the Miata and tests revealed Cinicola\u2019s left index fingerprint [on it]. ... No weapon was found in the Mustang, and evidence later revealed that the defendant knew all four occupants and was a close friend of the two who were killed and that none of them was connected to the Stickup Boys. The tinted windows of the Mustang had prevented the defendant and Cinicola from identifying the occupants of the Mustang.\u201d Id., 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">At trial, the defendant sought to introduce the expert testimony of Jeremy August, a psychiatrist, who was to testify regarding the behavioral effects caused by the use of the drug illy. Although August did testify regarding the behavioral effects of the components of illy \u2014 namely, methanol, phencyclidine (PCP), and formaldehyde \u2014 he stated that he could not testify as to the effects of these components in combination. August testified that illy was a nonuniform mixture of a variety of chemical substances, and that he had no knowledge as to the mixture ratio of the elements in the substance allegedly ingested by the defendant. He stated that \u201c[i]lly is not like a prescription drug so . . . the clinical presentation depends on how much each of the individual ingredients you have and the extent to which you\u2019ve been taking the substance.\u201d He also testified that he had neither examined the defendant nor reviewed his medical records, and that he could not testify as to the behavioral effects, if any, experienced by the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>at the time that the crimes were committed. Indeed, August offered to review the defendant\u2019s medical records in order to \u201cmake a guess as to what was actually in the concoction that he [was] presented with.\u201d Defense counsel rejected this offer. Consequently, the trial court ordered that August\u2019s entire testimony be stricken as irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">The defendant presented ample evidence of his drug use and the effects therefrom through his own testimony and that of his companions, Terrence Williams, Judale Wynkoop and Joseph Threatt.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Williams and Wynkoop testified that they had ingested illy with the defendant during the evening hours preceding the shootings. Furthermore, the defendant testified that he had been a chronic user of illy for \u201cfour or five years.\u201d He also testified as to the behavioral changes he has experienced as a result of smoking illy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the testimony of his expert witness. Specifically, the defendant claims that the exclusion of August\u2019s testimony improperly precluded him from presenting the defense of intoxication. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>As a threshold matter, we set forth the standard by which we review the trial court\u2019s determinations concerning the exclusion of evidence. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>241 Conn. 784, 789, 699 A.2d 91 (1997). \u201cMoreover, evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>249 Conn. 218, 230, 733 A.2d 156 (1999). Our review of such rulings is limited to the questions of whether the trial court correctly applied the law and reasonably could have reached the conclusion that it did. <em>Timm </em>v. <em>Timm, </em>195 Conn. 202, 210, 487 A.2d 191 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Concerning expert testimony specifically, we note that \u201cthe trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony and, unless that discretion has been abused or the ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, the trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>225 Conn. 650, 654, 626 A.2d 287 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>199 Conn. 473, 476, 507 A.2d 1387 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>196 Conn. 157, 166, 491 A.2d 1075 (1985); <em>Siladi </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>164 Conn. 510, 513, 325 A.2d 277 (1973); <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Laskau, </em>89 Conn. 325, 330, 94 A. 370 (1915).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>235 Conn. 802, 834, 670 A.2d 301 (1996). \u201cExpert testimony should be admitted when: (1) the witness has a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue, (2) that skill or knowledge is not common to the average person, and (3) the testimony would be helpful to the court or jury in considering the issues.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>241 Conn. 322, 354, 696 A.2d 944 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Our analysis is supported by a review of the well established rules of evidence. \u201cRelevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. . . . One fact is relevant to another if in the common course of events the existence of one, alone or with other facts, renders the existence of the other either more certain or more probable. . . . Evidence is irrelevant or too remote if there is such a want of open and visible connection between the evidentiary and principal facts that, all things considered, the former is not worthy or safe to be admitted in the proof of the latter. . . . Evidence is not rendered inadmissible because it is not conclusive. All that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree, so long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 788-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">We conclude that the trial court was within its discretion in determining that August\u2019s testimony regarding the behavioral effects of using illy did not satisfy the test articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 354. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to present a defense do not give him the right to have admitted any evidence he chooses.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Negron, </em>221 Conn. 315, 328, 603 A.2d 1138 (1992). In the present case, the expert\u2019s testimony was not based upon an examination of the defendant himself or a review of his pertinent medical records, nor was it premised upon an examination of the substance allegedly ingested by the defendant. Additionally, the testimony was not based upon an analysis of the behavioral effects of illy in general. Instead, August\u2019s testimony was limited to the behavioral effects of methanol, PCP and formaldehyde, separate substances which, as August admitted, might have very different effects when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>combined. Thus, the trial court reasonably determined that August\u2019s testimony was irrelevant as to both the defendant\u2019s condition immediately following the incident and the general effects of illy. Consequently, August\u2019s proposed testimony did not offer any expertise directly applicable to a matter at issue in the present case. His testimony, therefore, would not be helpful to the jury in reaching its verdict. Thus, the trial court correctly excluded his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">After a careful review of the record we conclude that, despite his claim to the contrary, the defendant was not precluded from presenting evidence of his defense of intoxication. He was permitted to pursue his defense of intoxication by means of his own testimony aud that of his other witnesses. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the testimony of August and, therefore, we uphold the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C. J., and BORDEN and MCDONALD, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-4\"> The specific questions certified in this appeal are: \u201c1.

The trial court in the present case refused to permit the jurors to consider expert testimony that was necessary in order to enable them to evaluate the sole defense that the defendant had raised. In my view, this ruling constituted an abuse of discretion for two reasons: (1) it contradicted a recent opinion rendered by this court and (2) it violated the defendant\u2019s fundamental right under the federal constitution to present a defense. I would reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">In the present case, the defendant, Maurice Billie, was charged with committing a number of serious crimes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His sole defense was that he had been unable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>to form the requisite mens rea because he was, at all relevant times, under the influence of a substance known as \u201cilly,\u201d which is a mixture of phencyclidine (PCP), wood alcohol, methanol and formaldehyde. In order to establish this defense, the defendant wished to rely upon the expert testimony of Jeremy August, a psychiatrist. August would have testified to the behavioral effects of each of the constituent ingredients of illy. He also would have testified that it was not possible to assess the precise effect of illy upon the defendant, for the simple reason that it was not possible to determine the precise ratio among the various ingredients contained in the particular mixture of illy that the defendant had ingested. The trial court excluded all of August\u2019s testimony on the ground that it was irrelevant. I agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that this ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Billie, </em>47 Conn. App. 678, 684, 707 A.2d 324 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u201cExpert testimony should be admitted when: (1) the witness has a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue, (2) that skill or knowledge is not common to the average person, and (3) the testimony would be helpful to the court or jury in considering the issues. . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>241 Conn. 322, 353-54, 696 A.2d 944 (1997). As the Appellate Court cogently explained, the psychiatric expert in the present case \u201cpossessed a special knowledge of illy, not common to the average person,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and his testimony would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>aided the jury in considering the issue of intoxication. The relevant issue was whether the defendant was under the influence of illy and whether the intoxication affected his capacity to form a specific intent. Testimony concerning the composition of illy and its effect would have aided the jury in considering those issues.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Billie, </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The mantra of the majority opinion is that \u201cthe trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) This is true. Nevertheless, \u201c[discretion means a legal discretion, to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice. In a plain case, this discretion has no office to perform, and its exercise is limited to doubtful cases, where an impartial mind hesitates. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Onofrio, </em>179 Conn. 23, 29, 425 A.2d 560 (1979). Discretion does not mean, as the majority seems to believe, an untrammeled right to do as the trial court wishes. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brien, </em>59 F.3d 274, 277 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 953, 116 S. Ct. 401, 133 L. Ed. 2d 320 (1995) (trial court\u2019s discretion is not carte blanche); <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapple, </em>[135 Ariz. 281, 296, 660 P.2d 1208 (1983)] (discretion does not mean that the court is free to reach any conclusion it wishes). If discretion were as unbridled as the majority seems to believe, a criminal defendant would be playing Russian roulette whenever his case was assigned to a judge: justice would depend upon which chambers he happened to draw. This is not justice. Rather, a trial court\u2019s discretion must be based upon a reasoned consideration of the unique circumstances of each particular case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McClendon, </em>248 Conn. 572, 609-10, 730 A.2d 1107 (1999) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting). With this analytic framework in mind, I am unable to comprehend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>the majority\u2019s determination that the trial court in the present case did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Just a few years ago, a unanimous panel of this court \u2014 which included the author of the majority opinion in the present case \u2014 held that the trial court had abused its discretion by \u201cexcludfing] the testimony of a defense expert regarding the adverse effects of cocaine on the cognitive abilities of a person who ingests the drug . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Barletta, </em>238 Conn. 313, 316, 680 A.2d 1284 (1996). The result that my colleagues in the majority have reached in the present case cannot be reconciled with <em>Barletta. </em>In fact, the trial court\u2019s ruling in the present case is more egregious than the ruling that the <em>Barletta </em>court found to be an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">To begin with, the expert testimony in <em>Barletta </em>was highly speculative.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the present case, the only uncertainty pertained to the ratio among the ingredients contained in the mixture of illy that the defendant had ingested. It is apparent that August could have informed the jury about the following two matters: (1) the behavioral effects of the individual drugs that compose illy; and (2) the range of possible reactions to differing batches of illy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Significantly, the <em>Barletta </em>court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>untroubled by the state\u2019s argument that \u201ccocaine affects people differently, [and the expert] could not testify with specificity how [the eyewitness\u2019] cognitive abilities were likely to have been impaired . . . Id., 319. If that argument did not suffice to insulate the trial court\u2019s ruling in <em>Barletta, </em>it cannot do so in the present case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Moreover, <em>Barletta </em>involved expert psychiatric testimony that was offered in order to impeach the credibility of a <em>witness </em>to a crime. Id., 318. In the present case, August would have testified to the <em>defendant\u2019s </em>state of mind. If the jurors had been permitted to consider August\u2019s testimony, they well may have reached the following conclusions: (1) the defendant did not possess the requisite mens rea; (2) the state had failed to establish a necessary element; and (3) the state had failed to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Finally, the majority today has disregarded the defendant\u2019s fundamental right under the sixth amendment to the federal constitution to present a defense. \u201cIn order to comport with the constitutional standards embodied in the confrontation clause, the trial court must allow a defendant to expose to the jury facts from which [the] jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness. <em>Davis </em>v. Alaska, [415 U.S. 308, 318, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L.

Thus, [w]hen defense evidence is excluded, such exclusion may give rise to a claim of denial of the right to present a defense. <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>[410 U.S. 284, 289-90, 93 S.

In the present case, the defendant\u2019s sole defense was that he was unable to form the requisite mens rea. By excluding the testimony of the psychiatric expert witness, the court deprived the defendant of the only credible means by which he could explain this defense to the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Without the benefit of this testimony, the jury was unable to evaluate the case mounted by the defense in an informed manner.

Because August knew about the behavioral effects of the drugs that compose illy and the jury probably did not, this latter question must be answered in the affirmative. \u201cA party is not required to offer such proof of a fact that it excludes all other hypotheses; it is sufficient if the evidence tends to make the existence or nonexistence of any oilier fact more probable or less probable than it would be without such evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>[179 Conn. 328, 333, 426 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>298 (1979), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 912,100 S.
