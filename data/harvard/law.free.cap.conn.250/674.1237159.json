Specifically, we must determine whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the petitioner, the commissioner of children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>and families (commissioner), was required to establish by clear and convincing evidence that reasonable efforts were made to reunify Ann F. with Eden and Joann as a predicate to the termination of Ann F.\u2019s parental rights with respect to her two children. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>conclude that, contrary to the determination of the Appellate Court, the commissioner was not required to make such a showing under the applicable statutory provisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We also address two additional claims that Ann F. raised in the Appellate Court but that were not decided by that court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> namely, that the trial court improperly: (1) found that Ann F. had failed to rehabilitate herself; and (2) concluded that the termination of Ann F.\u2019s parental rights was in Eden\u2019s best interest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We reject these claims and reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The opinion of the Appellate Court; <em>In re Eden F., </em>48 Conn. App. 290, 710 A.2d 771 (1998); sets forth the following relevant facts. \u201cAnn F. was born in Hartford on February 27, 1959 . . . [and] spent the majority of her childhood in a foster home. In 1975, at the age of fifteen,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ann F. was admitted for psychiatric care to Norwich State Hospital (Norwich). Thereafter, she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>admitted to Norwich on several more occasions with one stay lasting for more than one year.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At Norwich, she was diagnosed with chronic undifferentiated schizophrenia and other disorders over the years including bipolar disorder with psychotic features.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">\u201cWhile at Norwich, Ann F. met and married Thomas F.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in 1982 and her first child, Eden, was born on July 2,1988. Eden is a child with special needs. [The department of children and youth services, now the department of children and families (department)]<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> removed Eden from Ann F.\u2019s care when Eden was only five days old, due to Ann F.\u2019s psychiatric state. The court granted temporary custody of Eden to [the department] on July 15, 1988. On September 22, 1989, Eden was committed to the commissioner ... as a neglected child because of the hospital admission of Ann F. On that date, Ann F. signed expectations<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that were accepted by the court. Eden remained in foster care until she was nearly three years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">\u201cAlthough on January 31,1991, the court granted [the department\u2019s] petition to extend Eden\u2019s commitment, Eden began living with [Ann F.] on February 1, 1991. While Eden lived with [Ann F., the department] worked with Ann F. and provided a number of services to her. On June 13, 1991, the [department] filed a petition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>revoke Eden\u2019s commitment. The court granted [the department\u2019s] motion to revoke commitment on August 7, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">\u201cIn 1992, [the department] received four referrals concerning Ann F.\u2019s conduct with Eden, including a report of Ann F.\u2019s yelling, shaking and hitting Eden. Another referral, which was made just prior to the birth of Ann F.\u2019s second child, Joann, on September 8, 1992, was from the Manchester police department on July 16, 1992, alleging that . . Ann F. ... is a repeated complainant of sexual assault and strange goings on at the home. She claims that Randy M., the [alleged] father of . . . [Joann], sneaks in through the window at about 1:30 a.m. and sexually assaults [her].\u2019 That report also stated that she usually slept through it. It also indicated that \u2018[t]he condition of the apartment is very slovenly with trash and clutter strewn about. The smoke detector was also deactivated due to the removal of the battery.\u2019 In a call to [the department], Ann F. reported that her boyfriend, Randy M., would break into her apartment with seven men who sexually harassed her and performed witchcraft techniques on her.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">\u201cIn March, 1993, [the department] received a referral from the Manchester Memorial Hospital emergency room that Ann F. had walked out of the visitor\u2019s lounge leaving Eden, then age four, to care for Joann, then seven months old. At that time, Ann F. was admitted to [that] hospital on a physician\u2019s emergency certificate,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and [the department] invoked a ninety-six hour hold on both children, who have been cared for in the same foster home ever since. Ann F. was transferred from Manchester Memorial Hospital to Cedarcrest Regional Hospital (Cedarcrest), where she remained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>until August, 1993. Upon her discharge from Cedarcrest, she began receiving services from the Manchester Memorial Hospital Outpatient Mental Health Clinic [(clinic)] and the Horizons program [(Horizons)]. Horizons provides services to the psychologically impaired so they can live independently in the community. Her case manager, Candace Stone, worked with Ann F. up [until] the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">\u201cOn March 12, 1993, [the department] filed a petition seeking the commitment of Eden and Joann. On that date, the court granted an order of temporary custody of both children to [the department]. On October 21, 1993, the court adjudicated Eden and Joann neglected based on Ann F.\u2019s plea of nolo contendere. The court committed the children to the department for the statutory period. Also on that date, Ann F. signed, and the court entered, a new set of expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">\u201cAnn F. was hospitalized three times in 1993 for mental instability. Eden and Joann were taken for weekly visits with Ann F. while she was in Cedarcrest in 1993. Weekly visitation continued after she returned home. Ann F. continued outpatient treatment at [the clinic]. Throughout the remainder of 1993 and into the first six months of 1994, Ann F. stabilized within her limitations and participated in weekly supervised visits with her two children.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">\u201cOn June 1, 1994, the department developed what it called \u2018an extensive plan ... to determine what was in the best interest of [Ann F.\u2019s] children.\u2019 This plan was to give [Ann F.] every opportunity to prove her parenting abilities and was to be executed through \u2018the Exchange Club,\u2019 which would supervise the children\u2019s visits with Ann F. The length of these visits would be increased from one hour to one and one-half hours for seven weeks. If these visits were successful, a series of unsupervised visits could be scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>\u201cAt a department case status conference on July 26, 1994, the consensus opinion was that due to Eden\u2019s escalating behaviors she should be thoroughly evaluated by [the] Newington Children\u2019s Hospital PEDAL<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> medical program, which evaluation began at the end of August, 1994. On September 4, 1994, in accordance with the Exchange Club recommendation, four weeks of unsupervised visitation began but there was no mechanism to assess these visits since they were unsupervised. On October 8, 1994, four weeks of overnight visitation began, with an emergency telephone line available if Ann F. needed assistance or had an emergency. These visits again could not be assessed since they were unsupervised. In any event, the children did not show any evidence of physical abuse. In late October, 1994, a decision was made to return Eden to Ann F. on a trial basis for two months to make a final determination of Aim F.\u2019s capabilities of caring for [Eden]. The department\u2019s position was: \u2018If this two month trial was successful then strong consideration would be given to returning the youngest child, Joann, home.\u2019 In November, 1994, it was decided to put on hold Eden\u2019s return home to Ann F. until Ann F. obtained her own apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">\u201cEden was returned to Ann F. on February 27, 1995. Difficulties with the reunification quickly appeared. At the time of Eden\u2019s return, PEDAL was in the midst of conducting a comprehensive evaluation of Eden as requested by the department. As part of this evaluation, Eden was seen for the following: pediatric neurology, psychiatry, ophthalmology, audiology, psychology, education and occupational therapy. The testing for this evaluation occurred from December, 1994, through April, 1995. The results of the PEDAL evaluation were not disclosed until after April 19, 1995. The evaluation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>indicated that Eden \u2018is diagnosed with Reaction Attachment Disorder compounded by symptoms of depression, behavioral disturbance, including oppositionality and defiance.\u2019 The evaluation made a number of suggestions on how to address Eden\u2019s needs given her substantial behavioral and emotional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">\u201cUpon Eden\u2019s return to [Ann F.[, Eden did not attend school for almost three weeks. The department was aware, <em>before </em>Eden was returned to [Ann F.], that there was a problem with the Manchester board of education in gaining her admission. Nevertheless, the department returned her.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">\u201cAdditionally, Eden\u2019s parent-child therapy with Thomas Spudic, a psychologist who worked with Ann F. and the children, ceased in December, 1994, when he left Connecticut. Therapy was not resumed until sometime in March, 1995, after Eden was returned to Ann F. Moreover, even though the department made arrangements for a parent aide,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> who came once within the first week or so of Eden\u2019s return, neither the new therapist nor the parent aide was in place when Eden was returned.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">\u201cA crisis telephone line was put in place when Eden was returned to Ann F. The crisis line, aptly named, had as its apparent purpose to enable rapid communication by Ann F. with department staff. On Sunday, March 12, 1995, Ann F. called the crisis line and stated that she \u2018needed someone to talk to and Eden had been a little out of control.\u2019<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Apparently, Ann F. was required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>to leave this information in a message. Kenneth Crosby, a department social worker, returned Ann F.\u2019s call to the crisis line the following Friday, March 17, 1995, five days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">\u201cOn Tuesday, March 21, 1995, the department removed Eden from [Ann F.\u2019s] home and returned her to foster care. This removal followed an incident that occurred the prior weekend and also was reported to the department. Ann F., who had been caring for Eden without respite for twenty-four hours a day for about three weeks, went to a bingo game in the neighborhood with a female friend. Ann F. left Eden in the care of two men, one of whom Ann F. hardly knew, but who was acquainted with Ann F.\u2019s female friend. The child of Ann F.\u2019s female friend was also there. When Ann F. returned later that evening, there were beer cans strewn about her apartment, the sink was full of dishes, and Eden\u2019s bedroom was \u2018trashed.\u2019 There was no indication, however, that Eden had been harmed in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">\u201cThe day after the department removed Eden, it received a report of Eden scratching [Ann F.] as well as an anonymous caller who reported hearing Eden cry, \u2018[m]ommy, don\u2019t hit me.\u2019<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The department replaced Eden in her former foster home. Joann was not returned to Ann F. at all in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">\u201cOn April 6,1995, the parties agreed to, and the court granted, an extension of the [the children\u2019s] commitment to the department for the statutory period beginning April 21, 1995. On June 26, 1995, the department filed petitions in the Superior Court, Juvenile Matters, seeking to terminate the parental rights of Ann F., Randy M., the alleged father of Joann, and Thomas F., the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>father of Eden. Each petition alleged that \u2018[t]he child has been found in a prior proceeding to have been neglected or uncared for. . . . [Ann F.] has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child . . . she . . . could assume a responsible position in the life of the child.\u2019 This ground is alleged to have existed for more than one year. On July 20, 1995, the court accepted Thomas F.\u2019s affidavit of consent to his termination of parental rights as to Eden. The petition concerning Joann was thereafter amended to allege that Randy M. had abandoned Joann, that he failed to rehabilitate and that there was no ongoing parent-child relationship as provided in \u00a7 17a-112 (b). On July 24, 25, 26, 29 and 30, 1996, a trial was held on both petitions.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 291-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Following the trial, the court, citing \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (2), \u201cfound by clear and convincing evidence that the parents have not achieved a useful and constructive role as parents; nor, given the needs of the children, especially Eden, [was] such rehabilitation foreseeable within a reasonable time. . . . [Upon consideration of each of the seven factors enumerated under \u00a7 17a-112 (d), the trial court] then proceeded in the dispositional phase to find [by clear and convincing evidence] that the termination of parental rights was in the best interests of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\u201cBy motion dated August 23, 1996, Ann F. requested reargument. That motion alleged, inter alia, that the [commissioner] . . . failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that [the department had] made reasonable efforts to reunify either child with [Ann F.].</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">\u201cThe trial court denied the motion in a written memorandum, pointing out that a review of the file reflects that reasonable efforts at reunification were made on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>two occasions in 1993 and once again while the case was pending on April 6,1995. The court stated that \u2018the department . . . has made reasonable efforts given the situation and circumstances to provide counseling for Ann [F.], which she has continuously utilized. Efforts to reunite the child, Eden, with Ann [F.], were made in February, 1995. [Eden] was subsequently removed in March, 1995. Even [Ann F.] agreed that Eden was too difficult for her to control. . . . [Ann F.] simply does not have the intellectual or emotional wherewithal to raise these two children.\u2019 Moreover, the trial court noted that its written decision specifically addressed this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">\u201cIn addition, Ann F. also filed a \u2018Motion for Articulation of Decision Terminating Parental Rights of Mother. \u2019 The trial court, in articulating its decision, stated, inter alia, that it responded to each of the five specific questions raised [in Ann F.\u2019s motion] including the finding that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify both Eden and Joann with [Ann F.]. The court concluded that those findings were supported by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 303-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">On appeal, the Appellate Court concluded that, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112, the trial court was required to find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunite Eden and Joann with Ann F. See id., 310-11. The Appellate Court further concluded that the facts did not support such a finding with respect to either child. Id., 317. Consequently, the Appellate Court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment terminating Ann F.\u2019s parental rights with respect to Eden and Joann and remanded the case to the trial court for dismissal of both petitions. Id., 323. On the commissioner\u2019s appeal to this court, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">We first must decide whether the Appellate Court properly determined that the commissioner was required to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that reasonable efforts were made to reunify Ann F. with her children. The commissioner claims that she was not required to establish that the department had made reasonable reunification efforts because, contrary to the conclusion of the Appellate Court, \u00a7 17a-112 contained no such mandate at the time the petitions were filed in this case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Ann F. claims that the Appellate Court properly determined that the commissioner was required to prove reasonable reunification efforts by clear and convincing evidence. Alternatively, Ann F. contends that, even if the commissioner was not required to show that reasonable efforts were made to reunite her with Eden and Joann, the 1995 amendment to \u00a7 17a-112; Public Acts 1995, No. 95-238, \u00a7 3 (P.A. 95-238);<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> which expressly requires a court to find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>the department has made reasonable efforts to reunify parent and child, is retroactive and, therefore, applicable to the termination petitions filed in this case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We reject both of Ann F.\u2019s claims and conclude that the commissioner was not required to prove that reasonable efforts were made to reunify Ann F. with her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Under \u00a7 17a-112, a hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights consists of two phases: the adjudicatory phase and the dispositional phase. During the adjudicatory phase, the trial court must determine whether one or more of the four grounds for termination of parental rights set forth in \u00a7 17a-112 (b) exists by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cThe commissioner ... in petitioning to terminate those rights, must allege and prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>one or more of the statutory grounds. In contrast to custody proceedings, in which the best interests of the child are always the paramount consideration and in fact usually dictate the outcome, in termination proceedings the statutory criteria must be met before termination can be accomplished and adoption proceedings begun.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Luis C., </em>210 Conn. 157, 165, 554 A.2d 722 (1989). \u201cSection [17a-112 (b)] carefully sets out . . . [the] situations that, in the judgment of the legislature, constitute countervailing interests sufficiently powerful to justify the termination of parental rights in the absence of consent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Anna B., </em>50 Conn. App. 298, 303-304, 717 A.2d 289 (1998). One of the four predicates for the termination of parental rights under \u00a7 17a-112 (b) covers the situation in which, over an extended period of time, \u201cthe parent of a child who has been found by the superior court to have been neglected or uncared for in a prior proceeding has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">If the trial court determines that a statutory ground for termination exists, then it proceeds to the dispositional phase. During the dispositional phase, the trial court must determine whether termination is in the best interests of the child. When the petitions in this case were filed, \u00a7 17a-112 (d) required that the trial court, in determining whether to terminate parental rights, \u201cconsider and . . . make written findings regarding\u201d seven separate factors, including: \u201c(1) [t]he timeliness, nature and extent of services offered or provided to the parent and the child by an agency to facilitate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>reunion of the child with the parent; [and] (2) whether the department . . . has made reasonable efforts to reunite the family pursuant to the federal [Adoption Assistance and] Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The question of whether the commissioner was required to prove that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify Ann F. with Eden and Joann under the applicable statutory scheme \u201cis a matter of statutory interpretation, which is a matter of law, requiring plenary review. ... In interpreting statutes, our analysis is guided by well established principles of statutory construction. [O]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lopiano </em>v. <em>Lopiano, </em>247 Conn. 356, 363, 752 A.2d 1000 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">At the time that the petitions were filed in this case, \u00a7 17a-112 did not contain any language to suggest that the court could terminate parental rights only upon a finding, by a standard of clear and convincing evidence or otherwise, that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify parent and child. Rather, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (b), the trial court was authorized to terminate parental rights upon a showing, by clear and convincing evidence, first, that one or more of the four scenarios set forth in \u00a7 17a-112 (b) had been proven, and second, that the termination of parental rights was in the best interest of the child. Although \u00a7 17a-112 (d) (1) and (2) mandated that the trial court make written findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>regarding the timeliness, nature, extent and reasonableness of the efforts made to reunify parent and child, \u00a7 17a-112 contained nothing to indicate that any such finding was a prerequisite to the termination of parental rights. Thus, when the petitions in this case were filed, the factors to be considered under \u00a7 17a-112 (d) served only to guide the trial court in making its ultimate decision whether to grant the termination petition. See, e.g., <em>In re Christine F., </em>6 Conn. App. 360, 369, 505 A.2d 734, cert. denied, 199 Conn. 808, 809, 508 A.2d 769, 770 (1986) (termination in best interest of child despite trial court\u2019s conclusion that strong emotional ties existed between mother and child). Thus, \u201cthe fact that the legislature [had interpolated] objective guidelines into the open-ended fact-oriented statutes which govern [parental termination] disputes; <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>180 Conn. 705, 710, 433 A.2d 1005 (1980); should not be construed as a predetermined weighing of evidence; <em>Yontef v. Yontef, </em>185 Conn. 275, 282, 440 A.2d 899 (1981); by the legislature. Where . . . the record reveals that the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusions [regarding termination of parental rights] are supported by clear and convincing evidence, we will not reach an opposite conclusion on the basis of any one segment of the many factors considered in a termination proceeding . ... <em>In re Theresa S., </em>[196 Conn. 18, 25, 491 A.2d 355 (1985)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Christine F., </em>supra, 369-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The Appellate Court did not expressly articulate its rationale for concluding that the trial court was required to find, as a predicate to the termination of Ann F.\u2019s parental rights, that the commissioner established, clearly and convincingly, that reasonable efforts were made to reunify Ann F. with Eden and Joann. Ann F. claims, however, that the Appellate Court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 17a-112 is supported by our state\u2019s public policy, as expressed by the legislature, \u201cto strengthen the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>family and to make the home safe for children by enhancing the parental capacity for good child care . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101 (a).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A general statement of public policy underscoring the desirability of maintaining the integrity of the family unit, however, cannot trump the plain and unambiguous language of the statutory provision detailing with specificity the substantive rights of the parties to a termination proceeding. Under \u00a7 17a-112 (b), the court is authorized to terminate parental rights only in four limited circumstances and, moreover, the court is required to make written findings regarding the seven separate factors set forth in \u00a7 17a-112 (d), including \u201c[t]he timeliness, nature and extent of services offered or provided to the parent and the child by an agency to facilitate the reunion of the child with the parent\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (d) (1); and \u201cwhether the department . . . has made reasonable efforts to reunite the family pursuant to the federal [Adoption Assistance and] Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (d) (2). Thus, our interpretation of \u00a7 17a-112 as not requiring the commissioner to prove reasonable efforts at reunification does not contravene the public policy declared by the legislature in \u00a7 17a-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Ann F. also contends that the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (act); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 670 et seq.;<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> provides support for her contention that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>under \u00a7 17a-112, her parental rights could not be terminated absent a showing, by clear and convincing evidence, that the department had made reasonable efforts at reunification. As the Appellate Court has stated, however, \u201c[t]he act ... is an appropriations act and does not apply to individual actions or judicial findings . . . but merely sets forth general guidelines for a state\u2019s continued eligibility to receive funds for foster care maintenance.\u201d <em>In re Cynthia A., </em>8 Conn. App. 656, 664, 514 A.2d 360 (1986). The act, therefore, has no bearing on the question of whether, under \u00a7 17a-112, the commissioner was required to establish, as a predicate to the termination of Ann F.\u2019s parental rights, that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunite Ann F. with Eden and Joann.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Finally, Ann F. asserts that because principles of due process require proof of the facts that warrant a termination of parental rights by clear and convincing evidence; see footnote 19 of this opinion; we must construe \u00a7 17a-112 (b) as embodying the requirement that the commissioner establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunite Ann F. with her two children. We disagree. Proof of reasonable reunification efforts is not a constitutionally mandated prerequisite to granting a petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>for the termination of parental rights. The constitutional requirement of proof by clear and convincing evidence applies only to those findings upon which the ultimate decision to terminate parental rights is predicated.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Prior to the 1995 amendment of \u00a7 17a-112, the reasonableness of the department\u2019s efforts at reunification was not one of the factors that the legislature had incorporated in \u00a7 17a-112 (b) as aprerequisite to termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">If, prior to 1995, the legislature had intended to condition the termination of parental rights on a finding that reasonable efforts were made to reunify parent with child, it easily could have expressed this intent. See <em>State </em>v. Desimone, 241 Conn. 439, 455, 696 A.2d 1235 (1997). Indeed, the legislature manifested just such an intent when, in 1995, it amended \u00a7 17a-112 to add the requirement that Ann F. would have us read into the pre-1995 amendment version of the statute. No such legislative directive can be found in the language or history of \u00a7 17a-112 as it existed prior to its 1995 amendment. See id. (\u201c[ajbsent compelling countervailing reasons, we will not impute to the legislature an intent that is not apparent from the plain statutory language\u201d). Under that statutory provision, the trial court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>required to <em>consider </em>the efforts the department made to reunify Ann F. with Eden and Joann, and to <em>make written findings </em>regarding those efforts, and the trial court did so. For petitions filed before the effective date of the 1995 amendment, however, the commissioner was not required to establish the <em>reasonableness </em>of those efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Alternatively, Ann F. claims that P.A. 95-238, which amended \u00a7 17a-112 (b) by adding the requirement that the department make reasonable efforts to reunify parent and child, applies retroactively.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">\u201cWhether to apply a statute retroactively or prospectively depends upon the intent of the legislature in enacting the statute. ... In order to determine the legislative intent, we utilize well established rules of statutory construction. Our point of departure is General Statutes \u00a7 55-3, which states: No provision of the general statutes, not previously contained in the statutes of the state, which imposes any new obligation on any person or corporation, shall be construed to have retrospective effect. The obligations referred to in the statute are those of substantive law. . . . Thus, we have uniformly interpreted \u00a7 55-3 as a rule of <em>presumed </em>legislative intent that statutes affecting <em>substantive </em>rights shall apply prospectively only. . . . This presumption in favor of prospective applicability, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>may be rebutted when the legislature clearly and unequivocally expresses its intent that the legislation shall apply retrospectively. . . . Where an amendment is intended to clarify the original intent of an earlier statute, it necessarily has retroactive effect. . . . We generally look to the statutory language and the pertinent legislative history to ascertain whether the legislature intended that the amendment be given retrospective effect.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>245 Conn. 710, 718-19, 714 A.2d 1209 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Neither the language nor the history of P.A. 95-238 contains any indication that the legislature intended that it be applied retroactively. Ann F. contends, however, that the amendment is procedural, rather than substantive and, consequently, we must presume that the legislature intended its retroactive application. Ann F. also claims that the legislative debate on the 1995 amendment indicates that it was intended to clarify the original intent of the earlier statute and, therefore, should be applied retroactively for that reason. In support of her claims, Ann F. relies on several comments made by legislators during the debate on the bill in the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">We disagree with Ann F.\u2019s claims. First, the requirement that the department make reasonable efforts to reunite parent and child affects the substantive rights of the parties to a termination proceeding. The requirement of reunification efforts provides additional substantive protection for any parent who contests a termination action, and places a concomitant burden on the state to take appropriate measures designed to secure reunification of parent and child. Moreover, to the extent that the requirement reflects an important state policy favoring the reunification of parent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>child, as Ann F. herself has asserted, the express recognition of that policy in P.A. 95-238 cannot be considered procedural rather than substantive.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Furthermore, P.A. 95-238, which contains five separate sections, also made other substantive changes in the law.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> For example, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of P.A. 95-238 reduced the time period within which the parental rights with respect to certain children under the age of seven may be terminated. See, e.g., 38 S. Proc., Pt. 12, 1995 Sess., p. 4439, remarks of Senator Mark Nielsen (\u201c[t]he bill allows the court to terminate parental rights sooner than it would otherwise have the ability to do in certain cases involving children under the age of seven\u201d). We are especially reluctant to presume that the legislature intended the retroactive application of such provisions, for, as our Appellate Court has stated: \u201cAlthough the issue of whether parental rights should have been terminated is to be decided by a trial court on the basis of conditions existing at the time of trial . . . there is no legislative or decisional mandate allowing a trial court to decide that issue on the basis of statutes existing at the time of trial, but not in effect when the termination petition was filed. . . . <em>Parents have a constitutionally protected, right to raise and care for their children and that protection cannot be diluted by the use of statutory standards enacted subsequent to a petition to terminate that right, absent a counter legislative directive.\u201d </em>(Citation omitted; emphasis added.) <em>In re Migdalia M., </em>6 Conn. App. 194, 200, 504 A.2d 533, cert. denied, 199 Conn. 809, 508 A.2d 770 (1986). Ann F. has provided no evidence, in the legislative history or elsewhere, to suggest that the legislature intended to dilute retroactively a parent\u2019s rights under \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of P.A. 95-238.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Ann F.\u2019s reliance on certain comments by several legislators during the house debate on P.A. 95-238 also is misplaced. First, Ann F. notes Representative Richard D. Tulisano\u2019s statement that the bill \u201cchanges procedures.\u201d 38 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1995 Sess., p. 3736. Representative Tulisano, however, was not referring to the bill as a whole, but, rather, to a section, which was later withdrawn, regarding the creation of a child fatality review board. Ann F. also refers to a statement by Representative Scott Santa Maria, who indicated that the legislation \u201cwill make the legal process easier and easier for the [department] to act.\u201d Id., p. 3749. We discern nothing in Representative Santa Maria\u2019s comment to reflect the view that the amendment was intended to be retroactive. Finally, Ann F. points to a statement by Representative John W. Thompson describing a Senate amendment to the bill as \u201cclarify [-ing] [our] statutes concerning reunification efforts.\u201d 38 H.R. Proc., Pt. 17, 1995 Sess., p. 6126. Immediately thereafter, however, Representative Thompson yielded to Representative Tulisano \u201cfor a brief further explanation of the [Senate] Amendment\u201d; id.; at which point Representative Tulisano explained that the bill \u201cclarifies and makes . . . clear that the obligation of a court to find that [the department] has done all it can to reunify the family does not exist when there\u2019s a <em>consent </em>[to termination] involved.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., pp. 6126-27. Taken in context, neither this comment, nor any other comment made during the pertinent legislative debate, evinces an intent by the legislature that \u00a7 3 of P.A. 95-238 was intended to clarify, rather than to change, the then existing law on reunification of parent and child. In the absence of clear and unequivocal evidence of such intent, we conclude that, because P.A. 95-238 effected substantive changes in the law regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>the termination of parental rights, Ann F.\u2019s retroactivity claim must fail.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">We turn now to Ann F.\u2019s remaining two claims, namely, that the trial court improperly found that: (1) she had failed to rehabilitate herself in satisfaction of the requirements of \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (2); and (2) the termination of her parental rights with respect to Eden was in Eden\u2019s best interest.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We reject both of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following additional facts that are relevant to our resolution of these two claims. \u201cAt the trial, the department produced testimony [in its case-in-chief] from the following: psychiatrist Richard Sadler; psychologist David Mantell; [Crosby]; Janet Romayko, Eden\u2019s therapist in the community; Andrea Moran, one of Eden\u2019s therapists at Natchaug Hospital; Pavinee Saguansatsya, another of Eden\u2019s therapists at Natchaug Hospital; and the foster mother of the children. . . . Ann F. produced testimony from herself; Ilda DePina, a department social service assistant; Candace Stone, Ann F.\u2019s mental health care manager; Steven Alloy, Ann F.\u2019s psychiatrist; Benita Montalvo; Tina DeCosta; and Carol Anne Preste.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> There was no rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">\u201cMantell, a clinical psychologist, prepared court-ordered psychological evaluations in 1993 and 1995.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>On October 4, 1993, a time when both children had visitation with Ann F. once a week, Mantell, by court referral, undertook individual psychological and relationship evaluations of both [Ann F.] and the children. He reported that Eden \u2018exhibited poor work product, short attention span, avoidance, resistance, inappropriate affect, oppositionality, pleasure from causing interpersonal distress and a broad range of socially and emotionally inappropriate behavior.\u2019 He opined that she adduced \u2018the profile of a significantly troubled child and that she appears to have substantial developmental delay.\u2019 As to Joann, who was only one year old at that time, he noted that \u2018her development seems to be broadly within average limits. She was a pleasant child who posed no difficulties on the evaluation day.\u2019 With reference to Ann F., about whom he had been given a good deal of historical information, [Mantell] said: \u2018It is evident that [Ann F.] had a significant history of mental disorder that has impaired her ability to function as an adult and also as a parent.\u2019 Aware of her bipolar status and her medication regimen, he said that \u2018[h]er general manner of presentation is that of a psychologically simple, anxious, naive and child-like person with low stress tolerance who is being maintained by medication and substantial support service.\u2019 [Mantell's] report recommended \u2018that the children not live with [Ann F.] at this time.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">\u201cSadler . . . performed an evaluation of Ann F. in September, 1993. At that time, he was unable to assess who was the psychological parent of the children as he did not interview either child, nor did he see them interact with the major parenting figures in their lives. The trial court, in reviewing this report, noted Sadler\u2019s opinion that Ann F. had a stable and chronic psychiatric condition that had seriously impaired her functional abilities over many years, as well as her requirement of repeated hospitalizations and supportive outpatient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>treatment efforts. Sadler opined in his report that \u2018[Ann F.\u2019s] history strongly suggests that [she] is unlikely to be able to develop parenting skills which have not been demonstrated in the past [and that] no discussion by [her] indicates an adequate appreciation of the deficits which would need to be corrected for her to maintain a stable environment for her children.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">\u201cOn October 4, 1995, Ann F. indicated to Sadler that the department was \u2018going for a Termination of Parental Rights .... I asked to have [Joann] as she\u2019s easier to handle .... Eden came back to me totally depressed. I could handle it.\u2019 He also said that \u2018much better than ordinary parenting will be needed [for] Eden in order to deal successfully with her handicaps and to capitalize upon her personality, intellectual and physical strengths.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">\u201cOn May 26,1994, [Thomas] Spudic<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> [a psychologist] wrote of Ann F.\u2019s \u2018considerable progress in her ability to stay focused, to speak coherently about her problems and in her ability to relate to Eden [as well as his being] very impressed with her genuine love for these children and her desire to be with them.\u2019 He nevertheless believed that her problems in dealing with the children \u2018seem to be exclusively a product of her emotional state/bipolar disorder . . . and [that] it is clear that she continues to have significant emotional problems.\u2019 He concludes that \u2018although [Ann F.] has made significant strides in caring for herself, I question her ability <em>at this time </em>to care for her children on a full-time basis. . . . [I]t is far from certain whether she could care for herself and both children . . . even with considerable support.\u2019 . . . Some six months later, on December 5, 1994, Spudic again reported his pessimism \u2018about Eden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>making it permanently back with [Ann F. ], \u2019 commenting that \u2018Eden is extremely challenging from a behavioral point of view.\u2019 Iterating Ann F.\u2019s \u2018heart of gold,\u2019 Spudic candidly indicated that he hoped that he \u2018might be proved wrong in [his] prediction about the outcome of reunification.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">\u201cCrosby<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> testified that the department actually had no intention of reunifying Joann with [Ann F.] unless the reunification of Ann F. with Eden was successful. No comment was made that the department, in deciding to return Eden first, discussed that issue with Mantell or any other therapist. The department admitted that when Eden was returned to [Ann F.] in February, 1995, Eden was being evaluated at Newington Children\u2019s Hospital and that that evaluation had been ongoing for a period of time. The department, however, did not await the outcome of that evaluation before returning Eden to Ann F. in February, 1995, because to do so would have added months more before the reunification could have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\u201cAt trial, Sadler stated that the department did not consult with him about the reunification before returning Eden to Ann F. . . . Alloy . . . testified that the reunification would have had \u2018a greater chance of success to start working [if Ann F. were reunified] with the more normal child, the younger daughter [Joann].\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">\u201cIn its . . . memorandum of decision, the trial court found in the adjudicatory phase that, in late 1994 and early 1995, [the department] worked with other service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>providers to reunify Eden with [Ann F.]. The trial court referred to the belief of Crosby, the department caseworker, that Ann F. had spent more time with Eden (two years) than with Joann and that if there were any bonding between [Ann F.] and the children, it was more likely to be with Eden. The trial court also relied on Mantell\u2019s view that while there was no evidence of an ongoing relationship between Ann F. and Joann, there [was] some evidence of a more distant bonding between [Ann F.] and Eden with great conflict and dissatisfaction in the relationship, particularly on Eden\u2019s side. In addition, the trial court observed in its memorandum of decision that the social study prepared by the department and the reports of Sadler and Mantell all recommend the termination of parental rights.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Eden F., </em>supra, 48 Conn. App. 299-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The trial court noted that, by all accounts, Ann F. loves her children and is highly motivated to be reunited with them. Nevertheless, the court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that, largely due to Ann F.\u2019s longstanding and \u201cserious personality disorder that [adversely] affects her ability to interrelate with her children,\u201d she had failed to achieve the requisite degree of personal rehabilitation necessary to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (2). After considering each of the seven factors enumerated under \u00a7 17a-112 (d),<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> the trial court then found, by clear and convincing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>evidence, that it is \u201cin the best interests of Eden and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Joann to terminate the parental rights of their biological parents so that the children may be placed in adoption, or that other permanent planning be accomplished without further delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">We first address Ann F.\u2019s claim that the trial court reasonably could not have found that she had failed to achieve such a degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that, within a reasonable period of time, she could assume a responsible position with respect to the care of her children. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (2). We disagree with Ann F.\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">\u201cOn appeal, we review a trial court\u2019s finding that a parent has failed to rehabilitate herself in accordance with the rules that apply generally to a trier\u2019s finding of fact. We will overturn such a finding of fact only if it is clearly erroneous in light of the evidence in the whole record. <em>In re Luis C., </em>[supra, 210 Conn. 166].\u201d <em>In re Romance M., </em>229 Conn. 345, 353, 641 A.2d 378 (1994). \u201c[G]reat weight is given to the judgment of the trial court because of [the court\u2019s] opportunity to observe the parties and the evidence. . . . We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. . . . [O]n review by this court every reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>ruling.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Jessica M., </em>49 Conn.

The statute does not require [a parent] to prove precisely when she will be able to assume a responsible position in her child\u2019s life. Nor does it require her to prove that she will be able to assume full responsibility for her child, unaided by available support systems. It requires the court to find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the level of rehabilitation she has achieved, if any, falls short of that which would reasonably encourage a belief that at some future date she can assume a responsible position in her child\u2019s life.\u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-3), </em>1 Conn.

The trial court reasonably relied on the testimony of the three experts, Spudic, Mantell and Sadler, each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>whom concluded that, in light of the serious and chronic nature of Ann F.\u2019s mental illness, her future prospects for assuming a responsible parenting role for her children are bleak. See <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous), </em>177 Conn. 648, 667, 420 A.2d 875 (1979) (in termination proceeding, \u201c[psychological testimony from professionals is rightly accorded great weight\u201d). Moreover, each of those experts had spent a considerable amount of time evaluating Ann F. and her capacity to reestablish a position of responsibility in the lives of her children. Consequently, the record contains sufficient facts to support their professional opinions.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Ann F. points to certain evidence adduced during the trial tending to establish that, over the years, she has made progress in coping with both her illness and her children.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Indeed, the evidence does suggest that Ann F. has achieved a level of stability within her limitations. This fact, coupled with Ann F.\u2019s sincere love for her daughters, evokes genuine sympathy for Ann F. and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>her efforts at rehabilitation.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Nevertheless, in light of all the evidence, including the uncontroverted opinions of Spudic, Mantell and Sadler, we cannot say that the trial court was clearly erroneous in concluding, by clear and convincing evidence, that Ann F. had failed to reach such a degree of rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that, within a reasonable period of time, she could assume a responsible position in the lives of her children.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Ann F. also claims that the evidence did not support the trial court\u2019s finding that termination of her parental rights with respect to Eden was in Eden\u2019s best interest. Specifically, Ann F. contends that the termination of a child\u2019s relationship with his or her parents cannot be in that child\u2019s best interest unless the purpose is to free the child for adoption. Because Eden\u2019s foster parents would not commit themselves to adopting Eden, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>because there is no guarantee that an alternative adoptive family will be found,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Ann F. asserts that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Eden\u2019s best interest will be served by the termination of Ann F.\u2019s parental rights was clearly erroneous. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Although subsequent adoption is the preferred outcome for a child whose biological parents have had their parental rights terminated; <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-BC), </em>189 Conn. 66, 79, 454 A.2d 1262 (1983); accord <em>In re Baby Girl B., </em>224 Conn. 263, 274, 618 A.2d 1 (1992); it is not a necessary prerequisite for the termination of parental rights. While long-term stability is critical to a child\u2019s future health and development; <em>In re Romanee M., </em>supra, 229 Conn. 356; adoption provides only one option for obtaining such stability. In this case, Eden\u2019s foster parents, despite hesitancy about committing themselves to adopting Eden, have indicated a willingness to provide Eden with a permanent foster home, assuming that such a placement is determined to be in Eden\u2019s best interest. In light of this testimony, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the possibility of a permanent placement with Eden\u2019s current <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>foster family was preferable to the continuing uncertainty of the status quo.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Moreover, the trial court properly considered each of the factors enumerated in \u00a7 17a-112 (d), and thoroughly documented its conclusions regarding those factors. See footnote 31 of this opinion. Those conclusions, which need not be repeated here, are fully supported by the record. Consequently, we are persuaded that, in light of all the relevant facts and considerations, including Eden\u2019s special needs and Ann F.\u2019s demonstrated inability to meet them, Eden\u2019s need for permanency and stability, her bond with her foster family and her age, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the commissioner had demonstrated, by clear and convincing evidence, that the termination of Ann F.\u2019s parental rights was in Eden\u2019s best interest was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C.

App. 302 n.18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b721-6\"> As required by \u00a7 17a-112 (d), the trial court made the following written findings regarding each of the seven factors:</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">\u201c(1) The [department . . . has offered appropriate and timely services for transportation for visitation, for psychiatric counseling, for alcohol and drug treatment, and support services such as a parent aide, outpatient psychiatric services through Manchester Memorial Hospital, the Horizons program, the Exchange Club, Genesis, the Village for Families, [t]he Family Support Center, and pastoral counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">\u201c(2) The court finds that the [d]epartment . . . has made reasonable efforts given the situation and circumstances to provide counseling for Ann [F.], which she has continuously utilized. Efforts to reunite the child, Eden, with Ann [F.], were made in February, 1995. The child was subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>removed in March, 1995. Even the mother agreed that Eden was too difficult for her to control. The [department has unintentionally allowed an inordinate period of time, three and [one-half] years, for Ann [F.] to acquire the skills and stability to effectively parent these children. The mother simply does not have the intellectual or emotional wherewithal to raise these two children.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">\u201c(3) Regarding court orders, fulfillment of obligations, expectations and the like: The court finds that court approved expectations have urged Ann [F.] to secure and maintain clean, safe and adequate housing, which she has substantially done; to attend visitation sessions as often as permitted, which she has done; and to participate in individual counseling and day treatment, which she has done.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">\u201c(4) The children\u2019s feelings and emotional ties with the biological parent and foster parents were fully considered by the court. The children are clearly bonded to their foster family. The court-appointed psychologist. . . Mantell, reports that the foster parents are the psychological parents to the children. There is no parental-child bonding. [According to Mantell] \u2018[t]here is some evidence of a more distant bonding between [Ann F.] and Eden with great conflict and dissatisfaction in the relationship, particularly on Eden\u2019s side.\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">\u201c(5) With respect to the age of the children, Eden turned eight on July 2,1996. [As of the date of this decision, August 5,1996] Joann is nearly four years of age. These children require stability in their lives, a time to heal without the fear of having to five with Ann [F.], and an affirmation by this court that they have a permanent home. Leaving these children in legal \u2018limbo\u2019 would hardly be in their best interest. A three and [one-half] year delay in bringing finality to this placement decision is inordinately long.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">\u201c(6) With respect to the efforts [Ann F.] has made to adjust her circumstances, conduct or conditions to malee it in the best interests of the children to return to her home in the foreseeable future, the court finds that Arm [F.] has not demonstrated the parenting abilities in the past, and, given her optimal state of her therapeutic gains, she does not demonstrate even now, adequate understanding of Eden\u2019s needs or an ability to engage Joann in any way other than as a playmate. . . . Sadler indicated that\u2018[i]ncremental gains may well be made over the years, although it is exceedingly unlikely . . . that [Ann] F. will undergo any dramatic or substantial improvement either in her individual functioning or in her parenting abilities.\u2019 . . . Further delay in providing permanency to these children\u2019s family structure would be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">\u201c(7) With respect to any barriers which may have reasonably or unreasonably been placed in the path of Ann [F.] to prevent a meaningful relationship with the children, the court finds that the [department . . . has met its obligations to Ann [F.] by repeatedly offering a variety of services and treatment modalities to her. One of the few consistencies in Ann [F.\u2019s] life appears to be her consistent willingness to undergo treatment for her mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>health problems. She has gone to individual, parental and family support counseling. Notwithstanding the multitude of counseling services in which she has participated, she still lacks the judgment, patience, and skills necessary to parent. [According to Sadler\u2019s report of October 7, 1995, Ann F.] \u2018has herself consistently and vigorously and successfully continued to engage in behaviors that have maintained the chaos and disruptions in her life. [Ann] F. has selected companions who do not support her parenting and she has demonstrated no improvements in her parenting abilities that would encourage any hope that she will develop parenting abilities in the future that she has never demonstrated in the past.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b725-6\"> Ann F. contends that, at trial, she elicited certain concessions from Sadler that weakened the persuasive force of his testimony. Specifically, she notes that the social study report prepared by Crosby did not contain certain historical information helpful to Ann F., and that Sadler, who acknowledged that he had relied on the report, stated that he would have found the omitted information \u201cvery important.\u201d Notwithstanding that testimony, however, Sadler never changed his opinion that, in all likelihood, Ann F. never would be able to assume a responsible position in the lives of her children. The trial court, therefore, was entitled to give Sadler\u2019s opinion whatever weight it deemed appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b725-7\"> For example, Ann F. relies on the fact that she was able to care for Eden without serious incident during the three week period immediately preceding the date on which the department finally removed Eden from Ann F.\u2019s care. The trial court, however, was free to conclude that Ann F. had demonstrated poor judgment when she went out to play bingo and left Eden with two men, one of whom she hardly knew, who left Ann F.\u2019s home strewn with beer cans and allowed Eden\u2019s room to be \u201ctrashed\u201d while she was in their care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b726-7\"> As Mantell, the court-appointed psychologist, noted in one of his reports: \u201cThis is a sad and tragic case. ... I would like to believe that there might have been something that could have been done to reverse this process. Regrettably, [Ann F.] seems to be tragically disabled by the combination of the psychosocial compromises of her childhood and her chronic mental disorder. The quality of her a(Jjustment at any point is fragile, the risk of decompensation ever present, and her prospects are quite dim.\u201d This observation is quoted by the trial court in its memorandum of decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\"> At trial, Ann F. claimed that there exists a \u201cstrong bias against parents [with] mental illness,\u201d and that Ann F. herself had been \u201cbattl[ing]\u201d such bias in connection with this case. Ann F., however, makes no such claim on appeal. Of course, any such bias would be intolerable, and vigilance must be exercised to ensure that the parental rights of mentally ill persons are afforded the full protections provided under our stringent statutory scheme. See generally, e.g., R. Sackett, \u201cTerminating Parental Rights of the Handicapped,\u201d 25 Fam. L.Q. 253 (1991); P. Bernstein, \u201cTermination of Parental Rights on the Basis of Mental Disability: A Problem in Policy and Interpretation,\u201d 22 Pac. L.J. 1155 (1991); see also M.

With respect to Joann, the testimony established that her foster parents almost certainly will seek to adopt her. Due largely to Eden\u2019s \u201clong history of behavioral problems including aggression, impulsivity and defiance,\u201d however, her adoptive status is less clear. At trial, Eden\u2019s foster mother testified that \u201cwe would like to offer Eden a permanent home. I am not going to commit to adoption at this point because we feel there are a lot of issues involved and we would like to talk to the therapeutic community before we make a definite decision. . . . [W]e just want to make sure that we have the best atmosphere for her to be able to grow into a healthy adult.\u201d The foster mother also indicated that, even if she did not seek to adopt Eden, she nevertheless wanted Eden to remain in her home. The foster mother acknowledged, however, that there were times when she thought that she might not be able to keep Eden in her home due to Eden\u2019s behavioral problems. In addition, both Mantell and Crosby indicated that children with problems such as Eden\u2019s are less likely to be adopted than children who do not pose such problems.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b728-8\">MCDONALD, J., with whom BERDON, J., joins,</author>\n<p id=\"Apa\">dissenting. I would uphold the Appellate Court\u2019s decision that: (1) the trial court was required to find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the department of children and families (department) had made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent mother, Ann F., and her children, Eden and Joann, before terminating Ann F.\u2019s parental rights; and (2) the trial court\u2019s determination that such efforts were made was clearly erroneous. I also disagree with part II of the majority opinion, regarding whether Ann F. had rehabilitated herself, and whether the termination of her parental rights with respect to Eden was in Eden\u2019s best interest. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The Appellate Court held that, prior to terminating Ann F.\u2019s parental rights, the trial court was required to find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify Ann F. with both of her children, Eden and Joann. See <em>In re Eden F., </em>48 Conn. App. 290, 310-11, 710 A.2d 771 (1998). The trial court had made findings regarding the department\u2019s efforts to reunify the family, but the Appellate Court concluded that the findings were not supported by clear and convincing evidence in the record. Id., 322. The Appellate Court found that the department had failed to implement properly a plan to reunify Ann F. with Eden; id., 317-19; and that the department had made no efforts at all to reunify Ann F. with Joann. Id., 319-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The majority reverses the Appellate Court judgment, holding that the petitioner, the commissioner of children and families (commissioner), was not required to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify Ann F. and her children. The majority holds, instead, that a trial court may terminate parental rights if it determines, by clear and convincing evidence, that the termination is in the child\u2019s best interest, after considering the seven factors delineated in General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112 (d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>The termination of a parent\u2019s legal rights is \u201cthe complete severance by court order of the legal relationship, with all its rights and responsibilities, between the child and his or her parent. It is, accordingly, a most serious and sensitive judicial action. <em>Anonymous </em>v. Norton, 168 Conn. 421, 430, 362 A.2d 532, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 935, 96 S. Ct. 294,46 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1975).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Baby Girl B., </em>224 Conn. 263, 279, 618 A.2d 1 (1992). The United States Supreme Court has recognized that \u201ca natural parent\u2019s desire for and right to the companionship, care, custody, and management of his or her children is an interest far more precious than any property right.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 758-59, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982). \u201cIf the State prevails, it will have worked a unique kind of deprivation. ... A parent\u2019s interest in the accuracy and justice of the decision to terminate his or her parental status is, therefore, a commanding one.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 759. For these reasons, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201c[b]efore a State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child, due process requires that the State support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Id., 747-48. The clear and convincing standard is \u201cnecessary to preserve fundamental fairness in a variety of government-initiated proceedings that threaten the individual involved with a significant deprivation of liberty . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">I read <em>Santosky </em>to require the department to establish, by at least clear and convincing evidence, the conditions for the termination of parental rights. Under the revision of \u00a7 17a-112 (d) (2) in effect at the time of trial, the court was required to consider and make written findings regarding whether the department had made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>reasonable efforts to reunite the family before terminating Ann F.\u2019s parental rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I would find that the department was required to make such reasonable efforts as a condition of terminating parental rights and that the commissioner was required to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that those efforts were made. The statute\u2019s requirement that the court consider and make written findings regarding such reasonable efforts supports this conclusion. Any civilized and common sense reading of the requirements to forever cut off a parent\u2019s relationship with a child dictates this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">Be there any question, the legislature, in enacting Public Acts 1995, No. 95-238, \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> made clear that such a finding was required for the termination of parental rights. This amendment to \u00a7 17a-112 became effective before the trial in this case. Because the amendment was labeled procedural in the legislative history; see 38 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1995 Sess., p. 3736, remarks of Representative Richard D. Tulisano; and referred to as one that \u201cclarifies\u201d the statute; 38 H.R. Proc., Pt. 17, 1995 Sess., p. 6126, remarks of Representatives John W. Thompson and Tulisano; the amendment should have applied to Ann F.\u2019s termination proceedings. See <em>Miano </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>218 Conn. 170, 175, 588 A.2d 189 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Moreover, the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (federal act), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 670 et seq., requires the state to facilitate the reunification of the family in order to qualify for federal funding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The use of the federal spending power as a \u201ccarrot\u201d or \u201cstick\u201d to force state action repeatedly has been recognized in United States Supreme Court decisions. See, e.g., <em>South Dakota </em>v. <em>Dole, </em>483 U.S. 203, 208-209, 107 S. Ct. 2793,97 L. Ed. 2d 171 (1987). The majority accepts the commissioner\u2019s argument that the federal act is \u201can appropriations act.\u201d In truth, the department, for years, has complied with the federal act. The department has submitted a plan providing for such efforts, which was approved by the secretary of health and human services, and has accepted the federal funds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the department\u2019s policy manual, which was in effect in 1995 when the petitions to terminate Ann F.\u2019s parental rights were filed, provides that \u201c[the department] requires that \u2018reasonable efforts\u2019 be made in every case to prevent unnecessary placement or return the child to the family, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number><em>as required by federal law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Department of Children and Families Policy Manual (November, 1994) \u00a7 46-3-6, p. 1 (Policy Manual).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is difficult, to say the least, to reconcile the department\u2019s determination in the policy manual that federal law requires reasonable efforts and the department\u2019s receipt of federal funds \u2014 based on compliance with the federal act\u2014 with the commissioner\u2019s argument in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Finally, I cannot imagine that the citizens of this state, or those of the United States, would countenance the termination of parental rights without a requirement of reasonable efforts on the part of a state agency to attempt to reunify a mother with her daughters. Such a requirement, I believe, is expressed both in the federal and state constitutions and required in a decent society concerned with a mother\u2019s most fundamental right to her children. In this case, Ann F., although mentally impaired, loves and wants her children, and she deserves the protection of due process before her rights to her daughters are severed permanently.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Because the majority concludes that the trial court was not required to find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the family, it does not review the trial court\u2019s conclusion to that effect. I would affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s careful, detailed and proper decision that the trial court\u2019s conclusion was not supported by clear and convincing evidence. <em>In re Eden F., </em>supra, 48 Conn. App. 317, 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">As the Appellate Court noted, the department\u2019s plan for reunification \u201clacked planning on a number of critical issues . . . .\u201d Id., 317. Ann F. never was afforded a fair chance to succeed with Eden. When the department reunified Ann F. with Eden on February 27, 1995, Eden\u2019s own significant psychological and behavioral needs still were formally being assessed. Id., 296. The department chose not to wait for the results of this assessment, and proceeded with the reunification despite the ongoing evaluation of Eden.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., 296,319. Ann F. and her support service providers, i.e., her therapist and department case manager, were not informed of the reunification with Eden until the actual day on which it occurred. The commissioner provided a crisis telephone line for Ann F.; however, when she placed a telephone call to the department, no one returned her call for five days. Id., 297 &amp; n.11. The department also provided Ann F. with a parent aide, but the aide only visited twice over the course of the month. Id., 297 &amp; n.9. When Eden returned to live with Ann F., the department had not enrolled Eden in school, and Eden did not have her usual therapeutic services for most of the reunification period. Id., 296-97. Ann F. was not provided with any respite and, because Eden was not attending school, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Ann F. had to care for her, seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day, for three weeks. Id, 297, 318. Ann F. was programmed for failure. The end came when Ann F. went out to play bingo with a friend and left Eden in the care of two people. Id, 297. When the department learned that Eden\u2019s bedroom was \u201ctrashed\u201d that evening, and that the babysitters had been drinking beer in the apartment, it removed Eden from Ann F.\u2019s care. Id, 297-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The department did not demonstrate any efforts, whatsoever, to reunify Ann F. with her youngest child, Joann, despite the fact that Joann did not share her sister Eden\u2019s functional problems and would have been easier to handle. Id, 319-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Because the department did not properly implement the plan to reunify Ann F. with Eden and did not make <em>any </em>efforts to reunify Ann F. with Joann, I would affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court reversing the judgments of the trial court and order the trial court to restore Ann F.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">The majority reaches two additional issues that were not decided by the Appellate Court: First, whether the trial court improperly found that Ann F. had failed to rehabilitate herself and, second, whether the trial court improperly concluded that the termination of Ann F.\u2019s parental rights was in Eden\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">The trial court found that it had been proven, by clear and convincing evidence, that Ann F. had failed to rehabilitate herself. However, \u201c[t]he statute does not require [a parent] to prove precisely when she will be able to assume a responsible position in her child\u2019s life. Nor does it require her to prove that she will be able to assume full responsibility for her child, unaided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>available support systems.\u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-3), </em>1 Conn. App. 463, 477, 473 A.2d 795, cert. denied, 193 Conn. 802, 474 A.2d 1259 (1984). I would conclude that General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (2) does not require Ann F. to rehabilitate herself to the degree that she can care for her children without assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Under this standard, I believe that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to find that Ann F. had not rehabilitated herself. The majority stresses that \u201cthe trial court reasonably relied on the testimony\u201d of David Mantell, a clinical psychologist, and other expert witnesses in reaching its conclusion. I disagree that such reliance was reasonable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>There was no evidence at trial from which the trial court reasonably could have concluded that Ann F. could not care for Eden and Joann with reasonable assistance. No witness testified that, even with assistance and the required services, Ann F. would never be able to care for her daughters.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The reports of Thomas Spudic, a psychologist who worked with Ann F. and her children, noted that Ann F. had made \u201cconsiderable progress in her ability to stay focused, to speak coherently about her problems, and in her ability to relate to Eden.\u201d Spudic concluded that, while he questioned Ann F.\u2019s ability <em>at that time </em>to care for her children on a <em>full-time basis, </em>he was \u201cvery impressed with her genuine love for these children and her desire to be with them.\u201d Spudic noted that Ann F. had a \u201cheart of gold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Moreover, Ann F. had cared for Eden, a problem child, for three weeks without respite and without reasonable assistance. If the department had provided the proper support services to Ann F. during her reunification with Eden, as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671 (a) (15), by placing Eden in school, providing Eden with her regular counseling services and offering respite to Ann F., perhaps, Ann F. would not have been forced to leave Eden as she did that one evening when she went to play bingo.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">I agree with the Appellate Court that the department, in seeking to terminate the right to parent, is capable of amassing substantial resources. \u201c[I]n matters of termination of parental rights, the department occupies a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>superior position. . . . [T]he parties are by no means dealing on an equal basis. The parent is by definition saddled with problems: economic, physical, sociological, psychiatric, or any combination thereof. The agency, in contrast, is vested with expertise, experience, capital, manpower and prestige. Agency efforts correlative to their superiority [are] obligatory.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Eden F., </em>supra, 48 Conn. App. 312. Given the inequality of resources in this case, I do not believe that the department proved, by clear and convincing evidence, that Ann F. had failed to rehabilitate herself to the extent that, with the necessary support services and assistance, she could play a useful role in her daughters\u2019 lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">I also believe that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that terminating Ann F.\u2019s parental rights with respect to Eden was in Eden\u2019s best interest was clearly erroneous. Although long-term stability is critical to a child\u2019s future health and development, there was no prospect at the time of trial that Eden would be adopted by her foster parents. Eden\u2019s sister, Joann, however, maybe adopted by her current foster family. Watching her sister be adopted, while she is not, and having her mother\u2019s parental rights terminated, may be a cruel experience for Eden. It is not disputed that Eden, who was seven years old at the time of trial, had formed a bond with Ann F. over the years. Under the circumstances, it is not in Eden\u2019s best interest to terminate her legal relationship with Ann F., and then have Eden watch her sister be adopted while she is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">This is a tragic and difficult case that will have a long-standing, future effect upon parents with mental disabilities. The courts may have \u201c[little] experience in the area of terminating parental rights of handicapped parents.\u201d R. Sackett, \u201cTerminating Parental Rights of the Handicapped,\u201d 25 Fam. L.Q. 253, 253 (1991). \u201cHandicapped persons do not generally comply with society\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720A\">*720A</page-number>stereotype of a parent. The handicapped parent\u2019s parenting skill may therefore be assessed under standards that result in him or her being considered an inadequate parent because he or she is handicapped.\u201d Id., 272. Adding to this difficulty is the fact that Ann F. suffers from a mental illness. \u201cSurveys show that mental disabilities are the most negatively perceived of all disabilities.\u201d M. Perlin, \u201cThe ADA and Persons with Mental Disabilities: Can Sanist Attitudes Be Undone?\u201d 8 J.L. &amp; Health 15, 26 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">\u201cUltimately, the question is whether the parent is inherently unable to fulfill [her] responsibilities or the state has failed to provide adequate services or training to enable [her] to do so.\u201d D. Forman, Every Parent\u2019s Guide to the Law (1998) p. 311. While I respect the majority\u2019s efforts and conclusions as we all try to bring justice to Ann F. and her children, the fact remains that Ann F. tried to be a mother within the confines of her disabilities. She demonstrated that she cared deeply for her children and wanted to parent them as best she could. Forbidding her from ever doing so, without giving her a fair chance to try, violates both Ann F.\u2019s rights and the rights of her children. In a world in which children are abused, neglected and abandoned every day, it is sad that Ann F., a caring mother with a \u201cheart of gold,\u201d who may have the potential to play an important role in her daughters\u2019 lives, has been stripped of her right to be a parent without having a fair chance to prove herself capable. Ann F.\u2019s last act as a mother is fighting to remain in her daughters\u2019 lives. Perhaps, this, in itself, will give a small measure of comfort to them, particularly to Eden.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-7\"> The majority cites <em>In re Christine F., </em>6 Conn.

His objectivity recently was questioned by the Appellate Court, which concluded that the trial court should have struck his testimony because he simultaneously worked both as the court-appointed evaluator and as an evaluator for the state. <em>In re David W., </em>52 Conn.

As one article stated, \u2018[t]he studies . . . indicate that psychiatrists often disagree in their judgments and that even where they do agree those <em>judgments </em>\u2014 especially <em>predictive judgments </em>\u2014 are often wrong.\u2019 [B. Ennis &amp; T. Litwack, \u201cPsychiatry and the Presumption of Expertise: Flipping Coins in the Courtroom,\u201d 62 Cal. L. Rev. 693, 719 (1974).] . . . Reliance on these evaluations as a basis for terminating parental rights introduces an unacceptable element of chance. The severe intrusion on the rights of the parent is not outweighed by a compelling state interest if the state action will be wrong as often as it is right.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) P. Bernstein, \u201cTermination of Parental Rights on the Basis of Mental Disability: A Problem in Policy and Interpretation,\u201d 22 Pac. L.J. 1155, 1176-77 (1991). For these reasons, I believe that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to rely on Mantell\u2019s testimony in terminating Ann F.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b737-6\"> Rather, the expert witnesses that favored termination focused on the fact that Ann F. could not care for the children <em>on a full-time basis at that time. </em>Kenneth Crosby, a department social worker, testified to the effect that Ann F. was not capable of taking care of the children <em>on a full-time permanent basis. </em>Richard Sadler, a psychiatrist, testified to the effect that Ann F. could not parent the children <em>independently. </em>No witness stated that Ann F. could never be a successful parent, if provided with the statutorily required assistance and services.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720B\">*720B</page-number>BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AKYH\">dissenting. I agree with now Chief Justice McDonald\u2019s well reasoned dissent regarding the termination of the parental rights of the respondent mother, Ann F., with respect to her two daughters, Eden F. and Joann F. Indeed, this is one of those cases where the split decision of the court, carried by a bare majority of a five justice panel, is so outrageous and heartbreaking that Ann F.\u2019s motion to reargue en banc<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> prompted the filing of three applications for permission to appear as amici curiae and file briefs in support of Ann F.\u2019s motion to reargue before a full court of seven justices and also to file briefs on the merits in support of Ann F., had her motion to reargue been granted. Those applications were filed by the state office of protection and advocacy for persons with disabilities,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Connecticut Legal Services, Inc.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the Connecticut Legal Rights Projects, Inc., together with the Mental Health Association of Connecticut, Inc., Connecticut Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Advisory Council, Advocacy Unlimited, Inc., and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720C\">*720C</page-number>the Connecticut Consortium of Women and Children with Behavioral Needs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The critical issue in this three to two decision was whether the state was required to prove, by <em>clear and convincing evidence, </em>that the commissioner of children and youth services, now the commissioner of children and families (commissioner), made reasonable efforts to reunite Ann F. with Eden F. and Joann F., as the Appellate Court unanimously ruled in its well reasoned opinion in <em>In re Eden F., </em>48 Conn. App. 290, 710 A.2d 771 (1998). I join Chief Justice McDonald in his dissent because, in my view and contrary to the majority, General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112 requires that the commissioner must prove by clear and convincing evidence that termination is in the child\u2019s best interest and that the commissioner made reasonable efforts to reunite the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720D\">*720D</page-number>Furthermore, both the federal and state constitutions require that the state provide sufficient due process protection before terminating parental rights. \u201cThe standard of proof applicable to a proceeding for the termination of parental rights is that of \u2018clear and convincing evidence.\u2019 <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>[455 U.S. 745, 748, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982)]. The <em>Santosky </em>court said, \u2018We hold that such a standard adequately conveys to the factfinder the level of subjective certainty about his factual conclusions necessary to satisfy due process.\u2019 Id., 769.\u201d <em>In re Eden F., </em>supra, 48 Conn. App. 308. Indeed, this court recognized \u201cthat due process requires the state to prove the allegations in a petition to terminate parental rights by clear and convincing evidence before those rights could be terminated.\u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-AB), </em>189 Conn. 58, 60, 454 A.2d 271 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Nevertheless, under the facts of this case, as pointed out by Chief Justice McDonald in his dissent, it is clear that the commissioner failed even to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he made reasonable efforts to reunite the family. Not only does this violate the constitutional rights of Ann F. and her children, it flies in the face of a 1995 amendment<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to \u00a7 17a-112, which statutorily reinforces these constitutional rights. The majority waltzes around this amendment by concluding, in a hypertechnical ruling, that because the amendment was adopted subsequent to the filing of the petition for termination, it was not applicable. Although it is correct that the amendment did not become effective until after the petition was filed, it was effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>at the time of the hearing on the petition and was ignored by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">In affirming by only one vote the trial court\u2019s decision to terminate Ann F.\u2019s parental rights with respect to her two children and by refusing to allow for reargument before an en banc court, this court not only demonstrates a lack of sensitivity, but also ignores the fundamental constitutional right of the family to be free from government interference. \u201cThe fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State. Even when blood relationships are strained, parents retain a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of their family life. If anything, persons faced with forced dissolution of their parental rights have a more critical need of procedural protections than do those resisting state intervention into ongoing family affairs. When the State moves to destroy weakened familial bonds, it must provide the parents with fundamentally fair procedures.\u201d <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>supra, 455 U.S. 753-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">It seems incredible to me that the majority of this court would reverse a unanimous Appellate Court panel and let stand a three to two decision of this court involving such a sensitive matter that implicates fundamental constitutional rights of the family without ordering reargument before an en banc court. It is because of this seeming indifference that I remind the majority of this court of the sanctity of the parent-child relationship and that the state is required, by the constitution and by statute, to prove that every effort was made to support the reunification of a parent and her children before terminating their relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-5\"> This dissent was filed subsequent to the denial of the motion to reargue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b740-6\"> The state office of protection and advocacy for persons with disabilities advocates for the rights of persons with disabilities. The agency is concerned that, first, the court\u2019s decision negatively impacts upon the rights of disabled parents to raise their children by allowing for the termination of parental rights based upon the parents\u2019 disability status. This is contrary to the legislature\u2019s intent that the state provide services to reunify and strengthen families regardless of parents\u2019 disability. Second, the majority\u2019s decision affects the rights of children with disabilities to remain with their families. The state\u2019s removal of the disabled child in this case, given the familial relationship and the difficulties in arranging adoptions for disabled children, is not in the child\u2019s best interest. Finally, the majority\u2019s decision fails to recognize that parents and children with disabilities constitute a protected class under both federal and state civil rights laws. The agency argues, however, that the Appellate Court\u2019s decision is not narrowly tailored to serve the state\u2019s compelling interest in protecting children. Furthermore, the state\u2019s efforts to reunify the family did not offer equal protection to the disabled parent and child in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\"> Connecticut Legal Services, Inc., which represents indigent parents with disabilities, raises concerns about the rights of disabled parents in the termination of parental rights cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b741-6\"> Those various Connecticut nonprofit organizations advocate on behalf of persons with mental health disabilities. Their concern is that the majority\u2019s decision interferes with the rights of disabled parents to maintain or reestablish their familial relationships. This, they argue, violates various federal and state civil rights laws that protect the rights of the family and the disabled. They critique the majority\u2019s focus on whether the amendment to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112; see Public Acts 1995, No. 95-238, \u00a7 3; was substantive or procedural. Furthermore, they assert, given the fundamental rights of the respondent mother and her children to maintain their familial relationship, the court should have applied the <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976), test to ascertain if there was sufficient procedural due process protection. Under the <em>Mathews </em>test, (1) the right to parent is fundamental, (2) there is a risk of erroneously depriving the parent and children of the familial relationship, and (3) the state\u2019s interest in preserving families is more important than the state\u2019s burden of providing additional due process protections. There is insufficient evidence, these agencies argue, that the state made reasonable efforts to reunify Ann F. and her children before terminating her parental rights. In addition, the state\u2019s treatment of the disabled mother may implicate federal and state civil rights laws. Finally, these agencies point out that the state did not protect the rights of the children to maintain their familial relationships. In particular, the state did not act in the best interest of the disabled child, Eden, given the existing parent-child relationship and the potential difficulties of finding adoptive parents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b742-6\"> Public Acts 1995, No. 95-238, \u00a7 3, provides in relevant part: \u201cSection 17a-112 of the general statutes is repealed and the following is substituted in lieu thereof . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">\u201c(b) The superior court, upon hearing and notice as provided in sections 45a-716 and 45a-717, may grant such petition [to terminate parental rights] if it finds that <em>theDepartment of Children and Families has made reasonable efforts to reunify the child with the parent </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
