J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7yL\">The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether Connecticut should continue to adhere to the unity of title doctrine. See <em>Curtin </em>v. <em>Franchetti, </em>156 Conn. 387, 389, 242 A.2d 725 (1968). We conclude that it should not. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>of the trial court, which was compelled by its justified reliance on the doctrine as stated in <em>Curtin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The following facts and procedural history are undisputed. The plaintiff, Marie G. Bol\u00e1n, is the owner of approximately 161 acres of undeveloped real estate located in Litchfield. The plaintiffs land does not abut any public highway and is completely landlocked. The defendant, Avalon Farms Property Owners Association, Inc., is the owner of land that is situated immediately south of, and adjacent to, the plaintiffs land.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">From 1936 to 1939, Isabel Curtis was the owner of a large tract of land that included the properties that now belong to the plaintiff and the defendant. In 1939, Isabel Curtis divided her tract into two separate parcels. The boundary line between the two was the centerline of Old Mount Tom Road, a road that in 1927 had been discontinued for public use by the town of Litchfield. Isabel Curtis retained ownership of the tract north of the boundary line, and transferred the tract south of the line to her son, Charles Curtis. At that time, both tracts abutted public highways.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The plaintiffs land is part of the tract of land that was retained by Isabel Curtis in 1939. In 1940, Isabel Curtis transferred the tract to Marion Heiser.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Between 1940 and 1955, Heiser divided the property into parcels and sold every parcel that abutted a public highway, leaving herself with six adjacent parcels that had no access to a public highway and were completely landlocked. In 1958, Heiser transferred five of those six landlocked parcels to her son, Charles Phinny. Phinny acquired the sixth of Heiser\u2019s landlocked parcels from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Heiser\u2019s estate in 1970. Upon Phinny\u2019s death in 1985, his estate transferred two of the six landlocked parcels to the plaintiffs husband, Thomas A. Bol\u00e1n. Less than one month later, Thomas A. Bol\u00e1n transferred both parcels, which abut the defendant\u2019s land, to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The defendant\u2019s land is part of the tract that Isabel Curtis transferred to Charles Curtis in 1939. Upon acquiring the property, Charles Curtis gave it the name \u201cAvalon Farms.\u201d Thereafter, the property was transferred several times before Pasquale DiNardo, Trustee, (DiNardo) acquired it on January 5, 1978. DiNardo acquired the property with the intention of developing it, and, on January 24,1978, he filed a set of subdivision maps for the Avalon Farms Subdivision (subdivision) with the town clerk of Litchfield.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The subdivision maps, which showed the entire subdivision, included areas that were designated as \u201copen space conservation\u201d and \u201copen space.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In 1979, DiNardo transferred a portion of the subdivision to Gold Key Builders, Inc. (Gold Key).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The property transferred to Gold Key included all roadways, several building lots, and the areas shown as \u201copen space conservation\u201d and \u201copen space\u201d on the subdivision maps. In 1988, after further development of the subdivision, DiNardo and Gold Key executed deeds transferring to the defendant their respective interests in the \u201copen space conservation\u201d and \u201copen space\u201d areas of the subdivision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The deeds by which the defendant acquired its property from DiNardo and Gold Key describe the lands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>conveyed as those \u201cdesignated and shown as \u2018OPEN SPACE CONSERVATION\u2019 and \u2018OPEN SPACE\u2019 areas on a certain set of subdivision maps (including cover and sheets 1 through 13, inclusive), entitled \u2018Avalon Farms, Route 202, Litchfield, Connecticut August 1977, Prepared by Empire Associates, Inc., Plainville, Connecticut,\u2019 which subdivision maps are on file in the offices of the Morris and Litchfield Town Clerk [s] and to which subdivision maps reference is herein made for a more particular description of the same.\u201d The set of subdivision maps referred to in the defendant\u2019s deeds are those that DiNardo filed with the town clerk of Litchfield in 1978. Sheet 13 of those subdivision maps, which is explicitly referred to in the defendant\u2019s deeds, describes the boundary between the plaintiffs property and the defendant\u2019s property as the \u201cCENTERLINE OF [THE] OLD ROAD.\u201d Sheet 13 also sets forth the following legend in the portion of the defendant\u2019s property parallel and immediately adjacent to that boundary: \u201cTHIS AREA RESERVED FOR OPEN SPACE &amp; ACCESS AREA FOR LANDLOCKED ABUTTERS.\u201d At the time that the subdivision maps were filed, Phinny was the owner of the landlocked property that now is owned by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In 1994, the plaintiff brought the present action against the defendant, seeking a determination that: (1) the deeds by which the defendant had acquired its property granted Phinny an easement appurtenant over the defendant\u2019s property for purposes of access to a public highway; and (2) the plaintiff, as Phinny\u2019s successor in interest, is the owner of that easement. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant\u2019s deeds and the subdivision maps referred to therein manifested an intention by DiNardo and Gold Key to create an easement over the designated access area in favor of Phinny, a landlocked abutter. The trial court concluded that DiNardo and Gold Key had intended to grant Phinny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>an easement appurtenant over the defendant\u2019s land. Appropriately relying on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Curtin </em>v. <em>Franchetti, </em>supra, 156 Conn. 389, however, the court concluded that the unity of title doctrine precluded it from giving effect to such intent. Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We now abandon the unity of title doctrine, and reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims, inter alia, that: (1) the deeds by which the defendant acquired its land manifest an intention to create an access easement over the defendant\u2019s property in favor of property owned by landlocked abutters; and (2) because the unity of title doctrine operates to frustrate that intent, the doctrine should be abrogated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree with both of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\u201cThe principles governing the construction of instruments of conveyance are well established. In construing a deed, a court must consider the language and terms of the instrument as a whole. . . . <em>Our basic rule of construction is that recognition will be given to the expressed intention of the parties to a deed or other conveyance, </em>and that it shall, if possible, be so construed as to effectuate the intent of the parties. ... In arriving at the intent expressed ... in the language used, however, it is always admissible to consider the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>with the transaction, and every part of the writing should be considered with the help of that evidence. . . . The construction of a deed in order to ascertain the intent expressed in the deed presents a question of law and requires consideration of all its relevant provisions in light of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lakeview Associates </em>v. <em>Woodlake Master Condominium Assn., Inc., </em>239 Conn. 769, 780, 687 A.2d 1270 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The deeds by which the defendant acquired its property provide that the lands conveyed to the defendant were those \u201cdesignated and shown as \u2018OPEN SPACE CONSERVATION\u2019 and \u2018OPEN SPACE\u2019 areas on a certain set of subdivision maps (including cover and sheets 1 through 13, inclusive) ... to which subdivision maps reference is herein made for a more particular description of the same.\u201d Thus, the deeds explicitly provide that the defendant\u2019s rights in the \u201copen space conservation\u201d and \u201copen space\u201d land would be subject to all restrictions more particularly set forth in the subdivision maps. The effect of the reference to the subdivision maps was to incorporate those maps into the deed. General Statutes \u00a7 7-31.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThis reference to the map in the deed, \u2018[f]or a more particular description,\u2019 incorporates [the map] into the deed as fully and effectually as if copied therein.\u201d <em>Bankers Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>165 Conn. 624, 631, 345 A.2d 544 (1974). <em>\u201c[T]he </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number><em>identifying or explanatory features contained in maps referred to in a deed become part of the deed, </em>and so are entitled to consideration in interpreting the deed as though they were expressly recited therein.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Whittaker </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>179 Conn. 650, 659 n.8, 427 A.2d 1346 (1980). Thus, the effect of incorporation of the subdivision maps into the deeds was to include in the deeds any easement memorialized on those maps. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Sheet 13 of the subdivision maps contains a legend that provides that the area immediately south of, and adjacent to, what is now the plaintiffs landlocked property is \u201cRESERVED FOR . . . ACCESS AREA FOR LANDLOCKED ABUTTERS.\u201d The term \u201creserved\u201d is a term of art generally associated with the creation of an easement; see <em>Knowlton </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>72 Conn. 188, 192-93, 44 A. 8 <em>(1899);Barnes v. Burt, </em>38 Conn. 541, 542 (1871); 25 Am. Jur. 2d, Easements and Licenses \u00a7\u00a7 19, 82 (1996); and the term \u201ceasement of access\u201d is used to refer to an abutting landowner\u2019s \u201c \u2018right of ingress, egress, and regress ....\u2019\u201d <em>Kachele </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co., </em>109 Conn. 151, 153, 145 A. 756 (1929). Thus, the language of the legend on sheet 13 indicates an intention to create an access easement. Finally, the term \u201clandlocked abutters\u201d in that legend identifies the land to be benefited by the access easement, namely, the landlocked property that now is owned by the plaintiff. See <em>Branch </em>v. <em>Occhionero, </em>239 Conn. 199, 204, 681 A.2d 306 (1996) (creation of easement requires identification of property to be benefited). As previously noted, the determination of the intent expressed in a deed presents a question of law. <em>Lakeview Associates </em>v. <em>Woodlake Master Condominium Assn., Inc., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 780. We conclude, therefore, that, as a matter of law, the deeds and the incorporated subdivision maps by which the defendant acquired its property manifest an intention by DiNardo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>and Gold Key to create an access easement over that property in favor of the owner of the landlocked property that now belongs to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The trial court concluded, however, that the unity of title doctrine precluded it from recognizing such an easement. The unity of title doctrine provides that \u201c[n]o right of way appurtenant can be created without a dominant as well as a servient estate. . . . The dominant estate enjoys the benefit of the way, and the servient estate bears the burden. The way can become legally attached to the dominant estate only if the same person has unity of title to both the way and the dominant estate.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Curtin </em>v. <em>Franchetti, </em>supra, 156 Conn. 389. The doctrine is based on the common-law notion that, because a stranger to the deed has no interest in the property conveyed, he has no interest to be excepted from the grant, and none from which a reservation could be carved. <em>Aszmus </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>743 P.2d 377, 380 (Alaska 1987); <em>Willard </em>v. <em>First Church of Christ, Scientist, </em>7 Cal. 3d 473, 475, 498 P.2d 987, 102 Cal. Rptr. 739 (1972); annot., 88 A.L.R.2d 1199, 1202 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The unity of title doctrine was adopted by this court in <em>Curtin </em>v. <em>Franchetti, </em>supra, 156 Conn. 387. In <em>Curtin, </em>the plaintiff claimed that she owned a right of way over the defendant\u2019s property. Both parties traced their chains of title to a common grantor. The trial court determined that the grantor had reserved a right of way over the defendant\u2019s property for the benefit of the plaintiffs property, and rendered judgment for the plaintiff. On appeal, we noted that \u201c[t]he way can become legally attached to the dominant estate only if the same person has unity of title to both the way and the dominant estate.\u201d Id., 389. Concluding that the plaintiff had failed to establish that the common grantor had owned her property at the time he had reserved an easement over the defendant\u2019s property, we reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>the judgment of the trial court. Id., 391; see <em>Stankiewicz </em>v. <em>Miami Beach Assn., Inc., </em>191 Conn. 165, 170, 464 A.2d 26 (1983) (approving doctrine). Thus, <em>Curtin </em>requires that an easement be created by a person who has title to both the easement area and the property to be served by the easement. <em>Curtin </em>v. <em>Franchetti, </em>supra, 389. When the defendant in the present case acquired its property, DiNardo and Gold Key were the owners of the area of the property intended to serve as an easement; they were not, however, the owners of the land that the easement was intended to serve, i.e., the plaintiffs property. Consequently, continued adherence to the unity of title doctrine that we adopted in <em>Curtin </em>would preclude us from recognizing that easement. \u201cWhile we [have] recognized that several commentators view the unity of title doctrine as an obsolete vestige of feudalism that frustrates the intention of the grantor; H. Harris, \u2018Reservations in Favor of Strangers to the Title,\u2019 6 Okla. L. Rev. 127 (1953); 2 American Law of Property (Casner Ed. 1952) \u00a7 8.29; 5 Restatement, Property \u00a7 472, comment [a]; we [have] decided to defer reconsideration of the subject until we are confronted with a case in which the grantor\u2019s intention to create an interest that would violate the rule is \u2018reasonably clear.\u2019 <em>Ozyck </em>v. <em>D\u2019Atri, </em>[206 Conn. 473, 479, 538 A.2d 697 (1988)].\u201d <em>Carbone </em>v. <em>Vigliotti, </em>222 Conn. 216, 223-24, 610 A.2d 565 (1992); <em>Branch </em>v. <em>Occhionero, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 202 n.4; see <em>Abington Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Heublein, </em>246 Conn. 815, 829, 717 A.2d 1232 (1998). This is such a case. We can discern no reason to adhere to the unity of title doctrine and ignore the expressed intention of the parties to the defendant\u2019s deeds. We conclude, therefore, that the unity of title doctrine should be abandoned and that the intent of the deed creating an easement should be effectuated even if no unity of title exists between the servient estate and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>dominant estate the easement is intended to serve.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To the extent that <em>Curtin </em>approves the unity of title doctrine, it is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Our conclusion, moreover, finds support in the recently approved provisions of the Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and in the decisions of many other states.

Because of that legal conclusion, and because of the abandonment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the unity of title doctrine that was the underpinning of the trial court\u2019s judgment, the new trial that is necessitated should be limited to the extent and nature of the plaintiffs easement, which obviously the trial court did not determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for a new trial limited to a determination of the extent and nature of the plaintiffs easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-8\"> The deed by which Isabel Curtis transferred the tract south of the dividing line to Charles Curtis did not grant Isabel Curtis any easement appurtenant over that tract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-9\"> The deed by which Isabel Curtis transferred the tract north of the dividing line to Heiser also makes no mention of any easement over the property that then was owned by Charles Curtis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\"> The subdivision maps, which had been prepared for DiNardo\u2019s predecessor in title, previously had been approved by the Litchfield planning and zoning commission on November 21, 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b156-9\"> DiNardo was the president of Gold Key.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b156-10\"> The defendant acquired its property by quitclaim deed from DiNardo on January 6, 1988, and by warranty deed from Gold Key on January 6, 1988.
