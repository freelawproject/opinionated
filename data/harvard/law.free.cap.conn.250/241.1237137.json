The trial court rendered a judgment ordering a new election to be held, and we expedited the defendants\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal. Following the filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>of simultaneous briefs and oral argument before this court, we announced the decision of this court from the bench on June 11, 1999, reversing the judgment of the trial court and ordering that the results of the election were to stand, with a written opinion to be filed in due course.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hence, this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The principal issue in this appeal involves the standard to be applied under General Statutes \u00a7 9-328<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>a trial court to order a new election. The defendants appeal <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court ordering a new election, in response to the complaint of the plaintiff, Steven Bortner, the sole unsuccessful candidate in the election.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants claim that the trial court improperly: (1) found that one of the voting machines was out of paper for write-in voting during a significant part of the voting hours; (2) refused to open the evidence, after its decision, to admit certain election records regarding that machine; (3) determined that a new election was justified pursuant to \u00a7 9-328; and (4) ordered a new election at which all of the candidates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>would be required to run, rather than just the plaintiff and the successful candidate with the next closest number of votes to him. We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case with direction to render judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">On May 13, 1999, the plaintiff filed the complaint in this case challenging the result of the election held on May 3, 1999. The case was tried to the trial court on May 19 and 21, 1999, and on May 21, the trial court issued an oral memorandum of decision ordering a new election to be held on June 22, 1999. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Certain facts are undisputed. In the May 3,1999 election, there were five candidates for four available positions on the Woodbridge elementary board of education (board).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff was one of the five candidates, and was the only registered write-in candidate pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 9-373a.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Prior to the election, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>of the voting machines had been inspected and certified by the office of the secretary of the state in accordance with state law, and all of the machines had been inspected and serviced by the town\u2019s election machine mechanic. In addition, prior to the election, all of the candidates had been afforded the opportunity to inspect the machines. The plaintiff took that opportunity, and did not make any complaint to any election official. Furthermore, prior to the election, all of the machines were tested and were functioning properly, including the recording of write-in votes.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The polling place was open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. There were eight voting machines operating at the opening, plus one replacement machine. Each elector was entitled to cast one vote for each of any two of the five candidates for the board. A total of 3057 electors cast their ballots in the election. The election returns showed the following votes for the various candidates for the board: (1) 1250 votes for James M. Carolan; (2) 1142 votes for Marianne Vahey; (3) 1081 votes for Eleanor Sanders Sheehy; (4) 987 votes for Bonna M. Greene; and (5) 931 votes for the plaintiff.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, according to the vote count, Carolan, Vahey, Sheehy and Greene would have been elected, and the plaintiff would have lost to Greene, the next closest successful candidate, by fifty-six votes. The plaintiff did not request a recanvass pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 9-311,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>none was required by law pursuant to General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>\u00a7 9-311a.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>In his complaint, the plaintiff, relying on \u00a7 9-328,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> alleged that voters desiring to vote for him were prevented from doing so by voting machine malfunctions, which included the following: one or more of the machines ran out of paper for casting write-in ballots; on one or more of the machines, the sections for write-in candidates were not accessible because the metal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>doors would not open; on one or more of the machines, the paper for the write-in candidates did not advance properly; and on one or more of the machines, the write-in slots were not readily visible to or accessible for voters of short stature. The plaintiff alleged further that, as a result of these irregularities and malfunctions, and \u201cvarious . . . rulings of election officials, there has been a failure to record votes and, consequently, a mistake in the count of the votes cast at [the] election . . . .\u201d The plaintiff also alleged that, \u201c[b]ut for the improper actions of the elected officials and the irregularities which occurred, there is a substantial likelihood that the result of said election would have been different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">On the basis of these allegations, the trial court held an expedited trial<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> on May 19 and 21, 1999. At the conclusion of the trial, the court issued an oral memorandum of decision vacating the results of the election, and ordering a new election, to be held on June 22, 1999, for <em>all </em>candidates for the board in the May 3, 1999 election.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court found \u201cthat there were complaints throughout the day to election officials, not all of which were properly recorded and to which not all were attended in an expeditious and appropriate fashion.\u201d In support of this general finding, the court made the following \u201cunderlying factual findings.\u201d On voting machine number 143719, the paper for write-in candidates was not advancing at 6:50 a.m. Although that machine was taken out of service and replaced at that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>time, \u201cthat issue that early in the day affecting certainly one candidate more than others \u2014 in other words, there was only one candidate that depended on paper at that point or that kind of paper<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> . . . should have served as some sort of notice to the election officials that scrutiny of the mechanics of all of the machines needed to be undertaken throughout the day with some care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The trial court also found that voting machine number 150231 had a significant problem throughout the day, in that there were reports to election officials concerning that machine at 1:40 p.m., 2:50 p.m. and 3 p.m., and the 1:40 p.m. report involved a perceived inability to cast a write-in vote for the plaintiff. The court further found that this machine \u201cnever continued to function adequately,\u201d and that it was not checked at 3 p.m., although there was a complaint regarding it at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The trial court also found that voting machine number 106949 had a paper jam at 4:45 p.m., when it was taken out of service. The court noted that \u201cthe only candidate that depended upon paper of this kind was the write-in candidate,\u201d namely, the plaintiff. See footnote 5 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">The trial court found further that, at 6:30 p.m., voting machine number 107017 had no paper and was taken out of service. The court also found \u201cas a fact that [this machine] had been out of paper since at least 8:30 a.m.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">On the basis of these specific findings, the trial court concluded \u201cthat there were mistakes in the count and that to the extent that election officials in a de facto manner ruled throughout the day that they did not need to continue to inspect the voting machines in use in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>order to ensure that there were not problems with the mechanics, in particular of the write-in votes, [there] were errors.\u201d The court also concluded that, \u201c[g]iven the close vote, the court [felt] it has really no mandate in this situation other than to order a new election.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">On May 27, 1999, the defendants moved to open the evidence to permit them to introduce certain official records of the election that, according to their representations, contained an accurate count of the number of voters who had entered each voting machine on an hourly basis, and that would demonstrate conclusively that one of the trial court\u2019s findings, namely, that voting machine number 107017 had been out of paper since at least 8:30 a.m., was incorrect. The defendants attached copies of those records to their motion, represented that the records constituted \u201cbusiness record evidence,\u201d and asserted that the records had been omitted from the evidence by inadvertence or mistake, and that their absence would result in a serious danger of a miscarriage of justice. The plaintiff opposed the motion, pointing out to the court that, among other reasons, the defendants had produced the records at trial in response to the plaintiffs subpoena, but had not offered them. The court denied the defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The defendants raise a number of claims on appeal. We conclude that: (1) the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to open the evidence to consider the election records offered by the defendants; and (2) the record does not support the conclusion that a new election was warranted under \u00a7 9-328. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Section 9-328 cannot be read in a vacuum. It must be read against its fundamental governmental background. That background counsels strongly that a court should be very cautious before exercising its power under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>statute to vacate the results of an election and to order a new election.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">First, under our democratic form of government, an election is the paradigm of \u201cthe democratic process designed to ascertain and implement the will of the people.\u201d <em>In re Election for Second Congressional Dis</em>trict, 231 Conn. 602, 625, 653 A.2d 79 (1994). The purpose of the election statutes \u201cis to ensure the true and most accurate count possible of the votes for the candidates in the election.\u201d Id., 633. Those statutes rest on \u201cthe bedrock principle that the purpose of the voting process is to ascertain the intent of the voters.\u201d Id., 621. In implementing that process, moreover, when an individual ballot is questioned, \u201cno voter is to be disfranchised on a doubtful construction, and statutes tending to limit the exercise of the ballot should be liberally construed in his [or her] favor.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 653. Our election laws, moreover, generally vest the primary responsibility for ascertaining that intent and will on the election officials, subject, of course, to the court\u2019s appropriate scope of review when the officials\u2019 determination is challenged in a judicial proceeding. See id., 658. We look, therefore, first and foremost to the election officials to manage the election process so that the will of the people is carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Second, \u00a7 9-328 authorizes the one unelected branch of government, the judiciary, to dismantle the basic building block of the democratic process, an election. Thus, \u201c[t]he delicacy of judicial intrusion into the electoral process\u201d; <em>Lobsenz </em>v. <em>Davidoff </em>182 Conn. 111, 124, 438 A.2d 21 (1980) (Peters, <em>J., </em>dissenting); strongly suggests caution in undertaking such an intrusion. As we have indicated, therefore, \u00a7 9-328 provides for remedies only \u201cunder narrowly defined circumstances\u201d; <em>Scheyd </em>v. <em>Bezrucik, </em>205 Conn. 495, 496-97, 535 A.2d 793 (1987); and for \u201climited types of claims . . . .\u201d Id., 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Third, \u00a7 9-328 requires a court, in determining whether to order a new election, to arrive at a sensitive balance among three powerful interests, all of which are integral to our notion of democracy, but which in a challenged election may pull in different directions. One such interest is that each elector who properly cast his or her vote in the election is entitled to have that vote counted. Correspondingly, the candidate for whom that vote properly was cast has a legitimate and powerful interest in having that vote properly recorded in his or her favor. When an election is challenged on the basis that particular- electors\u2019 votes for a particular candidate were not properly credited to him, these two interests pull in the direction of ordering a new election. The third such interest, however, is that of the rest of the electorate who voted at a challenged election, and arises from the nature of an election in our democratic society, as we explain in the discussion that follows. That interest ordinarily will pull in the direction of letting the election results stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">An election is essentially \u2014 and necessarily \u2014 a snapshot. It is preceded by a particular election campaign, for a particular period of time, which culminates on a particular date, namely, the officially designated election day. In that campaign, the various parties and candidates presumably concentrate their resources\u2014 financial, political and personal \u2014 on producing a victory on that date. When that date comes, the election records the votes of those electors, and only those electors, who were available to and took the opportunity to vote \u2014 whether by machine lever, write-in or absentee ballot \u2014 on that particular day. Those electors, moreover, ordinarily are motivated by a complex combination of personal and political factors that may result in particular combinations of votes for the various candidates who are running for the various offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The snapshot captures, therefore, only the results of the election conducted on the officially designated election day. It reflects the will of the people as recorded on that particular day, after that particular campaign, and as expressed by the electors who voted on that day. Those results, however, although in fact reflecting the will of the people as expressed on that day and no other, under our democratic electoral system operate nonetheless to vest power in the elected candidates for the duration of their terms. That is what we mean when we say that one candidate has been \u201celected\u201d and another \u201cdefeated.\u201d No losing candidate is entitled to the electoral equivalent of a \u201cmulligan.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Moreover, that snapshot can never be duplicated. The campaign, the resources available for it, the totality of the electors who voted in it, and their motivations, inevitably will be different a second time around. Thus, when a court orders a <em>new </em>election, it is really ordering a <em>different </em>election. It is substituting a different snapshot of the electoral process from that taken by the voting electorate on the officially designated election day.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Consequently, all of the electors who voted at the first, officially designated election \u2014 3057 electors in the present case \u2014 have a powerful interest in the stability of that election because the ordering of a new and different election would result in <em>their </em>election day disfranchisement. The ordering of a new and different election in effect disfranchises all of those who voted at the first election because their validly cast votes no longer count, and the second election can never duplicate the complex combination of conditions under which they cast their ballots.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>All of these reasons strongly suggest that, although a court undoubtedly has the power to order a new election pursuant to \u00a7 9-328 and should do so if the statutory requirements have been met, the court should exercise caution and restraint in deciding whether to do so. A properjudicial respect for the electoral process mandates no less. With these principles in mind, therefore, we turn to the dispositive issues of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">We next address the burden that \u00a7 9-328 places on a plaintiff who seeks to secure a new election. The defendants claim that the plaintiff was obligated to establish that, as a result of any proven irregularities cognizable by the statute, he would have won the election, that is, he would have received at least fifty-seven more votes than he did receive and, therefore, would have received more votes than Greene. The plaintiff, although not offering on appeal<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> any standard under the statute,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> claims that the trial court was justified on the facts of this case in ordering a new election.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>We conclude that \u00a7 9-328 does not require a challenger, in order to secure a judicial order for a new election, to establish that, but for the irregularities that he has established as a factual matter, he would have prevailed in the election. We conclude instead that, in order for a court to overturn the results of an election and order a new election pursuant to \u00a7 9-328, the court must be persuaded that: (1) there were substantial violations of the requirements of the statute, which we discuss in more detail in parts IV and V of this opinion; and (2) as a result of those violations, the reliability of the result of the election is seriously in doubt. We conclude further that, although the underlying facts are to be established by a preponderance of the evidence and are subject on appeal to the clearly erroneous standard; see Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; the ultimate determination of whether, based on those underlying facts, a new election is called for \u2014 that is, whether there were substantial violations of the statute that render the reliability of the result of the election seriously in doubt\u2014 is a mixed question of fact and law that is subject to plenaiy review on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The determination of the standard to be applied under the statute presents a question of statutory interpretation. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>. . . Id.; <em>Carpenteri-Waddington, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>231 Conn. 355, 362, 650 A.2d 147 (1994); <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 755-56, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 431-32, 692 A.2d 742 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We begin, as we ordinarily do in interpreting statutes, with the statutory language. Section 9-328 provides in relevant part: \u201cSuch judge shall, on the day fixed for such hearing [on the plaintiffs complaint] and without unnecessary delay, proceed to hear the parties. If sufficient reason is shown, he may order any voting machines to be unlocked or any ballot boxes to be opened and a recount of the votes cast, including absentee ballots, to be made. Such judge shall thereupon, <em>if he finds any error in the rulings of the election official or any mistake in the count of the votes, </em>certify the result of his finding or decision to the Secretary of the State before the tenth day succeeding the conclusion of the hearing. <em>Such judge may order a new election or primary or a change in the existing election schedule. </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added.) The italicized language makes clear that, as a predicate for the ordering of a new election under \u00a7 9-328, there must be either (1) an error or errors \u201cin the rulings of\u2019 an election official, or (2) a \u201cmistake in the count of the votes.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See also <em>Scheyd </em>v. <em>Bezrucik, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 503; <em>Wrinn </em>v. <em>Dunleavy, </em>186 Conn. 125, 134 n.10, 440 A.2d 261 (1982). That language does not make clear, however, what standard must be met in order for the court to order a new election. Indeed, it does not state, either directly or by implication, how significant the errors in the rulings or the mistakes in the count must be, and how likely it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>was that the errors or mistakes affected the result of the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The genealogy and legislative history of the statute, however, offer guidance on this question. Until 1978, \u00a7 9-328 did not authorize a judge to order a new election. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 9-328.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In 1978, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the legislature enacted No. 78-125 of the 1978 Public Acts. Section 9 of Public Act 78-125 amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 9-328 by, among other things, adding the language: \u201cSuch judge may order a new election or primary or a change in the existing election schedule. ...\u201d The legislative history regarding this amendment, however, is unilluminating.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In 1987, the legislature again amended \u00a7 9-328 as part of an omnibus election law bill entitled, \u201cAn Act concerning Judicial Hearings concerning Absentee Ballots.\u201d See Public Acts 1987, No. 87-545. Section 3 of Public Act 87-545 amended \u00a7 9-328 by adding language that specifically brought within its terms fraudulent conduct and other improprieties in the casting of absentee ballots.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The legislative debate in the House of Representatives directly addressed the standard that must be met under \u00a7 9-328 in order for a judge to order a new election.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> That debate indicates a legislative intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>that, although a candidate who challenges an election need not necessarily prove that he would have won the election but for the improprieties that he established, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>he would be required, in the language of the debate, to prove that there were \u201csubstantial violations [that] . . . might change the results, and ... if unclear, but . . . substantial, the judge could order a new election . . . if he believed that the election was so compromised that that was the best . . . remedy.\u201d 30 H.R. Proc., Pt. 30, 1987 Sess., pp. 11,023-24, remarks of Representatives Robert F. Frankel and Martin M. Looney; see footnote 22 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Finally, in interpreting \u00a7 9-328, we are cognizant of the delicate balance of interests at stake in the electoral process. Taking into account the legislative language, its genealogy and history, and the balance of interests involved, we glean the following standard that must be met in order for a court to order a new election pursuant to \u00a7 9-328. The court must be persuaded that: (1) there were substantial errors in the rulings of an election official or officials, or substantial mistakes in the count of the votes; and (2) as a result of those errors or mistakes, the reliability of the result of the election, as determined by the election officials, is seriously in doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">We next address our scope of review regarding a decision by a trial court to order, or to decline to order, a new election pursuant to \u00a7 9-328. We conclude that the underlying historical facts as found by the trial court are, of course, subject on review to the clearly erroneous standard. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. Beyond that, however, we conclude that whether any rulings of an election official or mistakes in the count of votes were substantial, and whether the result of the election is seriously in doubt, are questions that call for plenary review on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">These questions are most accurately characterized, not as either questions of fact or as questions of law, but as the hybrid mixed questions of fact and law. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>throughout the law there are various mixed questions that call for differing scopes of appellate review and, therefore, applying the label does not necessarily yield the answer; see, e.g., <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>234 Conn. 139, 152-53, 662 A.2d 718 (1995) (mixed question of law and fact yielding plenary review); <em>Plastic Tooling Aids Laboratory, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 365, 369, 567 A.2d 1218 (1990) (mixed question of law and fact yielding review under clearly erroneous standard); the question of whether to give such a mixed determination by a trial court deferential or plenary review is really a question of judicial policy. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104, 114, 106 S. Ct. 445, 88 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1985) (when \u201cthe issue falls somewhere between a pristine legal standard and a simple historical fact, the fact/law distinction at times has turned on a determination that, as a matter of the sound administration of justice, one judicial actor is better positioned than another to decide the issue in question\u201d). The importance of the democratic interests at stake, the importance of seeing that the balance of those interests is struck properly in any given case, and the delicacy of the question of judicial intrusion into the electoral process, persuade us that a plenary scope of review is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">With these background principles and standards in mind, we turn to the defendants\u2019 specific claims on appeal. We first consider their claim that the trial court abused its discretion in denying their motion to open the evidence. We agree with the defendants. We conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the court should have opened the evidence to consider the documentary evidence that the defendants sought to offer. We further conclude that the undisputed facts disclosed by those documents wholly undermine a critical finding of the trial court regarding voting machine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>number 107017, namely, that this machine, which was taken out of service at 6:30 p.m., had been out of paper since at least 8:30 a.m. on election day, and that, therefore, that finding must be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u201cWhether or not a trial court will permit further evidence to be offered after the close of testimony in the case is a matter resting within its discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>103 Conn. 138, 145, 130 Atl. 96 [1925]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>103 Conn. 453, 479, 130 Atl. 899 [1925]; <em>King </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>115 Conn. 201, 203, 161 Atl. 103 [1932]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>125 Conn. 399, 405, 6 A.2d 359 [1939]. <em>Hauser </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>126 Conn. 240, 242, 10 Atl. (2d) 689 [1940], In the ordinary situation where a trial court feels that, by inadvertence or mistake, there has been a failure to introduce available evidence upon a material issue in the case of such a nature that in its absence there is serious danger of a miscarriage of justice, it may properly permit that evidence to be introduced at any time before the case has been decided. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmquist, </em>173 Conn. 140, 152, 376 A.2d 1111, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 906, 98 S. Ct. 306, 54 L. Ed. 2d 193 (1977).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>244 Conn. 403, 421, 710 A.2d 1297 (1998). The same principles apply to a request to offer evidence after a decision has been rendered. <em>Stocking </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>156 Conn. 70, 72, 238 A.2d 421 (1968). The trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">First, the documents offered by the defendants, which were attached to the motion,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> conclusively demonstrate that it was impossible for voting machine number 107017 to have been out of paper \u201csince at least 8:30 a.m.,\u201d as the trial court had found. Other evidence in the case established that, when the machine was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>taken out of service at 6:30 p.m., the plaintiff had received 115 write-in votes on that machine. The documents that the defendants offered were the official tally sheets for each voting machine used in the election. They constituted the official record, taken from the counting mechanism of each machine, of the number of electors who had entered that machine to vote on an hour-by-hour basis. These documents establish that: as of 8 a.m., 52 electors had entered that machine; as of 9 a.m., 80 electors had entered that machine; and as of 10 a.m., only 109 electors had entered that machine. Thus, it is simply impossible for this machine to have been out of paper for the purpose of recording write-in votes at 8:30 a.m., and also to have recorded 115 write-in votes for the plaintiff as of 6:30 p.m.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Second, the caution with which a court should approach the decision of whether to order a new election strongly suggests that the trial court should have entertained the proffered evidence, notwithstanding its lateness. Appropriate judicial respect for the election process requires that, when the two factors of accuracy and speed conflict, it is better for the court to be correct on its facts than to be prompt and final in its decision. These documents conclusively establish that the trial court was incorrect in at least one of its critical factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Third, there was no special need for speed and finality in this case at the time that the evidence was offered. Only six days had elapsed since the trial court\u2019s decision ordering a new election for June 22, 1999, nearly one month away. Furthermore, there was nothing magical about that date for the new election. No critical interests would have been undermined had the proffered evidence required some further delay in the ultimate decision and, consequently, in a postponed new election date. We consider the merits of this appeal, therefore, shorn of the trial court\u2019s finding that voting machine number 107017 was out of paper for purposes of recording write-in votes for the plaintiff since 8:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The defendants also claim that the trial court improperly concluded that there had been an erroneous ruling or rulings by an election official or officials within the meaning of \u00a7 9-328. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">We have not heretofore defined the meaning of \u201crulings of the election official\u201d as used in \u00a7 9-328. Moreover, neither \u00a7 9-328 nor any of the closely associated election statutes defines that phrase, nor does any of the legislative history of \u00a7 9-328 give any indication that it was intended to have some specialized meaning. We may presume, therefore, that the legislature intended it to have its ordinary meaning in the English language, as gleaned from the context of its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">The dictionaries of the English language constitute compendiums of the commonly accepted meanings of words, depending on their contexts. Those dictionaries offer the following consistent meanings of the word \u201cruling,\u201d when it is used in the context of an act of a governmental official. A \u201cruling,\u201d according to Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1971), is \u201can official or authoritative decision, decree, or statement ... a decision or rule of a judge or a court ... an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>inteipretation by an administrative agency of the law under which it operates applicable to a given statement of facts . . . .\u201d Similarly, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (1969) defines a \u201cruling\u201d as an \u201cauthoritative or official decision.\u201d In addition, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990), which may be considered as a compendium of the accepted usages of words in the law, depending on their contexts, defines a \u201cruling,\u201d consistently with the nonlegal dictionaries, as \u201c[a] judicial or administrative interpretation of a provision of a statute, order, regulation, or ordinance . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The common thread of these definitions is that, at the least, a ruling of an election official must involve some act or conduct by the official that (1) decides a question presented to the official, or (2) interprets some statute, regulation or other authoritative legal requirement, applicable to the election process. Given that common thread, and given the notion that we should not interpret \u00a7 9-328 beyond its narrowly defined circumstances and its limited types of claims, we conclude that the phrase \u201crulings of the election official\u201d as used in \u00a7 9-328 has that meaning. Moreover, there must be an \u201cerror in the rulings of the election official\u201d in order to supply a basis for a new election under \u00a7 9-328. (Emphasis added.) To summarize, therefore: as one of the statutory predicates of a judicial order for a new election under \u00a7 9-328, namely, \u201cerror in the rulings of the election official,\u201d election officials must have engaged in conduct that incorrectly either (1) decided a question presented to them applicable to the election process, or (2) inteipreted some statute, regulation or other authoritative legal statement or requirement applicable to that process. Applying that definition, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that there were erroneous rulings of election officials cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>The trial court determined that the errors in the rulings of election officials were \u201cthat election officials in a de facto manner ruled throughout the day that they did not need to continue to inspect the voting machines in use in order to ensure that there were not problems with the mechanics, in particular of the write-in votes . . . .\u201d Thus, in the view of the trial court, the election officials\u2019 failure throughout the day to continue to inspect the voting machines in use for the purpose of ensuring that there were not mechanical problems with those machines, constituted an erroneous ruling.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Such a failure, if it existed, however, did not constitute an erroneous ruling. It did not decide, either explicitly or implicitly, a question presented to the election officials regarding the election process, and it did not interpret any statute, regulation or other authoritative legal statement or requirement applicable to that process. It cannot be regarded as anything more than the exercise of election day discretion regarding the proper mechanical functioning of the voting machines, a subject that is committed in the first instance to the authority of the election officials. Given the broad and plenary powers of those officials under our statutes generally, and given the narrow and circumscribed bases for judicial intervention under \u00a7 9-328, the exercise of that discretion must be given a wide berth. Although judicial hindsight regarding whether that discretion was properly exercised might in an extreme case provide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>basis for a conclusion that votes were miscounted, it cannot convert its exercise into a ruling by the officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The plaintiffs reliance on <em>Wrinn </em>v. <em>Dunleavy, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 138-39, is misplaced. In that case, the election officials improperly counted twenty-six absentee ballots that were invalid because they had been improperly mailed. Id., 130. We held that the \u201cruling\u201d was the counting of those improper ballots. Id., 139. In that case, however, by counting those invalid ballots, the election officials implicitly had inteipreted the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 9-146 regarding the casting and mailing of absentee ballots. See id., 145. Thus, <em>Wrinn </em>does not, as the plaintiffs argument suggests, stand for the proposition that any act or failure to act by election officials that is relevant to the election process will suffice as a \u201cruling\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 9-328. Cf. <em>In re Election for Second Congressional District, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 607 (election officials ruled, on recanvass, that absentee ballot envelopes not originally opened should be opened and ballots counted); see also <em>Lobsenz </em>v. <em>Davidoff </em>supra, 182 Conn. 13 (interpretation of minority representation statutes by election moderator constituted ruling by that official). Indeed, such a suggestion is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Scheyd </em>v. <em>Bezrucik, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 503, wherein we stated: \u201c[T]he review provided by [General Statutes] \u00a7 9-325 is available only when the original complaint actually states a cause of action cognizable under [General Statutes] \u00a7\u00a7 9-324, 9-328, or 9-329a. Such a complaint must concern a ruling of an election official or a mistake in the count of votes. ... A plaintiff may not use these sections to challenge a law or regulation under which the election or primary election is held by claiming aggrievement in the election official\u2019s obedience to the law. In such a case the plaintiff may well be aggrieved by the law or regulation, but he or she is not aggrieved by the election official\u2019s rulings which are in conformity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>with the law.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Erroneous rulings by election officials do not, however, constitute the only predicate for a judicial order for a new election under \u00a7 9-328. The other predicate is that there was a \u201cmistake in the count of the votes.\u201d The trial court determined that there was such a mistake. We next address, therefore, the propriety of that determination and whether it justified a new election.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The basis for that determination by the trial court was that there were several voting machines that did not function properly in recording write-in votes for the plaintiff. Specifically, the court found that at 6:50 a.m., on voting machine number 143719, the paper for recording write-in votes was not advancing. It is undisputed, however, that, upon being informed of this problem and checking the complaint, the election officials took this machine out of service and replaced it with alternate voting machine number 76263. The court also found that voting machine number 150231 had a significant problem throughout the day. This problem included reports to election officials concerning this machine at 1:40 p.m., 2:50 p.m. and 3 p.m., with the first of these complaints involving \u201ca perceived inability to cast a write-in vote\u201d for the plaintiff. The court also found that at 3 p.m., this machine was not checked despite a complaint concerning it, and that \u201c[njotwithstanding the evidence that the machine was checked ... it never continued to function adequately.\u201d In addition, the court found that voting machine number 106949 had a paper jam at 4:45 p.m., and was then taken out of service. Finally, with respect to voting machine number 107017, shorn of the improper finding that we already have discussed, the court found that at 6:30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>p.m. the machine had no paper for write-in candidates and was taken out of service.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">We agree with the plaintiff that a mechanical failure of a machine properly to record write-in votes may constitute a \u201cmistake in the count of the votes,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 9-328.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We conclude, however, that these mistakes were not substantial, and that as a result of them the reliability of the result of the election was not placed seriously in doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Voting machine number 143719 was taken out of service at 6:50 a.m., less than one hour after the polls had opened, because it was discovered that the write-in paper was not advancing properly. The evidence regarding this event was that, as a result of that mechanical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>failure, two write-in votes were lost. There was no evidence, however, and it could not be determined, whether either or both of those write-in votes were for the plaintiff or for the write-in candidate for the regional board of education. Thus, any factual finding that these two lost votes harmed the plaintiff would rest on nothing more than speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The evidence regarding voting machine number 150231 was as follows. At 1:40 p.m., there was a complaint regarding write-in votes, namely, that the paper was not advancing properly. The election officials entered the machine, tested the write-in mechanism, determined that the paper was advancing properly, initialed the paper, and left the machine in service. At that time, it also was discovered that one vote for the plaintiff had been crossed out. The significance of that cross-out was not explained. There is no basis in the evidence, however, for an inference that any mechanical failure of the machine could have crossed out a vote that had been cast for the plaintiff.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> At 2:50 p.m., there was another complaint about the write-in mechanism of this machine. The record indicates that the public counter on the machine was off by two digits.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The record also indicates, however, that the election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>officials entered the machine and determined that the mechanism was working properly. There also was evidence that at 3 p.m., there was another complaint about the write-in mechanism, but the election officials did not check the machine at that time. In addition, there was undisputed evidence that this machine was checked twice at 6:35 p.m., and found to be functioning properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">This evidence simply is inadequate to support a finding that this machine \u201cnever continued to function adequately.\u201d The evidence amounts to three complaints, two of which were determined by the election officials at the scene to have been unfounded, and a third complaint that, for unexplained reasons, was not pursued, all in a fourteen hour period of voting. In addition, the voting records indicate a total of 110 write-in votes cast for the plaintiff on this machine, which is fully consistent with the spectrum of such votes cast for the plaintiff on all of the other machines.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It is wholly improbable that a machine that never functioned adequately with respect to recording write-in votes, nonetheless, would have registered a number of votes that was so close to the numbers registered by the other machines that were functioning adequately for all or most of the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The evidence regarding voting machine number 106949 was that at 4:45 p.m., its paper jammed and it was taken out of service. There was no evidence of any malfunctioning of the write-in mechanism before that time. Although there was evidence that when the write in paper was removed from the machine at the end of the voting day it was partially tom vertically, the evidence was also that seventy-nine write-in votes had been recorded on that machine throughout the day. Moreover, this number of write-in votes was consistent with the numbers recorded on the other machines, given that this machine was in service for only eleven of the fourteen voting hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Finally, the evidence regarding voting machine number 107017 was that at 6:30 p.m., in response to a complaint, its write-in mechanism was found not to be functioning properly, and it was then taken out of service. Moreover, by that time 115 write-in votes had been cast for the plaintiff on this machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">There also was evidence that, prior to that time, three voters were unsuccessful, because of a mechanical malfunction, in casting their write-in votes for the plaintiff on that machine. Elizabeth Phillips Marsh testified that at approximately 8:15 a.m., she lifted the slot cover and wrote the plaintiffs name on metal, not paper. Jean Bortner, the plaintiffs wife, testified that at approximately 9 a.m., she lifted the slot cover and wrote the plaintiffs name on what appeared to be metal or clear computer-type paper, not white paper. Michelle Greengarden testified that at approximately 4 p.m., she lifted the slot cover and wrote the plaintiffs name on metal, not paper. Neither Marsh, Bortner nor Greengarden, however, reported her difficulty to any election official.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The sum of this evidence, therefore, was that of the total of nine voting machines in use during the election, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>three were taken out of service at some point, and one was questioned three times. Although these facts, considered alone, might give rise to a conclusion that there were substantial mistakes in the count of the votes, that conclusion is not justified when the facts are analyzed more closely.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">First, one of the three machines was taken out of service less than one hour into the voting day, and there is no evidence that it contributed to any identifiable mistake in the count of the votes for the plaintiff. Second, two of the three complaints on the questioned machine were found to be unfounded, and it was checked twice thereafter and found to be working properly. Third, one machine was not questioned until 4:45 p.m., when it was promptly taken out of service. There is no evidence that, prior to that time, it contributed to any identifiable mistake in the count of the votes for the plaintiff. Fourth, one machine was taken out of service at 6:30 p.m. The only evidence that this machine contributed to identifiable mistakes in the count of votes for the plaintiff was that it did not record the votes of three voters, who did not at any time register complaints with the election officials when those complaints could have been addressed. Furthermore, the undisputed evidence regarding all of the machines in question was that they registered total numbers of write-in votes that were consistent with the numbers registered on the machines that were never questioned. There was no basis, therefore, for an inference that these particular malfunctions were a surrogate for other, unidentified malfunctions of the process of write-in votes for the plaintiff, either on the machines in question or on the other machines in use during the election. Applying our plenary scope of review to this evidence, therefore, we conclude that it falls short of establishing substantial mistakes in the count of the votes in the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>We also conclude that even if we were to regard these mistakes in the count as substantial, the evidence falls short of establishing that those mistakes rendered the reliability of the result of the election, as reported by the election officials, seriously in doubt. The margin between the plaintiff and Greene was fifty-six votes. Giving the plaintiff the full benefit of any mistakes in the count established by the evidence, we cannot conclude that those mistakes would have brought the plaintiffs number of votes significantly closer to that of Greene so as to cast doubt on the reliability of the result of the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C.

Looney during the legislative debate in the House of Representatives:</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">\u201c[Representative Frankel]: Mr. Speaker, just one, perhaps two questions for legislative intent. As I understand the existing statutes, which we are about to act on amending, one can use this procedure where the outcome of an election may be at stake, and now we are going to provide that any alleged violation of these other sections would also be reason to go to court. The operative language . . . when under these new areas, the judges may order a new election.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\u201cThrough you, Mr. Speaker, if the violation were to be found by the judge, but it was not of a substantial nature such that the election results would change, and I will give you an example. Is it our intent to have a judge order a new election in instances such as I am about to outline, where they are minimal, that they may make other findings, but would be advised not to order a new election?</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u201cAnd let me give you an example. If, for example, an allegation under one of these sections was brought that someone had voted three or four times, and indeed, it is a violation of one of these sections. And, after a hearing, a judge found out indeed that was, in his belief, the case, but the outcome of the election wouldn\u2019t be affected, because perhaps the final result was say: 500 votes difference, and the fraud that was found involved only three or four difference. Under those circumstances, I trust that we are not directing the judge to order a new election.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u201cThrough you, Mr. Speaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\u201c[Speaker Irving J. Stolberg]: Representative Looney.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\u201c[Representative Looney]: Yes, Mr. Speaker, through you to the Majority Leader, for purposes of legislative intent. The Majority Leader is correct. It is not the intent of this amendment that a judge would overturn an election or primary unless the violation was major. It would not be the intent to have the remedy far out-strip the events.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">\u201c[Representative Frankel]: Through you, Mr. Speaker, just a follow-up on that. Obviously, we are in areas where there would be substantial violations where, perhaps, might change the results, and I would assume that if unclear, but they were substantial, the judge could order a new election.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">\u201cThrough you, Mr. Speaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">\u201c[Speaker Stolberg]: Representative Looney.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">\u201c[Representative Looney]: Through you, Mr. Speaker, to the Majority Leader. Yes, that is correct. If the violations were substantial, the judge could order anew election, if he believed that the election was so compromised that that was the best and approved and most equitable remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">\u201c[Representative Frankel]: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\u201d 30 H.R. Proc., Pt. 30, 1987 Sess., pp. 11,021-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-16\">Although this was not the legislature that enacted the original provision for a judicially ordered new election, and although we ordinarily do not regard subsequent legislative debate on the intent of earlier enacted legislation as particularly persuasive regarding that intent, we do regard this colloquy as relevant to the meaning of \u00a7 9-328. First, this colloquy took place in the context of an enacted amendment to the statute at issue. Second, the judicial power provided by that amendment bore directly on the scope of that power, albeit enacted in an earlier year. Third, it is apparent from the pointed language of the colloquy that the participants intended it to be used as indicative of legislative intent regarding the scope of that power.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\"> In opposing the motion in the trial court, the plaintiff did not contest the authenticity or accuracy of the documents, and has not done so in this appeal. The documents on their face demonstrate their authenticity. We therefore consider them as authentic and accurate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\"> The fatal frailty of the trial court\u2019s finding in this regard is further demonstrated by a comparison of the total number of write-in votes cast for the plaintiff on voting machine number 107017 and on the other machines. As we have indicated, 115 electors cast their write-in votes for the plaintiff on that machine. The range of write-in votes for the plaintiff on the other machines \u2014 excluding voting machine number 143719, which was taken out of service early in the voting hours, at 6:50 a.m., with one such vote cast\u2014 was from a low of 79 on voting machine number 106949, which was taken out of service at 4:45 p.m., to a high of 137 on voting machine number 76264, and included totals of 90, 105, 110, 112, 115 and 123. It is wholly improbable, therefore, that 115 write-in votes would have been cast for the plaintiff by 8:30 a.m. on that one machine, and none thereafter, while the other machines in service throughout most or all of the day recorded a range of similar totals for the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b287-6\"> That this was a basis of the trial court\u2019s determination that there had been erroneous rulings by the elect ion officials is reinforced by the following passage in the court\u2019s memorandum decision: \u201cThe paper was not advancing on [voting] machine number 143719. The decision at that point was to take that machine out of service and replace it, but that issue that early in the day affecting certainly one candidate more than others \u2014 in other words, there was only one candidate that depended on paper at that point or that kind of paper \u2014 it seems to me should have served as some sort of notice to the election officials that scrutiny of the mechanics of all of the machines needed to be undertaken throughout the day with some care.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\"> When we inquired at oral argument before this court, the parties could not explain to us how a voting machine could have \u201cno paper\u201d for purposes of recording write-in votes. It is undisputed that, mechanically, the write-in process takes place as follows. In the back of the machine there is a continuous roll of paper on which such votes are recorded. It is undisputed that each machine was equipped with such a roll of paper. When a voter wished to cast a write-in vote, he lifted a metal slot cover, causing the paper behind the cover to advance to, presumably, a blank place on the roll. He then wrote in the name of the candidate, and closed the slot cover. Given this mechanism, we were able to understand how a machine, because of a malfunction, could fail to advance the paper to a blank place. It was difficult to understand, however, how there could be <em>no </em>paper behind the metal slot cover. The transcript discloses, however, that, when the election officials discovered, with respect to a particular machine, that there was \u201cno paper\u201d behind the slot cover, they assumed that there was a paper jam that had produced that circumstance. This may account for the mechanical conundrum of \u201cno paper\u201d where there is a continuous roll of paper. In any event, the defendants have not raised this apparent conundrum as a ground of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\"> We reject, therefore, the defendants\u2019 argument that the statutory language only covers a situation in which votes that were cast were improperly counted, but does not cover a situation in which votes were <em>not </em>cast, for whatever reason. First, the statutory language is broad enough to cover both situations. If otherwise validly cast ballots were not counted, the resulting total number of votes for each candidate may be regarded as a \u201cmistake in the count of the votes.\u201d Second, one of the purposes of the statute, namely, to ensure accuracy in the election process, suggests the broader <em>interpretation.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\"> In this connection, the trial court found that \u201c[t]he moderator of the election specifically recalls that the first of [the complaints regarding voting machine number 150231] had to do with a perceived inability to cast a write-in vote for [the plaintiff]; that is not specifically recorded by her but I credit her testimony in that regard.\u201d The transcript indicates, however, that the moderator simply acknowledged that line five, the line with the crossed out vote, was one of the two lines on which an elector could have voted for the plaintiff. We have examined fully the testimony of Mary Lou Winnick, the moderator of the election, and can find no other testimony regarding her recollection o\u00ed a perceived inability by an elector to vote for the plaintiff. We therefore disregard that portion of the finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\"> This meant that there was a discrepancy of two between the total number of electors who had entered the machine, and the total number of votes cast on the machine. The evidence indicates a number of reasons unconnected with any malfunction of the write-in mechanism that would account for such a discrepancy, such as an official entering the machine to check its functioning. On the basis of the evidence in the record, it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>be speculative to infer that this discrepancy was connected to lost votes for the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\"> Those records indicate the following votes for the plaintiff on the other voting machines: (1) 1 vote on voting machine number 143719, which was taken out of service at 6:50 a.m.; <em>(2) </em>79 votes on voting machine number 106949, which was taken out of service at 4:45 p.m.; (3) 90 votes on voting machine number 76263, which was in service from 6:50 a.m. until 8 p.m.; (4) 105 votes on voting machine number 76265, which was in service all day; (5) 115 votes on voting machine number 107017, which was taken out of service at 6:30 p.m.; (6) 123 votes on voting machine number 161427, which was in service all day; (7) 112 votes on voting machine number 160117, which was in service all day; and (8) 137 votes on voting machine number 76264, which was in service all day.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b295-8\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASY\">concurring. I agree with my colleagues in the majority that the trial court should order a new election pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 9-328 only when the following two criteria have been satisfied: (1) the party challenging the election has proven that it is more likely than not that \u201cthere were substantial violations of the requirements of [\u00a7 9-328] . . . and (2) as a result of those violations, the reliability of the result of the election is seriously in doubt.\u201d I also agree that the ultimate determination of whether these criteria have been satisfied \u201cis a mixed question of fact and law that is subject to plenary review on appeal.\u201d Applying this analytic framework to the facts before us, I join my colleagues in the majority in holding that the trial court in the present case improperly ordered a new election. I write separately for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">First, I believe that part I of the majority opinion is dangerously misleading, and I write to set the record straight. The text of \u00a7 9-328 authorizes a trial court to order a new election if it \u201cfinds <em>any error </em>in the rulings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>of the election official or <em>any mistake </em>in the count of the votes . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) I fear that the lopsided tone of part I of the majority opinion will intimidate trial courts and deter them from vacating elections that do not embody the will of the people. Although the majority is certainly correct to emphasize that \u201call of the electors who voted at [an] officially designated election . . . have a powerful interest in the <em>stability </em>of that election,\u201d the voters have an even more powerful interest in the integrity and the accuracy of that election. (Emphasis added.) Pursuant to the legislative mandate contained in \u00a7 9-328, it is the duty of the trial court to elevate integrity and accuracy over stability. To the extent that the majority opinion contains innuendo to the contrary, it should be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">I also write separately in order to take several steps back from the facts of the controversy that is presently before us. In the context of \u00a7 9-328, the majority adopts a plenary standard of review, pursuant to which we do not defer to the trial court\u2019s determination regarding the integrity and accuracy of an election. Viewed in isolation, this is a perfectly sensible decision; indeed, it is one that I join without reservation. Viewed alongside other recent decisions, however, it makes absolutely no sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The majority correctly observes that \u201cthe question of whether to give ... a trial court deferential or plenary review is really a question of judicial policy. \u201d As a matter of judicial policy, I agree that vacating an election is serious business, and that we should scrutinize rigorously a trial court\u2019s determination that it is appropriate to do so. I also believe, however, that we should scrutinize rigorously other judicial rulings that implicate fundamental rights under the constitution. My colleagues in the majority disagree with me, for reasons that they are unable to explain to my satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>I will limit myself to a single, illustrative example. \u201cThe conventional wisdom among African-Americans and other minorities is that they are not treated fairly throughout the judicial system because of their race. To put it plainly, minorities believe that the judicial system is stacked against them. This perception is heightened when the state eliminates minorities from juries by exercising peremptoiy challenges based upon the race of venirepersons. The United States Supreme Court recognized this fact when it stated: \u2018[W]e have not questioned the premise that racial discrimination in the qualification or selection of jurors offends the dignity of persons and the integrity of the courts. Despite the clarity of [constitutional] commands to eliminate the taint of racial discrimination in the administration of justice, allegations of bias in the jury selection process persist.\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>499 U.S. 400, 402, 111 S.

In the present case, however, the majority has decided to scrutinize rigorously the trial court\u2019s ruling, pursuant to the robust standard of plenary review. Apparently, my colleagues in the majority believe that a new election for the Woodbridge elementary school is more important than the perception among African-Americans that the overwhelmingly white legal system \u2014 which once enforced and legitimized both slavery and segregation \u2014 continues to discriminate against them. I am simply bewildered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\"> \u201c[T]his court and the Appellate Court have reviewed claims of purposeful discrimination in the exercise of peremptory challenges in [twenty] cases. Neither court, however, has ever found impermissible discrimination in the exercise of a peremptory challenge, a statistical fact that lends credence to the public perception that our judicial system fosters discrimination.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>248 Conn. 207, 272-73, 726 A.2d 531 (1999) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting); see <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>249 Conn. 645, 691 n.2, 735 A.2d 267 (1999) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b297-8\"> By raising a <em>Ba,tson/Holloway </em>claim, the defendant asserts that the trial court improperly permitted the state to exclude a venireperson from the jury on the basis of race.
