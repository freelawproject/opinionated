We reverse the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">All of the pertinent facts are undisputed. The defendant, James Issler, and his wife, the plaintiff, Susan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Issler, who were married in 1969, entered into a written separation agreement on June 30, 1995 (agreement). Shortly thereafter, the court, <em>Axelrod, J., </em>found the agreement to be fair and equitable and incorporated it into the judgment of dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The agreement is very sophisticated. Both parties agree that it was designed to calibrate the defendant\u2019s alimony payments so that they reflect the intricate structure of the compensation that he receives as the president of H. H. Brown Shoe Company (H. H. Brown), a subsidiary of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway. Each year, the defendant receives both a base salary and incentive compensation. His incentive compensation\u2014 which is based on the profits of H. H. Brown \u2014 comprises the lion\u2019s share of his income.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">H. H. Brown is generally unable to determine its profits for a given year until March of the following year. Every March, an independent certified public accountant releases a letter (accountant\u2019s letter) that conclusively determines the company\u2019s profits for the prior year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the defendant\u2019s incentive compensation is based on the profits of H. H. Brown, his incentive compensation for a given year cannot be determined until the accountant\u2019s letter is released in March of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>following year. In short, the bulk of the defendant\u2019s income for a given year is not known until several months after the end of that year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The agreement reflects the structure of the defendant\u2019s compensation. Pursuant to article 2.2 of the agreement, the plaintiff is entitled to a fixed percentage ofthe defendant\u2019s \u201cgross earnings.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>Article 2.5provides that, \u201c[w]hile the [defendant] is employed by [H. H. Brown], the [defendant\u2019s] gross earnings will be determined by H. H. Brown\u2019s independent certified public accountant\u2019s letter which computes the compensation of [the defendant].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In addition, the parties structured the annual recalculation of alimony payments around the accountant\u2019s letter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pursuant to article 2.6 of the agreement, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>parties assumed that the defendant\u2019s gross earnings in 1995 \u2014 the year in which the agreement was executed\u2014 would be $1,250,000 (estimate). Based upon this estimate, the defendant would have owed the plaintiff $338,000 in alimony for 1995 if the marriage had been dissolved as of January 1, 1995.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because the parties remained married for exactly one half of 1995, however, the defendant was obligated to pay only one half of this amount, spread out over the six remaining months of 1995. This worked out to $28,166.67 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The estimate was, of course, nothing more than an approximation of the husband\u2019s gross earnings for 1995. This is where the accountant\u2019s letter comes in. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>agreement provides that, \u201c[w]ithin five days of March 31,1996, which is when the accountants will have completed the annual H. H. Brown audit and prepared the calculation of the defendant\u2019s gross earnings, [the defendant] shall send to the [plaintiff] the [accountant\u2019s] letter indicating the [defendant\u2019s] gross earnings for the prior year.\u201d If the accountant\u2019s letter discloses that the estimate was too low, then the defendant must pay the plaintiff the entirety of the difference between the estimate and his actual gross earnings by April 30,1996. If, on the other hand, the letter discloses that the estimate was too high, then the defendant is entitled to reduce his alimony payments for each of the remaining nine months between April, 1996, and December, 1996, by one ninth of the difference between the estimate and his actual gross earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Under the agreement, this cycle continues every year until the occurrence of one of several specified events that are not relevant to the present appeal. Each year, the estimate is replaced with the defendant\u2019s actual gross earnings for the prior year. Significantly, the annual recalculation occurs in April (i.e., after the accountant\u2019s letter has been released), rather than in January (i.e., after the defendant\u2019s taxable income is known).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">At the time of the dissolution, the plaintiffs attorney canvassed his client in order to assure the court that she understood the terms of the agreement. During this canvass, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\u201cQ. . . . [Y]ou\u2019re aware that we have . . . agreed to a definition of gross earnings?</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">\u201cA. Yes. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">\u201cQ. And you understand . . . that where [the defendant is] employed now, H. H. Brown, every year <em>an </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>independent certified audit is done and that\u2019s how he knows what he has \u2018earned, \u2019 </em>and you\u2019re going to receive a copy of that; you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u201cQ. And attached to this agreement ... is his compensation agreement [with H. H. Brown], which you are familiar with; are you not?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">\u201cQ. The alimony shall be based <em>only on these earnings </em>or wherever he\u2019s employed later and does not include any . . . investment income; do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">\u201cA. Yes. ...</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">\u201cQ. . . . [W]e\u2019re using [the estimate] to \u2014 to start the alimony and then, <em>depending on [the accountant\u2019s] letter . . </em>. [the defendant] may owe you a lump sum, or you may owe him some money back which he would take back . . . over the next nine months after you receive that letter; do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">\u201cA. Yes. Yes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">Every month between July, 1995, and March, 1996, the defendant made alimony payments to the plaintiff in the amount set forth in the agreement, namely, $28,166.67. Upon receiving the accountant\u2019s letter in 1996, the defendant claimed that the estimate substantially overstated his gross earnings for the prior year.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In a letter to the plaintiff dated eleven days prior to the deadline contained in the agreement, the defendant set forth a comprehensive explanation of how he would</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>comply with the terms of the agreement by reducing the alimony payments for the remainder of 1996.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Beginning in April, 1996, he reduced his alimony payments to $13,500.01 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>On May 2,1996, the plaintiff moved to have the defendant held in contempt of court on the ground that he should have recalculated the estimate of his 1995 gross earnings by reference to his taxable income for that year, <em>not </em>by reference to his earnings as reflected in the accountant\u2019s letter that was released in March of 1996. On September 20, 1996, the trial court, <em>Munro, J., </em>found the defendant in contempt for reducing his alimony payments to $13,500.01. The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s order of contempt. <em>Issler </em>v. <em>Issler, </em>50 Conn. App. 58, 72, 716 A.2d 938 (1998). This certified appeal followed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the defendant paid precisely what he should have paid, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">We begin with our standard of review. The agreement \u201cwas ordered incorporated . . . into the dissolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>decree. A judgment rendered in accordance with such a stipulation of the parties is to be regarded and construed as a contract. See <em>Kenworthy </em>v. <em>Kenworthy, </em>180 Conn. 129, 131, 429 A. 2d 837 <em>(1980); Albrecht v. Albrecht, </em>19 Conn. App. 146, 152, 562 A.2d 528, cert. denied, 212 Conn. 813, 565 A.2d 534 (1989).\u201d <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>214 Conn. 99, 109, 570 A.2d 690 (1990). Accordingly, \u201c[o]ur resolution of the [plaintiffs] claim is guided by the general principles governing the construction of contracts. A contract must be construed to effectuate the intent of the parties, which is determined from the language used interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction. . . . [T]he intent of the parties is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words and . . . the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract. . . . Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms. . . . <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Whitey\u2019s Frame Shop, </em>241 Conn. 678, 686, 697 A.2d 1137 (1997). Although ordinarily the question of contract interpretation, being a question of the parties\u2019 intent, is a question of fact . . . [w]here there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law. . . . <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>232 Conn. 272, 277, 654 A.2d 737 (1995); see <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Rioux, </em>229 Conn. 716, 740, 643 A.2d 1226 (1994), on appeal after remand, 38 Conn.

Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 752, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992); <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>207 Conn. 683, 689, 542 A.2d 1145 (1988); <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). <em>Morton Buildings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>222 Conn. 49, 53, 607 A.2d 424 (1992). . . . Under the circumstances of this case, because the trial court relied solely upon the written [agreement] in ascertaining the intent of the parties, the legal inferences properly to be drawn from the [document is a question] of law .... <em>Morton Buildings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>supra, 53-54. . . . See, e.g., <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>219 Conn. 51, 62, 591 A.2d 1231 (1991) (legal effect of [undisputed] facts is question of law); <em>Bria </em>v. <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, </em>153 Conn. 626, 632, 220 A.2d 29 (1966) (when surrounding circumstances are not in dispute, construction and legal effect of [agreement] is question of law).\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gateway Co. </em>v. <em>DiNoia, </em>232 Conn. 223, 229-30, 654 A.2d 342 (1995). In short, our resolution of the present appeal does not call upon us to go outside the four comers of the agreement, the language of which is clear and unambiguous.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, our standard of review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The plaintiff argues that the defendant should have recalculated the estimate of his 1995 gross earnings by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>reference to his taxable income for that year, <em>not </em>by reference to the accountant\u2019s letter that was released in March of 1996. In other words, the plaintiff argues that the defendant did not comply with the agreement by failing to pay alimony on income that he earned in 1994 and received from H. H. Brown several months prior to the date of the dissolution on June 30, 1995. The trial court and the Appellate Court both agreed with the plaintiff. We, however, are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">As discussed previously, article 2.5 of the agreement expressly provides that, \u201c[wjhile the [defendant] is employed by [H. H. Brown], the [defendant\u2019s] gross earnings will be determined by H. H. Brown\u2019s independent certified public accountant\u2019s letter which computes the compensation of [the defendant].\u201d The plaintiff ignores this language.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The plaintiffs omission is unavailing for the veiy simple reason that the agreement provides that the defendant\u2019s alimony obligations are calculated by reference to the accountant\u2019s letter that the plaintiff wants to ignore. The nuts and bolts of the defendant\u2019s alimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>obligations first appear in article 2.6 (A). This provision sets forth the parties\u2019 estimate of the defendant\u2019s 1995 gross earnings, then provides for a recalculation \u201c[w]ithin [five] days of March 31, 1996, <em>which is when the accountants will have completed the annual H. H. Brown audit and prepared the calculation of [the defendant\u2019s] gross earnings . . </em>. .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This recalculation in April of 1996 occurs as soon as information regarding H. H. Brown\u2019s profits for 1995\u2014 and, correlatively, the defendant\u2019s gross earnings for 1995 \u2014 becomes available. The recalculation in April of 1996 is obviously designed to ensure that the defendant\u2019s alimony payments for the prior year reflect the gross earnings disclosed in the accountant\u2019s letter.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> By its terms, the requirement of subsequent recalculations contained in article 2.6 (B) is likewise designed to ensure that the defendant\u2019s alimony payments for \u201ceach year commencing [with] 1996\u201d reflect the gross earnings disclosed in the accountant\u2019s letter released in March of the following year.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The agreement thus expressly provides that the accountant\u2019s letter released in 1996 governs the recalculation of the defendant\u2019s alimony obligations on his gross earnings for 1995 and that subsequent accountant\u2019s letters will govern the recalculation of his alimony obligations on his gross earnings for \u201ceach year commencing [with] 1996.\u201d The agreement does <em>not </em>state that the defendant must pay alimony on the taxable income that he earned in 1994 and received from H. H. Brown several months prior to the dissolution in 1995. In fact, that income was reflected in an accountant\u2019s letter released approximately one year <em>before </em>the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>accountant\u2019s letter that is referred to in the agreement. Accordingly, the plaintiffs claim that she is entitled to alimony on this income finds no support in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Significantly, the plaintiffs argument before this court contradicts her testimony before the trial court that presided over the dissolution of her marriage. During the colloquy with her own attorney shortly after she executed the agreement, the plaintiff made the following concessions: (1) the accountant\u2019s letter is \u201chow [the defendant] knows what he has \u2018earned\u2019 (2) she will receive a copy of the accountant\u2019s letter every year; (3) she is familiar with the defendant\u2019s compensation agreement with H. H. Brown; (4) the defendant\u2019s alimony obligations are based on the compensation agreement and, therefore, on the accountant\u2019s letter;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and (5) the estimate is revised annually based upon the accountant\u2019s letter. Our fundamental objective when construing a contract is to ascertain the intent of the parties. See, e.g., <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 277. This colloquy makes the parties\u2019 intent clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Moreover, one corollary of the plaintiffs argument that the accountant\u2019s letter is irrelevant is that much of the agreement is meaningless and superfluous. More specifically, neither the definition of \u201cgross earnings\u201d set forth in article 2.5 nor the nuts and bolts explanation of the defendant\u2019s alimony obligations set forth in article 2.6 makes any sense unless the accountant\u2019s letter is used to determine the defendant\u2019s alimony obligations. The fact that the plaintiffs argument renders much of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>the agreement meaningless supplies a further reason for rejecting her position. See, e.g., <em>Hatcho Corp. </em>v. <em>Della Pietra, </em>195 Conn. 18, 23, 485 A.2d 1285 (1985) (\u201c[p]arties generally do not insert meaningless provisions in their agreements and therefore every provision must be given effect if reasonably possible\u201d); <em>Barnard, </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 116 (same); see also <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Advest, Inc., </em>244 Conn. 732, 753, 714 A.2d 649 (1998) (\u201c \u2018contract . . . construed so as to give full meaning and effect to all of its provisions\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">If we were to accept the plaintiffs invitation to rip the thread of the accountant\u2019s letter from the fabric of the agreement, the whole agreement would unravel. Aside from the provisions that are expressly based upon the accountant\u2019s letter, the agreement does not contain any guidance on how to calculate the defendant\u2019s alimony obligations with respect to his complex compensation arrangement with H. H. Brown. We do not believe that the seasoned attorneys who drafted the sophisticated agreement would have failed to set forth a method for determining how to reckon with these funds. The implausibility of this scenario supplies an additional reason to decline the plaintiffs invitation to ignore the accountant\u2019s letter.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Another corollary of the plaintiffs argument is that she is asking for a windfall. When the parties entered into a division of their property in the middle of 1995, each party received 50 percent of the total assets. The sum that the plaintiff received included her portion of the incentive compensation that the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>earned in 1994 and that he had received in the beginning of 1995, several months prior to the date of the dissolution. Now, the plaintiff wants to receive alimony upon this money, even though she already has received her share of it as part of the property division. This windfall finds no support in either the terms of the agreement or basic principles of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">In short, the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the agreement makes sense, and the plaintiffs interpretation does not. Because the defendant\u2019s actions comported with the only sensible interpretation of the agreement, the trial court improperly found him in contempt of court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to vacate the trial court\u2019s order of contempt and to remand the case to the trial court to recalculate the defendant\u2019s alimony obligation consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\"> At the time of the dissolution, the defendant\u2019s annual base salary was $350,000 and his most recent incentive compensation payment was $952,643.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-9\"> The defendant\u2019s compensation agreement with H. H. Brown contains the following provision: \u201cYour compensation . . . will consist of an annual salary . . . plus [incentive compensation] based on 5% of the combined annual adjusted consolidated profits, before income taxes, of [H. H. Brown]. . . . The profits of [H. H. Brown] will be determined, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, by our auditors at the end of the calendar year. It usually takes until the following March to get the final results.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">The accountant\u2019s letter is always released in the first quarter of each year, usually in late February or March. In the interest of clarity, we wiE assume that the letter is always released in March.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b247-6\"> While the defendant\u2019s income for a given year is not known until the following March, the defendant may elect to receive' a portion of his anticipated incentive compensation during the course of that year, based upon estimated profits. Between 1990 and 1995 the defendant deferred receipt of an average of 47 percent of his earnings until after the accountants had completed their annual review. At the time when the parties were finalizing the agreement in June, 1995, the defendant had not yet received any incentive compensation whatsoever for services that he had rendered in 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\"> More specifically, article 2.2 of the agreement contains the following alimony schedule: \u201ca.

From <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>July 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995, the [plaintiff] shall receive 1/2 of $338,000 or $28,166.67 per month. Within 5 days of March 31, 1996, which is when the accountants will have completed the annual H. H. Brown audit and prepared the calculation of [the defendant\u2019s] gross earnings, the [defendant] shall send to the [plaintiff] the [accountant\u2019s] letter indicating the [defendant\u2019s] gross earnings for the prior year. For the period from July 1, 1995, to December 31, 1995, the total alimony due shall be determined as follows: the total alimony due pursuant to [article] 2.2 [see footnote 4] for the year 1995 multiplied by fifty percent (50%) minus the payments made for the period from July 1, 1995, to December 31, 1995.

The base alimony payments for each calendar year shall be determined by the gross earnings of the [defendant] for the prior year.

If the [defendant\u2019s] gross earnings are more than $1,250,000.00 he shall pay to the [plaintiff] . . . the difference between the total base alimony payments and the total alimony to be paid hereunder. The differential payment shall be paid to the [plaintiff] by April 30 of each year. In the event the [defendant\u2019s] monthly payments for January, February and March of each year based on $1,250,000.00 of assumed gross earnings were overpayments after the computation of his gross earnings by the certified public accountants, the [plaintiffs] alimony paid from April through December of that year shall be reduced by 1/9 each month of that overage. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b248-16\"> See footnote 4 of this opinion for the formula used to derive this amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b250-14\"> As discussed previously, the parties had estimated that the defendant\u2019s gross earnings in 1995 would be $1,250,000. According to the defendant, the accountant\u2019s letter revealed that his gross earnings in 1995 were, in fact, $842,354. For this reason, the defendant argues that he was entitled to recover $407,646, the difference between the estimate and the amount set forth in the accountant\u2019s letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b251-6\"> The letter provided as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u201cMarch 25, 199G</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Susan Issler 45 Turkey Hill Road Westport, CT 06880 Dear Susan,</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">As directed in our divorce agreement dated June 80, 1995, [articles] 2.5 and 2.6A, I am sending you this letter with attachments which are copies of the letter sent to me from [H.

Since my income for 1995 was $842,354, only sections a and b of [article] 2.2 apply.

Overpayment of Alimony Jan-Mar 1996</p>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">According to [article] 2.6B, I have paid you $28,166.67 per month for the first three months of 1996, which was based on assumed earnings of $1,250,000 as agreed. Since these monthly payments resulted in an overpayment, the alimony payments from Apr-Dee 1996 will be reduced by 1/9 each month of the overage. The calculation is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-17\">Actual Payments Jan-Mar 1996 = $28,166.67 x 3 = $84,500.01</p>\n<p id=\"b251-18\">Alimony Due Jan-Mar 1996 = 20,883.34 x 3 = -62,500.02</p>\n<p id=\"b251-19\">Total Overpayment 1996 -21,999.99</p>\n<p id=\"b251-20\">1/9 Adjustment /9</p>\n<p id=\"b251-21\">Reduction in Monthly Alimony $-2,444.44</p>\n<p id=\"b251-22\">Apr-Dee 1996</p>\n<p id=\"b251-23\">B.

Total alimony due for Jul-Dec 1995 was agreed to be determined as total alimony computed according to [article] 2.2, multiplied by 50%, minus payments I made. 1/9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>of the total overage was to be offset against alimony payments paid from Apr-Dee 1996.

This reliance is misplaced. Article 2.2 contains a general definition of gross earnings: \u201cGross earnings shall be defined as all income earned by the [defendant], <em>wherever he may be employed </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Article 2.2 contains no explanation for how the defendant should calculate his alimony obligations while he is employed by H. II. Brown. This explanation is contained in article 2.5, which sets forth a particular method of calculating gross earnings in the specific context of the defendant\u2019s sophisticated compensation arrangement with H. H. Brown: <em>\u201cWhile the [defendant] is employed by [H. H. Brown], </em>the [defendant\u2019s] gross earnings will be determined by H. H. Brown\u2019s independent certified public accountant\u2019s letter . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) For generations, it has been well settled that \u201cthe particular language of a contract must prevail over the general.\u201d <em>Miller Bros. Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., </em>113 Conn. 504, 514, 155 A. 709 (1931); see E. Farnsworth, Contracts (2d Ed. 1998) \u00a7 7.11, p. 285 and cases cited therein (\u201ca specific provision controls a general one and may operate as an exception to it\u201d); 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 203 (c) (1981) (\u201cspecific terms and exact terms are given greater weight than general language\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\"> If the parties had wanted to calculate the defendant\u2019s alimony obligations based upon his taxable income, they would not have timed the annual recalculation of the estimate to coincide with the release of the accountant\u2019s letter in March \u2014 several months <em>after </em>the defendant\u2019s taxable income is known.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\"> As discussed in footnote 2 of this opinion, the defendant\u2019s compensation agreement provides that his incentive compensation is based on the profits of H. II. Brown, which are set forth in the annual accountant\u2019s letters. Accordingly, the plaintiffs concession that the defendant\u2019s alimony obligations are based on his compensation agreement is equivalent to a concession that the defendant\u2019s alimony obligations are based on the accountant\u2019s letters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b258-8\"> The plaintiff claims that \u201cthe [trial] court had ample evidence that the [accountant\u2019s] letter on which the [defendant relied for his computation [of his alimony obligations in 1995] . . . was not the result of the type of \u2018independent\u2019 audit contemplated by the agreement.\u201d The trial court did not make such a factual finding, and it is not within our jurisdiction to do so of our own accord. Moreover, the plaintiff has not come forth with any reason to believe that the accountant\u2019s letter was inaccurate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b259-14\"> In light of this conclusion, we need not reach the remaining issues briefed by the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
