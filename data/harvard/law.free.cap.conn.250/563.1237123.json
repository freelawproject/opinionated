We reject both of the defendant\u2019s claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Between 3 and 3:30 a.m. on August 27, 1994, the defendant, while driving his gray Pontiac Grand Prix, approached Leanne Kollar on Middle Street in Bridgeport. Kollar, who was working as a prostitute, entered the defendant\u2019s car in anticipation of engaging in sex for money. The defendant drove around Bridgeport, eventually stopping on Salem Street. He turned off the engine and locked the doors to the vehicle. The defendant then began to choke Kollar, telling her that, if she removed her clothes, he would not hurt her. Kollar began to undress, and the defendant reclined her seat back and started to choke her again. Kollar managed to open the car door in an attempt to escape, and the defendant began hitting and punching her. They both rolled out of the car together, after which the defendant kneeled over Kollar and continued strangling her. After hitting the defendant and knocking the defendant\u2019s eyeglasses off his face, Kollar was able to flee to a nearby house. The defendant then drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">When the police arrived, Kollar gave them a description of the defendant and told the officers where the defendant lived, as she had been to his apartment on prior occasions. The police went to the defendant\u2019s apartment and waited for him to return. Meanwhile, the defendant returned to Middle Street and picked up Jennifer Williamson, another prostitute. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>drove to the comer of Maplewood and Laurel Avenues, where he and Williamson engaged in aphysical struggle. The defendant hit Williamson, bit her on the back and strangled her. During the stmggle, Williamson stopped moving and the defendant pushed her out of the car and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Sara Iza, a resident of Laurel Avenue, saw the defendant\u2019s car on Maplewood Avenue at approximately 5:30 a.m. on August 27, 1994. When her husband, Luis Iza, went outside to start his car at approximately 6 a.m., he saw Williamson\u2019s naked body lying in the street, in the same spot where Sara Iza had seen the defendant\u2019s car stop earlier. Malka Shah of the office of the chief medical examiner testified that Williamson died from asphyxia, which had been caused by strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">At his trial, the defendant raised the defenses of mental disease or defect<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, alternatively, extreme emotional disturbance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The jury rejected these defenses and found the defendant guilty of the murder of Williamson and the attempted murder and unlawful restraint of Kollar.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">On appeal, the defendant first claims that the trial court improperly excluded expert testimony from Margaret Cooney, a teacher of English as a second language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>at the University of Bridgeport, regarding the defendant\u2019s ability to comprehend the English language. The defendant claims that, because his native tongue is Arabic and he is limited in his ability to understand English, Cooney\u2019s testimony was relevant to shed light on the circumstances surrounding the statements he had given to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The following additional facts are relevant to the disposition of this claim. Before the trial began, the defendant moved to suppress his statements to the police, claiming, inter alia, that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his Miranda<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> rights, and that his statements were not voluntary. The circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s interview with the police are as follows. After the defendant returned home at approximately 5:45 a.m. on August 27, 1994, the police drove him to a local hospital, where Kollar identified him as her assailant. The police then drove the defendant to the police station and, later that day, brought him into an interview room and read him his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The defendant stated that he understood his rights and signed a waiver form. During questioning about the incident involving Kollar, the defendant admitted that he had picked up a woman that morning and had tried to have sex with her, but when she mentioned that she wanted money, the defendant had told her that he does not \u201cpay money for sex.\u201d The defendant admitted that an altercation ensued, and that the woman had fled the vehicle. Prior to questioning the defendant about the incident involving Williamson, the detectives read the defendant his <em>Miranda </em>warnings again, and had asked him to sign another <em>Miranda </em>waiver form, which he did. The defendant then admitted that he had picked up another woman, and that they also had fought over money. The defendant stated that he had struggled with her in the car and, when she appeared to be unconscious, he removed her from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>car and left her on the pavement. After giving this information to the police, the defendant agreed to go over the incidents again with a tape recorder in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">At the suppression hearing, Cooney testified -with respect to the defendant\u2019s grasp of the English language. She stated that, after the defendant had been arrested, she administered a generally accepted achievement test to the defendant. The test results indicated that, while the defendant\u2019s conversational English was good, his ability to comprehend written English was \u201c[v]ery, very poor.\u201d Cooney also testified that she had reviewed the notice of rights form that the defendant had signed before giving his statements to the police. She stated that, based upon the defendant\u2019s performance on the standardized test she administered, the defendant probably had not understood many of the words included in the waiver form. Specifically, Cooney concluded that the defendant would not understand the meaning of \u201cauthorize,\u201d \u201cconsent,\u201d \u201cvoluntarily,\u201d \u201cconstitutional\u201d and \u201cwaiver.\u201d Cooney also stated that she had reviewed the tape recording of the defendant\u2019s interview with the police and found it significant that he had answered \u201cyes\u201d to every question when the police officers asked him if he understood his rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cooney stated that \u201cit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>is very common for people of limited English abilities to answer yes to every question\u201d that they do not understand. She concluded that the defendant \u201cprobably . . . did not understand\u201d the waiver form that he had signed before speaking with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his statements. The court concluded that the state had met its burden of proving that the defendant \u201cunderstood [his rights] and intelligently waived them.\u201d The court further concluded that the defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary because there was \u201cnothing coercive or threatening in the [officers\u2019] conduct . . . .\u201d The admissibility of the defendant\u2019s statements to the police is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">At trial, the defendant attempted to offer Cooney as a witness and the state filed a motion in limine to exclude her testimony.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant argued that Cooney\u2019s testimony would demonstrate that, in making his statements to the police, the defendant merely went along with the version of events fed to him by the police, and that it would shed light on the \u201cphysical and psychological environment that yielded the [defendant\u2019s] confession . . . .\u201d <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 683, 689, 106 S. Ct. 2142, 90 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion to exclude Cooney\u2019s testimony. Distinguishing <em>Crane, </em>the court concluded that Cooney\u2019s testimony did not shed light on the physical and psychological circumstances under which the defendant made his statements to the police, but, instead, concerned the defendant\u2019s understanding and waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly excluded Cooney\u2019s testimony, which was relevant under <em>Crane. </em>The state counters that Cooney\u2019s testimony was not relevant to any issue before the jury. We need not resolve this issue, however, because we conclude that, even if the evidence was relevant, the court\u2019s ruling excluding Cooney\u2019s testimony was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">In <em>Crane, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the accused improperly was prohibited from presenting evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding his confession. Id. The court also stated that \u201cthe erroneous ruling of the court is subject to harmless error analysis.\u201d Id., 691, citing <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986). \u201cThe correct inquiry is whether, assuming that the damaging potential of the [court\u2019s ruling] were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>supra, 684.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The defendant in this case claims constitutional error based on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number><em>Crane.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We, therefore, require the state to establish any such error to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 482, 680 A.2d 147 (1996) (state bears burden of proving constitutional error was harmless beyond reasonable doubt); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavell, </em>235 Conn. 711, 720, 670 A.2d 261 (1996) (same); see <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967). \u201cWhether ... an error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a host of factors, all readily accessible to reviewing courts. These factors include the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>supra, 475 U.S. 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">We conclude that the state has met its burden and has demonstrated that the error, if any, of excluding Cooney\u2019s testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Cooney\u2019s testimony was not important either to the defendant\u2019s case or the state\u2019s case. The record reveals that the defendant did not contest the fact that Kollar and Williamson were in his car with him on separate occasions that night, nor that he had had altercations with both of them. His defense consisted of testimony concerning his mental state. At trial, James Merikangas, a psychiatrist and neurologist called by the defendant, testified concerning the validity of the defendant\u2019s statements to the police, stating that they resulted from confabulation, which is a \u201cmental defect where [by] someone who has a poor or missing memory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>thinks that they have a memory and will tell you what happened when it didn\u2019t. ... It is a false memory. It is not a lie. It is a belief the patient has which simply has no basis in fact.\u201d Merikangas then concluded that \u201c[the defendant] was really not aware of what was happening, and that if there were statements made later, either confabulation or things that had been told to him, that [the defendant] was not the most reliable witness at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">With respect to the issue of the defendant\u2019s mental state, there was no indication that Cooney, who was not a psychiatrist, would testify that the defendant\u2019s statements resulted from confabulation or repetition. Cooney\u2019s testimony that people with minimal English speaking abilities tend to answer \u201cyes\u201d to questions they do not understand would not have supported his defense because Cooney would have testified that the terms the defendant did not understand related to his <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s statements to the police, which consisted of questions and answers, contained no such terms; the questions were narrative and descriptive, and the defendant often answered \u201cno\u201d to those questions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Cooney\u2019s testimony would not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>been important to the issue of the defendant\u2019s mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>state because the focus of Cooney\u2019s testimony was on an entirely different issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">As to the evidence at trial of the defendant\u2019s English language abilities, the jury heard testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s ability to converse in English and listened to the tape recording of the defendant\u2019s interview with the police. Inspector John F. Solomon of the office of the state\u2019s attorney, who participated in the interview of the defendant, stated that, while the defendant had an accent, it \u201cappeared evident that he understood what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>was being asked of him.\u201d Lieutenant Richard Petitte of the Bridgeport police detective bureau stated that, in his conversations with the defendant regarding his statements, the defendant did not have a hard time understanding English words. To the contrary, Isam Araboghli, a Mend of the defendant, testified that the detectives had told him that they did not understand the defendant very well, and Merikangas described the defendant as \u201ca man that doesn\u2019t understand or speak English very well . . . .\u2019\u2019If Cooney had testified, she would have stated that the defendant\u2019s oral English skills were good. Cooney\u2019s testimony, at best, would have bolstered the testimony of Solomon and Petitte.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Moreover, the overall strength of the state\u2019s evidence was overwhelming. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 20, 105 S. Ct. 1038, 84 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1985) (error in prosecutor\u2019s remarks harmless due to overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt). Bridgeport detectives testified that, when they searched the defendant\u2019s vehicle pursuant to a warrant, they had found women\u2019s clothing on the floor of the front passenger seat. Kollar identified some of the clothing found in the defendant\u2019s car as her own, and she made an in-court identification of the defendant as her assailant. Williamson\u2019s boyfriend testified that he had seen Williamson enter the defendant\u2019s car that night, and that it was the last time he saw her alive. He also identified some of the clothing found in the defendant\u2019s vehicle as that which Williamson had been wearing on the night of her murder. Luis Iza discovered Williamson\u2019s body in the exact location where his wife, Sara Iza, had seen the defendant\u2019s car. In addition, the police had found identical brown stains, which appeared to be vomit, on Williamson\u2019s body and in the defendant\u2019s vehicle. The autopsy revealed that there were bite marks on Williamson\u2019s back, and a forensic odontologist testified that the structure of the defendant\u2019s teeth was consistent with those marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that any error in excluding Cooney\u2019s testimony was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court improperly denied his supplemental request to charge the jury that, in considering the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance, the victim need not be the cause of the perpetrator\u2019s distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to the resolution of the defendant\u2019s second claim. At trial, the defendant adduced testimony establishing that, three months prior to the assaults, his wife had been shot in the chest during a robbery at a convenience store and she had remained hospitalized with serious injuries. He also presented evidence that, one week prior to his arrest, he had been attacked by an unknown individual and that the resulting injury required fifty-two stitches in his back. There was testimony that, on the night in question, the defendant had been drinking heavily and was very upset about the recent loss of his passport. Merikangas testified that the defendant also suffered from brain damage, hypoglycemia and epilepsy. Merikangas further testified that alcohol interferes with an epileptic\u2019s ability to modulate behavior, and that the combination of low blood sugar and alcohol could inhibit the nervous system to the extent that a person \u201cwould not know what he was doing.\u201d Merikangas concluded that, based upon all the stresses in his life at the time, the defendant was suffering from extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the incidents. The state then offered Karen Brody, a psychiatrist, as a rebuttal witness. Brody acknowledged the stresses in the defendant\u2019s life, but concluded that the defendant did not act under extreme emotional disturbance. Brody also testified that she was not aware of any case in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>which violence caused by extreme emotional disturbance was directed toward a third person who did not cause the underlying stresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Defense counsel then stated in closing argument: \u201cWell, I would submit to you the court will charge you on extreme emotional disturbance, and you can listen to the judge\u2019s charge and find out whether or not in order to qualify for that legal concept it is necessary for the person who explodes to explode against the person who is causing the problem or against someone who happens to be there after they brood for a long time and then explode as if without any provocation.\u201d Outside the presence of the jury, the court informed counsel that, in giving its charge on extreme emotional disturbance, it did not intend to address whether the victim must be the cause of the stress. The defendant then submitted a supplemental request to charge that provided: \u201cIn considering the defense of extreme emotional disturbance, it is not necessary that the victim(s) of the Defendant\u2019s acts be the person who caused the emotional distress to the Defendant. The law provides that the defense is available to the Defendant even when a third party who is unconnected to the cause of the emotional disturbance, is the victim of the Defendant\u2019s act.\u201d The court refused to give this instruction, concluding that its intended charge<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> was legally accurate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>that the element of \u201creasonableness\u201d addressed the substance of the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">On appeal, the defendant contends that, while the trial court\u2019s instruction was legally correct, it misled the jury by failing to address whether extreme emotional disturbance must be caused by the victim of the crime. Because defense counsel already had told the jury that the court might provide guidance on whether the victim must be the cause of extreme emotional disturbance, the absence of any instruction on this issue was reversible error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">\u201c[A] request to charge which is relevant to the issues of [a] case and which is an accurate statement of the law must be given.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>240 Conn. 766, 781, 695 A.2d 525 (1997). \u201cA refusal to charge in the exact words of a request will not constitute error if the requested charge is given in substance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gant, </em>231 Conn. 43, 47, 646 A.2d 835 (1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1038, 115 S. Ct. 1404, 131 L. Ed. 2d 291 (1995). \u201cA jury instruction is constitutionally adequate if it provides the jurors with a clear understanding of the elements of the crime charged, and affords them proper guidance for their determination of whether those elements were present.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>supra, 781. \u201cThe test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>231 Conn. 484, 494, 651 A.2d 247 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s instruction on extreme emotional disturbance did not mislead the jury or result in any injustice. The court adequately instructed the jury on the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance and did not imply, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>any manner, that the extreme emotional disturbance must be caused by the victim. The court instructed the jury: \u201cIt is your responsibility as the trier of fact to decide to what extent, if any, the defendant\u2019s emotions governed his conduct at the time of the death of . . . Williamson. In reaching this decision, you may consider all of the feelings which you find in fact influenced the defendant\u2019s conduct, for example, passion, anger, distress, grief, resentment, fright, hatred, excessive agitation, or other emotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\"><em>\u201cWhile the emotional disturbance need not necessarily have been a spontaneous or sudden occurrence or caused by any particular provoking event, indeed [it] may have simmered in the defendant\u2019s mind for [a] long period of time, the disturbance must actually have influenced his conduct at the time of the killing.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The court\u2019s charge made clear that the \u201cprovoking event\u201d need not cause a \u201cspontaneous or sudden\u201d emotional disturbance, and that such a disturbance \u201cmay have simmered in the defendant\u2019s mind for [a] long period of time . . . .\u201d The reference to an \u201cevent\u201d as a cause and the long, <em>simmering </em>nature of such a disturbance suited the defendant\u2019s evidence. It removed any possibility that the jury mistakenly would believe that the victim, rather than the circumstances, contemporaneously must have caused the defendant\u2019s disturbance for the defense of extreme emotional disturbance to apply. Furthermore, Brody\u2019s testimony that she never had seen a case in which the victim did not cause the disturbance was merely testimony and not an instruction as to the law.
