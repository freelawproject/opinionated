On January 7, 1997, the parties entered into a stipulation of facts, which they submitted to the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner (commissioner) for consideration of the following issue: whether the plaintiffs injury and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder combat fatigue syndrome (PTSD/CFS) is compensable. Thereafter, the commissioner adopted these facts and issued the following decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u201cFINDING OF DISMISSAL</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">\u201cOn January 9, 1997 the [defendants<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] forwarded to the Seventh District office of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission a Stipulation of Facts signed by both parties, and based upon the same, the following facts are found:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">\u201c1. On or about June 8, 1994, a contract of employment existed between the [plaintiff], William Biasetti, and the [defendant], City of Stamford.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">\u201c2. The [plaintiff] has a temporary total disability rate of $638.00 and a permanent partial disability rate of $529.00 as a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">\u201c3. The [plaintiff] is married with no eligible dependents and has a date of birth of December 4, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>\u201c4. On June 8, 1994, the [plaintiff], while working for the [defendant] in his capacity as a police officer, was involved in a high-speed pursuit. The pursuit came to an end in the Town of Fairfield, Connecticut, and a gun battle pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u201c5. As a result of this pursuit on June 8, 1994, the [plaintiff] was instructed by his supervisor to go to Stamford Hospital for medical treatment with regard to the injuries suffered due to the gun battle.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u201c6. As a direct result of the gun battle, the [plaintiff] suffered from headaches, upset stomach, a pressure sensation in his right calf and upper leg, and [PTSD/ CFS].</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u201c7. The [plaintiff] came under the care of Dr. H. Martin Fuchs of Norwalk, Connecticut, and is still being treated by Dr. Fuchs for the headaches and stomach cramps.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u201c8. The [plaintiff] was referred to Dr. Steven A. Garrett of Norwalk, Connecticut, with regard to the pressure sensation of his right calf and upper leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">\u201c9. The [plaintiff] was referred to Dr. Patricia Otis Cook, a psychologist in Darien, Connecticut. The [plaintiff] saw Dr. Cook until about August 15, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">\u201c10. Dr. Cook referred the [plaintiff] to Dr. Joel Albert, a psychiatrist in Weston, Connecticut. The [plaintiff] is still [being treated] and under the care of Dr. Albert.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">\u201c11. All medical and hospital and incidental expenses relating to the treatment of the [plaintiffs] disability and injuries have been paid by the [defendant].</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">\u201c12. The [plaintiff] claims that the injury and treatment of [PTSD/CFS] is an occupational disease as defined by [General Statutes \u00a7] 31-275 (15). [PTSD/CFS] is a disease peculiar to the occupation of apolice officer, in which the [plaintiff] was engaged and due to causes in excess of the ordinary hazards of employment as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>\u201c13. On March 7, 1996, the [plaintiff] claimant was operating the [defendant\u2019s] vehicle in transporting a prisoner to Stamford police department headquarters. While in the vehicle, the [plaintiff] became dizzy and lightheaded, stopped the vehicle and blacked out.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u201c14. On March 7, 1996, as a result of the blackout, the [plaintiff] was sent by his supervisor to Stamford Hospital as to his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\u201c15. The [plaintiff] came under the care of Dr. Robert LaBarre, a cardiologist in Stamford, Connecticut, and treated with Dr. LaBarre.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\u201c16. The injury of March 7, 1996, is considered a manifestation of the June 8,1994 [PTSD/CFS], for which the [plaintiff] is still under the care of Dr. Joel Albert.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">\u201c17. It is undisputed that all physical complaints suffered by the [plaintiff] are symptoms of his [PTSD].</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">\u201c18. The [defendants] contend that the [plaintiffs] [PTSD] is non compensable pursuant to [General Statutes \u00a7] 31-275 (16) (B) (ii).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">\u201cBased upon the foregoing stipulated facts, I Find, Order and Decree that . . . the [plaintiffs] . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>[PTSD/CFS] is not compensable under [General Statutes \u00a7] 31-275 (16) (B) (ii) and therefore this matter is DISMISSED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Subsequently, the plaintiff filed a motion to correct the commissioner\u2019s findings, asking the commissioner to delete his conclusion that PTSD/CFS is not compensable under \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii) and insert in its place a conclusion that the plaintiff had \u201cset forth a prima facie case that [PTSD/CFS] is an \u2018occupational disease\u2019 under ... \u00a7 31-275 (15) and therefore is entitled to all benefits under the [act] . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Following the commissioner\u2019s denial of that motion, the plaintiff appealed to the workers\u2019 compensation review board (board), claiming that the commissioner\u2019s failure to make the proposed substitute finding had been improper \u201cbecause such facts [had been] admitted and undisputed.\u201d He further challenged the commissioner\u2019s conclusion as being \u201clegally inconsistent with the subordinate facts found\u201d in that the order dismissing his claim failed to consider the \u201cundisputed facts that the [plaintiff] incurred a mental, physical type injury . . . [and that] said injury has always been compensable and continues to be compensable under our present system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The board, in a two to one decision, affirmed the dismissal. Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed from the decision of the board to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Before reaching the merits of the plaintiffs appeal, we reiterate the standards governing our review of decisions by the compensation review board. \u201c[W]hen a decision of a commissioner is appealed to the [board], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>the [board] is obligated to hear the appeal on the record of the hearing before the commissioner and not to retry the facts. <em>Fairy. People's Savings Bank, </em>207 Conn. 535, 538-39, 542 A.2d 1118 (1988). The commissioner has the power and duty, as the trier of fact, to determine the facts. <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 435, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988). The conclusions drawn by him from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. <em>Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/Norden Division, </em>[177 Conn. 107, 118, 411 A.2d 924 (1979)]. . . . Our scope of review of the actions of the review [board] is similarly limited. <em>DeBarros </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>21 Conn. App. 107, 110, 572 A.2d 69 [cert. denied, 215 Conn. 808, 576 A.2d 538 (1990)].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vanzant </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>219 Conn. 674, 677, 594 A.2d967 (1991). \u201cWhere, however, the appeal involves an issue of statutory construction that has not yet been subjected to judicial scrutiny, this court has plenary power to review the administrative decision. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>232 Conn. 311, 317, 654 A.2d 1221 (1995) (state agency not entitled to special deference when its construction of statute has not undergone previous judicial scrutiny).\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>241 Conn. 692, 697, 699 A.2d 52 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The first issue we address is whether the plaintiff suffered from an occupational disease. The term \u201coccupational disease\u201d is specifically defined as including \u201cany disease peculiar to the occupation in which the employee was engaged and due to causes in excess of the ordinary hazards of employment as such . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (15). Although we recognize the public policy implications of this case, the first issue presented is, at bottom, a matter of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>construction. We decide this issue mindful both of general principles of statutory construction and of principles specifically applicable to workers\u2019 compensation law. As a general matter, \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994). We discern that intent by looking to the statutory language, to legislative history and policy and to other legislation and common-law principles. See id., 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">In <em>Glodenis </em>v. <em>American Brass Co., </em>118 Conn. 29, 40, 170 A. 146 (1934), this court analyzed the statutory language requiring an occupational disease to be \u201c \u2018peculiar to the occupation in which the employee was engaged and due to causes in excess of the ordinary hazards of employment as such\u2019 \u201d and concluded that to be within the definition, the disease need not \u201cbe one which arises solely out of the particular kind of employment in which the employee is engaged, nor that it ... be due to causes in excess of the ordinary hazards of that particular kind of employment. Otherwise the definition would exclude most diseases .... The phrase \u2018peculiar to the occupation\u2019 is not here used in the sense that the disease must be one which originates exclusively from the particular kind of employment in which the employee is engaged, but rather in the sense that the conditions of that employment must result in a hazard which distinguishes it in character from the general ran of occupations; see Oxford Dictionary; Funk &amp; Wagnalls Dictionary; and the phrase \u2018employment as such\u2019 means employment in general.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">More recently, we reiterated that, in interpreting the phrase \u201coccupational disease,\u201d \u201c \u2018the requirement that the disease be \u201cpeculiar to the occupation\u201d and \u201cin excess of the ordinary hazards of employment,\u201d refers to those diseases in which there is a causal connection between the duties of the employment and the disease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>contracted by the employee. In other words, [the disease] need not be unique to the occupation of the employee or to the work place; it need merely be \u201cso distinctively associated with the employee\u2019s occupation that there is a direct causal connection between the duties of the employment and the disease contracted.\u201d \u2019 <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>221 Conn. 29, 35, 602 A.2d 560 (1992).\u201d <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>227 Conn. 333, 352, 630 A.2d 1027 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In the present case, the workplace circumstances that caused the plaintiffs PTSD/CFS reasonably can be said to be \u201cpeculiar to\u201d his occupation as a police officer. A \u201cgun battle,\u201d the incident to which the parties stipulated, is not a common occurrence in most of the working world. Indeed, the plaintiffs PTSD/CFS is \u201cdistinctively associated with\u201d his particular occupation as a police officer. See id. Thus, it can be said that the plaintiffs PTSD/CFS was an occupational disease because his job and experiences as a police officer were more likely to cause this stress disorder \u201cthan would other kinds of employment carried on under the same conditions.\u201d <em>Madeo </em>v. <em>I. Dibner &amp; Bro., Inc., </em>121 Conn. 664, 667, 186 A. 616 (1936); see <em>Discuillo </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster, </em>242 Conn. 570, 579, 698 A.2d 873 (1997) (painter cannot claim heart attack as occupational injury because both mental and physical stresses of painting were no more likely to cause heart attack than other kinds of employment under same circumstances); <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 353 (music teacher could not claim mental injury as occupational disease where injury based upon false charges of sexual misconduct by student, because such allegations \u201ccould arise in numerous occupational settings\u201d); <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 37 (hepatitis was occupational disease where dental hygienist was \u201cat a particular risk of contracting [hepatitis] because of [her] contact with blood and other secretions\u201d). Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>because the plaintiffs PTSD/CFS, which was caused by a gun battle, \u201coccupied a definite relationship to the [plaintiffs] occupation,\u201d we conclude that it was an. occupational disease.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The next issue to be decided is whether the plaintiffs PTSD/CFS was compensable. We decide this issue, again, mindful both of general principles of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>construction and of principles specifically applicable to workers\u2019 compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The defendant claims that, in the absence of a physical injury, the plaintiffs PTSD/CFS was not compensable based upon \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii), which excludes \u201cmental or emotional impairment, unless such impairment arises from a physical injury or occupational disease.\u201d The plaintiff asserted that his claim is not a \u201cmental-mental\u201d claim \u2014 that is, a mental disease giving rise to a mental impairment \u2014 but rather is a \u201cmental-physical\u201d claim \u2014 a claim that has a mental stimulus that causes a physical injury. In affirming the commissioner\u2019s decision, the board agreed with the defendant that the plaintiff had failed to establish a physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Additionally, the board concluded that, in amending \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii) to eliminate from the definition of personal injury \u201ca mental or emotional impairment, unless such impairment arises from a physical injury or occupational disease\u201d; Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228, \u00a7 1; the clear intent of the legislature was to eliminate any occupational disease that does not have a physical component. Specifically, the board stated that \u201c[i]n order to constitute an occupational disease, the [plaintiffs PTSD/CFS] must [have] originate [d] from a physical trauma, or some other occupational disease that was caused by a tangible physical stimulus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">In <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 333, the defendant had challenged the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that a mental injury unaccompanied by a physical component was compensable under General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-294, and argued, instead, that the physical component is essential. We disagreed. First, we turned to \u00a7 31-275, which used the term \u201cinjury\u201d without limitation. Id., 359. Next, finding no cases that had interpreted the statute to include the proposed limitation, we determined that the court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>never hypothesized that mental injury alone could not be the subject of compensation provided that it is causally connected to the employee\u2019s work. Id. We then consulted decisions by the compensation review division, the agency entrusted with interpreting and enforcing the act, which held to the contrary. Id., citing <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Brink\u2019s, Inc., </em>5 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 115 (1988); <em>Zipoli </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>3 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 23 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In <em>Crochiere, </em>we then stated: \u201cThe injuries compensated by the act axe not only those for which an action lay under the common law, but all injuries arising out of and in the course of the employment of the injured. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>American Steel &amp; Wire Co., </em>90 Conn. 349, 375, 97 A. 345 (1916). Injury, as stated throughout the act is not defined exclusively as physical injury. Neither are the words incapacity or disability when used in the statute confined exclusively to somatic conditions. <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Brink\u2019s, Inc., </em>supra, [5 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op.] 116. The absence of such limiting language in the rest of the statute, in contrast to the inclusion of such limiting language in General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-349, precluding liability under that section from being transferred if the previous impairment is mental or emotional, reflects the legislative intent. [I]n reliance on the classic inclusio unius [est] exclusio alterius argument, (we conclude) that had the legislature wished to restrict compensable incapacity only to those occasions when some physical element was involved, it would have included in other chapter 568 sections similar restrictive language to that used in \u00a7 31-349. Id.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 359-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Additionally, we looked to Professor Arthur Larson, who, in his treatise, \u201cdiscusses three categories of cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>that address the various mental, nervous and stress conditions for which workers\u2019 compensation claims are routinely made: mental stimulus causing physical injury; physical trauma causing nervous injury; and mental stimulus causing nervous injury [mental-mental cases], 1B A. Larson, The Law of Workmens\u2019 Compensation (1992) \u00a7 42.20, p. 7-813.\u201d <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 360. Having found compensability in the first two groups; see <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>204 Conn. 104, 527 A.2d 664 (1987); <em>Sgrilla, </em>v. <em>Hertz Construction Co., </em>124 Conn. 6, 197 A. 754 (1938); we turned to the growing majority position among other jurisdictions supporting compensability in Larson\u2019s third category. We noted that, \u201cin fact, only eight states have expressly ruled out liability in any kind of mental-mental case. 1B A. Larson, supra, \u00a7 42.25 (d), p. 7-963.\u201d <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 362. Based upon then recent developments in toil law reflecting a broadening of the definition of a compensable injury to include emotional distress; <em>Montinieri </em>v. <em>Southern, New England Telephone Co., </em>175 Conn. 337, 344, 398 A.2d 1180 (1978); and a refusal \u201cto subject a claim of mental suffering ... to stricter scrutiny or greater care than a claim of physical suffering evidenced by the same type of complaints\u201d; <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Lovallo, </em>2 Conn. App. 579, 589, 481 A.2d 1286 (1984); we held \u201cthat mental disorders, even if not accompanied by physical trauma to the body, constitute an injury under the act.\u201d <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">While our decision in <em>Crochiere </em>was pending, the legislature, as part of a major revision of the act, enacted No. 93-228, \u00a7 1, of the 1993 Public Acts, now codified at \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii), which provides in pertinent part: \u201c(B) \u2018Personal injury\u2019 or \u2018injury\u2019 shall not be construed to include . . . (ii) A mental or emotional impairment, unless such impairment arises from a physical injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>or occupational disease . . . .\u2019\u2019In reliance on certain comments contained in the legislative history,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the board in the present case interpreted this legislative action to forbid the \u201cmental-mental\u201d claims included by <em>Crochiere. </em>The one dissenting member of the board disagreed, focusing on the remedial nature of the act as well as on the language in the Public Act \u201cor <em>occupational </em>disease\u201d (mental or emotional impairment is not a personal injury, \u201cunless such impairment arises from a physical injury <em>or occupational </em>disease\u201d). (Emphasis in original.) \u201cRather than defining \u2018occupational disease\u2019 in terms of the absence of a mental impairment claim, the [a]ct does the opposite: it permits a mental impairment to be recognized as a personal injury if the impairment arises from an occupational disease. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>should not take it upon ourselves to adopt a more exclusionary definition in light of the humanitarian purpose of the [a]ct . . . .\u201d Citing to <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 698-700 (accidental exposure to contagious disease, though it had not been contracted by claimant, constitutes an injury, even in absence of puncture or other outward sign) for its discussion of the breadth of the definition of physical injury, the dissent rejected the limitations imposed by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We need not determine, however, whether \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii) eliminated a \u201cmental-mental\u201d claim in order to decide the present case. Even if we were to assume, without deciding, that the legislature did <em>not </em>intend to eliminate \u201cmental-mental\u201d cases,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a review of the plain language of the statute as applied to the facts of this case is dispositive of the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Section 31-275 (16) (B) (ii) includes within the definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d an emotional impairment that <em>arises from </em>or is caused by a physical injury or occupational disease. It does not, however, extend coverage to an emotional impairment <em>which itself is </em>an occupational disease. To conclude otherwise would be to ignore the causation requirement encompassed within the term \u201carises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The physical symptomology of which the plaintiff complains is associated with PTSD. Indeed, the parties stipulated that the plaintiffs physical complaints constitute symptoms of his mental impairment. Although a mental impairment may give rise to a distinct and separate \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d such as a heart attack or stroke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>precipitated by mental stressors, the plaintiff in the present case seeks to extend coverage to mental ailments that produce concomitant physical symptoms. Essentially, the plaintiff seeks this court to extend coverage to an emotional impairment which is <em>itself </em>an occupational disease, thereby ignoring the causation requirement of the term \u201carises.\u201d We agree with the defendant that the legislature intended not to extend coverage to an emotional impairment that <em>is itself </em>an occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Virtually all psychiatric pathologies have attendant somatic symptoms. For example, five of the diagnostic criteria for major depression are physical symptoms including significant weight loss, insomnia, psychomotor agitation, fatigue and diminished ability to think or concentrate.

Similarly, the diagnostic criteria for, or \u201csymptoms\u201d of, a panic disorder include the presence of panic attacks that are marked by heart palpitations, sweating, trembling or shaking, feelings of choking, chest pain or discomfort, nausea or abdominal stress, dizziness, lightheadedness, paresthesia and chills or hot flashes.

Kennedy </em>v. <em>Frauwirth, </em>167 Conn. 165, 168, 355 A.2d 39 (1974). Courts must presume that the General Assembly did not intend to enact useless legislation. <em>Bergner </em>v. <em>State, </em>144 Conn. 282, 287, 130 A.2d 293 (1957).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Heggelund, </em>219 Conn. 620, 625-26, 594 A.2d 464 (1991). Because mental impairments often carry attendant physical symptoms; see Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, supra, p. 327; by specifically including the term \u201carise from\u201d in \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii), the legislature must have intended something more than the causal connection generally associated with the \u201ctime, place and circumstances of the injury\u201d inquiry required to fall within the exclusive coverage of the act. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Spatafore </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>239 Conn. 408, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>418, 684 A.2d 1155 (1996). To conclude that physical <em>symptoms </em>of mental impairments are not excluded from coverage under the act would, at best, be to radically dilute the term \u201carise from,\u201d if not render it entirely superfluous. Such an interpretation would effectively result in virtually all psychiatric disabilities or mental impairments being covered, <em>regardless </em>of whether the impairment arises from a physical injury or an occupational disease. We therefore reject it.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In this opinion, CALLAHAN, C. J., and BORDEN, NORCOTT and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b100-7\">MCDONALD, J., with whom BERDON, J., joins,</author>\n<p id=\"AXG\">dissenting. Although I agree with part II of the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>opinion, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs injuries are not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The basis for the majority\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs injuries are not compensable is that, because his disabling combat fatigue <em>is, itself, </em>an occupational disease, it does not <em>\u201carise from,\u201d </em>an occupational disease. Such a narrow reading of the definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d; see General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (16); does not effectuate the remedial purposes behind the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act). See, e.g., <em>Green </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>245 Conn. 66, 71, 712 A.2d 938 (1998); <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Sherwood Industries, Inc., </em>244 Conn. 502, 511, 710 A.2d 1338 (1998). I do not believe that the term \u201carises from,\u201d found in \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii), bars the plaintiffs recovery, as his disability does arise from an occupational disease. I would hold that the plaintiffs injuries, which include mental anguish with physical manifestations or symptoms, are compensable because they <em>arise from </em>an occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The majority dismisses the plaintiffs claim that his combat fatigue syndrome is compensable, concluding that the plaintiffs claim is merely a \u201cmental claim with attendant symptoms.\u201d Footnote 12 of the majority opinion. According to the majority, the plaintiffs headaches, upset stomach, dizziness and blackout episode are not physical injuries because they are \u201csymptoms\u201d of combat fatigue. In footnote 7 of its opinion, the majority suggests that, if the plaintiff suffered a heart attack arising from his condition, such an injury would be compensable. The distinction between a blackout, which the majority characterizes as a physical symptom, and a heart attack, which the majority finds to be a compensable physical injury, escapes me. The majority would have us distinguish between a physical symptom \u2014 a sign or indication of a disease \u2014 and a physical disability that arises from that disease. Logically, a physical symptom must be a result of that disease, or else <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>it would be a symptom of some other condition. If that symptom causes a disability, which it clearly does in this case, then it should be compensable. In effect, the majority states that there can be no compensation unless the disability for which the worker seeks compensation is different than the symptoms through which the occupational disease manifests itself. The majority peels a grape<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to deny compensation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">It is clear from the legislative history of Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228, codified at General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq., that the legislature did not intend to exclude disabilities such as the plaintiffs disability from compensation. In discussing the part of the proposed legislation dealing with mental or emotional impairment, Representative Christopher G. Donovan mentioned the case of a female correction officer who had been sexually assaulted at work, but who had suffered no physical injury. 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 18, 1993 Sess., p. 6153. Representative Donovan explained: \u201cThe prisoner grabbed [the correction officer\u2019s] body \u2014 various parts, ripped her clothes and engaged in a tussle. She was able to subdue the prisoner, close the door and receive some assistance. . . . [T]here was no physical injury at the time. There was contact, but no physical injury.\u201d Id., p. 6154. The correction officer suffered emotional damage as a result of the attack, however. Id., p. 6153. The representatives agreed that, in this situation, the correction officer would receive compensation for her mental anguish related to the attack. See id., pp. 6155-56. Representative Michael P. Lawlor stated: \u201cIn my opinion, there is a physical injury there, although if she was touched and physically assaulted, I think that is an injury and she may be compensated. . . . [B]eing assaulted by a prisoner is one of the hazards that takes place inside our State\u2019s prisons and I think she is more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>than entitled to receive workers\u2019 [compensation] benefits, she will receive 100 [percent] of her gross base pay and I think she deserves it and I hope no one ever suggests that is taken away in that kind of situation.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The scenario involving the correction officer is nearly identical to the plaintiffs situation in this case. The plaintiff was assaulted in the line of duty, although he was not wounded, as he was involved in a gun battle and shots were fired at him. While the plaintiff did not suffer physical trauma from the attack, his subsequent mental condition had arisen from the incident just as the mental distress of the correction officer. If combat fatigue syndrome is an occupational disease, a disease that is peculiar to the officer\u2019s occupation and due to causes in excess of the ordinary hazards of that occupation, it seems clear that the mental and emotional disabilities that also may be symptomatic of that disease are compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Commissioner Amado J. Vargas, a member of the compensation review board who dissented from the board\u2019s decision in this case, correctly stated: \u201cNeither \u00a7 31-275 (15) . . . nor \u00a7 31-275 (16) specifically states that occupational diseases must be accompanied by physical indicia of trauma or exposure to a foreign substance. Instead, \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii) merely says that a mental or emotional impairment is not a personal injury \u2018unless such impairment arises from a physical injury <em>or occupational disease.\u2019 . . .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">\u201cRather than defining \u2018occupational disease\u2019 in terms of the absence of a mental impairment claim, the Act does the opposite: it permits a mental impairment to be recognized as a personal injury if the impairment arises from an occupational disease.\u201d <em>Biasetti </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>No. 03632-CRB-07-97-06 (September 8, 1998) (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The majority, I regret, ignores the legitimate needs of law enforcement officers in the dangerous and necessary work of protecting the public. That work is physically dangerous and that causes emotional and psychological harms. \u201cPolice work has been identified as the most psychologically dangerous job in the world.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) W. Terry, \u201cPolice Stress: The Empirical Evidence,\u201d 9 J. Police Sci. &amp; Admin. 61, 70 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I disagree that the workers\u2019 compensation law denies compensation to this officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b84-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (15) provides: \u201c \u2018Occupational disease\u2019 includes any disease peculiar to the occupation in which the employee was engaged and due to causes in excess of the ordinary hazards of employment as such, and includes any disease due to or attributable to exposure to or contact with any radioactive material by an employee in the course of his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">We note that since 1994, the time of the underlying occurrences in this case, changes have been made to various subdivisions of \u00a7 31-275, including subdivision (16). See footnote 3 of this opinion.

References herein to the defendant, however, are to the city of Stamford only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b87-12\"> In connection with stipulation number twelve, the parties disagree as to whether there was in fact a stipulation that PTSD was an occupational disease under \u00a7 31-275 (15). The plaintiff claims that the parties stipulated that PTSD/CFS is an occupational disease. The defendant, however, asserts that it stipulated only to the fact that the plaintiff had <em>claimed </em>that PTSD/ CFS is an occupational disease, not that PTSD/CFS actually met the statutory definition of \u00a7 31-275 (15). The compensation review board treated stipulation number twelve as a stipulation by the parties that PTSD/CFS is an occupational disease. It further noted that the commissioner also had found that PTSD/CFS is compensable as an occupational disease under \u00a7 31-275 (15) . At a subsequent point in its opinion, however, the board determined that, in order to be an occupational disease, the plaintiffs PTSD/CFS \u201cmust [have] originate[d] from a physical trauma, or some other occupational disease that was caused by a tangible physical stimulus.\u201d Because we conclude that, under the facts of this case, PTSD/CFS is an occupational disease, we treat it as such and examine whether it is compensable under \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b92-8\"> The board concluded that PTSD/CFS cannot be an occupational disease based upon its determination that, under \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii), which excludes mental or emotional impairments from the definition of personal injury unless they are caused by physical injuries or occupational diseases, in order to be an occupational disease, the plaintiffs PTSD/CFS must have originated from aphysical trauma, or have been caused by a tangible physical stimulus. Essentially, the board interpreted subdivision (16) and then grafted onto subdivision (15) its interpretation of the term \u201coccupational disease\u201d under subdivision (16). We disagree with the board\u2019s conclusion and its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The defendant acknowledges that mental impairment may be an occupational disease, but argues, nonetheless, that it is not a personal injury under \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii). Therefore, according to the defendant, whether the plaintiffs PTSD/CFS can be categorized properly as an occupational disease is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Although the legislature enacted No. 93-228, \u00a7 1, of the 1993 Public Acts (now codified at \u00a7 31-275 [16] [B] [ii]), it did not amend \u00a7 31-275 (15). In appeals arising under workers\u2019 compensation law, we must resolve statutory ambiguities or lacunae in a manner that will further the remedial purpose of the act. <em>See Hansen v. Gordon, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 32. Although we recognize that, in enacting workers\u2019 compensation law, the legislature did not intend to create \u201ca general health and benefit insurance program\u201d; id.; we do not read the act to include limitations on eligibility for compensation for which there is no statutory basis. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 698. Although the legislature amended \u00a7 31-275 in other ways, it left intact the court\u2019s construction of the definition of occupational diseases. Therefore, in the absence of any limitations expressly placed upon \u00a7 31-275 (15), we hesitate to diminish its purview. See <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Control Authority, </em>176 Conn. 191, 198, 405 A.2d 638 (1978) (\u201cinference of legislative concurrence with the [court\u2019s] interpretation [is] to be drawn from legislative silence concerning that interpretation\u201d). Finally, we note that if PTSD/CFS were not considered to be an occupational disease, a heart attack arising from the mental impairment would not be compensable. Clearly, that was not a result intended by the legislature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b96-4\"> In support of its interpretation of \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii), the board referred to the legislative history of Public Act 93-228. Specifically, the board noted the following: \u201c[Representative Michael P.] Lawlor stated in his comments that \u2018[t]he only injury that would not be compensable that is purely a mental injury is that which was not caused by any type of a physical injury in the first place,\u2019 as opposed to a case in which an employee is physically or sexually assaulted, and subsequently incurs a mental injury. 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 18, 1993 Sess., p. 6215. [Representative Nancy A.] DeMarinis, who opposed the version of the bill that was passed, expressed concern that the language in the proposed statute would prevent people from being compensated for trauma or extreme stress caused by the witnessing of events such as the building collapse at L\u2019Ambiance Plaza in Bridgeport or the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York. Id., 6308. [Representative Alan] Kyle explained his support of the bill by stating that he had personally pursued a dangerous avocation at which he had seen friends killed, but he continued pursuing the avocation nonetheless. \u2018[I]t is a very subjective thing when we speak of and interject into our laws things as ill-defined ... as is emotional stress. ... If a person is physically injured and cannot work, then by all means they do deserve help, but for an emotional or stressful type things, there is stress in life and we need to accept that.\u2019 Id., 6312. Comments such as these indicate that the legislature believed that the language of \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii) would not permit claims such as the one currently before us. We are not inclined to weaken the effect of the statute and the legislature\u2019s judgment by manufacturing ways to define \u2018mental-mental\u2019 claims as either occupational diseases or \u2018mental-physical\u2019 claims.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\"> In our review of the legislative history of Public Act 93-228, \u00a7 1, we note that whenever the question of mental impairment arises, the discussion appertains <em>solely </em>to the exception allowing for mental or emotional impairment arising from a physical injury. There is no discussion of mental impairment arising from an occupational disease, despite its inclusion in the statute. Nor is there any reference to <em>Crochiere, </em>which, although undecided, had been argued to this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b99-5\"> Although the plaintiff filed a motion with the board for permission to submit as additional evidence this letter from Albert, which motion the board in its opinion concluded was properly denied, the board nevertheless determined from its own review of the record that the letter \u201cis in fact marked as page 3 of Exhibit B in the record. Thus it appears that the [plaintiffs] motion may have been unnecessary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b99-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 provides in relevant part that <em>\u201cunless the context otherwise provides: </em>(1) \u2018Arising out of and in the course of his employment\u2019 means ... an occupational disease of an employee originating while he has been engaged in the line of his duty in the business or affairs of the employer upon the employer\u2019s premises, or while engaged elsewhere upon the employer\u2019s business or affairs by the direction, express or implied, of the employer . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This reflects the causal connection between the injury and the employment, specifically the origin and cause of the accident; see, e.g., <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Sherwood Industries, Inc., </em>244 Conn. 502, 506, 710 A.2d 1338 (1998); which the defendant does not dispute. Indeed, that causal connection is repeated in \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A). Because the legislature clearly intended to limit the compensability of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>mental impairment by enacting Public Act No. 93-228, \u00a7 1, now codified at \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii), and in recognition of the fact that mental impairments often carry attendant physical symptoms, we conclude that the legislature intended to impose an additional burden when it chose to include the qualifying language \u201carises from.\u201d Further evidence of this intent can be gleaned from a comparison between the statute as it was ultimately enacted and a proposed draft of the bill, Substitute House Bill No. 7172, dated May 13, 1993, which, in place of the current language of \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii), excluded the following from the definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d: \u201cA MENTAL OR EMOTIONAL IMPAIRMENT UNLESS A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTING CAUSE OF SUCH IMPAIRMENT IS AN EVENT OR SERIES OF EVENTS ARISING OUT OF AND IN THE COURSE OF EMPLOYMENT . . . .\u201d This language effectively mirrored, in pertinent part, the language in \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (i), which merely pertains to causation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b100-9\"> In rejecting this interpretation, we also necessarily reject the plaintiffs assertion that his claim is not a \u201cmental-mental\u201d claim \u2014 that is, a mental disease giving rise to a mental impairment \u2014 but, rather, is a \u201cmental-physical\u201d claim \u2014 a claim that has a mental stimulus that causes a physical injury. The plaintiffs claim is a mental claim with attendant symptoms. As the board correctly observed: \u201cThe commissioner made no finding of a physical injury in this case, and we will not treat this claim as a \u2018mental-physical\u2019 claim for the purpose of review.\u201d Such a finding is like the determination by a commissioner that an injury arose out of employment, in that it is factual in nature and therefore is accorded the same deference as that given to similar conclusions of a trial judge or jury on the issue of proximate cause.
