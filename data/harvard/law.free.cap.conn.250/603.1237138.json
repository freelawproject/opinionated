On March 7, 1994, the plaintiff, Teresa Kulig, was burned when she spilled a large pot of boiling soup on her legs in the course of her employment with the named defendant, Crown Supermarket,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in West Hartford. The plaintiff sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits under General Statutes \u00a7 31-308 (c)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *for the scarring that she suffered as a result of those bums.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">After a hearing, the commissioner concluded that the plaintiff was not eligible for benefits under \u00a7 31-308 (c)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, on March 19, 1996, sent notice of his findings and decision to counsel for the parties by certified mail pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-321.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 counsel received notice on March 20, 1996. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney, however, claims not to have received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision until April 24, 1996, thirty-five days after it had been mailed to him. The plaintiff filed an appeal from the commissioner\u2019s decision on May 2, 1996, eight days after receiving notice but forty-three days after the commissioner had sent that notice by certified mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The board dismissed the plaintiffs appeal on the ground that it had not been filed within the ten day limitation period of \u00a7 31-301 (a). In dismissing the appeal, the board stated that it was bound by decisions of our Appellate Court in which that court held that the ten day period commences on the day that the commissioner sends notice of his or her decision to the party wishing to appeal. See, e.g., <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Hull Dye &amp; Print, Inc., </em>39 Conn. App. 717, 720, 667 A.2d 76 (1995); <em>Conaci </em>v. <em>Hartford Hospital, </em>36 Conn. App. 298, 303, 650 A.2d 613 (1994). The board, therefore, concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Kulig </em>v. <em>Crown Supermarket, </em>3335 CRB 6-96-5 (November 25, 1997). The plaintiff appealed from the decision of the board to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>The plaintiff claims that the ten day appeal period prescribed by \u00a7 31-301 (a) commences on the date that a party wishing to appeal receives notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision, rather than the date on which the commissioner sends notice to that party. In support of this contention, the plaintiff argues that it is fundamentally unfair to deprive a party of the right to appeal solely because of a failure of notice for which the party bears no responsibility. According to the plaintiff, the legislature reasonably could not have intended such a constitutionally suspect result. Although we agree with the plaintiff that the legislature did not intend such a result, we need not, and do not, construe \u00a7 31-301 (a) in the manner that the plaintiff advocates. Rather, we conclude, consistent with our decision in <em>Kudlacz </em>v. <em>Lindberg Heat Treating Co., </em>250 Conn. 581, 738 A.2d 135 (1999),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and in accordance with established Appellate Court precedent, that the ten day appeal period begins to run from the date on which notice is sent by the commissioner, subject to the tolling of the ten day period when a party wishing to appeal establishes that, through no fault of his own, he did not receive notice within ten days of the date that notice was sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">\u201c[T]he process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... As with any issue of statutory interpretation, our initial guide is the language of the statute itself. . . . Furthermore, we interpret statutory language in light of the purpose and policy behind the enactment. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Finally, in seeking to ascertain the intent of the legislature regarding the proper construction of \u00a7 31-301 (a), we are guided by the golden rule of statutory interpretation . . . that the legislature is presumed to have intended a reasonable, just and constitutional result.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">\u201cConstrued literally, \u00a7 31-301 (a) mandates that a party who wishes to appeal from an adverse ruling of the commissioner do so within ten days after the commissioner renders his or her decision. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (a). We previously have eschewed a literal interpretation of the ten day appeal period of \u00a7 31-301 (a), however, concluding that the legislature [undoubtedly . . . intended this provision to mean ten days <em>after notice to the party of the entry of such finding; </em>otherwise, in the event of the failure of the commissioner to notify the party of his finding and award within the ten-day period, the taking of the appeal would be fruitless. . . . <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Elms Hotel, </em>104 Conn. 351, 352, 133 A. 106 (1926) (interpreting General Statutes [1918 Rev.] \u00a7 5366, as amended by Public Acts 1919, c. 142, \u00a7 14, predecessor to \u00a7 31-301). Fundamental rights to procedural due process mandate such a construction. <em>Trinkley </em>v. <em>Ella Grasso Regional Center, </em>220 Conn. 739, 743, 601 A.2d 515 (1992).\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kudlacz </em>v. <em>Lindberg Heat Treating Co., </em>supra, 250 Conn. 587-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The plaintiff claims that the same constitutional considerations compel the conclusion that the ten day appeal period of \u00a7 31-301 (a) does not begin to run until notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision is received by the party wishing to appeal. In <em>Kudlacz </em>v. <em>Lindberg Heat Treating Co., </em>supra, 250 Conn. 581, which we also decide today, we recognized the \u201cobvious unfairness inherent in depriving an aggrieved party of the right to appeal the commissioner\u2019s decision solely because of a failure of notice beyond that party\u2019s control . . . .\u201d Id., 588: In light of this unfairness, we concluded in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number><em>Kudlacz </em>\u201cthat the ten day appeal period of \u00a7 31-301 (a) is tolled when the aggrieved party establishes that, through no fault of his own, he did not receive notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision within ten days of the date that it was sent.\u201d Id., 590-91. In so concluding, we operated on the assumption that the ten day appeal period of \u00a7 31-301 (a) commences on the date that notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision is <em>sent </em>to the aggrieved party. Our holding in <em>Kudlacz, </em>therefore, addresses, and eliminates, the due process concerns that the plaintiff in this case raises in support of her argument regarding the proper construction of \u00a7 31-301 (a). The plaintiff makes no other argument as to why we should overrule established Appellate Court precedent holding that the ten day appeal period begins to run from the date notice is sent, and we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">As we have indicated, the Appellate Court consistently has held \u201cthat the ten day appeal period [of \u00a7 31-301 (a)] begins to run on the day on which the party wanting to appeal is <em>sent </em>meaningful notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Conaci </em>v. <em>Hartford Hospital, </em>supra, 36 Conn. App. 303; accord <em>Vega </em>v. <em>Waltsco, Inc., </em>46 Conn. App. 298, 301, 699 A.2d 247 (1997); <em>Cyr </em>v. <em>Domino\u2019s Pizza, </em>45 Conn. App. 199, 203-204 n.5, 695 A.2d 29 (1997); <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Hull Dye &amp; Print, Inc., </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 720. In explaining this conclusion, the Appellate Court in <em>Conaci </em>observed that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Trinkley </em>v. <em>Ella Grasso Regional Center, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 743, \u201cimplied that the operative date from which the limitation period for appeals to the . . . board should run is the date that notice is given to the party who might want to appeal.\u201d <em>Conaci </em>v. <em>Hartford Hospital, </em>supra, 303. In <em>Conaci, </em>the Appellate Court sought to \u201cfollow the direction [this court had taken] in <em>Trinkley </em>[and] . . . decline [d] to adopt the . . . position that the appeal period commences when notice of the appealable decision is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>received [because such] a holding would create undue delay and difficulties in proving receipt by the party wanting to appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id. We agree with this reasoning. Accordingly, we conclude that the ten day appeal period prescribed by \u00a7 31-301 (a) begins to run on the date that notice is sent by the commissioner, rather than on the date that notice is received. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In accordance with our holding in <em>Kudlacz, </em>however, the plaintiff is entitled to establish that: (1) through no fault of her own, she failed to receive notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision within ten days of the date that she was sent such notice by the commissioner;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and (2) the plaintiffs petition for review of the commissioner\u2019s decision was filed within ten days of the date that she received notice of that decision. See <em>Kudlacz </em>v. <em>Lindberg Heat Treating Co., </em>supra, 250 Conn. 590-91. If, on remand, the plaintiff can make such a showing, then her appeal to the board must be reinstated.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The decision of the board is reversed and the case is remanded to the board for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b622-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAt any time within ten days after entry of an award by the commissioner . . . either party may appeal therefrom to the Compensation Review Board by filing in the office of the commissioner from which the award or the decision on a motion originated an appeal petition and five copies thereof. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b622-11\"> When we refer throughout this opinion to a party receiving notice, including the plaintiff, we are referring to the receipt of notice by that party\u2019s counsel, to the extent that the party is represented by counsel. In <em>Schreck </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>250 Conn. 592, 600-601, 737 A.2d 916 (1999), also decided today, we held that when a plaintiff wishing to appeal an adverse decision of a commissioner is represented by counsel in that appeal, the ten day limitation period prescribed by \u00a7 31-301 (a) begins to run on the date that the commissioner sends notice to the party\u2019s counsel, rather than to the party. As in <em>Schreck, </em>the plaintiff in this case was represented by counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\"> Crown Supermarket's insurance carrier also is a defendant in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b623-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-308 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201c[T]he commissioner . . . may award compensation . . . for any permanent significant disfigurement of, or pennanent significant scar on, (A) the face, head or neck, or (B) on any other area of the body which handicaps the employee in obtaining or continuing to work. . . .

[the] decisions of our Appellate Court that specifically address this matter, despite the claimant\u2019s vehement protests that the . . . standard [adopted by the Appellate Court] ignores the reality that notice is not always received within ten days after it is mailed. The simple fact is that this board does not have jurisdiction to consider the merits of a claim once we determine that an appeal is untimely, as it was here. . . . Legally, we can do nothing but dismiss this appeal.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Kulig </em>v. <em>Crown Supermarket, </em>3335 CRB 6-96-5 (November 25,1997). The plaintiff does not challenge the conclusion of the board that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over an appeal by a party who has failed to comply with the ten day limitation period of \u00a7 31-301 (a). See, e.g., <em>Chieppo </em>v. <em>RobertE. McMichael, Inc., </em>169 Conn. 646, 648, 363 A.2d 1085 (1975); <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Hull Dye &amp; Print, Inc., </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 720.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b625-6\"> The plaintiff <em>in Kudlacz, </em>although represented by the same attorney as the plaintiff in this ease, did not claim that the ten day appeal period prescribed by \u00a7 31-301 (a) should be construed to run from the date that notice is received by the party wishing to appeal. See generally <em>Kudlacz </em>v. <em>Lindberg Heat Treating Co., </em>supra, 250 Conn. 586. Rather, the plaintiff in <em>Kudlacz </em>argued, and we agreed, that the ten day period is tolled when, through no fault of the party wishing to appeal, that party did not receive notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision within ten days of the date that the commissioner sent notice to the party. Id., 590-91.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\"> In addition to these difficulties, the construction urged by the plaintiff frequently would result in one party to a case having an appeal deadline different from that of another party to the same case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b628-9\"> Of course, this conclusion is subject to our holding in <em>Kudlacz </em>regarding the tolling of that appeal period in the circumstances described previously.

See <em>Schreck </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>250 Conn. 592, 600-601, 737 A.2d 916 (1999); footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b628-11\"> The plaintiff also claims that she never received proper notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision because, under \u00a7 31-301 (a), the commissioner was required to send notice to her, as the party, rather than to her attorney. This claim, however, is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Schreck </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>250 Conn. 592, 600-601, 737 A.2d 916 (1999); see footnote 3 of this opinion; which we also decide today.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
