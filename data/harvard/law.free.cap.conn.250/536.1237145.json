We conclude that the good time statutes are not applicable to such persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The material facts are not in dispute. On November 30, 1994, the petitioner, Jorge Velez, committed a rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>bery in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-135. He was convicted and, on July 21, 1995, he was sentenced to an effective term of imprisonment of eight years, with execution suspended after three years, and a three year period of probation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commissioner of correction (commissioner), interpreting \u00a7 18-100d as making the petitioner ineligible for any reduction in his sentence for good conduct, calculated December 17, 1997, as the petitioner\u2019s release date. This calculation did not credit the petitioner for prison good time pursuant to \u00a7 18-7a (c), presentence jail good time pursuant to \u00a7 18-98d (b), or seven day workweek good time pursuant to \u00a7 18-98a.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If all the foregoing good time credit had been applied to the petitioner\u2019s sentence, his release date would have been in April, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">On August 28,1997, the petitioner, while still incarcerated, filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging that he had a statutory right to good time and that he had been confined beyond his lawful release date. The trial court concluded that, pursuant to \u00a7 18-lOOd, the petitioner was not entitled to good time credits and dismissed his petition. Upon the granting of certification, the petitioner appealed to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">We begin by noting that the interpretation of \u00a7 18-lOOd is a matter of statutory construction. \u201cStatutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [O]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shawhan </em>v. <em>Langley, </em>249 Conn. 339, 343, 732 A.2d 170 (1999); <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Dohmann, </em>247 Conn. 274, 286, 722 A.2d 1205 (1998); <em>Ferrigno </em>v. <em>Cromwell Development Associates, </em>244 Conn. 189, 195, 708 A.2d 1371 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Before we address the petitioner\u2019s claim regarding the effect of \u00a7 18-100d upon the availability of good time pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 18-7a (c), 18-98d (b) and 18-98a, we will undertake a general overview of the statutory scheme governing the release of prisoners. Prior to the enactment of \u00a7 18-100d in 1993; see Public Acts 1993, No. 93-219 (P.A. 93-219); the release of prisoners before the completion of their court-imposed sentences was governed in pertinent part by three statutory entitlements. First, the good time statutes set forth formulae by which incarcerated persons could earn a <em>commutation </em>of their court-imposed sentences. <em>Seno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>219 Conn. 269, 270 n.1, 593 A.2d 111 (1991); <em>Laden </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>169 Conn. 540, 541, 363 A.2d 1063 (1975). In other words, the good time statutes provided a means by which an inmate could earn a reduction of his or her court-imposed sentence, thereby advancing the date on which he or she no longer would be subject to the authority of the department of correction (department) or, if he or she had been granted parole, the authority of the board of parole (board).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Second, with respect to persons sentenced to a definite term of imprisonment of one year or less, General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 18-100c<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provided that upon completion of one half of their court-imposed sentences, less any good time credit they may have earned pursuant to the good time statutes, such persons were eligible for placement in a community correctional program such as a halfway house (community placement). Thus, General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 18-100c authorized the commissioner to include the good time that an inmate had earned pursuant to the good time statutes in the calculation of the inmate\u2019s community placement eligibility date. Prisoners released from incarceration and granted community placement pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 18-100c remained under the authority of the commissioner. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 18-100 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Third, with respect to persons sentenced to a definite term of imprisonment exceeding one year, General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 54-125a<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provided that upon completion of one half of their court-imposed sentences, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>persons sentenced to more than one year were eligible for parole. General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 54-125a, the statute governing parole, did not authorize the commissioner to include good time in the calculation of an inmate\u2019s parole eligibility date. Further, General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 54-125a provided that parolees were subject to the authority of the board, which at that time was part of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">To summarize, prior to the enactment of P.A. 93-219: (1) pursuant to \u00a7 18-100c, inmates sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year or less were eligible for community placement, and the commissioner was authorized to include good time in the calculation of an inmate\u2019s community placement eligibility date; (2) pursuant to \u00a7 54-125a, inmates sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding one year were eligible for parole upon completion of one half of their court-imposed sentences; and (3) pursuant to the good time statutes, all inmates, regardless of the length of their sentences, were eligible to earn good time, which operated to commute a portion of their court-imposed sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">In enacting P.A. 93-219, the legislature effected three relevant changes to the statutory scheme governing the release of prisoners. First, \u00a7 6 of P.A. 93-219 transferred from the department to an independent board of parole the supervision of all persons released from the custody of the department, other than those granted community placement pursuant to \u00a7 18-100c. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-124c.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Second, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of P.A. 93-219 amended \u00a7\u00a7 18-100c and 54-125a, respectively, to increase, from one to two years, the sentence one could receive, and still be eligible for placement in a community correctional program. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark>As amended, \u00a7 18-100c<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provides for community placement of prisoners sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years or less, and \u00a7 54-125a<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> provides for parole of prisoners sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Third, \u00a7 10 of P.A. 93-219 created a new statute codified as \u00a7 18-100d, the statute principally at issue in this appeal. Section \u00a7 18-100d provides: <em>\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of the general statutes, </em>any person convicted of a crime committed on or after October 1, 1994, shall be subject to supervision by personnel of the Department of Correction or the Board of Parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number><em>until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was </em>sentenced.\" (Emphasis added.) By its terms, \u00a7 18-100d requires that a person convicted of a crime committed on or after October 1, 1994, remain under the authority of either the department or the board for the entire length of his or her court-imposed sentence. Thus, the language of \u00a7 18-100d manifests an intention that such persons be either incarcerated (i.e., under the authority of the department), placed in a community correctional program (i.e., under the authority of the department) or on parole (i.e., under the authority of the board) during the <em>entire term </em>of their court-imposed sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Moreover, the phrase <em>\u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of the general </em>statutes(emphasis added); in \u00a7 18-100d unequivocally indicates that the legislature intended that the statutory requirement that persons convicted of crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994, remain under the authority of the department or the board for the entire length of the court-imposed sentences, would override any statutory provisions to the contrary. By its terms, therefore, \u00a7 18-100d indicates that the legislature intended that the good time statutes \u2014 statutes that operate to release inmates and persons granted community placement from the authority of the department and to release parolees from the authority of the board after completion of only a portion of their court-imposed sentences \u2014 no longer be applicable to persons convicted of crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The legislative history of House Bill No. 6934, the bill that eventually was enacted as P.A. 93-219, and codified in part as \u00a7 18-100d, also indicates that the legislature intended that \u00a7 18-100d render the good time statutes inapplicable to persons convicted of crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994. During the discussion of the bill on the floor of the House of Representatives, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Representative Michael P. Lawlor, a sponsor of the bill, stated: \u201c[This bill] requires parole supervision for parolees for the entire term of the sentence that had been imposed by the court. Under current law, parolees come off parole supervision at the time they max out on their sentence, which in most cases, is <em>two-thirds of the original sentence that was imposed.\u2019\u2019\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 22, 1993 Sess., pp. 7645-46. Representative Lawlor\u2019s statement, a clear reference to good time, is compelling evidence that the legislature intended that an inmate\u2019s court-imposed sentence remain in effect, and that persons convicted of crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994, no longer be able to \u201cmax out\u201d their sentences pursuant to the good time statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">In November, 1994, moreover, in response to an inquiry by the commissioner regarding the effect of \u00a7 18-100d on the applicability of the good time statutes to persons convicted of crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994, the office of the attorney general rendered an opinion stating: \u201c[Section 18-100d] has the effect of eliminating the impact that good time credits heretofore have had in reducing length of sentence and accelerating discharge. . . . [T]he maximum terms of sentences imposed for crimes committed on or after October 1,1994, are not reducible by good time credits. For such crimes, the entire sentence must be served under the supervision of the Department of Correction or the Board of Parole.\u201d Opinions, Conn. Atty. Gen. No. 94-031 (November 23, 1994). \u201c \u2018Although an opinion of the attorney general is not binding on a court, it is entitled to careful consideration and is generally regarded as highly persuasive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Connecticut State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in </em>Podiatry, 208 Conn. 709, 720, 546 A.2d 830 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">On the basis of the opinion rendered by the office of the attorney general, the commissioner declined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>award good time to inmates incarcerated for crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994. Thereafter, in 1997, the legislature enacted legislation titled \u201cAn Act Concerning the Forfeiture of Good Time Credits.\u201d Public Acts 1997, No. 97-169. During the discussion on the floor of the House of Representatives of House Bill No. 7058, the bill that eventually was enacted as Public Acts 1997, No. 97-169, Representative Lawlor, <em>a 1993 sponsor of the bill that eventually was codified as \u00a7 18-100d, </em>stated: \u201cI\u2019d like to point out two things. First of all, <em>persons committing crimes after October 1, 1994, they\u2019re no longer earning good time credits. </em>This legislation would only apply to the 7000 or so inmates who committed their crimes prior to October 1, 1994. So there\u2019s no more good time in Connecticut, but there are some people in the system who were sentenced at a time when there was still good time, and of course those rules stay with them.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 40 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7,1997 Sess., p. 2433. Representative Lawlor\u2019s remarks are clear evidence of the legislature\u2019s awareness of, and acquiescence in, the interpretation given to \u00a7 18-100d by the attorney general and the commissioner. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Grullon, </em>212 Conn. 195, 210, 562 A.2d 481 (1989) (considering legislative history of subsequent enactment in determining legislative intent of prior legislation); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>McVeigh, </em>224 Conn. 593, 621, 620 A.2d 133 (1993) (considering subsequent enactment in determining legislative intent of prior legislation); <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 542, 613 A.2d 748 (1992) (same). Again, that interpretation is that \u00a7 18-100d rendered the good time statutes inapplicable to persons convicted of crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The petitioner nonetheless claims that \u00a7 18-100d was not intended to make the good time statutes inapplicable to persons incarcerated for crimes committed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>or after October 1, 1994. In the petitioner\u2019s view, \u00a7 18-100d was intended, instead, to alter the manner in which the good time statutes operate with respect to such persons by replacing sentence commutations with an automatic system of parole when a prisoner has served his sentence less good time earned. Specifically, the petitioner contends that the legislature intended that: (1) persons sentenced to imprisonment for crimes committed after October 1,1994 continue to earn good time pursuant to the good time statutes; (2) despite language of the good time statutes stating that good time operates to <em>reduce court-imposed sentences, </em>good time no longer would reduce court-imposed sentences; (3) if, after serving one half of their court-imposed sentences, such prisoners are granted parole by the board pursuant to \u00a7 54-125a, any earned good time would provide them with no benefit; but (4) if, after serving one half of their court-imposed sentences, such prisoners are denied parole by the parole board, their earned good time would provide them with automatic parole on the dates that, but for the enactment of \u00a7 18-100d, would have been their release dates under the good time statutes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This automatic parole would require no action or exercise of discretion by the board. To support his proposed construction of \u00a7 18-100d, the petitioner primarily relies on: (1) the legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201csupervision\u201d in \u00a7 18-100d; (2) claimed inconsistencies between the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 18-100d and other statutory provisions; and (3) references to good time made in a report issued by the legislative program review and investigations committee.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>We first address the petitioner\u2019s argument regarding the language of \u00a7 18-100d. Section 18-100d requires that a \u201cperson convicted of a crime committed on or after October 1, 1994 ... be subject to <em>supervision </em>by [the commissioner] or the [board] until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Distinguishing between \u201ccustody\u201d and \u201csupervision,\u201d the petitioner claims that the legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201csupervision\u201d in \u00a7 18-100d and its omission of the word \u201ccustody\u201d from the statute must indicate that the legislature intended that all inmates be released at some point during their sentences from the \u201ccustody\u201d of the commissioner (i.e., incarceration) into a program of correctional \u201csupervision\u201d (i.e., community placement or parole). The legislative history of \u00a7 18-100d, however, reveals that the word \u201csupervision\u201d in \u00a7 18-100d was intended to refer to incarceration as well as to community placement and parole. See 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 22, 1993 Sess., p. 7646. Specifically, in the discussion on the floor of the House of Representatives of Substitute House Bill No. 6934, the bill that eventually was enacted as P.A. 93-219, and codified in part as \u00a7 18-100d, Representative Lawlor stated: \u201cSo in essence, this change will maintain people on parole for the full, in the case of a ten year sentence, for the full ten years rather than for just two or three years after their release maybe only six years of <em>total supervision both in the facility and outside the facility </em>and this has the obvious benefit of keeping people under supervision with the opportunity to return them immediately to prison based on a violation for the full term of the original sentence imposed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Representative Lawlor\u2019s statement that \u201csupervision\u201d may occur both inside and outside a correctional facility reveals that, in the context of \u00a7 18-100d, the term \u201csupervision\u201d was intended to include incarceration as well as community placement and parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The petitioner\u2019s next claim is that a construction of \u00a7 18-100d as rendering the good time statutes inapplicable to persons convicted of crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994 cannot be harmonized with: (1) the provision of \u00a7 18-100c that authorizes the commissioner to include good time earned by an inmate sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years or less in the calculation of the date on which the inmate becomes eligible for community placement; or (2) the provision of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 18-87f,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> a statute that addressed prison overcrowding but was <em>repealed </em>in 1995, that authorized the commissioner, under certain emergency circumstances, to release inmates from custody early.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Contrary to the petitioner\u2019s view, we can discern no inconsistency between \u00a7 18-100d and \u00a7 18-100c. Construing \u00a7 18-100d as making persons convicted of crimes committed on or after October 1,1994, ineligible for good time results in such persons earning no good time. Consequently, in calculating the date of their eligibility for community placement pursuant to \u00a7 18-100c, the commissioner simply would not subtract any good time from one half of their court-imposed sentences, and they would have to serve one half of their sentences before becoming eligible for the transition to community placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>With respect to the petitioner\u2019s claimed inconsistency between \u00a7 18-100d and General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 18-87f, \u00a7 18-87f provided in relevant part: \u201c(e) In the event that [other measures taken to reduce prison overcrowding are] insufficient to reduce prisoner population ... to prisoner capacity, the commissioner shall first further reduce the parole eligibility dates of prisoners serving indeterminate or indefinite sentences by thirty days, and then further reduce the maximum sentences of prisoners serving indeterminate or indefinite sentences and the sentences of prisoners serving determinate sentences, by increments of one day, to a maximum of thirty days, until prisoner population ... is reduced to prisoner capacity. Eligible prisoners may be released on parole or to an approved community residence. ... (f) ... No prisoner shall be released from custody under this section unless he has served at least one-half of his minimum indeterminate sentence or one-half of his determinate sentence, but shall have served not less than sixty days, including [good time earned under \u00a7 18-98d], . . .\"Asa matter of statutory construction, a statute such as \u00a7 18-87f, which applied only under specific, emergency conditions, is presumed to prevail over more general statutory provisions dealing with the same overall subject matter. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>206 Conn. 346, 359, 538 A.2d 185 (1988). Moreover, to the extent that \u00a7 18-87f, after the enactment of \u00a7 18-100d and before its repeal, authorized the commissioner to consider good time earned by an inmate in determining eligibility for early parole, it is not inconsistent with \u00a7 18-100d. Pursuant to \u00a7 18-100d, persons convicted of crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994 simply would have earned no good time to be included in the calculation of their eligibility for early parole pursuant to \u00a7 18-87f, and the commissioner could have determined their parole eligibility accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Furthermore, it is the petitioner\u2019s proposed construction of \u00a7 18-100d that cannot be harmonized with other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>statutory provisions. Section 54-125a, the statute governing parole, does not provide the commissioner with any authority to include good time in the calculation of an inmate\u2019s parole eligibility date, but rather requires the service of one half of the imposed sentence. Moreover, \u00a7 54-125a (a) explicitly provides that the determination of whether to grant parole rests with the discretion of a panel of the board and is not automatic on the accumulation of good time. In addition, General Statutes \u00a7 54-125b,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which, like \u00a7 18-100d, was enacted as part of P.A. 93-219, provides that an inmate may be granted parole without a hearing before a panel of the board <em>only if an employee of the board has reviewed the inmate\u2019s case and recommended that parole be granted and such recommendation has been approved by at least two members ofapanel of the board. </em>During the discussion of Substitute House Bill No. 6934 on the floor of the Senate, Senator George C. Jepsen stated: \u201c[T]his bill . . . puts [prisoner releases] in the hands of the [board] . . . that ought to restore rationality by allowing the [board] to . . . [release prisoners] on not a random, but at least a basis that involves statutory criteria.\u201d 36 S. Proc., Pt. 10, 1993 Sess., p. 3463. The fact that the legislature enacted \u00a7\u00a7 18-100d and 54-125b, and amended \u00a7 54-125a, in the same act; see P.A. 93-219; is compelling evidence that the legislature did not intend \u00a7 18-100d to create an automatic version of parole, without board action, as advocated by the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Finally, we recognize that certain examples included in a report prepared in 1993 by the legislative program review and investigations committee<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> support the petitioner\u2019s proposed construction of \u00a7 18-100d. In light of the language and legislative history of \u00a7 18-100d and the legislature\u2019s awareness of, and acquiescence in, the interpretation given to \u00a7 18-100d by the commissioner and the attorney general, however, that report simply does not provide a proper basis for a conclusion that \u00a7 18-100d was intended to adopt the system of automatic parole urged by the petitioner \u2014 a system that would provide automatic parole to persons, who like the petitioner, previously have been deemed by the board to be unfit for parole and denied parole. See <em>Iovieno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>242 Conn. 689, 699-700, 699 A.2d 1003 (1997) (departure from existing statutory law must clearly be expressed); <em>Gomeau </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>176 Conn. 523, 527, 409 A.2d 1006 (1979) (radical departure from established statutory scheme must be expressed in unequivocal language and may not be implied).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">On the basis of the language and legislative history of \u00a7 18-100d, and of the legislature\u2019s apparent awareness of, and acquiescence in, the interpretation given to \u00a7 18-100d by the attorney general and the commissioner, we conclude that \u00a7 18-100d renders the good time statutes inapplicable to persons sentenced to a term of imprisonment for crimes committed on or after October 1,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 18-100d provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of the general statutes, any person convicted of a crime committed on or after October 1, 1994, shall be subject to supervision by personnel of the Department of Correction or the Board of Parole until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b555-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 18-7 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny prisoner sentenced to a term of imprisonment prior to October 1, 1976, may, by good conduct and obedience to the rules of said institution, earn a commutation or diminution of his sentence, as follows: Sixty days for each year, and pro rata for a part of a year, of a sentence which is not for more than five years;
