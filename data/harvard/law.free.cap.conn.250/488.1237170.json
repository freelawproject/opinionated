Woodward Lewis, Jr., the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>in error (Lewis), against the defendants in error, James Kobernat and Vicki Kobernat (Kobemats), and Vincent T. McManus (McManus). The issues raised by these two writs are whether: (1) the trial court, <em>Levin, J., </em>improperly imposed monetary sanctions against Lewis for failing to comply with a discovery order of that court; and (2) the trial court, <em>Levine, J., </em>improperly disqualified Lewis from representing Green Rock Ridge, Inc. (Green Rock),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in its case against the Kobemats, and their attorney, McManus. We dismiss both writs for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, without reaching the merits of either.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Underlying these two writs of error are two pending Superior Court cases that Green Rock currently is litigating as the plaintiff. The first trial court case involves a counterclaim brought by the Kobemats against Green Rock (Green Rock I).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That case underlies the first writ of error before this court. The second case is an action by Green Rock, in which it, as landlord, seeks: (1) damages from the Kobemats for nonpayment of rent, failure to repair, and preventing Green Rock from making repairs; and (2) damages from the Kobemats and McManus for fraud and abuse of process (Green Rock II).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The second writ of error was taken from an order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the trial court, <em>Levine, J., </em>disqualifying Lewis from representing Green Rock in the latter case.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Green Rock I</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">The facts that we have gleaned from the appeal papers and the trial courts\u2019 files are as follows. Green Rock is a New Llampshire corporation. Lewis is an attorney and the president of Green Rock. His wife, Linda Lewis, is also an officer of Green Rock.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Green Rock owned a single-family dwelling in Wallingford, which it leased to the Kobemats for the period from June 1, 1995, through May 31, 1996. At the time that Green Rock and the Kobernats entered into the lease, the house was occupied by another tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">The Kobemats moved into the house before June 1, 1995, although they did not have a key. Upon the Kobernats\u2019 moving, it was discovered that the house had been damaged. James Kobernat then contacted Green Rock regarding the damage to the house. Thereafter, a representative of Green Rock and the Kobemats inspected the house. Green Rock then asked the Kobernats to move out, which they declined to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">Green Rock then brought a summary process action against the Kobemats based on nonpayment of rent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While the summary process action was pending, Green Rock also filed an action for money damages against them. In that action, Green Rock claimed: that it had suffered damages because it had been denied access to the house and, therefore, was unable to make repairs; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>that the Kobemats had not provided for insurance as required by the lease; and that they had not paid rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In their answer in that action, the Kobemats set forth a special defense and a counterclaim. In their counterclaim, the Kobemats alleged violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA); General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42-110a and 42-110b.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In support of their special defense and counterclaim, the Kobemats alleged that the house did not comply with the Wallingford housing code,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that the damage to the house made it uninhabitable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Kobemats alleged, therefore, that no rent was due to Green Rock.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Sometime between June and the end of September, 1995, Green Rock made some, but not all, of the needed repairs to the house. Green Rock did not, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>obtain a certificate of compliance<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> from the town of Wallingford for the house until December 12, 1995. Green Rock then withdrew its complaint, but the counterclaim survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Lewis was Green Rock\u2019s trial attorney in this action from September 19, 1995, through September 11, 1997. On September 11,1997, the trial court disqualified Lewis from representing Green Rock in that case pursuant to rule 3.7 (a)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the Rules of Professional Conduct, on the ground that Lewis would be a material witness at the trial. Thereafter, attorney Bruce A. Chaplin represented Green Rock.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">On March 9, 1998, the Kobemats served Lewis with a subpoena to appear for a deposition on the next day. In response, Green Rock filed a motion to quash, and a motion for a protective order, citing, among other reasons, the attorney-client privilege. The trial court ordered Lewis to appear for a deposition in McManus\u2019 office, and also ruled that it would not \u201crule on matters of privilege in advance,\u201d but that it would \u201cdo that on a question by question basis.\u201d Lewis then appeared in McManus\u2019 office for a deposition, during which he refused to answer nearly every question that he was asked by McManus, claiming the attorney-client privilege.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The Kobemats then filed a motion for sanctions against Green Rock and Lewis. Subsequently, Chaplin moved to withdraw as Green Rock\u2019s counsel, stating, among other reasons, that the \u201cdifficulties between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>two attorneys [had become] insurmountable.\u201d Chaplin\u2019s motion was granted. The trial court granted the motion for sanctions, ordered Lewis, \u201cindividually or as an officer of\u2019 Green Rock, to pay McManus the sum of $750.90,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and to appear in McManus\u2019 office for another deposition on June 16, 1998 at 10 a.m. Lewis paid the $750.90 to McManus, but did not appear for another deposition on June 16, 1998, as ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">On June 12, 1998, Lewis filed the first writ of error in this court, in which he seeks to have us review and set aside the trial court\u2019s order compelling him to appear for a deposition, and to order McManus to return the $750.90 to him. Thereafter, the defendants in error moved to dismiss this first writ of error. We denied that motion without prejudice subject to being reviewed and reconsidered when the writ was argued before us. In addition, we ordered the parties to address several questions, among them the following: \u201cIs the order requiring the witness F. Woodward Lewis to attend a second deposition an interlocutory order that cannot be reviewed at this time?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Subsequently, Lewis filed a motion for supervision of procedure in this court, in which he sought to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>this court stay all the trial court actions pending the outcome of his first writ of error, and to disqualify McManus from continuing to represent the Kobemats, both in the trial court and in this court. In addition, Lewis sought to have this court impose sanctions on McManus for repeatedly attempting to depose him while his writ of error was pending in this court. We denied these motions and, sua sponte, dismissed \u201cthat portion of the writ of error that seeks review of the order requiring F. Woodward Lewis to testify at an upcoming deposition and to bring with him all documents previously ordered by the court or otherwise subpoenaed.\u201d Accordingly, we also modified our previous order by eliminating the question noted previously. We were informed at the oral arguments on the merits of these writs that Lewis has since been deposed to the satisfaction of the defendants in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Green Rock II</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">In April, 1998, Green Rock brought another civil action against the Kobemats and McManus. Initially, Lewis represented Green Rock in that action. The Kobemats moved to disqualify Lewis from representing Green Rock as its attorney in that action. The trial court granted the motion to disqualify Lewis. Lewis then filed the second writ of error in this court seeking reversal of the trial court\u2019s order disqualifying him as Green Rock\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">In his first writ of error, Lewis claims that the trial court improperly: (1) ordered him to attend another deposition; and (2) imposed monetary sanctions on him. We dismiss this writ of error for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">First, we conclude that any claim regarding the propriety of the order of the trial court directing Lewis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>to appear for another deposition is moot. \u201c[M]ootness implicates the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d <em>Goodson </em>v. <em>State, </em>228 Conn. 106, 114, 635 A.2d 285 (1993). \u201cIt is a well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. ... In the absence of an actual and existing controversy for us to adjudicate . . . the courts of this state may not be used as a vehicle to obtain judicial opinions upon points of law . . .and where the question presented is purely academic, we must refuse to entertain the appeal.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>184 Conn. 434, 436, 439 A.2d 1055 (1981). \u201cWhen, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>233 Conn. 370, 378, 660 A.2d 323 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The controversy in the present case arises out of a discovery order, which, according to Lewis, would have led him to violate the attorney-client privilege by compelling him to disclose, to Green Rock\u2019s adversaries, information that he had obtained through his professional relationship with Green Rock. We dismissed this aspect of the writ prior to the oral arguments. Consequently, Lewis has been deposed to the satisfaction of the defendants in error. To the extent, therefore, that the writ of error challenges the trial court\u2019s order requiring Lewis to attend the deposition, the writ is moot because there is no longer a viable controversy for which we can provide a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Lewis also seeks, however, to have this court order McManus to return the sum he paid pursuant to the trial court\u2019s monetary sanctions order. Given the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>of this case, and our well established rules regarding reviewability of discovery orders, the sanctions order with which Lewis complied does not constitute a final judgment from which a writ of error lies. Just as an appeal, a writ of error requires a final judgment as a predicate. See Practice Book \u00a7 72-1; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>189 Conn. 42, 51, 454 A.2d 266 (1983) (\u201cthe use of a writ of error would in no way overcome the objections ... to the appeal process based upon . . . the absence of finality in the judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u201cAn order issued upon a motion for discovery is ordinarily not appealable because it does not constitute a final judgment, at least in civil actions.\u201d <em>Chrysler Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Fairfield Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>180 Conn. 223, 226, 429 A.2d 478 (1980); see also <em>Presidential Capital Corp. </em>v. <em>Reale, </em>240 Conn. 623, 625, 692 A.2d 794 (1997) (\u201c[t]he general rule established by our case law is that an interlocutory order requiring a witness to submit to discovery is not a final judgment and, therefore, is not immediately appealable\u201d). \u201c[W]e require that those ordered to comply with discovery be found in contempt of court before we consider an appeal . . . .\u201d <em>Barboto </em>v. <em>J. &amp; M. Corp., </em>194 Conn. 245, 249, 478 A.2d 1020 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Although this sanctions order was not itself a discovery order, it was an order for sanctions for failure to comply with the discovery procedure of a deposition. We can perceive no reason or policy why we should treat the sanctions order differently, for purposes of finality of judgment, from the discovery procedure of which it is a part. We, therefore, regard it as governed by the same principles of finality as discovery orders. Accordingly, we conclude that, in order for a deponent to challenge such a sanctions order by a writ of error, it is necessary for him to refuse to comply and be held in contempt therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>In the present case, Lewis was ordered by the trial court to pay McManus the sum of $750.90, in order to compensate McManus for the costs and legal fees that he had incurred in preparing for, and conducting, the deposition. Lewis paid the $750.90, thus satisfying the order. He was not held in contempt. There was, therefore, no final judgment in this case for the purpose of appellate review by way of a writ of error.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, we dismiss this writ for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">In the second writ of error, Lewis challenges the order of the trial court disqualifying him from representing Green Rock in its action against the defendants in error. Specifically, Lewis claims that the trial court improperly disqualified him as the trial attorney for Green Rock. We recently held that a disqualified attorney does not have standing to challenge the disqualification order by way of a writ of error. <em>Crone </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>250 Conn. 476, 477, 736 A.2d 131 (1999). That conclusion disposes of this writ of error, and requires its dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The writs of error are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-10\"> Practice Book \u00a7 72-1 provides: \u201c(a) Writs of error for errors in matters of law only may be brought from a final judgment of the superior court to the supreme court.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">\u201c(b) No writ of error may be brought in any civil or criminal proceeding for the correction of any error where (1) the error might have been reviewed by process of appeal, or by way of certification, or (2) the parties, by failure timely to seek a transfer or otherwise, have consented to have the case determined by a court or tribunal from whose judgment there is no right of appeal or opportunity for certification.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-6\"> Green Rock also is named as a plaintiff in error in both writs of error. Because Green Rock is a party to both cases underlying the writs of error; see parts I A and B of this opinion; any claims it may have regarding the propriety of the orders of the trial courts may be addressed through an appeal. Green Rock, therefore, may not have its claims reviewed through these writs. See Practice Book \u00a7 72-1. To the extent, therefore, that the writs of error involve Green Rock as a plaintiff in error, the writs must be dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\"> Green Rock II was initiated by Green Rock against the Kobemats. The Kobemats counterclaimed for damages, alleging that Green Rock had violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. Green Rock thereafter withdrew its claims against the Kobemats. Consequently, only the Kobemats\u2019 counterclaim against Green Rock remains to be litigated. See part I A of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"><em> </em>McManus has appeared pro se with respect to these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b509-12\"> The summary process action was dismissed on September 14, 1995. Green Rock also filed another summary process action, and another civil action against the Kobernats. There is no record before this court regarding the substance and the outcomes of those actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a)provides: \u201cNo person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Under General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a (4), \u201c \u2018[t]rade\u2019 and \u2018commerce\u2019 means the advertising, the sale or rent or lease, the offering for sale or rent or lease, or the distribution of any services and any property, tangible or intangible, real, personal or mixed, and any other article, commodity, or thing of value in this state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b510-9\"> Section 167-3 of the Wallingford housing code provides in relevant part: \u201cA.
