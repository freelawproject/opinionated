Because we conclude that the trial court improperly precluded the state from introducing the defendant\u2019s grand jury testimony, we reverse the judgment of the trial court dismissing the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. In February, 1993, the chief state\u2019s attorney and the state\u2019s attorney in Hartford applied to the investigatory grand jury panel pursuant to General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 5447c<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the appointment of a grand jury to investigate possible illegal conduct by certain members of the Connecticut state police and the Hartford police department, among others. The grand jury panel approved the application and Judge Aaron Ment, then the chief court administrator, appointed Judge Arthur L. Spada, judge trial referee, to serve as the grand juror. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 54-47d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The investigation began on March 29, 1993, and continued through August 16, 1994. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>December 13, 1993, the defendant, in response to a subpoena, appeared before the grand jury and was placed under oath by the grand juror. In the presence of senior assistant state\u2019s attorney Paul Murray (state\u2019s attorney), the grand juror conveyed the following order of secrecy to the defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u201cThe Court: . . . [I]n a few minutes . . . [the state\u2019s attorney] will be advising you as he does all the witnesses. I\u2019m also required to advise you, as I do every witness that comes before us, [about] an order of secrecy that I\u2019m going to place you under. It not only covers you, but every individual in this room. So any of the questions that are asked of you, the subject matter and any of the answers that you may give are protected by an order of confidentiality and secrecy. That is, no one in this room can reveal to anybody outside this room who was in this afternoon to talk to us, and no one can tell anybody outside this room what questions were asked of you and what answers you gave. So the answers you give will also be confidentially protected. Conversely, if you go out of this building or anywhere in this building and discuss with anyone the fact that you\u2019re here, who was present in the room, what questions were asked of you and what answers you gave, that would violate the order of confidentiality and this order of secrecy, and would expose you to an arrest for criminal contempt. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes, I do Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">After receiving an advisement of his rights from the state\u2019s attorney,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as required by General Statutes \u00a7 54-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>47f,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendant proceeded to testify. Following the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>completion of the grand jury investigation, the grand juror, in a final report, concluded, inter alia, that probable cause existed to believe that as many as twenty-four persons had committed various crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">On October 24, 1994, the defendant was charged in the present case with one count of larceny in the first degree<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-122 (a) (4) <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> prior to trail, the defendant moved in limine to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>preclude the state from using his grand jury testimony as evidence in its case-in-chief against him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In support of his motion, the defendant maintained that, because our statutes relating to investigatory grand juries; General Statutes \u00a7 54-47a et seq.; do not expressly authorize the state to introduce a defendant\u2019s grand jury testimony in its case-in-chief, such use is barred under common-law principles of grand jury secrecy.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The trial court, <em>Koletsky, J., </em>filed an expensive memorandum of decision granting the defendant\u2019s motion. After discussing the history and the law pertaining to investigatory grand juries in Connecticut, the trial court concluded: \u201cThere are, to be sure, numerous policy reasons for preserving grand jury secrecy, and while many of those reasons no longer obtain after the conclusion of the grand jury proceedings, certainly the thought that witnesses who learned that their testimony was not sacrosanct will be deterred from future uninhibited testimony, as will others not involved in that particular grand jury process. See <em>In re Investigation of the Grand Juror into Cove Manor Convalescent Center, Inc., </em>[4 Conn. App. 544, 495 A.2d 1098 (1985), appeal dismissed, 203 Conn. 1, 522 A.2d 1228 (1987)].</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\u201c[The Connecticut] Supreme Court has instructed that where the traditional secrecy of grand jury proceedings is well entrenched in the common law, any change in that law must be strictly construed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Canady, </em>187 Conn. 281, 287, 445 A.2d 895 (1982). While the legislature has lessened grand jury secrecy in many ways in recent years, it notably has <em>not </em>done so in expressly permitting use by the state of grand jury testimony as evidence. No radical departure from the long standing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>policy of preserving grand jury secrecy which is well entrenched in the common law is warranted unless the language of the statute unequivocally expresses such an intent. <em>In re Investigation of the Grand Juror into Cove Manor Convalescent Center, Inc., </em>supra, 4 Conn. App. 554. The court concludes that the common law of Connecticut is still in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u201cThat the prosecution has access to testimony from the grand jury proceeding is clear. From that access it is to be presumed that further investigative work should permit the development of evidence from other sources. In [this] case, no request for release of grand jury transcripts for use in the state\u2019s case-in-chief has been made [under General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g (a)], <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> nor has there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>been any attempt to demonstrate a \u2018particularized need. \u2019 Whether, in a particular case, that would be availing, this court does not now decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\u201cWhat this court does decide is that in the present case, in which [the] defendant was given both a promise and a warning of confidentiality and secrecy as to his testimony, the state cannot use that testimony in its case-in-chief. Indeed, since the grand juror imposed an order of secrecy on the witness as to his testimony, it may well be that the defendant would be precluded from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>taking the stand to deny the accuracy of the transcript, unless released from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u201cThis is an issue which the legislature may wish to address, but the decision to change three centuries of this state\u2019s common law is one that this court does not believe is its function.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\u201cThe motion in limine is granted and the state is precluded from offering any grand jury testimony as direct evidence in the state\u2019s case-in-chief . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>45 Conn. Sup. 1, 9-11, 697 A.2d 736 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Thereafter, the trial court granted the state\u2019s motions to dismiss the information<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and for permission to appeal. The state appealed from the judgment of dismissal to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to what is now Practice Book \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">On appeal, the state challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to preclude it from introducing the defendant\u2019s grand jury testimony in its case-in-chief. In support of its claim, the state maintains that the use of such testimony is authorized under \u00a7 54-47g, which governs the disclosure and use of grand jury testimony. The state also contends that, to the extent that the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the defendant\u2019s motion in limine is predicated upon the defendant\u2019s detrimental reliance on the grand juror\u2019s order of secrecy, the defendant never established such reliance and, consequently, the trial court reasonably could not have limited the state\u2019s use of the defendant\u2019s grand jury testimony on the basis of that order of secrecy. The defendant concedes that the state may introduce his grand jury testimony in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>case-in-chief in a prosecution for perjury, and that it may use his testimony to cross-examine him in this case if he testifies at trial. The defendant also acknowledges that the state may use his grand jury testimony to develop information regarding the defendant\u2019s alleged larcenous conduct. The defendant claims, however, that the state cannot otherwise use his testimony in its casein-chief absent a determination by the grand jury panel, pursuant to \u00a7 54-47g, that such use is \u201cin the public interest.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g (a); see footnote 8 of this opinion. The defendant further contends that the grand juror\u2019s order of secrecy provided the trial court with a sufficient, independent basis upon which to preclude the state from using the defendant\u2019s grand jury testimony in the state\u2019s case-in-chief. We agree with the state and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">We first consider whether our statutes governing the conduct of investigatory grand juries prohibit the state from using the defendant\u2019s grand jury testimony against him in its case-in-chief. We conclude that they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u201c[T]he one-man investigatory grand jury is purely a creature of statute . . . .\u201d <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>213 Conn. 66, 70, 566 A.2d 426 (1989). Thus, our analysis of whether the defendant\u2019s grand jury testimony may be introduced during the state\u2019s case-in-chief is guided by well established principles of statutory interpretation. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [O]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Double A Transportation, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 21, 25, 727 A.2d 204 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Our point of departure is the pertinent statutory language. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-47a through 54-47h delineate the procedures governing investigatory grand juries in Connecticut. The parties agree that the relevant statutory provisions do not explicitly address the question of whether the state may use the grand jury testimony of a witness in its case-in-chief in a subsequent criminal proceeding in which that witness is the defendant. Those statutoiy provisions, however, contain no express bar to such use of grand jury testimony by the state. This revelation has special relevance in light of the fact that General Statutes \u00a7 54-45a (b),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which governs <em>indicting </em>grand juries, <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> expressly prohibits the subsequent use of such testimony. As evidenced by \u00a7 54-45a (b), if the legislature had wanted to prohibit the state from introducing a witness\u2019 testimony before an investigatory grand jury in the state\u2019s case-in-chief against that witness, it easily could have done so. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Love, </em>246 Conn. 402, 411-12, 717 A.2d 670 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Furthermore, \u00a7 54-47g (a) affords prosecutors \u201caccess\u201d to the grand jury record upon request and without a hearing. A commonly used definition of the term \u201caccess\u201d is the \u201cfreedom or ability to obtain or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number><em>make use of .. . </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. Thus, in common parlance, \u00a7 54-47g (a) permits prosecutors to \u201cmake use of\u2019 the grand jury material in the performance of their duties. The legislature did not expressly limit the \u201cuse\u201d to which a prosecutor may put such testimony in the otherwise proper discharge of that prosecutor\u2019s responsibilities; this fact belies the defendant\u2019s contention that the state is barred from introducing his grand jury testimony in its case-in-chief against him. See <em>Stein </em>v. <em>Hillebrand, </em>240 Conn. 35, 40, 688 A.2d 1317 (1997) (\u201c[w]e will not impute to the legislature an intent to limit [a] term where such intent does not otherwise appear in the language of the statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Indeed, the defendant concedes, and we agree, that the state\u2019s access to his grand jury testimony would permit the state to use that testimony to develop other incriminating evidence, and that <em>secondary </em>evidence could be introduced by the state in its case-in-chief. It would be a bizarre interpretation of the concept of \u201caccess to testimony\u201d to say that it may be used to incriminate the witness secondarily but not directly. We decline to read statutes so as to reach bizarre or absurd results. <em>Fimiani </em>v. <em>Star Gallo Distributors, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 635, 651, 729 A.2d 212 (1999). This is particularly apt in view of the <em>purpose </em>of the investigative grand jury: to determine whether <em>crimes </em>have been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Section 54-47g (a) also provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this section . . . any person may file an application with the [grand jury] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>panel for disclosure of any such part of the record. Upon receipt of such application, the panel shall, after notice, hold a hearing and the panel, by a majority vote, may disclose any such part of the record when such disclosure is deemed by the panel to be in the public interest . . . .\u201d The phrase \u201cexcept as otherwise provided\u201d is most plausibly interpreted as referring to the fact that the court, the grand jury panel and the designated prosecutorial personnel have unfettered access to the grand jury proceedings, and, consequently, need not petition the panel for authorization to use those materials in discharging their duty to investigate and prosecute crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Moreover, in the absence of persuasive evidence to the contrary, we may presume that a word used in different parts of the same statutory scheme has the same meaning. See, e.g., <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>223 Conn. 336, 343, 612 A.2d 1203 (1992) (\u201cwhere the same words are used in a statute two or more times they will ordinarily be given the same meaning in each instance\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Section 54-47g (g) provides in relevant part: \u201cNotwithstanding the existence of an order of nondisclosure under this section, the presiding judge ... or his designee, shall grant any written request of a person accused of a crime as a result of the investigation to have <em>access, </em>at all reasonable times, to the record of his own testimony and to obtain a copy of such record.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It would be strange, indeed, for the legislature to have granted a defendant an absolute right of access to his or her own grand jury testimony and then require the defendant to apply to the grand jury panel for permission, under \u00a7 54-47g (a), to publish that testimony at his or her trial. If a defendant\u2019s right of access to his or her testimony under \u00a7 54-47g (g) includes the right to publish that testimony at trial, which seems perfectly reasonable, then we see no reason why the state\u2019s right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>of access to the defendant\u2019s grand jury testimony is not similarly unconditional.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The defendant nevertheless argues that, because the common law favored secrecy and confidentiality in grand jury proceedings, we necessarily must resolve any claim under our statutory scheme in favor of secrecy unless those statutory provisions explicitly have abrogated the requirement of secrecy. We disagree. Although the common law embraced a principle of secrecy in grand jury proceedings,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it generally recognized such secrecy only when it was necessary to further the purposes of grand jury confidentiality. See <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation by Judge John M. Alexander, </em>207 Conn. 98, 107, 540 A.2d 49 (1988) (\u201cpublic disclosure of grand jury proceedings must be regulated with an eye to the recognized importance of secrecy in the proper functioning of the grand jury system\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence (4th Ed. 1961) \u00a7 2360, pp. 731-32 (limitations on secrecy must depend upon reasons for secrecy). \u201cSafeguarding the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings serves a number of functions. First, if preindictment proceedings were made public, many prospective witnesses would be hesitant to come forward voluntarily, knowing that those against whom they testify would be aware of that testimony. Moreover, witnesses who appeared before the grand jury would be less likely to testify fully and frankly, as they would be open to retribution as well as to inducements. There also would be the risk that those about to be indicted would flee, or would try to influence individual grand jurors to vote against indictment. Finally, by preserving the secrecy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>of the proceedings, we assure that persons who are accused but exonerated by the grand jury will not be held up to public ridicule. <em>Douglas Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Petrol Stops Northwest, </em>[441 U.S. 211, 219, 99 S. Ct. 1667, 60 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1979)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Final Grand Jury Report Concerning the Torrington Police Dept., </em>197 Conn. 698, 709-10, 501 A.2d 377 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The secrecy of grand jury proceedings, however, never has had as a goal the protection of grand jury witnesses who, without immunity, voluntarily incriminate themselves during their sworn testimony. Rather, grand jury secrecy is intended to protect against the premature disclosure of information in advance of the completion of the investigation, and to ensure that information gathered during the investigation is not disclosed without sufficient reason. When the investigation has been completed, the persuasive force of the arguments in favor of secrecy are greatly diminished. \u201c[0]bviously the secrecy that is guaranteed is only <em>temporary </em>and provisional. Permanent secrecy would be more than is necessary to render the witness willing. . . . [The need for secrecy] ceases when the grand jury has finished its duties and has either indicted or discharged the persons accused.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) 8 J. Wigmore, supra, \u00a7 2362, p. 736. The common law, therefore, recognized that the veil of secrecy surrounding grand jury proceedings may be lifted when and if the purposes of protecting witnesses and preventing premature disclosure of information are no longer served.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Moreover, the legislative genealogy of \u00a7 54-47g reveals a distinct trend away from a policy of rigid nondisclosure in grand jury matters. The first statutory provision to include procedures for investigatory grand juries, which was enacted in 1941, allowed the proceedings, testimony and final report to be made public in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>the discretion of the trial court. See General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1941) \u00a7 889f.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>In 1985, the legislature significantly expanded the statutory provisions relating to investigatory grand juries for the purpose of streamlining the grand jury process, increasing the accountability and openness of such investigations and expanding public access to the findings and records. For example, Public Acts 1985, No. 85-611 (P.A. 85-611), empowered the grand jury panel, by majority vote, to disclose the finding and record of grand jury proceedings upon a determination that such disclosure would \u201cbe in the public interest.\u201d P.A. 85-611, \u00a7 6, codified at General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 54-47g (a). The act further provided that any witness or any person accused of a crime as a result of a grand jury investigation may have access to the record of his or her own grand juiy testimony. P.A. 85-611, \u00a7 6, codified at General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 54-47g (b) and (c).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>In 1987, the legislature further increased the accessibility of grand jury materials by adding a provision that allowed state\u2019s attorneys to receive the record and transcripts of grand jury proceedings upon request and without a hearing. See Public Acts 1987, No. 87-350, \u00a7 5 (P.A. 87-350).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Recognizing the central role of the prosecutor in the grand jury process, the legislative purpose behind this amendment was to facilitate the prosecutors\u2019 receipt of copies of grand jury testimony and records for use in the investigation and prosecution of crime. See 30 H.R. Proc., Pt. 19, 1987 Sess., p. 6922, remarks of Representative Jay B. Levin; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 3, 1987 Sess., p. 945, remarks of John Kelly, chief state\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In 1988, the legislature cut back even further on the confidentiality of the grand juror\u2019s findings and conclusions. Public Acts 1988, No. 88-345 (P.A. 88-345), provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he finding of the investigation shall be open to public inspection and copying . . . seven calendar days after it has been filed, unless within that period the chief state\u2019s attorney or a state\u2019s attorney . . . [requests] that a part or all of such finding not be so disclosed. The finding may include all or such part of the record as the investigatory grand jury may determine . . . .\u201d P.A. 88-345, \u00a7 1, codified at General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 54-47g (b). This amendment, in effect, established a rebuttable presumption of disclosure: in the event that the chief state\u2019s attorney seeks to seal the record, \u201cthe investigatory grand jury shall conduct a hearing . . . [and] shall deny any such motion unless it makes specific findings of fact on the record that there is a substantial probability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>that one of the following interests will be prejudiced by publicity that nondisclosure would prevent, and that reasonable alternatives to nondisclosure cannot adequately protect that interest: (1) The right of a person to a fair trial; (2) the prevention of potential defendants from fleeing; (3) the prevention of subornation of perjury or tampering with witnesses; or (4) the protection of the lives and reputations of innocent persons which would be significantly damaged by the release of uncorroborated information.\u201d P.A. 88-345, \u00a7 1, codified at General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 54-47g (c). In the same public act, the legislature also authorized \u201cany person\u201d to \u201cfile an application with the [grand jury] panel for disclosure of any . . . part of [a grand jury] record\u201d; P.A. 88-345, \u00a7 1, codified at General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 54-47g (a); and empowered the panel to grant such application if, after notice and a hearing, it determines, by a majority vote, that disclosure would \u201cbe in the public interest.\u201d P.A. 88-345, \u00a7 1, codified at General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 54-47g (a). Section 54-47g has not been amended since 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">This development of \u00a7 54-47g demonstrates that, over time, the legislature has provided for increased disclosure of grand jury proceedings and testimony. Recognizing the purposes behind the common-law presumption regarding the confidentiality and secrecy of grand jury proceedings, the statute favors disclosure after the grand jury has completed its investigation. Thus, neither the reasons for common-law secrecy nor the current statutory scheme preclude the state from using the defendant\u2019s incriminating grand jury testimony in its case-in-chief against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Finally, the statutory interpretation urged by the state is identical to that followed by the federal courts under rule 6 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. We previously have been guided by federal law in construing our own investigatory grand jury statutes. See, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>e.g., <em>In re Final Grand Jury Report Concerning the Torrington Police Dept. </em>supra, 197 Conn. 712 (\u201c[t]he test of \u2018particularized need\u2019 under the federal cases is therefore an entirely appropriate measure of the discretionary authority conferred upon the Superior Court by \u00a7 54-47 [g]\u201d). Rule 6 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, like the provisions governing investigatory grand juries in this state, vests \u201cthe attorney for the government\u201d with complete access to federal grand jury proceeding materials, whereas no such access is available to other persons absent a court order.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See Fed. R. Crim. P. 6 (e) (3) (C) (i). Similarly, rule 6 (e) contains no prohibition against the use of grand jury testimony by federal prosecutors who, acting in the discharge of their official duties, routinely use such testimony in criminal prosecutions and related proceedings without prior approval from the United States District Court, which exercises supervisory authority over the federal grand jury process.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>The defendant also asserts that, if the state wishes to introduce his grand jury testimony in its case-in-chief, the trial court first must find, under \u00a7 54-47g (a), that such disclosure is \u201cin the public interest.\u201d We disagree. Because the state, under that same statutory subsection, has an absolute right to obtain grand jury testimony from the clerk of the court,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> it would be redundant to require the state to seek \u201cdisclosure\u201d of the testimony from the grand jury panel. Furthermore, the unique role our prosecutors play in assisting the grand jury and prosecuting crimes exposed during the course of the grand jury investigation strongly suggests that the legislature did not intend that prosecutors would be required to seek special permission to use such testimony.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It would make little sense for the legislature to have granted prosecutors access to all grand jury testimony and transcripts and then lump them together with the press and private litigants by requiring them to apply to the grand jury panel for permission to use the transcripts to prove its case in a prosecution against the witness. Moreover, requiring a prosecutor to petition the grand jury panel, pursuant to \u00a7 54-47g, for permission to use a witness\u2019 grand jury testimony in the state\u2019s case-in-chief against that witness would result in a waste of judicial resources. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>virtually is impossible to imagine a scenario in which the grand jury panel reasonably could conclude that the public interest would not warrant the state\u2019s use of such testimony for the puipose of proving a crime that the grand jury found probably was committed, and with which the defendant has been charged. In light of this fact, it is difficult to discern any reason why the legislature would have required the state to make an independent showing that such use is in the public interest.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the state\u2019s right of access to the testimony of a grand jury witness includes the right to use that testimony in its case-in-chief in a subsequent criminal prosecution of that witness. We now turn to the question of whether the order of secrecy imposed by the grand juror in this case requires a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The defendant claims that, even if the statutory scheme does not prohibit the state from using the defendant\u2019s grand jury testimony against him in the state\u2019s case-in-chief, the state nevertheless is foreclosed from doing so in this case based on the grand juror\u2019s order of secrecy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">At the outset, we note that the precise basis for the trial court\u2019s ruling in this case is not clear. Although virtually all of the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision is devoted to a discussion of the defendant\u2019s statutory claim; see generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 45 Conn. Sup. 1; it appears that the court\u2019s decision is based, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>least in part, on the grand juror\u2019s order of secrecy. See id., 9-10.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">To the extent that the trial court\u2019s ruling <em>is </em>predicated upon the grand juror\u2019s order of secrecy, it lacks support in the record because the defendant never established\u2014 indeed, he never claimed \u2014 that he had relied to his detriment on the grand juror\u2019s order of secrecy. The defendant bore the burden of establishing such reliance because the grand juror\u2019s instruction was not so clear and unambiguous as to require a finding of detrimental reliance. The fact that the instructions were given by a judge serving as a grand juror is not dispositive of what the defendant <em>actually understood </em>those instructions to mean. Accordingly, in the absence of proof of a nexus between the grand juror\u2019s instructions and the defendant\u2019s testimony \u2014 in other words, in the absence of a showing of detrimental reliance \u2014 the defendant cannot prevail. See, e.g., <em>State v. Carter, </em>243 Conn. 392,398-401, 703 A.2d 763 (1997) (trial court error in plea canvass did not affect validity of defendant\u2019s voluntary guilty plea); <em>State </em>v. <em>Domian, </em>235 Conn. 679, 687-92, 668 A.2d 1333 (1996) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>197 Conn. 247, 256-59, 496 A.2d 513 (1985) (police promises of leniency did not vitiate defendant\u2019s voluntary confession).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">We reach this conclusion for two essential reasons. First, the defendant, a trained law enforcement officer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>reasonably could have interpreted the order of secrecy to be limited, both in time and in scope, to the pendency of the grand jury investigation. For example, in instructing the defendant, the grand juror stated that the defendant could be held in contempt if the defendant breached the confidentiality of the proceedings. A necessary implication of this statement is that the state, in prosecuting and proving a contempt violation, would be required to introduce evidence of what had occurred during the grand jury proceedings. Furthermore, the advisement of rights the state\u2019s attorney gave to the defendant, which carried the imprimatur of the grand juror and which was given in his presence,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> informed the defendant that he could be prosecuted for perjury. Any such prosecution naturally would require the state to introduce the defendant\u2019s grand jury testimony in its case-in-chief. Finally, the secrecy order contained no language indicating that it was of permanent duration and, therefore, the defendant reasonably could have understood only that the order applied until the grand jury completed its investigation.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Second, neither the grand juror nor the state\u2019s attorney ever expressly advised the defendant that the state could not use his testimony against him in a subsequent criminal proceeding. On the contrary, the state\u2019s attorney informed the defendant that he was \u201cat least a potential target of [the] investigation,\u201d and that he was entitled to assert his fifth amendment privilege if he \u201c[felt] that, in some way, [his testimony] might incriminate [him] in the commission of a crime.\u201d These admonitions, together with the other relevant facts, give rise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>to a reasonable probability that the defendant was not misled to his detriment by the grand juror\u2019s order of secrecy.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In sum, only the defendant knows whether he testified before the grand jury because he believed, on the basis of the grand juror\u2019s advisement, that the state\u2019s right to use his testimony against him was limited in the manner he now claims. If, as a result of the grand juror\u2019s instructions, the defendant did harbor such a belief, then it was his burden to establish that fact. The question, therefore, is not whether the defendant reasonably <em>could have relied </em>on the advisement to his detriment, but whether he <em>did detrimentally rely </em>on that advisement. If the defendant had, in fact, relied to his detriment on the grand juror\u2019s order of secrecy, one would have expected him to seek to establish that fact, either in support of his motion in limine or in support of his motion to suppress his testimony. See footnote 7 of this opinion. In any event, in the absence of such proof, the trial court could not reasonably have concluded that the grand juror\u2019s order of secrecy barred the state from using the defendant\u2019s grand jury testimony against him in its case-in-chief.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the defendant\u2019s motion in hmine, and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C.

In support of his claim, the defendant asserts that, because the state could not subpoena him to testify at his own trial, it should not be able to obtain his testimony pursuant to a grand jury subpoena and then use his testimony against him to prove his guilt in a subsequent criminal trial. In essence, the defendant claims that the state\u2019s use of his grand jury testimony at his criminal trial violates his fifth amendment right not to be a witness against himself. We reject this claim. The defendant was advised of his rights immediately prior to testifying before the grand jury, including his fifth amendment privilege to refuse to answer any question if doing so would have tended to incriminate him. The record reflects, therefore, that the defendant knowingly and freelywaived his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. In such circumstances, it cannot be said that the use of his testimony against him implicates his right to refrain from incriminating himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b226-6\"> As we have indicated, \u00a7 54-47g (a) grants the state access to the <em>record </em>of the entire grand jury investigation merely upon request made to the clerk of the court and without a hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b226-7\"> For example, in conducting its investigation, the grand jury may request assistance from the chief state\u2019s attorney or a state\u2019s attorney.

The dispositive issue in this case is the effect of an unconditional order of secrecy given to a witness by a grand juror conducting investigatoiy grand jury proceedings. Specifically, if such a witness subsequently is charged with criminal misconduct, should the trial court grant a motion in limine to preclude the state from using the witness\u2019 grand jury testimony in the state\u2019s case-in-chief? The majority would allow the witness\u2019 testimony to be so used in the absence of a factual showing by the witness that he relied on the order of secrecy.

Alexander, </em>207 Conn. 98, 107, 540 A.2d 49 (1988). In subsequent proceedings arising out of Judge Spada\u2019s grand jury investigation, two other grand jury witnesses persuaded the investigatory grand jury panel that release of certain parts of the grand jury record to the movants was in the public interest. The state, however, filed no disclosure request with the panel until after the trial court had granted the defendant\u2019s motion in limine. The panel refused to consider the merits of the state\u2019s request during the pendency of its appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The majority now concludes that, despite the absence of a timely disclosure request, the trial court should have permitted the state to introduce the disputed testimony because \u00a7 54-47g, by affording the state \u201caccess to [the grand jury] record,\u201d unconditionally authorized the state to use the disputed evidence in its case-in-chief. Under the circumstances of this case, I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>As a general matter, the issue of construing the grand jury statutes strikes me as more problematic than it appears to the majority. I recognize that the investigatory grand jury is a creature of statute. <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>213 Conn. 66, 70, 566 A.2d 426 (1989). In construing grand jury statutes, however, we have applied the principle of strict construction whenever the legislature has sought to diminish the traditional common-law secrecy of grand jury proceedings. The principle of grand jury secrecy \u201cis well entrenched in the common law \u2014 \u2018older than our Nation itself,\u2019 <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>360 U.S. 395, 399, 79 S. Ct. 1237, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1323 (1959) . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Canady, </em>187 Conn. 281, 287, 445 A.2d 895 (1982); see also <em>In re Final Grand Jury Report Concerning the Torrington Police Dept., </em>197 Conn. 698, 707-10, 501 A.2d 377 (1985). \u201c[P]ublic disclosure of grand jury proceedings must be regulated with an eye to \u2018the recognized importance of secrecy in the proper functioning of the grand jury system.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation by Judge John M. Alexander, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In light of these precedents, unlike the majority, I am not persuaded that the most significant reference point afforded by our common-law tradition is that \u201cthe veil of secrecy surrounding grand jury proceedings may be lifted when and if the purposes of [that secrecy] are no longer served.\u201d Although that may well be the federal practice, our case law has traditionally assigned a more central role to grand jury secrecy than the majority\u2019s statement would suggest. That central role reflects an ongoing concern for the privacy interests of those who are required to testify at grand jury hearings, typically as a result of a subpoena, and typically without the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">If we take grand jury secrecy as the background against which to construe grand jury statutes, then it seems to me important that our statutes, as currently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>drafted, provide no explicit authorization for the state to introduce into evidence, in its case-in-chief, testimony that a defendant gave as a witness before an investigatory grand jury. The majority points to General Statutes \u00a7 54-45a (b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> under which evidence given by a witness before an <em>indicting </em>grand jury \u201cmay not be used as evidence in any proceeding against the accused . . .\u201d except for limited purposes such as challenges to the accuracy or veracity of a witness. One inference to be drawn from that statute, as the majority suggests, is that no such limitation obtains in the case of an <em>investigatory </em>grand jury. An alternate inference, however, is that the legislature knew how to address the issue of \u201cuse\u201d expressly and chose not to do so, perhaps for the reason that such \u201cuse\u201d had not been an issue for testimony given before investigatory grand juries. At the very least, the inference drawn by the majority is debatable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">My view of the statutory construction question can best be summed up by the phrase \u201cnot proven.\u201d The best resolution would be for the legislature itself to revisit the question and to clarify its intention. Under the circumstances of this case, I think we would do well to await such legislative clarification because, contrary to the majority, I am persuaded that the order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>secrecy given to the defendant by the grand juror in this case should be given legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The underlying facts of record are not disputed. On February 10, 1993, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7\u00a7 54-47c and 54-47d,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> an investigatory grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>jury panel of judges concluded that the administration of justice required an investigation to determine whether or not there was probable cause to believe that a crime or crimes had been committed by state and local law enforcement officers. On February 24, 1993, the chief court administrator appointed Judge Arthur L. Spada, judge trial referee, to conduct the investigation. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-47d. The investigation began on March 29, 1993, and continued until August 16, 1994. On December 13, 1993, the defendant was subpoenaed to testify before the grand juror. On October 24, 1994, the defendant was arrested and charged with the crimes of larceny in the first degree and larceny in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">At the outset of the grand jury proceedings, the defendant received two instructions about the testimony that he was about to give. One instruction was given by the grand juror, and the other was given by Paul Murray, an assistant state\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In the presence of the assistant state\u2019s attorney, the grand juror told the defendant to obey an order of secrecy that not only precluded the defendant from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>disclosing his grand jury testimony but also purported to preclude such disclosure by every individual in the hearing room. The grand juror warned the defendant that failure to obey the order of secrecy would expose him to the risk of criminal contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">In accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 54-47f,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the assistant state\u2019s attorney then instructed the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>about his duties as a witness. The assistant state\u2019s attorney informed the defendant that: (1) false testimony might expose him to a perjury charge; (2) he had a constitutional privilege to refuse to testify if such testimony would tend to incriminate him; (3) a court might nonetheless direct him to testify, but, in that case, he would receive immunity from prosecution with regard to that testimony; (4) he had a right to counsel; and (5) he was being questioned as a potential target of the grand juiy investigation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The majority opinion accepts the view of the state that a right of \u201caccess\u201d affords the state an unlimited right of prosecutorial use. The state argues that the statute places no limitations on its use of the defendant\u2019s grand jury testimony because that testimony was not compelled. Because it is undisputed that the defendant is not eligible for the immunities conferred by General Statutes \u00a7 54-47a (b), the state maintains that he has no exclusionary rights whatsoever. The state envisages only two universes: compelled testimony and testimony that is not compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In effect the state\u2019s argument, which the majority accepts, is that the only instructions that accurately informed the defendant about his situation when he was before the grand jury were those given to him by the assistant state\u2019s attorney. It was irrelevant that the grand juror told the defendant that he was under an <em>order of secrecy </em>that covered not only the defendant, \u201cbut every individual in this room,\u201d presumably including the assistant state\u2019s attorney. The grand juror said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>nothing meaningful when he stated that \u201cthe questions that are asked of you, the subject matter, and any of the answers that you may give are <em>protected by an order of confidentiality and secrecy. </em>That is, <em>no one </em>in this room can reveal to <em>anybody </em>outside this room who was in this afternoon to talk to us, and <em>no one </em>can tell <em>anybody </em>outside this room what questions were asked of you and what answers you gave. So <em>the answers you give will also be confidentially </em>protected.\u201d The grand juror was likewise saying nothing of consequence when he warned the defendant that if the defendant disclosed the questions and his answers \u201canywhere\u201d to \u201canyone,\u201d then the defendant would be in violation of \u201cthe order of confidentiality and this order of secrecy,\u201d and would be exposed \u201cto an arrest for criminal contempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The majority opinion offers several reasons why the grand juror\u2019s order of secrecy provides no shelter for the defendant. Principally, the majority takes the position that the defendant\u2019s reliance on the grand juror\u2019s order cannot be presumed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant, according <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>to this reasoning, must assert and show a nexus, by way of detrimental reliance, between the grand juror\u2019s order and the testimony that he gave.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The rule that the majority adopts is new to this state. The majority derives it from our case law concerning plea bargains for guilty pleas, such as <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>243 Conn. 392, 398-401, 703 A.2d 763 (1997), in which criminal defendants unsuccessfully have challenged the voluntariness of their pleas on the ground of allegedly misleading omissions by the trial court at the time of the initial plea canvass. That line of cases is, however, distinguishable for two reasons. First, the issue in those cases is the alleged reliance by a defendant on what a trial court failed to say, rather than, as in the present case, on what the grand juror did say. There seems to me to be a world of difference between these two situations. Second, each of those cases involved situations in which the decision that the defendant subsequently came to regret was a decision that he had reached with the advice of counsel. We regularly rely, in those cases, on the presumption that counsel fully explained the governing legal principles to the defendant before the entry of the plea. The defendant in the present case had no counsel, and might well have failed fully to understand the importance of obtaining counsel once the assistant state\u2019s attorney identified him as a possible target of the investigatory grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Despite the inherent weaknesses of the guilty plea canvass analogy, the majority opts for a rale requiring a showing of reliance in fact. It emphasizes that the defendant was a trained police officer, but there is nothing in the record to show that the defendant had any prior acquaintance with investigatory grand jury proceedings. It is speculative to suppose that his training as a police officer would have alerted him to the manner in which contempt and perjury prosecutions would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>tried, if he had violated the order of secrecy or committed perjury. It is disingenuous to characterize the order of secrecy as \u201cnot clear and unambiguous,\u201d because it did not expressly indicate the extent of its duration, when the language used by the grand juror was, on its face, unconditional. Finally, it is not unreasonable for the defendant to have construed an order of secrecy including \u201ceveryone in this room\u201d to be binding on the assistant state\u2019s attorney whose presence the grand juror expressly acknowledged.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The majority focuses its attention not on what the grand juror said but on what he did not say. It may well be the case that attorneys and judges would not take literally the facially unconditional order of secrecy given to the defendant by the grand juror. Professional training would alert such persons to hear what the grand juror said with implicit caveats. Perhaps the assistant state\u2019s attorney understood the grand juror\u2019s order in just that way. In that case, as an officer of the court, and recognizing that the defendant was unaccompanied by counsel, he could well have clarified the situation for the benefit of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">I would not attribute to the defendant a sophisticated understanding of the relationship between grand jury and plenary criminal proceedings for which the record provides no support. Like the trial court, I am persuaded that the defendant was given \u201cboth a promise and a warning of confidentiality and secrecy as to his testimony\u201d on which his reliance should be presumed. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>45 Conn. Sup. 1, 10, 697 A.2d 736 (1997). Someone without legal training whom a judge instructs that \u201cthe answers you give will also be confidentially protected\u201d cannot be expected to read limitations into unconditional language. In my view, it is improper to treat a court order, enforceable by contempt, as an aleatory promise of no consequence without an actual showing of reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>In doing so, the majority ignores the fundamental difference between judicial instructions and instructions given to an accused person by other participants in criminal justice proceedings. In our judicial system, instructions by judges play a unique role. We routinely tell the jury to follow the instructions given by the trial judge, rather than those offered by counsel. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>241 Conn. 322, 352-53, 696 A.2d 944 (1997). We expect the jury to follow judicial instructions to cure the harmful effect of improper actions by counsel. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>227 Conn. 417, 441, 630 A.2d 1043 (1993). In each instance, we presume that the members of the jury will give conclusive weight to the instructions that they have been given. We do not ask the jury, in announcing its verdict, to attest to its reliance on the instructions. The state has cited to us no case in which reliance on express judicial instructions has not been presumed and an evidentiary foundation to establish reliance has been required.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">In sum, grand jury testimony that is given without invocation of constitutional privilege, rather than compelled to be given, must be evaluated in its own context. On the present record, I am persuaded that the most significant aspect of that context for the present defendant was the order of secrecy purporting to preclude future disclosure of his testimony to the public at large in any forum, including the state\u2019s introduction of that testimony in its case-in-chief charging him with criminal misconduct. Although the state intimates that some of the terms in that order were ill-advised and incomplete, I would hold that these flaws, if flaws they were,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> do not defeat the presumption that the defendant relied on the grand juror\u2019s order in toto. There was no reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>for the defendant to perceive any inconsistency between the grand juror\u2019s instructions and those of the state\u2019s attorney. In my view, the defendant must be presumed, under these circumstances, to have given his testimony in reliance on the instructions of the grand juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Because of the specific instructions contained in the order of secrecy given by the grand juror to the defendant, and because of the absence of contemporaneous objection thereto by the state, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119 provides in relevant pari,: \u201cA person commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such property from an owner. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-122 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of larceny in the first degree when he commits larceny as defined in section 53a-119and. . .

The probative power of secondary evidence is not likely to be identical to that of direct evidence. See also General Statutes \u00a7 54-45a.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">Furthermore, the legislature may have considered that a witness, fearing retribution from a third party, may consider his or her exposure to that risk to be exacerbated if his or her own testimony becomes public information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b236-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 54-47c provides: \u201c(a) Any judge of the superior court, appellate court or supreme court, the chief state\u2019s attorney or a state\u2019s attorney may make application to a panel of judges for an investigation into the commission of a crime or crimes whenever such applicant has reasonable belief that the administration of justice requires an investigation to determine whether or not there is probable cause to believe that a crime or crimes have been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u201c(b) Each application for an investigation into the commission of a crime or crimes shall be made in writing upon oath or affirmation to a panel of judges. Each application shall include the following information: (1) The identity of the applicant and his authority to make such application; (2) a full and complete statement of the facts and circumstances relied upon by the applicant to justify his reasonable belief that the investigation will lead to a finding of probable cause that a crime or crimes have been committed; and (3) a full and complete statement of the facts concerning all previous applications known to the applicant, made to any panel of judges, for investigation of any one or more of the same criminal offenses involving any of the same persons specified in the application, including the action taken by the panel on each such application. The panel of judges may require such additional testimony or documentary evidence in support of facts in the application as it deems necessary. Such additional testimony shall be transcribed. If the application is made by the chief state\u2019s attorney or a state\u2019s attorney, it shall also include a full and complete statement of facts showing that other normal investigative procedures with respect to the alleged crime have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or be too dangerous to employ.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 54-47d provides: \u201c(a) If the panel approves the application and orders an investigation into the commission of a crime or crimes, the chief court administrator shall (1) appoint an investigatory grand jury to conduct the investigation and (2) designate the court location in the judicial district where any motions to quash and any contempt proceedings shall be heard and any findings and records of the investigation shall be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">\u201c(b) Each order authorizing the investigation into the commission of a crime or crimes by the panel shall specify: (1) The date of issuance of the order, (2) the period of time within which the investigation is to be conducted, provided in no event shall the investigation be longer than six months from the date the chief court administrator appoints the investigatory grand jury to conduct the investigation, unless an application for an extension of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>time is filed and granted pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, (3) the scope of the investigation, and (4) its reasons for finding that the administration of justice requires an investigation to determine whether or not there is probable cause to believe that a crime or crimes have been committed. The panel shall retain a copy of the order and the original application and shall transmit to the investigatory grand jury, appointed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the original order and a copy of the application filed with the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">\u201c(c) The investigatory grand jury may make an application to the panel of judges for an extension of time within which to conduct its investigation or for an amendment to the scope of its investigation. The application for extension or amendment shall set forth the reasons for the necessity of such extension or amendment. No more than two extensions or amendments of an order may be granted by the issuing panel. The period of any extension shall be no longer than the panel deems necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was granted and in no event shall any extension be for a period longer than six months.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b238-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-47f provides: \u201c(a) The investigatory grand jury, in conducting the investigation, may (1) seek the assistance of the Chief State\u2019s Attorney or state\u2019s attorney who filed the application, or his designee, (2) appoint an attorney to provide assistance if a judge of the Superior Court, Appellate Court or Supreme Court filed the application or (3) appoint any other attorney to provide assistance when necessary in the interest of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\u201c(b) The attendance of witnesses and the production of documents at such investigations may be compelled by subpoena, signed by any official authorized to issue such process.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">\u201c(c) If any witness properly summoned fails to appear or to produce any documents included in the subpoena, or if he fails to answer any proper question, the investigatory grand jury conducting the investigation may report the matter to the state\u2019s attorney for the judicial district which has been designated in subsection (a) of section 54-47d unless such state\u2019s attorney is the applicant or has been appointed to assist in such investigation, in which case the investigatory grand jury shall report the matter to the Chief State\u2019s Attorney, and such state\u2019s attorney or Chief State\u2019s Attorney, as the case may be, may file a complaint setting forth the facts at any criminal session of the superior court in such judicial district. The court shall thereupon issue a citation to the witness to appear before the court and show cause why he should not be punished as for a contempt, and if, after hearing, the court finds that he failed to appear without due cause or failed to produce any document properly to be presented to the investigatory grand jury or failed to answer any proper question in the course of the investigation, it may punish him as it might a witness failing to appear, to produce a document properly to be considered or to answer a proper question before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">\u201c(d) Witnesses may be examined by the investigatory grand jury conducting the investigation or by any attorney or attorneys appointed by such investigatory grand jury for such purpose. At the hearing, the official conducting the investigation shall inform the witness that he has the right to have counsel present and to consult with such counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">\u201c(e) The official conducting the investigation shall inform any witness who is a target of the investigation that he is a target and shall advise him that he has the right under the constitution of the United States and the constitution of Connecticut not to be compelled to be a witness, or to give evidence, against himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u201c(f) Any attorney appointed to assist in conducting the investigation shall disclose to the investigatory grand jury any exculpatory information or material in his possession, custody or control concerning any person who is a target of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">\u201c(g) An official stenographer of the Superior Court or his assistant, shall record any testimony taken at the investigation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b239-10\"> The defendant unsuccessfully challenged the propriety of these instructions in a motion to suppress. See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\"> It is notable that it was not until its reply brief in this court that the state, for the first time, raised the argument that the defendant cannot invoke the representations contained in the order of secrecy without making a factual showing of detrimental reliance. This argument was procedurally improper at that late stage in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">I recognize that the trial court interjected the issue of the grand juror\u2019s secrecy order into the trial court proceedings late in the trial day. The state could, however, have raised the reliance issue in appropriate postjudgment pleadings that would have alerted the defendant to provide an affidavit about his reliance, a representation that the state would have been hard put to dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Whatever the procedure at trial might have been, the state had an unconstrained opportunity to raise the issue in its initial appellate brief in this court. Had the state availed itself of this opportunity, the defendant would have been in a position to respond to it fully in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Despite the important public interests at stake in this litigation, I have difficulty discerning a reason why the state should not be held to our rules deploring inclusion of new arguments in reply briefs. See <em>Williams Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>232 Conn. 559, 593 n.26, 657 A.2d 212 (1995). Those who represent the state in appellate proceedings are not neophytes with respect to the appellate process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b243-7\"> Grand jurors conducting future investigatory grand jury proceedings would be well advised, however, to avoid the risk of misunderstanding by limiting the scope of any order of secrecy to reflect the possibility of future adversarial proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
