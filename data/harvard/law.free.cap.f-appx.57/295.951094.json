The district court was correct in denying Perez\u2019s petition because the California state court\u2019s decision was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Perez claims that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to argue in closing that because Perez was intoxicated he did not possess the requisite intent for first-degree murder. To prevail, Perez must show that (1) his counsel\u2019s actions were outside the range of professionally competent assistance, and (2) he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s actions. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 690-93, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Under <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984), prejudice is presumed in cases where \u201ccounsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, 104 S.Ct. 2039. An assessment of prejudice is necessary in this case, however, because counsel\u2019s failure to argue one of Perez\u2019s possible defenses, however negligent, does not constitute a wholesale \u201cabandonment of the defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Swanson, </em>943 F.2d 1070, 1074 (9th Cir.1991); <em>see also Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1851, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002) (holding that an attorney\u2019s failure \u201cmust be complete\u201d to warrant the presumption of prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The California court\u2019s conclusion that Perez has failed to prove prejudice is not objectively unreasonable. Perez\u2019s primary theory of defense was that the shooting was an accident, and there was some evidence to support this theory. While a theory of intoxication also involves a lack of intent, it is some what inconsistent with a theory of accident because accident implies a complete lack of mens rea, while an intoxication defense suggests a reduced mens rea, such as recklessness. The inconsistency in these two arguments lessens the amount of prejudice that would result from neglecting to argue one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">In addition, the jury heard all the evidence that Perez may have been intoxicated that night, and was instructed on the legal effect a finding of intoxication would have. Further, the evidence of the degree of Perez\u2019s drunkenness was contradicted and inconclusive. Thus, it was not unreasonable for the court to conclude that Perez had not established that, but for his counsel\u2019s conduct, there was a reasonable probability that the result would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b331-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
