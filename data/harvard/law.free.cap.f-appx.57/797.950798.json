See Fed. R.App. P. 34(f). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-25\">Defendant appeals his conviction and sentence for Conspiracy to Possess with Intent to Distribute, and to Distribute Methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1),(b)(1)(A) and 846. He claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>that 1) his confession was not sufficiently corroborated by independent evidence, 2) his conviction should be reversed because it was not supported by sufficient evidence, and 3) his conviction should be reversed due to prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions regarding sufficiency of the evidence, including sufficiency of corroboration. <em>See United States v. Wiseman, </em>172 F.3d 1196, 1212 (10th Cir.1999). We must determine whether any rational jury could have found all of the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). A conviction cannot be sustained on appeal where the offense was proven solely by an extrajudicial confession. <em>United States v. Chimal, </em>976 F.2d 608, 610 (10th Cir.1992). However, the corroborating evidence does not have to independently establish each element of the crime. <em>Wiseman, </em>172 F.3d at 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Our review of the briefs and the record reveal that the independent evidence establishing the trustworthiness of Defendant\u2019s confession was sufficient. Defendant\u2019s confession was corroborated by other evidence including his co-conspirator Mr. Davila\u2019s testimony, Special Agent Woodson\u2019s independent investigation, hotel records, and Defendant\u2019s ability to pick out Mr. Davila\u2019s suppliers from large photographic arrays. Additionally, many of the details specifically recounted by Defendant directly parallel information given by Mr. Davila at trial and in other interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Defendant then claims that even if his confession was properly submitted to the jury, his conviction was still not supported by sufficient evidence. This claim is without merit. A conspiracy conviction requires \u201c(1) agreement with another person to violate the law; (2) knowledge of the essential objectives of the conspiracy; (3) knowing and voluntary involvement; and (4) interdependence among the alleged co-conspirators.\u201d <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>69 F.3d 419, 430 (10th Cir.1995) (quotations and citation omitted). Our review of the trial record including Defendant\u2019s confession, Mr. Davila\u2019s testimony, and Special Agent Woodson\u2019s testimony, reveals that the jury was provided with enough evidence to find Defendant guilty of Conspiracy to Possess with Intent to Distribute, and to Distribute Methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1),(b)(1)(A) and 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">Defendant\u2019s final claim is that his conviction should be reversed due to prosecu-torial misconduct during closing argument. Where Defendant made a timely objection, we review the denial of a motion for new trial based on prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Broomfield, </em>201 F.3d 1270,1276 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">The prosecutor\u2019s statements at issue are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-10\">At least be honest, ladies and gentlemen. Agent Woodson did not say he did not believe anything Mr. Morris said. He said, \u201cI believe parts based on Mr. Davila\u2019s testimony.\u201d Don\u2019t come in here and say we didn\u2019t follow up because we didn\u2019t believe. If you really believe that I don\u2019t believe that Mr. Morris is guilty of these charges and Agent Woodson doesn\u2019t believe that and Agent Dobbs doesn\u2019t believe that, this is a lark for us \u2014 [Defense counsel objected, court told prosecuting attorney he could not say what he believed.] If this is just a lark for us, we\u2019re down here trying to convict an innocent person, acquit him. Acquit him. But that\u2019s bunk, ladies and gentlemen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">Rec., Vol. VII, at 313-14. The Government concedes on appeal that the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>tor\u2019s comments were unprofessional. Aple. Br. at 32. We have long recognized the impropriety of a prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding his belief in the accused\u2019s guilt. <em>See United States v. Ainesworth, </em>716 F.2d 769, 771 (10th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Rios, </em>611 F.2d 1335, 1343 (10th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Coppola, </em>479 F.2d 1153, 1163 (10th Cir.1973). Therefore, we further hold that the comments in the instant case were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Because the comments were improper, we must consider whether the impropriety requires a new trial. <em>United States v. Pena, </em>930 F.2d 1486, 1491 (10th Cir.1991). In order to make this determination, we must consider the trial record as a whole and order a new trial only if the \u201cprosecutor\u2019s misconduct was enough to influence the jury to render a conviction on grounds beyond the admissible evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Our review of the record and the briefs reveals that the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument was in response to defense counsel\u2019s closing argument that the Government \u201cdid not believe that Defendant was a drug dealer.\u201d Rec., Vol. VII, at 301. Even though our review is for an abuse of discretion, we agree with the district court that <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985), is instructive. In <em>Young, </em>the Supreme Court held that the potential harm from prosecutor\u2019s remarks in which he stated his opinion that defendant was guilty did not amount to plain error because prosecutor was responding to defense counsel\u2019s repeated attacks on the prosecution\u2019s integrity. The Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-7\">[i]n order to make an appropriate assessment, the reviewing court must not only weigh the impact of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, but must also take into account defense counsel\u2019s opening salvo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-8\">Thus the import of the evaluation has been that if the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were \u201cinvited,\u201d and did no more than respond substantially in order to \u201cright the scale,\u201d such comments would not warrant reversing a conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 12-13, 105 S.Ct. 1038. Because the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument was in response to defense counsel\u2019s similarly improper argument attacking the Government\u2019s integrity, we hold that the remarks, in context, do not warrant overturning the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">Additionally, we note that the trial court took steps to mitigate any potential harm caused by the improper arguments. In response to defense counsel\u2019s objection, the trial court told the Government\u2019s attorney that he could not say what he believed. The court also instructed the jury that the arguments of the attorneys were not evidence in this case and that it could convict or acquit the Defendant based only on the evidence. Additionally, the jury did not have a copy of the trial transcript during deliberations. Therefore, we agree with the district court that \u201cthe comments considered at their very worst as a commentary on the [prosecuting attorney\u2019s] belief did not prejudice the defendant.\u201d Rec., Vol. V, at 32-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">The conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b833-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
