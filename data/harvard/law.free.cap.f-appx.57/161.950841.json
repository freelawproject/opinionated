Enersys moved to dismiss the action and compel arbitration of Singletary\u2019s claims or, alternatively, to stay the action pending the outcome of arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Finding that the collective bargaining agreement did not contain explicit provisions sufficient to waive Singletary\u2019s right to litigate his employment grievances in federal court, the district court denied En-ersys\u2019s motions. Enersys then moved for interlocutory appeal on the question of \u201c[w]hether the collective bargaining agreement satisfies the <em>Wright v. Universal Maritime Serv. Corp., </em>525 U.S. 70, 119 S.Ct. 391, 142 L.Ed.2d 361 (1998) standard for permitting waivers of an employee-union member\u2019s statutory right to a jury trial on his federal and statutory claims under the ADA and the FMLA?\u201d The district court certified the question, and we granted Enersys\u2019s petition for interlocutory appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292(b) (West 1993). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Singletary began work for Enersys\u2019s predecessor on June 12, 1988. He contends that on February 26, 1999 his employment was unlawfully terminated because of a disability (paranoid schizophrenia), which had been diagnosed in 1985. Singletary maintains that he successfully treated his schizophrenia with medication during the bulk of his employment, requiring only four short hospitalizations over more than ten years of employment with the company. After his last hospitalization, Singletary apparently had trouble adjusting to his new medication and, rather than return to work, re-entered the hospital. During this time, Enersys terminated his employment, ostensibly because of \u201cabsenteeism.\u201d Singletary then brought this action for wrongful termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">There is no dispute that the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) entered into by the company and the I.U.E. International Union governed Singletary\u2019s employment and his subsequent termination. The only question is whether the arbitration provisions of the CBA were sufficiently clear to meet the standards required to constitute a waiver of Singletary\u2019s right to litigate in a judicial forum his statutory claims of employment discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">We review the district court\u2019s contract interpretation decision <em>de novo. See United States v. Bankers Insurance Co., </em>245 F.3d 315, 319 (4th Cir.2001). In doing so, however, we do not simply apply common law principles of contract interpretation; nor do we impose the general presumption of arbitrability that applies in other contexts. Rather, the Supreme Court has directed that in situations like this, involving a \u201ca union-negotiated waiver of employees\u2019 statutory right to a judicial forum for claims of employment discrimination,\u201d such a waiver must be \u201cclear and unmistakable.\u201d <em>See Universal Maritime, </em>525 U.S. at 80-81; <em>see also Carson v. Giant Food, Inc., </em>175 F.3d 325, 331 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201c[CJollective bargaining agreements to arbitrate these [statutory] claims, unlike contracts executed by individuals, must be \u2018clear and unmistakable\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Universal Maritime, </em>525 U.S. at 80)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>In applying <em>Universal Maritime, </em>we have concluded that a collective bargaining agreement can achieve \u201cthe requisite degree of clarity ... by two different approaches.\u201d <em>Carson, </em>175 F.3d at 331. The first approach \u201csimply involves drafting an explicit arbitration clause,\u201d i.e., \u201ca clear and unmistakable provision under which the employees agree to submit to arbitration all federal causes of action arising out of their employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The second approach applies \u201cwhen the arbitration clause is not so clear,\u201d and requires that such\u201d[g]eneral arbitration clauses\u201d be supported by additional provisions mandating \u201cexplicit incorporation of statutory anti-discrimination requirements,\u201d which \u201cmake[] it unmistakably clear that the discrimination statutes at issue are part of the agreement.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 332; <em>see also Brown v. ABF Freight Systems, Inc., </em>183 F.3d 319, 321-22 (4th Cir.1999). In the case at hand, we need only consider the first approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Article V (Non-Discrimination) of the governing CBA provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgK\">The company and the union recognize the importance of providing all employees with equal employment opportunities, as provided by applicable laws. Therefore, the Company and the Union agree that no employee will be discriminated against based upon their race, col- or, creed, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or status as a Vietnam era veteran. The Company and the Union will comply with all laws preventing discrimination and regarding employment of individuals....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">\n<em>Any and all claims regarding equal employment opportunity or provided for under this Article of the Agreement or under any federal or state employment law shall be exclusively addressed by an individual employee or the Union under the grievance and arbitration provisions of this Agreement.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">The specific grievance and arbitration procedures are deta\u00f1ed separately in Articles XIII (Grievances) and XIV (Arbitration).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">The district court concluded that the language emphasized above did not constitute the \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d waiver described in <em>Universal Maritime </em>because it was \u201cgeneral in nature,\u201d \u201csomewhat ambiguous,\u201d devoid of any \u201cspecific reference to arbitration of employee claims against Defendant under the ADA, FMLA, or state law governing wrongful termination of employment,\u201d and lacking any \u201cexplicit incorporation of statutory antidiscrimi-nation requirements.\u201d Singletary urges us to affirm the district court, arguing similarly that the language of the CBA does not constitute an \u201cexplicit arbitration agreement\u201d because \u201cthe word \u2018statute\u2019 is not present, there is no reference to statutory discrimination disputes, there is no reference to the FMLA, and there is no language that compels arbitration.\u201d Brief of AppeUee at 8.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>We disagree with the interpretation of the CBA advanced by the district court and urged on us by Singletary. Article V of the CBA does include an explicit arbitration provision: \u201cAny and all claims ... under any federal or state employment law shall be exclusively addressed by an individual employee or the Union under the grievance and arbitration provisions of this Agreement.\u201d This language constitutes a \u201cclear and unmistakable provision under which the employees agree to submit to arbitration all federal causes of action arising out of their employment.\u201d <em>Carson, </em>175 F.3d at 331. Although the language is indeed quite broad, it could not be more clear. Nothing in <em>Universal Maritime, </em>Carson, or <em>Brown </em>requires that the provision be narrow in scope, just that it be clear and unmistakable in its application to statutory claims. The arbitration provision here refers explicitly to <em>\u201cany </em>and <em>all </em>claims ... under <em>any </em>federal or state employment law,\u201d thus, its application to statutory claims arising in the employment context is certainly clear. Simply put, it includes the entire set of such claims, leaving no room for courts and litigants to speculate on the margins about which claims are covered and which are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">A quick review of the agreements at issue in the leading cases illustrates the point. In <em>Universal Maritime, </em>525 U.S. at 80, the arbitration clause merely provided for arbitration of \u201c[mjatters under dispute\u201d without elaborating on whether those matters could arise under the employment contract, or federal law, or both, and \u201ccontain[edj no explicit incorporation of statutory anti-discrimination requirements.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Carson, </em>175 F.3d at 332, the arbitration clauses stated \u201cthat the parties agree to arbitrate all disputes over the meaning of the agreement,\u201d without mentioning \u201cdisputes arising under federal law,\u201d and without any explicit incorporation of federal statutory law. Finally, in <em>Brown, </em>183 F.3d at 321-22, the arbitration provisions also referred generally to \u201call grievances or questions of interpretation arising under ... this Agreement,\u201d without any mention of those that might arise out of alleged statutory violations and without any explicit provision incorporating the anti-discrimination statutes. Consequently, in all of these cases, the arbitration provisions were held insufficient to constitute waivers of the employees\u2019 rights to litigate their statutory claims. By comparison, the arbitration clause in this case was far more explicit\u2014 referring to \u201cany and all claims ... under any federal or state employment law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Indeed, the provision at issue in this case is arguably even more clear than that in <em>Safrit v. Cone Mills Corp., </em>248 F.3d 306, 308 (4th Cir.2001) <em>(per </em>curiam), which we held sufficient to waive an employee\u2019s right to a judicial forum. In <em>Safrit, </em>the CBA stated only that the parties agreed to \u201cabide by all the requirements of Title VII\u201d and \u201cthat [ujnresolved grievances arising under this Section are the proper subjects for arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The CBA in this case explicitly mandates that \u201cany and all claims ... under any federal or state employment law shall be exclusively addressed\u201d through the agreement\u2019s grievance and arbitration procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">No matter how sympathetic his claims, William Singletary submitted to a union-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>negotiated agreement that contained an explicit arbitration clause, which clearly and unmistakably waives his rights to litigate statutory employment discrimination claims in a judicial forum. Such \u201c[a]n agreement to arbitrate statutory claims is part of the natural tradeoff that a union must make in exchange for other benefits.\u201d <em>Safiit, </em>248 F.3d at 308. Had the union and the company struck a different bargain, the result might indeed be different. But this is the bargain they reached, and we hold that it is sufficient under <em>Universal Maritime </em>and <em>Carson </em>to constitute a waiver of the right to litigate statutory claims in a judicial forum. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\">. In <em>Universal Maritime, </em>the Supreme Court specifically reserved the question whether a union-negotiated waiver of a statutory right to litigate employment claims in federal court can ever be enforceable. <em>See Universal Maritime, 525 </em>U.S. at 82. This court, however, has \"answered that question \u2014 both before that decision and since \u2014 in the affirmative.\u201d <em>Brown v. ABF Freight Systems, Inc., </em>183 F.3d 319, 321 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b199-6\">. Singletary also contends that the CBA arbitration provisions are permissive rather than mandatory because Article XIV (Arbitration) states that \"[a]ll disputes ... <em>may </em>be referred to arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11-12. This argument disregards the context of the \"may.\u201d Article XIV provides in pertinent part: \"All disputes under this agreement which are not settled or resolved may be referred to arbitration by a notice given to the other party. Notice of appeal of a grievance must be given within ten (10) days of the Company\u2019s decision in the last step of the Grievance Procedure. In the event that notice of arbitration is not given within the ten (10) day period, the grievance shall be considered settled and/or waived.\u201d JA 50. Thus, failure to give proper and timely notice of arbitration ordinarily results in settlement or waiver of the grievance; this does not render arbitration permissive. See <em>Austin v. Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc., </em>78 F.3d 875, 879 (4th Cir.1996) (finding that purpose of the word \"may\u201d in a CBA was \"to give an aggrieved party the choice between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>arbitration and abandonment of his claim\u201d); <em>see also Bankers Ins. Co., </em>245 F.3d at 320-21 (same). We note, however, that at oral argument counsel for Enersys stipulated that, in any event, this ten-day notice provision could not be applied in a manner that would prevent an employee from exercising his procedural rights to arbitrate statutory employment discrimination claims initiated within the time period set forth in the governing statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
