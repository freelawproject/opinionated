FLETCHER, KLEINFELD and MCKEOWN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b761-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-20\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard used by the trial court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We accord no special deference to the district court\u2019s interpretation of Idaho state law and apply the normal de novo standard of review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the Idaho courts are \u201cthe ultimate expositors of [Idaho] state law,\u201d we must follow their interpretation of Idaho\u2019s statute of limitations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-21\">In <em>Lapham v. </em>Stewart,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Idaho Supreme Court held that \u201cthe cause of action for professional malpractice accrues as of the time of the occurrence, act or omission complained of\u2019 provided that there is \u201csome damage\u201d to plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the case at bar, the critical question is when Truck Insurance incurred \u201csome damage\u201d from Hiller\u2019s alleged failure to convey a settlement offer to the insureds. Under Idaho law, some damage occurs when the damage is \u201cobjectively ascertainable.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Idaho law further provides that damage is objectively ascertainable when \u201cthere is objective proof that would support the existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>of some actual damage.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">In some cases, such as those involving negligent drafting of an instrument, there is objective proof of the damage upon hiring new counsel to deal with the consequences of the error.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But in cases of negotiation or litigation error, the error isn\u2019t necessarily objectively ascertainable when it is alleged and new counsel is retained. Thus, in <em>Chicoine v. Bignall, </em>the Idaho Supreme Court held that a cause of action didn\u2019t accrue until it reversed the trial court\u2019s decision to grant a new trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> One way to look at such a case is that, unlike the drafting case, damage cannot be objectively ascertained until a judgment or settlement imposes some harmful consequence with finality. Another way to look at <em>Chicoine </em>is that the client wasn\u2019t suing for attorney\u2019s fees for dealing with an earlier error, but rather for the expense of a judgment or settlement caused by the error. This case is controlled by <em>Chicoine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Truck Insurance prevailed on summary judgment in the bad faith litigation in Idaho\u2019s trial court. At that point, there was no ground upon which it could have sued its attorneys, because the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of Truck Insurance insulated it from any objectively ascertainable damage. The Idaho Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of summary judgment did not begin the accrual of the cause of action because it remanded for further proceedings and did not hold that Truck Insurance had engaged in bad faith. Although Truck Insurance no longer had won the case, neither had it lost. Until settlement occurred, it was speculative, not only whether damages would be caused, but also whether there was any breach of duty by the insurance carrier and by the attorney. Any damage to Truck Insurance was not objectively ascertainable until it settled the claim for an amount in excess of policy limits. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">Appellees argue that even if the statute of limitations does not bar Truck Insurance\u2019s malpractice claim, the doctrine of judicial estoppel does. Under <em>Rissett</em>o,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> whether judicial estoppel applies is a question of federal law. Judicial estoppel \u201cprecludes a party from gaining an advantage by taking one positions, and then seeking a second advantage by taking an incompatible position.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judicial estoppel doctrine does not bar Truck Insurance\u2019s claims. Truck Insurance did not gain advantage by taking the position that its attorneys were not negligent prior to claiming in this case that they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">Our reversal does not establish that there was any professional malpractice, nor do we speak to any other defenses that may pertain. The summary judgment based on the statute of limitations is</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b761-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-12\">. <em>Delta Savings Bank v.
