Baker was sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(b), 120 months imprisonment, and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-20\">The presentence report prepared in Baker\u2019s case recommended that eleven special conditions be imposed as terms of the supervised release. The second proposed condition contained in the presen-tence report stated, \u201cThe defendant shall cooperatively participate in an evaluation and a mental health treatment program with emphasis on sex offender treatment at the discretion of the probation officer. Treatment may include physiological testing such as the polygraph and penile pleth-ysmograph, and the use of prescribed medications.\u201d Baker did not object to this term in the presentence report. At sentencing, without objection by Baker, the district court imposed the eleven conditions of supervised release recommended in the presentence report. In its oral pronouncement, however, the court phrased the second condition, \u201cNow the conditions of supervised release are the standard ones adopted by the Court, that the defendant cooperatively participate in an evaluation and mental health treatment program with emphasis on sex offender treatment, at the discretion of the probation officer. That treatment may include testing and the use of prescribed medicines.\u201d The written judgment, entered fourteen days after the sentencing hearing, included as a term of supervised release, \u201cThe defendant shall cooperatively participate in an evaluation and a mental health treatment program with emphasis on sex offender treatment at the discretion of the probation officer. Treatment may include physiological testing such as the polygraph and penile plethysmograph, and the use of prescribed medications.\u201d Baker asserts on appeal that the written judgment has changed the terms of supervised release pronounced orally at sentencing in violation of Fed.R.Crim.P. 43. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>This court reviews legal issues concerning sentencing de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir. 1989). When there is a conflict between the written judgment and a sentence announced in court, the oral pronouncement of sentence controls. <em>United States v. Morse, </em>344 F.2d 27, 29 n. 1 (4th Cir.1965). When there is an ambiguity in the oral pronouncement of a sentence, the written judgment is used to resolve the ambiguity. <em>Payne v. Madigan, </em>274 F.2d 702, 704-05 (9th Cir.1960), <em>aff'd, </em>366 U.S. 761, 81 S.Ct. 1670, 6 L.Ed.2d 853 (1961). The district court\u2019s power to amend a sentence does not extend to a situation where the district court judge simply changes his mind about the sentence imposed. <em>United States v. Cook, </em>890 F.2d 672, 675 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Both the oral and written pronouncement of sentence permit treatment and testing. The written judgment does not require any particular test; it simply adds specificity by listing two particular tests as examples of \u201ctesting\u201d that may be administered as part of Baker\u2019s \u201ctreatment.\u201d We find that the difference between the oral and written sentence was, at most, a clarification of the sentence that did not alter its terms or scope. Moreover, the change did not affect Baker\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court in the written judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
