It argues that its agreement to a post-petition arrangement qualifies the post-petition payments as administrative expenses. It never sought, however, relief from the automatic stay of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362 nor adequate protection under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363. The bankruptcy court denied Tidewater\u2019s claim, and on appeal, the district court affirmed. We now affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-18\">Henson purchased computer goods from Access 1 under a \u201cConsumer Credit Retail Installment Contract and Security Agreement,\u201d which Access 1 assigned to Tidewater. Smith entered into a similar arrangement with RoomStore Furniture in connection with her purchase of furniture. After Henson and Smith filed separate petitions under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, they reached agreements, as part of their plans, with Tidewater to make payments directly to Tidewater for the balance owed on the goods purchased. When Henson and Smith defaulted in making the payments, Tidewater filed claims with the bankruptcy court for administrative expenses for the missed payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-19\">The bankruptcy court denied Tidewater\u2019s request because Tidewater\u2019s claim did not arise out of post-petition transactions, because the payments to Tidewater conferred no benefit on the bankruptcy estates, and because Tidewater could not elect to recoup the value of its collateral through administrative expense rather than through adequate protection. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court, and Tidewater filed this appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code provides for administrative expenses to creditors for \u201cthe actual, necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate, including wages, salaries, or commissions for services rendered after the commencement of the case.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503(b)(1)(A). If allowed, administrative expenses have priority over unsecured claims against the bankruptcy estate. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507(a). One of the main policies behind granting priority to administrative expenses is \u201cto provide an incentive for creditors and landlords to continue or commence doing business with a bankrupt party.\u201d <em>In re Merry-Go-Round Enters., Inc., </em>180 F.3d 149, 158 (4th Cir.1999). Pre-petition secured creditors, while not privy to administrative-expense priority, are protected under the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s provisions for adequate protection. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 361-364.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">A two-part test determines whether a cost is actual and necessary to a bankruptcy estate in order to qualify as an administrative expense under \u00a7 503(b)(1)(A). First, for an expense to be actual, it must arise from a post-petition transaction between the creditor and the debtor or trustee. <em>In re Merry-Go-Round Enters., Inc., </em>180 F.3d at 157. Second, for an expense to be necessary, it must confer a benefit on the estate. <em>Id. </em>A narrow exception exists to award administrative expenses to pre-petition creditors where post-petition use of the collateral is in the operation of a business or to otherwise make an economic profit. <em>See Grundy Nat\u2019l Bank v. Rife, </em>876 F.2d 361, 363-64 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Tidewater argues that, despite its status as a-pre-petition creditor, it is nevertheless entitled to administrative expenses. As to the first requirement \u2014 that the expense arise from a post-petition transaction between the creditor and the debtor \u2014 Tidewater argues that Henson\u2019s and Smith\u2019s post-petition use of the collateral qualifies as a post-petition transaction. It also argues that confirmation of the bankruptcy plans constitutes a qualifying post-petition transaction. As to the second requirement \u2014 that the expense confer a benefit on the estate \u2014 Tidewater argues that Henson\u2019s and Smith\u2019s post-petition use of the collateral confers an actual benefit on the bankruptcy estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The district court rejected Tidewater\u2019s attempt to redefine itself as a post-petition creditor whose collateral confers a concrete benefit on the bankruptcy estates. <em>Tidewater Fin. Co. v. Henson, </em>272 B.R. 135 (D.Md.2001). The court stated that Tidewater\u2019s pre-petition transactions with Henson and Smith do not satisfy the two requirements of \u00a7 503(b)(1)(A), and the court declined to apply <em>Grundy\u2019s </em>exception for business use of collateral acquired pre-petition because the record contained no evidence that Henson or Smith used the computer goods or furniture to operate a business or to otherwise make an economic profit. <em>Tidewater Fin. Co., </em>272 B.R. at 139. The court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order denying administrative expenses and stated that adequate protection, and not administrative expense, is the appropriate remedy for Tidewater to seek. <em>Id. </em>at 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>We have carefully reviewed the record and considered the arguments of counsel made in their briefs and at oral argument. For the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s opinion, we conclude that Tidewater\u2019s claim for administrative expenses is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Because of our holding, we need not address Tidewater\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b173-16\"> Henson\u2019s and Smith's cases reached the district court as a consolidated appeal, pursuant to Tidewater\u2019s motion for consolidation filed in the district court upon appeal of the bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>ruptcy court's order and granted by the district court on May 17, 2001. We note that Tidewater\u2019s appeal of Henson's case was no longer before the district court when it issued its decision on December 31, 2001, because, on October 15, 2001, the bankruptcy court, on motion of the bankruptcy trustee, had dismissed Henson\u2019s bankruptcy action due to Henson's material default in plan payments. <em>In re Henson, </em>No. 00-50470SD, 2001 Bankr.LEXIS 1911 (Bankr.D.Md. Oct. 15, 2001). Consequently, only Tidewater's appeal of Smith\u2019s case is now before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
