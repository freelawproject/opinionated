He appeals this sentence, alleging that the district court erred when it determined that a departure below the guideline range was not warranted because of Chapman\u2019s health, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 5H1.4, p.s. He also raises for the first time a number of challenges to the sentence calculation and the constitutionality of \u00a7 841, all of which we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (unpreserved error may be corrected only if error occurred, that was plain, and that affects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>substantial rights, and if failure to correct error would seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings); <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 230-31 (4th Cir.2001) , We find no merit in any of Chapman\u2019s claims for the reasons explained below. We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Chapman\u2019s career offender designation was based on his 1992 conviction for cocaine trafficking and his 1994 conviction for assault and battery. Chapman argues that it was impermissible double counting to sentence him as a career offender, thereby increasing his offense level and criminal history category, because of his prior convictions when a prior drug conviction may also increase the statutory maximum from twenty to thirty years under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). We discern no error.* The district court applied the guidelines \u201cas written,\u201d <em>see United States v. Wilson, </em>198 F.3d 467, 472 n.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> (4th Cir.1999), and neither the guideline calculation nor Chapman\u2019s sentence was affected by the potential increase in the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Chapman next objects to the inclusion in his criminal history of one criminal history point for a 1991 fine he paid after he pled guilty to criminal domestic violence. The information in the presentence report did not establish whether Chapman was represented by counsel or whether the conviction was for a felony or a misdemeanor. A non-prison sentence for an uncounseled misdemeanor (but not felony) conviction, may be counted in a defendant\u2019s criminal history. <em>Nichols v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 738, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 128 L.Ed.2d 745 (1994). In this case, the issue is moot because the point awarded for the conviction did not affect Chapman\u2019s criminal history score, which was determined by his status as a career offender based on other prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">Chapman further alleges that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), \u00a7 4B1.1 is unconstitutional when applied in a case where the sentence is enhanced pursuant to \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), in that the government is not required to prove the fact of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions beyond a reasonable doubt by submitting the issue to a jury. As noted above, Chapman was not subject to a enhanced sentence under the statute. Moreover, <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated when the district court determines sentencing enhancements that do not increase the statutory maximum sentence. <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2418, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002). Nor has the sentencing scheme set out in \u00a7 841(b) been rendered facially unconstitutional by <em>Apprendi, </em>as Chapman suggests. <em>McAllister, </em>272 F.3d at 232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">Chapman argues that Congress has failed to make interstate drug transactions an element of an offense under \u00a7 841(a), and has thus exceeded its power to criminalize conduct under the Commerce Clause as it did in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 558-59, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). We have already considered and rejected a Commerce Clause challenge to \u00a7 841(a)(1). <em>United States v. Leshuk, </em>65 F.3d 1105, 1112 (4th Cir.1995). Consequently, this claim fails, as does Chapman\u2019s related argument that the government should have been required to assert an alternative basis for jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">With respect to the district court\u2019s decision not to depart below the guideline range because of his health problems, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>record reveals that the district court was in no doubt about its legal authority to depart on this ground, but decided not to depart. In this circumstance, the district court\u2019s exercise of its discretion is not reviewable by the appellate court. <em>United States v. Carr, </em>271 F.3d 172, 176-77 (4th Cir.2001). Therefore, this portion of the appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dismiss that portion of the appeal that seeks to challenge the district court\u2019s decision not to depart. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b588-6\"> The record discloses that the government did not file the necessary information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000), seeking the statutory sentence enhancement. Thus, Chapman was not exposed to a statutory term of more than twenty years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
