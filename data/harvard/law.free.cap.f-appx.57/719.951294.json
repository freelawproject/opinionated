Keever pleaded guilty. The district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> denied Keever\u2019s motion for a reduction in the offense level under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2) (2002) and sentenced him to 30 months in prison. Keever appeals his sentence. We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the guidelines to the facts de novo, bearing in mind that it was Keever\u2019s burden to prove a reduction in the offense level should apply. <em>United States v. Ramirez-Rios, </em>270 F.3d 1185, 1187 (8th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2) provides for an eight level reduction in Keever\u2019s offense level if he \u201cpossessed all ammunition and firearms solely for lawful sporting purposes or collection.\u201d Keever contends he qualifies for this reduction because the gun\u2019s owner told Keever his uncle had used the gun for hunting. We agree with the district court that the surrounding circumstances indicate Keever possessed the gun for the sole purpose of selling it to a pawn shop, and pawning a weapon does not qualify as a sporting purpose or as collection. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Alvarez, </em>79 F.3d 96, 98 (8th Cir.1996) (defining sporting purposes); <em>United States v. Moit, </em>100 F.3d 605, 606-07 (8th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (discussing collection). We thus affirm Keever\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b755-21\"> The Honorable Laurie Smith Camp, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
