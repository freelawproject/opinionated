Mounts pled guilty to conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846. The district court determined that the applicable guideline imprisonment range under the sentencing guidelines was 360 months to life. However, the court concluded that because a drug quantity had not been charged in the indictment or proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the maximum sentence Mounts could receive was 20 years. Therefore, the court sentenced him to 240 months in prison and 5 years of supervised release. He filed a notice of appeal. Appointed counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Mounts has filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">I. <em>Challenge to Guilty Plea</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-12\">Two of the issues raised by Mounts are, in substance, challenges to his guilty plea. First, he argues that he wanted to go to trial but that his attorney and the government attorney would not allow it. Second, he claims that the government breached its promise that if he pled guilty and testified at co-defendant Heidi Chaffee\u2019s trial, he would receive a lenient sentence. These arguments are unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-13\">As to the first of these arguments, Mounts never asked the district court to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea. Nor has he, even in the present filing, asserted his innocence of the offense to which he pled guilty. The plea hearing was conducted in conformity with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. During the plea colloquy, Mounts denied that anyone had \u201cthreatened [him] or ... attempted to force [him] or induce [him] in any way to tender his plea of guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-14\">As to Mounts\u2019 second argument, at his plea colloquy, he assured the judge that no one had made a promise to him as to what sentence would be imposed. \u201cSuch statements in open court during a plea hearing \u2018carry a strong presumption of verity.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez-Molina, </em>64 F.3d 719, 733 (1st Cir.1995). Mounts\u2019 plea was entered pursuant to a written plea agreement which specifically stated that it did not require the government to move for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Mounts agreed to cooperate with the government and the government agreed to recommend that Mounts be sentenced on the basis of a drug quantity of 500 grams to 1.5 kilo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>grams of cocaine base. Mounts acknowledged in the plea agreement that \u201cthere are no other promises or agreements, either express or implied, other than those contained in this Agreement.\u201d We reject Mounts\u2019 challenge to his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">To the extent that Mounts is claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, the factual record concerning Mounts\u2019 allegations that his attorney misled him about the consequences of pleading guilty or his right to proceed to trial is not sufficiently developed to permit reliable review on direct appeal. <em>See Lopez-Pineda, </em>55 F.3d at 697. Our rejection of Mounts\u2019 ineffective assistance claim is without prejudice to his presenting that claim on collateral review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">II. <em>Challenge to Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">A. <em>Evidence from Chaffee Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Mounts argues in his pro se brief that the sentencing court erred by increasing his sentence on account of evidence from the Chaffee trial that he had abused Chaf-fee, who was his fianc\u00e9 as well as his co-defendant. \u201cFed.R.Crim.P. 32, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3 and the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution require that a defendant be apprised of the information to be relied on in sentencing and an opportunity to rebut such information.\u201d <em>United States v. Berzon, </em>941 F.2d 8, 17 (1st Cir. 1991). This requirement was satisfied here. At the presentence conference, the sentencing judge informed Mounts that he would be relying upon information received at the Chaffee trial, \u201cthus enabling [Mounts] to respond to it before the sentence was set.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Under the terms of the plea agreement, the court was precluded from using Mounts\u2019 own testimony at the Chaffee trial in \u201cdetermining the applicable guideline range,\u201d with certain exceptions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.8. To the extent that Mounts alleges that the court violated that prohibition, the record does not support such an allegation. In any event, it is clear that no prejudice resulted from the court\u2019s reliance upon any evidence presented at the Chaffee trial. The transcript from the sentencing hearing reveals that the court relied upon evidence from the Chaffee trial in deciding not to grant the three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Had Mounts received the three-level reduction, the applicable guideline sentencing range would have been 262 to 327 months. The sentence Mounts received (240 months) was well below that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">B. <em>Drug Quantity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">Mounts appears to argue in his brief that the drug quantity employed by the district court in arriving at his sentence was higher than the quantity calculated in the PSR. The record belies that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-13\">C. <em>Government\u2019s Failure to Seek a \u00a7 5K1.1 Departure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-14\">The government stated at the sentencing hearing that it had decided not to seek a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure because Mounts had violated the law by attempting to smuggle cigarettes into the prison where he was detained while awaiting sentencing. The plea agreement specifically provided that the government was not required to seek a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure. The government\u2019s decision not to seek a departure was not based on any constitutionally impermissible factors and was rationally related to a legitimate government end. Under these circumstances, the government\u2019s \u201cunbridled discretion\u201d in deciding whether to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion was not constrained. <em>See United States v. Sandoval, </em>204 F.3d 283, 285 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-15\">D. <em>Supervised Release Term</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-16\">The sentencing court gave the parties advance notice (at the presentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>conference) of its intent to impose a five-year supervised release term and there was no objection. That term did not exceed the governing statutory limits. <em>See United States v. Cortes-Claudio, </em>312 F.3d 17 (1st Cir.2002). The court included in its Memorandum of Sentencing Judgment the following reasons justifying a five-year supervised release term: protection of the public and rehabilitation of the defendant. In the plea agreement, Mounts admitted to a drug quantity of 50 grams or more of cocaine base. The United States Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 supervised release maximum corresponding with that drug quantity is five years. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(a)(l). Under these circumstances, there is no non-frivolous argument that it was plain error for the court to impose a five-year supervised release term. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>246 F.3d 56, 62 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is <em>granted </em>and appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence are <em>affirmed. See </em>Loc.R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
