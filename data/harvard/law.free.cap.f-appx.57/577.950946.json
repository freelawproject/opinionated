Clark seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition. To be entitled to a certificate of appealability, Clark must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). When a district court dismisses on procedural grounds, the petitioner \u201cmust demonstrate both (1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right,\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). Upon independent examination of Clark\u2019s petition, we cannot conclude that reasonable jurists would find it debatable whether the district court correctly concluded the petition was untimely. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>- U.S. -;, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931, 2003 WL 431659, at *10 (U.S. Feb. 25, 2003) (No. 01-7662). Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
