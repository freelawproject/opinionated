Overton, who moved for a downward departure under both U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 and \u00a7 5K2.13, argues that the District Court failed to rule on his \u00a7 5K2.0 motion, and that as a result we should remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-25\">Prior to Overton\u2019s sentencing hearing, he submitted a request for a downward departure, claiming diminished capacity under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13 and mental and emotional conditions under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5H1.3, 5K2.0. In his sentencing memorandum, Overton included the report of Dr. Gary Glass, a psychiatrist, who concluded that Overton suffers from bipolar disorder. The Government argued that Overton was not entitled to a downward departure under \u00a7 5K2.13 because his lengthy criminal history (eleven prior convictions) precluded the departure. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Government also argued that there was a lack of evidence that Overton\u2019s emotional or mental condition were so extraordinary as to warrant relief under \u00a7 5H1.3 and/or \u00a7 5K2.0.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The District Court heard arguments on the downward departure motion. Defense counsel did not reference \u00a7 5K2.0 during the hearing, but argued that Overton was entitled to a departure because of an untreated mental disorder and emotional problems, which substantially contributed to the commission of his crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The District Court, while recognizing its authority to depart, denied the downward departure stating it did not find sufficient evidence establishing that Overton\u2019s mental health substantially contributed to his commission of the offense and that his mental health and emotional condition did not rise to the level warranting the court to depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">After this ruling, defense counsel stated that he was ready to proceed with sentencing and did not raise the \u00a7 5K2.0 motion or request clarification of the ruling. The court then sentenced Overton to 77 months imprisonment, within the applicable range of 77 to 96 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">A downward departure may be appropriate under \u00a7 5K2.13 \u201cif the defendant committed the offense while suffering from a significantly reduced mental capacity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13. A departure is permitted under \u00a7 5K2.0 if \u201c\u2018there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\u2019 \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)). Overton argued that a departure under \u00a7 5K2.0 was appropriate because Overton\u2019s mental illness was so exceptional and severe that a departure was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">After the District Court expressly acknowledged its authority to depart, it used its discretion to deny the downward departure, and stated its basis for doing so. The District Court stated that it recognized Overton\u2019s mental health issues and had reviewed Dr. Glass\u2019s evaluation, but was still of the opinion that Overton\u2019s \u201cmental health and emotional condition do not rise to the level warranting this Court to depart.\u201d App. at 70. This encompassed not only its reasoning on the diminished capacity ground for the departure motion but also the \u00a7 5K2.0 ground, because in this case they present nearly identical issues. Therefore, we reject Over-ton\u2019s argument that the District Court failed to rule on his \u00a7 5K2.0 ground for departure, even though the District Court did not expressly reference \u00a7 5K2.0.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">Moreover, Overton did not argue to the District Court that it had overlooked his \u00a7 5K2.0 argument. That guideline section had not been called to its attention. Therefore, we review for plain error, a standard Overton has patently not met. In light of our decision, we need not reach the Government\u2019s contention that \u00a7 5K2.0 cannot be used to circumvent the \u00a7 5K2.13 requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">For the reasons set forth, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
