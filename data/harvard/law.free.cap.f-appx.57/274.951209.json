After de novo review, <em>see Peter v. Wedl, </em>155 F.3d 992, 996 (8th Cir.1998), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-20\">Crutchfield\u2019s damages claims for an allegedly wrongful disciplinary conviction are barred because he has not successfully challenged the conviction. <em>See Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 644-48, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997); <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 489, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); <em>Portley-El v. Brill, </em>288 F.3d 1063, 1066-67 (8th Cir. 2002). In any event, the summary judgment record shows that his due process claims fail on their merits: the victim\u2019s statement supports the disciplinary conviction, <em>see Goff v. Dailey, </em>991 F.2d 1437, 1442 (8th Cir.) (due process is satisfied if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>disciplinary committee based its decision on \u201csome evidence\u201d in record), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 997, 114 S.Ct. 564, 126 L.Ed.2d 464 (1993); the disciplinary hearing officer stated his reasons for finding Crutchfield guilty of assault, <em>see Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 558-70, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) (elements of due process in prison disciplinary hearing); and defendants\u2019 violation of prison policy does not amount to a denial of due process, <em>see Kennedy v. Blankenship, </em>100 F.3d 640, 643 (8th Cir.1996) (state\u2019s failure to follow its own procedural rules does not state federal claim). Further, Crutchfield has no constitutional right to be housed in any particular prison or to receive a particular classification. <em>See Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 245, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983); <em>Moody v. Daggett, </em>429 U.S. 78, 88 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 274, 50 L.Ed.2d 236 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Accordingly, we affirm, but we modify the judgment to reflect that the adverse grant of summary judgment does not count as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-9\">. The Honorable Susan Webber Wright, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable H. David Young, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
