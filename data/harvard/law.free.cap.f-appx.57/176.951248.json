He was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment. His sole argument on appeal is that the district court erred, during sentencing, in imposing a four-level adjustment under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B5.1(b)(4) (2001), for possession of a firearm in connection with the felony offense. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-22\">To the extent that Thompson\u2019s assertion of error involves a challenge to the district court\u2019s interpretation of USSG \u00a7 2B5.1, we apply a de novo standard of review. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989). To the extent that Thompson\u2019s assertion of error challenges the district court\u2019s factual findings, we apply the clearly erroneous standard of review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-23\">After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and the materials submitted on appeal, we find that, under the facts of this case, the district court did not err in applying the enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2B5.1(b)(4). Accordingly, we affirm Thompson\u2019s sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>tence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
