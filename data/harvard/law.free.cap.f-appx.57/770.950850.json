Because the transitional rules apply, we have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U. S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>See Ruano v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1155, 1159 (9th Cir.2002). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">The BIA summarily adopted the IJ\u2019s findings on appeal, therefore we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002). We review findings of fact for substantial evidence and will uphold the IJ\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>Chan-chavac v. INS, </em>207 F.3d 584, 589 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">The unfulfilled threats against Petitioner were not sufficiently egregious to constitute past persecution. <em>See Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir.2000). Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Gramajo-Diaz was not persecuted or threatened on the basis of real or imputed political opinion. <em>See Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201c[Ajbsent evidence of discriminatory purpose, a guerilla organization\u2019s attempts to force a person to join them [sic] is insufficient to compel a finding of persecution on account of political belief.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-14\">Because he did not make the requisite showing for asylum, it follows that Grama-jo-Diaz failed to satisfy the more stringent standard required to establish eligibility for withholding of deportation. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b807-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
