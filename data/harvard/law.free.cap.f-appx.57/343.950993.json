We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Kohler v. Inter-Tel Techs., </em>244 F.3d 1167, 1171 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-21\">Summary judgment was proper on Kha-chikian\u2019s constructive discharge claims because he failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether DeVry intentionally created or knowingly permitted conditions so intolerable that they effectively forced him to resign. <em>See Mullins v. Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp., </em>15 Cal.4th 731, 63 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 936 P.2d 1246,1249 (1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-22\">Summary judgment was proper on Kha-chikian\u2019s retaliation claim because he failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his employer took an adverse employment action against him. <em>See Kor-tan v.
