We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings in the sentencing phase, but they must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>U.S. v. Fox, </em>189 F.3d 1115, 1118 (9th Cir.1999). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-23\">Nakamura contends the district court erred in determining by a preponderance of the evidence that the conspiracy distributed in excess of 5 grams of actual methamphetamine when only 3.3 grams were recovered and tested for purity.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-24\">It is undisputed that Nakamura delivered 12.5 grams of unrecovered methamphetamine. Absent evidence to the contrary, it was not clear error for the district court to determine the purity of the unre-covered methamphetamine by extrapolating from the purity of the 3.3 grams actually recovered. <em>See U.S. v. Lopes-Montes, </em>165 F.3d 730, 731-32 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that absent evidence to the contrary, the district court was entitled to assume that the remaining 3.6 kilograms Lopes-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Montes agreed to deliver was a mixture with a similar purity level as the 3.2 kilogram mixture actually recovered).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Nakamura\u2019s contention that he had no knowledge of the purity of the substance he possessed is unpersuasive because a defendant who actually possesses the drugs may be sentenced on the basis of the amount possessed, whether or not he or she knew of the amount. <em>See U.S. v. Mendoza, </em>121 F.3d 510, 514 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b764-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
