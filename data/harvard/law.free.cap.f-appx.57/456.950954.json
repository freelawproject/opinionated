The remaining argument\u2014 that Beras\u2019 convictions for international money laundering under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2) were improper because he did not engage in a \u201ctransfer\u201d of funds within the meaning of the statute \u2014 we discuss, and reject, in an opinion separately issued today.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-18\">In addition, Beras has raised in several \u201cpro <em>se </em>supplemental briefs\u201d the claim that his trial counsel was ineffective. Those claims are more properly the subject of a petition for habeas corpus under 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>\u00a7 2255, and we therefore will not address them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">At all relevant times, Beras served as co-owner and vice-president of Dinero Express, Inc. (\u201cDinero\u201d), a licensed money remitter that specialized in transmitting money on behalf of customers in the United States to locations in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. The evidence adduced at trial showed that between 1994 and 1996, Beras \u2014 in conjunction with other Dinero co-owners and officers \u2014 used Dine-ro and its employees in furtherance of an extensive international money laundering scheme. In exchange for commissions that generally totaled five percent of each transaction, Beras and his co-conspirators accepted from area drug traffickers cash deposits known to be the proceeds of illegal narcotics sales, and then, via a number of different techniques, arranged for the transport or transfer of those deposits from Dinero\u2019s headquarters in Manhattan to members of the traffickers\u2019 networks located in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Besides the physical transport of cash in suitcases aboard airlines, another laundering practice engaged in by Beras involved the transfer of drug proceeds to the Dominican Republic under the guise of phony money remittances through a four-step process. First, drug traffickers delivered their cash to Dinero\u2019s New York headquarters for gradual deposit into the company\u2019s bank accounts in the United States. Second, Dinero remittance invoices were generated for fictitious transactions to the Dominican Republic; the invoices used false identities and addresses and were made out in amounts small enough to avoid currency reporting requirements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Third, arrangements were made for a Dominican \u201cpeso supplier\u201d to advance local currency \u2014 in the same amount as the original deposit delivered to Dinero\u2019s New York headquarters, minus commission \u2014 to Dine-ro\u2019s Dominican office, which in turn forwarded the cash to the drug traffickers\u2019 Dominican personnel under the pretense of fulfilling the fictitious remittances generated in New York. Fourth, the process culminated with Dinero\u2019s repayment of the peso supplier through a wire transfer of funds from Dinero\u2019s New York operating account to the peso supplier\u2019s bank accounts in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">After a four-week trial, the jury returned a verdict convicting Beras on all eighty-two counts in the indictment. Ber-as was sentenced to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years\u2019 supervised release, and a $4,100 mandatory special assessment, and was additionally subjected to an order of forfeiture in the amount of $10 million. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">Beras contends that the District Court ought to have dismissed the indictment for pre-indictment delay as he was not indicted until five years after the completion of the charged criminal conduct. To prevail on a claim of pre-indictment delay arising under the Fifth Amendment, a defendant must \u201cbear the \u2018heavy burden\u2019 \u201d of showing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the delay was \u201ca course intentionally pursued by the government for an improper purpose.\u201d <em>United States v. Cornielle, </em>171 F.3d 748, 752 (2d Cir.1999). An improper purpose, argues Beras, was evidenced in this case by the government\u2019s withholding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>charges until a time when it had obtained the cooperation of other Dinero co-conspirators. Yet, the case agent assigned to the Dinero investigation explained that the extra time was required to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8Z\">analyze! ] the documents seized from Dinero Express and debrief! ] witnesses and cooperating defendants. In addition, [he] received additional documents from some of these cooperating defendants that required extensive analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Houlihan Aff. 113. The government\u2019s decision to refrain from charging a defendant pending investigation of his conduct is not, absent more, an \u201cimproper\u201d pre-indictment delay. <em>See United States v. Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. 783, 791, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977) (\u201c[P]rosecutors are under no duty to file charges as soon as probable cause exists but before they are satisfied they will be able to establish the suspect\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). To the contrary, \u201c[r]ather than deviating from elementary standards of \u2018fair play and decency,\u2019 a prosecutor abides by them if he refuses to seek indictments until he is completely satisfied that he should prosecute and will be able promptly to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 795, 97 S.Ct. 2044. Thus, \u201cto prosecute a defendant following investigative delay does not deprive him of due process, even if his defense might have been somewhat prejudiced by the lapse of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 796, 97 S.Ct. 2044. Without sufficient evidence of improper motive, the District Court correctly denied Beras\u2019 motion to dismiss the indictment for prein-dictment delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Beras also appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for severance. In that motion \u2014 which Beras raised for the first time following opening statements and again renewed at the close of evidence \u2014 Beras contended that the defenses of his co-defendants were mutually antagonistic to his defense because both co-defendants alleged that they were instructed by their \u201cbosses,\u201d which included Beras, to perform the acts described in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits the District Court to \u201cgrant a severance of defendants\u201d if \u201cit appears that a defendant ... is prejudiced by a joinder of ... defendants in an indictment.\u201d The rule commits the decision to sever a joint trial \u201cto the sound discretion of the trial judge,\u201d <em>United States v. Casamento, </em>887 F.2d 1141, 1149 (2d Cir. 1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1081,110 S.Ct. 1138, 107 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1990), and a district court\u2019s denial of a severance motion is reversible only if a defendant can \u201cshow prejudice so severe that his conviction constituted a miscarriage of justice and that the denial of his motion constituted an abuse of discretion,\u201d <em>United States v. Rosa, </em>11 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.1993) (internal citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>511 U.S. 1042, 114 S.Ct. 1565, 128 L.Ed.2d 211 (1994). \u201c[A] district court should grant a severance under Rule 14 only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent a jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Zafiro v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 534, 539, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993). Such a risk might occur if evidence inadmissible against one defendant but probative of guilt is admitted against a co-defendant, or if exculpatory evidence is excluded due to a co-defendant\u2019s presence. <em>Id. </em>In most cases, however, \u201cless drastic measures, such as limiting instructions, often will suffice to cure any risk of prejudice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Beras identifies no specific trial right that was infringed by his co-defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>dants\u2019 defenses. No incriminating evidence was admitted that would have been withheld had Beras been tried separately, nor was any potentially exculpatory material hidden from the jury\u2019s view as a consequence of the joint trial. Beras instead rests on the proposition that antagonistic defense theories are presumptively prejudicial under Rule 14 \u2014 a proposition that the Supreme Court in <em>Zafiro </em>squarely rejected. <em>See </em>506 U.S. at 538, 113 S.Ct. 933. In any event, the District Court cured any risk of prejudice by instructing the jury of the government\u2019s burden of proving each defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and reminding the fact-finders of their duty to evaluate the evidence against each defendant independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Beras challenges various evidentiary rulings of the District Court, all of which we review for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Taubman, </em>297 F.3d 161, 164 (2d Cir.2002) (per curiam). First, the District Court prohibited Beras from eliciting testimony concerning the credibility of a government informant after tapes of conversations between the informant and Beras had been admitted into evidence. Beras argues that his inability to delve into topics such as the amount of money paid to the informant by the government and the informant\u2019s prior perjury violated the Confrontation Clause. But as the tape recordings of the informant\u2019s statements were admitted solely to place Beras\u2019 own recorded statements in context and not for the truth of the matters asserted, the informant\u2019s credibility was simply irrelevant. <em>See United States v. Barone, </em>913 F.2d 46, 49 (2d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Second, the District Court admitted expert testimony by an FBI agent on the money remitting business in general, the operations of legal and illegal money remitters, and the connections between drug trafficking and money laundering. Beras claims that such testimony violated our decisions in <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>981 F.2d 659, 659 (2d Cir.1992), and <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>924 F.2d 1227, 1231 (2d Cir.1991). <em>Castillo </em>and <em>Cruz </em>are inapposite. In those cases, our concern was that the government had used an expert witness to bolster an essential fact in dispute \u2014 whether in <em>Castillo </em>the defendant really did use a gun as part of his drug deal and whether in <em>Cruz </em>the defendant really was present during the relevant narcotics transactions. Here, by contrast, the dispositive question at trial was whether Beras \u2014 as evidenced through his conduct \u2014 intended to structure and launder monies in furtherance of a drug trafficking enterprise and to avoid financial reporting requirements. Indeed, Beras\u2019 sole defense was that he had no knowledge of the Dinero laundering operations, and that the government\u2019s cooperating witnesses \u201crepeatedly lied ... about [his] involvement\u201d in order \u201cto save their own skins.\u201d The expert testimony thus had no role, potential or actual, in bolstering the essential fact in dispute in this case: Beras\u2019 state of mind. This point is borne out by the fact that, unlike in <em>Castillo </em>and <em>Cruz, </em>the government in summation never referred to the expert testimony as somehow corroborative of Beras\u2019 unlawful state of mind. <em>See United States v. Tapia-Ortiz, </em>23 F.3d 738, 741 (2d Cir.) (\u201cOur conclusion that no error occurred in this case is supported by the fact that the Government did not place great emphasis on [the expert\u2019s testimony in its summation.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 877, 115 S.Ct. 206, 130 L.Ed.2d 136 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Third, the District Court admitted falsified remittance forms into evidence under the \u201cbusiness records exception\u201d of Fed. R.Evid. 803(6). Whether or not the forms were appropriately admitted under Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>808(6), the forms were also admissible because those documents were used by the government, not for their truth, but to demonstrate the co-conspirators\u2019 efforts in concealing their illegal structuring and laundering activities. <em>See United States v. Sliker, </em>751 F.2d 477, 489 (2d Cir.) (records not hearsay where \u201cadmitted not to establish the truth of the matters asserted but rather to prove the sham nature of the [transactions]\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>470 U.S. 1058, 105 S.Ct. 1772, 84 L.Ed.2d 832 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Beras next argues that his convictions for money laundering and structuring are multiplieitous in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause because the act of \u201cstructuring\u201d the transferred funds was an integral component of the laundering operation as a whole. Although Beras concedes that the test in <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), is satisfied because the money laundering statute and the structuring statute each requires proof of a fact that the other does not, he nevertheless argues that <em>Blockburger </em>does not control because, in enacting both statutes through a single legislative act \u2014 the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986, Pub.L. No. 99-570, 100 Stat. 3207 (Oct. 27, 1986) \u2014 Congress impliedly intended to prohibit cumulative punishment. The Supreme Court rejected such reasoning in <em>Albernaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981), a case involving cumulative punishments for conspiracy to import and distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 963. The Supreme Court found it unavailing to draw any inference concerning cumulative intent from the fact that both statutes were enacted pursuant to a single bill, the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. Noting that \u201cCongress is predominantly a lawyer\u2019s body\u201d and hence is presumed to \u201cknow the law,\u201d the Court concluded that \u201cif anything is to be assumed from the congressional silence ..., it is that Congress was aware of the <em>Blockburger </em>rule and legislated with it in mind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341-42, 101 S.Ct. 1137 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). '</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">The District Court sentenced Beras to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment based on a total offense level of 40.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court adopted the recommendations contained in Beras\u2019 Pre-Sentencing Report (PSR), which suggested: a base offense level of 23 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Sl.l(a)(l) (2000) because Ber-as engaged in a conspiracy to launder money with the intent to promote narcotics trafficking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(3)(A);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a ten-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Sl.l(b)(2)(K) (2000) because the total amount of laundered funds approximated $27 million; a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) (2000) because Beras was the \u201corganizer or leader\u201d of a laundering operation that \u201cinvolved five or more participants;\u201d and a three-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Sl.l(b)(l) (2000) because Beras \u201cknew or believed that the funds were the proceeds of an unlawful activity involving the manufacture, importation, or distribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>of narcotics.\u201d Due to the absence of any known prior criminal convictions, Beras\u2019 final sentencing range fell between 292 and 365 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">On appeal, Beras contends that the District Court exceeded its discretion when it concluded, based on its own independent reading of the evidence, that the object of Beras\u2019 money laundering conspiracy was to promote narcotics trafficking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(3)(A). The Guidelines, however, permit the District Court to do exactly as it did. Where a conspiracy count alleges multiple objects of the conspiracy, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.2(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">A conviction on a count charging a conspiracy to commit more than one offense shall be treated as if the defendant had been convicted on a separate count of conspiracy for each offense that the defendant conspired to commit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Application Note 4 of the Commentary accompanying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.2 further advises that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">Particular care must be taken in applying [U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.2(d) ] because there are cases in which the verdict or plea does not establish which offense(s) was the object of the conspiracy. <em>In such cases, subsection (d) should only be applied with respect to an object offense alleged in the conspiracy count if the court, were it sitting as a trier of fact, would convict the defendant of conspiring to commit that object offense, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The District Court therefore acted within its discretion when it applied a base offense level of 23 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1(a)(1) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Beras further challenges, as clear error, each of the District Court\u2019s sentencing enhancements. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, \u201cdisputed facts relevant to sentencing ... need be established only by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Concepcion, </em>983 F.2d 369, 388 (2d Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 856, 114 S.Ct. 163, 126 L.Ed.2d 124 (1993). In reaching its factual conclusions, the sentencing court \u201cremains entitled to rely on any type of information known to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have carefully reviewed the record and conclude that the District Court\u2019s 17-level enhancement was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">In the course of this appeal, Beras filed two \u201csupplemental <em>pro se </em>briefs\u201d charging his trial counsel with ineffective assistance on various grounds. We have expressed \u201ca baseline aversion to resolving ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>205 F.3d 23, 35 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 885, 121 S.Ct. 203, 148 L.Ed.2d 142 (2000). This is because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-13\">[ineffective assistance claims are often based on assertions that trial counsel made errors of omission, errors that are difficult to perceive from the record: for example, neglecting to call certain witnesses or introduce certain evidence. The claims might also be based on a conflict of interest not apparent at trial. Proof is sometimes provided in attorney-client correspondence, or in other documents not introduced at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-14\"><em>Billy-Eko v. United States, </em>8 F.3d 111, 114 (2d Cir.1993), <em>superseded by statute on another ground as stated in Triestman v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 361, 369 n. 8 (2nd Cir.1997). As Beras\u2019 ineffective assistance of counsel claims \u201crequire[ ] consideration of evidence not contained in the record, we will not reach it here, and if [Beras] wishes to pursue the issue, he must raise it on a collateral attack of his convictions.\u201d <em>United States v.
