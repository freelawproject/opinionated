Beckwith, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Eduardo Ramirez-Cayetamo pleaded guilty to illegally reentering the United States after a previous deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b). On March 6, 2002, the district court sentenced him to eighteen months of imprisonment and two years of supervised release. It is from this judgment that Ramirez-Cayeta-mo now appeals. The parties have waived oral argument, and the panel unanimously agrees that it is not needed in this case. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">We generally review the sentencing court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>while examining its factual findings for clear error. <em>United, States v. Henderson, </em>209 F.3d 614, 617 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">Ramirez-Cayetamo\u2019s offense level was calculated under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2, which assigns an initial base offense level of 8 to a defendant who has been convicted of unlawful entry. That level is increased by 8 if he previously was deported or unlawfully remained in the United States after being convicted of \u201can aggravated felony\u201d USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) (2001). The district court properly applied this guideline, as it is undisputed that Ramirez-Cayetamo was deported after being convicted in state court of receiving stolen property and sentenced to twelve months in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">Ramirez-Cayetamo now argues that \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) was not applicable because his prior state conviction did not expose him to a sentence \u201cexceeding one year\u201d and, thus, would not be a felony under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iv)). This argument is unavailing because a \u201cfelony\u201d and an \u201caggravated felony\u201d are defined separately under \u00a7 2L1.2. In particular, USSG \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.2) now defines an aggravated felony by reference to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). That statute describes an aggravated felony in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-15\">(43) The term \u201caggravated felony\u201d means ... (G) a theft offense (including receipt of stolen property) or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment [is] <em>at least one year; ...</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-16\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-17\">Ramirez-Cayetamo\u2019s prior state sentence of twelve months is a sentence of \u201cat least one year,\u201d as required by \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). <em>See Drakes v. Zimski </em>240 F.3d 246, 251 (3d Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Christopher, </em>239 F.3d 1191, 1193 (11th Cir.2001). Hence, the district court properly determined that he had committed an aggravated felony within the meaning of USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). <em>See United States v. Gonzales-Vela, </em>276 F.3d 763, 766-68 (6th Cir.2001); <em>Christopher, </em>239 F.3d at 1193-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-18\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
