He appeals, alleging prosecutorial misconduct. Zambrano also claims that the drug statutes under which he was convicted are unconstitutional. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-19\">The prosecutor was entitled to inquire into relevant specific acts of conduct during cross-examination to refute the witness\u2019s testimony that Zambrano is honest and law-abiding. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 405(a). In any event, the district judge eventually struck the testimony elicited during cross-examination and gave the jury a curative instruction, which we must assume the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>jury followed. <em>United States v. Aichele, </em>941 F.2d 761, 765 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The prosecution\u2019s presentation of negative character evidence through testimony of a rebuttal character witness was also proper. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 404(a)(1), 405(a). The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the probative value of the rebuttal witness\u2019s testimony outweighed any prejudicial effect. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Expert testimony on drug organization structure may not be presented in a non-conspiracy case. <em>United States v. Pineda-Torres, </em>287 F.3d 860 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 661, 154 L.Ed.2d 555 (2002); <em>United States v. Varela-Rivera, </em>279 F.3d 1174, 1179 (9th Cir.2002). The prosecutor\u2019s attempt to circumvent this prohibition by arguing drug structure in closing was improper, but the error was not plain because the reference was made in closing argument, not through expert testimony, and in response to Zambrano\u2019s defense that he was an \u201cinnocent dupe.\u201d <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (reviewing only for plain error where defendant didn\u2019t object at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">We explicitly held 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 952, and 960 constitutional in <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558 (9th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S. Ct. 2314, 152 L.Ed.2d 1067 (2002), and <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1109-11 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 573, 154 L.Ed.2d 459 (2002), and affirmed their constitutionality after <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), in <em>United States v.
