The District Court imposed sentence and entered judgment, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-19\">The defendant contends (1) that the District Court should have lessened his federal sentence by according him full-time credit for a related state conviction and sentence already served and (2) that his guilty plea was not entered voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. In accordance with the defendant\u2019s instructions, defendant\u2019s counsel submitted a brief presenting these claims to this Court. Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), however, defendant\u2019s counsel submitted a brief certifying that each of the issues raised by the defendant is without merit. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-23\">After reviewing counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief and engaging in an independent review of the record, <em>see United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 299-300 (3d Cir.2001), we find no non-frivolous issues meriting appeal. Accordingly, pursuant to <em>Anders </em>and Third Circuit Local Appellate Rule 109.2(b), we affirm the judgment of the District Court and grant defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
