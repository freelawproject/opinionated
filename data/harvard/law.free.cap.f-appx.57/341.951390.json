Audett, a civilly committed individual confined under Washington state\u2019s sexually violent predator statute, Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 71.09 <em>et seq. </em>(2002), ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>peals pro se the district court\u2019s summary-judgment for defendant in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging due process violations based on the conditions of his detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>Sorrels v. McKee, </em>290 F.3d 965, 969 (9th Cir.2002), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Audett contends that the conditions of his bedroom at the Special Commitment Center were unconstitutional because the room lacked natural lighting, was smaller than other bedrooms in the facility, had a door that swung inwards, and received recycled air. Although Audett\u2019s bedroom had a lock, it is undisputed that he had a key to the room and unlimited access to other areas of the facility during designated hours. The district court properly granted summary judgment because Au-dett failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether these conditions rise to the level of a constitutional violation. <em>See Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 542, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) (noting, in the pretrial detention context, that \u201cThere is ... a <em>de minimis </em>level of imposition with which the Constitution is not concerned\u201d) (quoting <em>Ingraham v. Wright, </em>430 U.S. 651, 674, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Audett\u2019s motion for judicial notice is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Audett\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b377-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
