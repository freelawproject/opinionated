R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">This is a <em>pro se </em>state prisoner 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights appeal. Mr. Hairston seeks monetary damages on his claim that Defendant was deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The district court dismissed Mr. Hairston\u2019s complaint as legally frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Mr. Hairston appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">Mr. Hairston suffered pain after his jaw surgery. A dentist examined him and prescribed Motrin. Defendant Nurse subsequently told Mr. Hairston that he could not take Motrin because he had been previously diagnosed with Hepatitis C. She instead recommended Tylenol. Mr. Hair-ston complained that he would have to pay for Tylenol and that Tylenol was not strong enough for the pain. He also claimed that he was embarrassed by the public announcement that he has Hepatitis C.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-17\">We agree with the district court that Mr. Hairston\u2019s allegations do not rise to the level of an Eighth Amendment claim. Therefore, after a thorough review of Appellant\u2019s brief and the record, and for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned September 16, 2002, Order, we hold that no relief is available to Mr. Hairston.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-18\">The decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED. Appellant\u2019s motion to proceed without prepayment of the appellate filing fee is GRANTED. We remind Appellant that he must make partial payments on court fees and costs until such have been paid in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b825-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
