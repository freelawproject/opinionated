We affirm the district court and deny Ms. Cas-tille\u2019s motion for leave to proceed <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-23\">Ms. Castille brought an action against Compliance Solutions contending it violated Title VH\u2019s anti-retaliation provision, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a), by taking action against her for filing a previous complaint of age and race discrimination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Compliance Solutions filed a motion to dismiss, alleging it did not employ enough individuals during the time Ms. Castille worked for the company to subject it to a suit under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>Title VII. The district court, adopting and approving the recommendation of a magistrate judge, granted Compliance Solutions\u2019 motion and dismissed the case with prejudice. The court subsequently denied Ms. Castille\u2019s leave to file an appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>on the ground her appeal was frivolous and lacked good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Compliance Solutions cannot be subject to Ms. Castille\u2019s anti-retaliation suit unless it satisfies Title VII\u2019s statutory definition of employer. <em>See Walters v. Metropolitan Educ. Enter., Inc., </em>519 U.S. 202, 205, 117 S.Ct. 660, 136 L.Ed.2d 644 (1997). \u201cThe term \u2018employer\u2019 means a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b). Ms. Cas-tille does not address in either her response to Compliance Solutions\u2019 motion to dismiss, or in her appeal, whether her claim against Compliance Solutions meets this threshold requirement. Nor does she make any effort to counter Compliance Solutions\u2019 evidence of the same.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation for dismissal noted Compliance Solutions provided an affidavit from its president stating the company did not have fifteen or more employees during the time Ms. Cas-tille was employed there, or during the twenty weeks preceding her employment. The magistrate judge also cited a letter Ms. Castille attached to her complaint, in which she stated \u201cwhen I started working for [Compliance Solutions they had] 14 employees and when I left there was 10 employees.\u201d <em>Castille v. Compliance Solutions Occupational Trainers, Inc., </em>No. 01-RB-2523 at 6 (D. Colo. April 16, 2002) (unpublished recommendation for dismissal). Based on Ms. Castille\u2019s recitation of the number of employees at Compliance Solutions, coupled with her former employer\u2019s affidavit, we determine the district court correctly concluded Compliance Solutions did not fall within Title VII\u2019s definition of employer, and therefore it properly dismissed Ms. Castille\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Ms. Castille leave to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis. </em>A plaintiff must show the \u201cexistence of a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal\u201d in order to proceed <em>in forma pau-peris. DeBardeleben v. Quinlan, </em>937 F.2d 502, 505 (10th Cir.1991). \u201cAn appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies that it is not taken in good faith.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3). Here, the district court issued an order certifying as such. Based on our previous discussion affirming the district court\u2019s conclusion that Compliance Solutions did not employ the requisite number of people to subject it to a Title VII suit, we determine the district court correctly found Ms. Castille\u2019s appeal lacked legal support and was not in good faith. Accordingly, we DENY Ms. Castille\u2019s request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b878-15\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, or collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-25\">.
