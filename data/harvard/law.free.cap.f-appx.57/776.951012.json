Nunez argues that his waiver of his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently made. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>\u00a7 1291. We review <em>de novo. See United States v. Duarte-Higareda, </em>113 F.3d 1000, 1002 (9th Cir.1997). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Nunez\u2019s right to a jury trial is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. U.S. Const, amend. VI; <em>Duarte-Higareda, </em>113 F.3d at 1002. Nunez, however, may waive his right to a jury trial if the following four conditions are met: (1) the waiver is in writing; (2) the government consents; (3) the court accepts the waiver; and (4) the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Cochran, </em>770 F.2d 850, 851 (9th Cir.1985)). Only the last condition is contested in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Compliance with Fed. R.Crim. P. 23(a), requiring a written waiver of the right to a jury trial, creates a presumption that the waiver is voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. <em>Cochran, </em>770 F.2d at 851. That presumption, however, is eliminated when \u201cthe record indicates a special disadvantage or disability bearing upon the defendant\u2019s understanding of the jury waiver.\u201d <em>Duarte-Higareda, </em>113 F.3d at 1003. Here, Nunez, like Duarte-Higareda, speaks only Spanish. Throughout the proceedings a \u201cSpanish-to-English and English-to-Spanish\u201d court interpreter translated the proceedings for Nunez\u2019s benefit. Nunez\u2019s \u201clanguage barrier\u201d was a \u201cspecial disadvantage\u201d known to the district court; thus, the district court was required to conduct an adequate colloquy with Nunez \u201cto carry out its \u2018serious and weighty responsibility\u2019 of ensuring that a defendant\u2019s jury waiver is voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(holding that the district court is required to conduct a colloquy with a non-English-speaking defendant in order to ensure that defendant\u2019s waiver of his right of a jury trial was voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently made); <em>see also United States v. Christensen, </em>18 F.3d 822, 826 (9th Cir.1994) (when the district court suspects a defendant suffers from mental or emotional instability, the district court must conduct an in-depth colloquy that reasonably assures the court that the signed waiver of a jury trial was voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently made).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">The district court, through the court interpreter, conducted an adequate colloquy that reasonably assured the district court that Nunez voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his right to a jury trial. Because we find that his waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent, we AFFIRM Nunez\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b812-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
