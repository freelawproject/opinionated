The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 210 months of imprisonment and 5 years of supervised release. On appeal, his counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.5 (2001), which provides enhanced penalties for sex offenders against minors, should not have been applied to Jackson because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>he was not convicted of a \u201ccovered sex crime.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Jackson stipulated that he had agreed to pay the victim to meet him and to engage in sexually explicit conduct, which he would photograph, and we thus agree with the District Court that Jackson\u2019s pleaded-to offense was a \u201ccovered sex crime\u201d under section 4B1.5. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.5, cmt. n. 2 (\u201ccovered sex crime\u201d includes offense against minor under Chapter 110 of Title 18 of United States Code, but specifically excludes trafficking in, receipt of, or possession of child pornography, or record-keeping offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-29\">. The Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
