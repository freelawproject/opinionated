The District Court denied the petition without holding an evidentiary hearing. The District Court granted a certificate of appeal-ability with respect to two claims of ineffectiveness of counsel, but declined to grant a certificate of appealability on the lack of an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">Appellant Varela was tried in 1988 on charges of molesting and sexually abusing his niece. The initial alleged molestation took place when the niece was five; the sexual abuse when she was thirteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">Prior to trial, the trial judge heard argument on two <em>in limine </em>prosecution motions to preclude the introduction by the defense of character testimony with respect to three of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses \u2014 Sonya Gallardo, the alleged victim; Cynthia Gallardo, her older sister; and Gloria Gal-lardo, the mother of the two girls (appellant\u2019s sister). The trial judge granted the motions to preclude. Trial ensued, leading to the challenged conviction and resultant sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">On appeal Mr. Varela was represented by new counsel. The Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the character evidence appellant sought to admit was not probative of untruthfulness. <em>See </em>Ariz. R. Evid. 608(a). The court further reasoned that even if appellant was trying to prove that the victims had fabricated their stories, the character evidence \u2014 tales of the witnesses\u2019 smoking pot, \u201chang[ing] out in the barrio,\u201d and \u201crun[ning] around\u201ddid not demonstrate a motive for the witnesses to make false accusations. Varela did not appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-16\">Varela filed a <em>pro se </em>application for post-conviction relief in 1993, alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The Arizona trial court denied the motion. Varela filed another petition in 1996, this time represented by counsel. In it, Varela argued that trial counsel had been delinquent for failing to present Varela\u2019s claims that Gloria Gallardo had induced her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>daughters to he in retaliation for Varela\u2019s refusal to lend her money.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The trial court denied this petition as well, and the Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed in May of 1999. The court noted that, in order \u201c[t]o present a colorable claim for ineffective assistance of counsel,\u201d a petitioner seeking collaterally to challenge a conviction pursuant to <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), has the burden of showing both that counsel\u2019s performance fell below the level of competence required by <em>Strickland, </em>and that counsel\u2019s deficient representation resulted in demonstrable prejudice to the petitioner at trial. After pointing out that, \u201cwhere a petitioner has made an insufficient showing of prejudice, the court need not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was substandard,\u201d the Arizona Court of Appeals, without undertaking an assessment of the adequacy of trial counsel\u2019s performance, ruled that \u201cVarela has failed to demonstrate prejudice.\u201d The appeals court quoted from the trial judge\u2019s minute entry denying Rule 32 relief: the trial judge had stated it as his recollection that Varela had testified at trial about the intra-family conflicts, and the trial judge had expressed the opinion that the additional testimony about the victim and her sister and mother that Varela wished to introduce could not have prevailed over the \u201coverwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Varela then petitioned for federal habe-as relief, and the District Court dismissed his petition without an evidentiary hearing in June of 2001. Paraphrasing the pertinent language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), the District Court concluded that Varela had not shown that the Arizona Court of Appeals\u2019 decision with respect to <em>Strickland </em>was \u201ceither (1) contrary to clearly established Federal law or involved an unreasonable application of that law, or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Varela thereafter sought a certificate of appealability on claims that he was denied an evidentiary hearing and received ineffective assistance of counsel. The District Court concluded that Varela failed to explain what facts were in dispute that could have been resolved by an evidentiary hearing, and noted that when no factual basis for a claim has been developed in state court, an evidentiary hearing may only be held if (1) there is a new rule of constitutional law, or (2) the facts could not have been discovered earlier. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2)(A). As neither of those conditions prevailed, the District Court denied Varela\u2019s motion for a certificate of appeala-bility with respect to his request for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">The District Court granted the certificate of appealability on the two ineffective assistance of counsel claims: (1) counsel\u2019s failure to make an offer of proof concerning limitation of cross-examination and preclusion of evidence; and (2) counsel\u2019s offer of evidence under Rule 608(b) of the Arizona Rules of Evidence rather than under Rule 401, and failure to make an offer of proof to show motive and/or bias. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">This court reviews a denial (or grant) of habeas corpus <em>de novo. Bowen v. Hood, </em>202 F.3d 1211, 1218 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Dow-ney v. Crabtree, </em>100 F.3d 662, 663-64 (9th Cir.1996); <em>Weston v. Kernan, </em>50 F.3d 633, 636 (9th Cir.1995), 516 U.S. 937, 116 S.Ct. 351,133 L.Ed.2d 247 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">Pretermitting the question whether Varela\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s representation was substandard, the Arizona Court of Appeals went directly to the issue of whether, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the basis of the record before it, there was reason to conclude that counsel\u2019s allegedly substandard performance had caused Varela demonstrable prejudice. Noting that the record was \u201cextremely limited\u201d and that \u201c[wjith the exception of a few excerpted pages it is devoid of any transcripts or minute entries from [Varela\u2019s] trial and contains nothing from which we might conclude the trial court abused its discretion,\u201d the Arizona Court of Appeals pointed out that \u201cit is petitioner\u2019s responsibility to see that the record contains all materials necessary to our decision,\u201d and hence \u201cwe presume the missing material supports the actions of the trial court.\u201d For these reasons the Arizona Court of Appeals concluded that, in view of the trial court\u2019s \u201cfirst-hand observation\u201d of what transpired at trial \u201cwe defer to its conclusion that petitioner sustained no prejudice attributable to the alleged errors and omissions of counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">With matters in this posture, the District Court concluded that the ruling of the Arizona Court of Appeals was neither inconsistent with the governing due process rules nor grounded in \u201can unreasonable determination of the facts\u201d \u2014 and hence, on habeas, was unassailable. We think the reasoning and conclusions of the District Court were correct. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court denying habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b353-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
