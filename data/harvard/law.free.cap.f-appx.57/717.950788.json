California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the district court erred in its drug-quantity calculation. Gibson has filed a pro se supplemental brief, also challenging the drug-quantity calculation. Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude there was no clear error. <em>See United States v. Santana, </em>150 F.3d 860, 864 (8th Cir.1998) (standard of review). In his plea agreement Gibson stipulated that he was responsible for 27.18 grams of a mixture containing methamphetamine; at his sentencing hearing a former state criminalist testified that, following laboratory protocol, she had thrice tested a single sample of the methamphetamine and had found an average purity of 20%; and even factoring in the laboratory\u2019s 5% margin of error, the stipulated quantity of methamphetamine mixture would yield more than 5 grams of actual methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">We have further reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b754-8\">. The Honorable Robert W.
