We have reviewed the administrative record and find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that Tegegn failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution as necessary to qualify for relief from deportation. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4)(1994); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii)(2002); <em>Huaman-Cornelio v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.1992); <em>M.A. v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 307 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> She therefore could not meet the higher standard for withholding deportation. <em>See INS v. Cardozo-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 431-32, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-22\">Accordingly, we affirm the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b208-18\"> We note that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) was repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRI-RA) effective April 1, 1997. Because this case was in transition at the time the IIRIRA was passed, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) is still applicable here under the terms of the transitional rules contained in \u00a7 309(c) of the IIRIRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
