Wade was sentenced to 135 months imprisonment for the drug counts, and a consecutive term of eighty-four months for the \u00a7 924(c) offense. He appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in finding that he obstructed the investigation of the drug offenses. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 (2001). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Wade and the driver of the Toyota truck ahead of him in traffic were stopped by police after both ran a red light at high speed. The driver of the truck, Rhett Hamilton, told the police officer that Wade was chasing him to collect a drug debt and had threatened to kill him. Wade\u2019s passenger, Charles Hudson, told police that he and Hamilton had stolen cocaine from Wade and that Wade had then kidnaped him, assaulted him, and forced him at gunpoint and knife point to help locate Hamilton and the stolen drugs. He also said Wade had phoned his girlfriend after the police stopped the two vehicles and told her to get \u201cthe stuff\u201d out of his house and yard. The police recovered 441.3 grams of cocaine from Hamilton\u2019s truck. A shotgun was found in Wade\u2019s van and a knife was found in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">In a search of Wade\u2019s residence, police discovered two firearms and drug paraphernalia. Wade\u2019s girlfriend, Katy Bell, corroborated Hudson\u2019s account of the assault and kidnaping, and confirmed that Wade had called her and told her to get rid of the cocaine in the house. She said Brian Peterson, who was later charged with Wade as a co-conspirator, came to the house and took away the cocaine she had hidden. Peterson was arrested in Rhode Island four months later. He admitted that Bell called him after Wade\u2019s arrest and that he received about eight ounces of cocaine from her. The cocaine was never recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">At Wade\u2019s sentencing, the district court found that, by instructing Bell to conceal or destroy the cocaine at his house, Wade had earned an adjustment under USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 for conduct that \u201cobstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede ... the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense.\u201d Application Note 4(d) to \u00a7 3C1.1 directs that such conduct includes \u201cdestroying or concealing or directing or procuring another person to destroy or conceal evidence that is material to an official investigation ... or attempting to do so....\u201d An exception is made for conduct that \u201coccurred contemporaneously with arrest,\u201d such as \u201cattempting to swallow or throw away a controlled substance,\u201d unless it results in a material hindrance to the investigation or prosecution of the instant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Wade maintained that (1) when he called Bell, the only investigation under way involved traffic violations; (2) his action was contemporaneous with arrest and similar to swallowing or throwing away the drugs; and (3) his conduct did not materially hinder the investigation. The district court rejected these contentions, adopting the government\u2019s position that Wade acted deliberately, rather than instinctively, and with the intention of obstructing the investigation of his drug activities that he expected would follow. We find that the district court did not err in so finding. <em>United States v. Butner, </em>277 F.3d 481, 488 (4th Cir.) (ruling based on undisputed facts is legal issue reviewed de novo), <em>cert. denied, </em>536 U.S. 932, 122 S.Ct. 2610, 153 L.Ed.2d 795 (2002). With respect to the materiality of the eight ounces of cocaine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>that Wade successfully concealed, we note that the threshold for materiality is low, <em>United States v. Gormley, </em>201 F.3d 290, 294 (4th Cir.2000), and in any case, Wade\u2019s attempt to materially impede the investigation or prosecution of his drug offense is enough to warrant the adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
