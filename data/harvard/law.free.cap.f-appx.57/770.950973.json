We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.2000), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-17\">Rangel contends that he failed to appear for his deportation hearing because he never received written notice. Notice was sent to his last known address, however, and the certified mail receipt bears his signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-24\">A notice sent by certified mail creates a strong presumption of delivery. <em>See Salta v. INS, </em>314 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir.2002). While this presumption can be rebutted by an affirmative defense of nondelivery or improper delivery based on substantial and probative evidence, <em>see Arrieta v. INS, </em>117 F.3d 429, 432 (9th Cir.1997), Rangel\u2019s declaration with accompanying writing samples stating that the signature on the return receipt is a forgery was insufficient. Accordingly, the IJ did not abuse his discretion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b806-35\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
