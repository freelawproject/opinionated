Salazar (\u201cSalazar\u201d) was charged as follows: Count 1, with unlawfully possessing, on May 17, 2000, with an intent to distribute less than 500 grams of a mixture containing a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; Count 2, with unlawfully possessing, on June 3, 2000, with an intent to distribute more than 500 grams of a mixture containing a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. At trial, Salazar admitted to all of the elements of the two charges and his defense was entrapment by a government informant as to each of the two counts, each of which was based on a different transaction occurring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>on a different date. After the jury had deliberated for several hours, the jury sent a note to the court asking if they could be considered \u201chung\u201d at that time. In response to that note, the district court responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-5\">Folks, my understanding from your note is that you\u2019re having a little trouble reaching a verdict. And rather than, at this point, declaring things over, I\u2019m going to send you home for the evening and ask you to report back tomorrow morning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">On the following morning, the district court, without objection, gave the jury the so-called <em>Allen </em>instruction, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-7\">Each of you must decide the case for yourself, but only after an impartial consideration of the evidence with your fellow jurors. In the course of your deliberations, do not hesitate to re-examine your own views and change your opinion, if convinced it is erroneous, but do not surrender your honest conviction as to the weight or effect of the evidence solely because of the opinion of your fellow jurors or for the mere purpose of returning a verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-8\">You are not partisans, you are judges, judges of the facts. Your sole interest is to ascertain the truth from the evidence in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-9\">Now, I am not pressuring you to go anywhere that your conscience dictates that you should not go after listening to the evidence in the case. And you\u2019ve got the instructions about what the law is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-10\">As I say, I am not trying to pressure you one way or the other in terms of which way you ought to go, because I don\u2019t have an opinion on this case. I\u2019ve just been here to try to make sure that the process is a fair one. And the decision remains with you. And if, at the end of your deliberations \u2014 or if you reach a point where there just is no place else to go, we\u2019ll accept that. I mean, you\u2019ve done your job.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">The jury then resumed its deliberation. A short time later the jury sent another note to the court, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad5Y\">Sir, could you please explain to us in easier terms \u201cinducement\u201d in layman\u2019s term? And \u201cpromise of reward\u201d and \u201cfriendship\u201d in the meaning of \u201cinducement.\u201d Some examples please.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">In this connection, the district court had previously given the jury instructions on the defense of entrapment and, without objection, gave the following instruction on \u201cinducement:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-14\">Inducement is any conduct on the part of the government agent or informant that creates a substantial risk than an indisposed person or otherwise law-abiding citizen would commit the offense. Inducement may arise from persuasion, fraudulent misrepresentations, threats, coercive tactics, harassment, promises of reward, or pleas based on need, sympathy, or friendship. However, evidence that a government agent approached, solicited or requested that the defendant engage in criminal conduct, standing alone, is insufficient to constitute inducement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-15\">Thus, if you find from the evidence that defendant Salazar was induced to commit the crime addressed in the indictment, and at the time was not predisposed to otherwise commit the crime, you must acquit the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">In response to the note from the jury asking for a further definition of the word \u201cinducement,\u201d the district court responded to the jury in open court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-17\">I see, Ms. Dorsey [jury foreperson], that we have another question, and I\u2019m <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>going to share that with the lawyers here in just a moment, and we\u2019ll take that up and see if there is anything that we can give you beyond what\u2019s already in the instructions. I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve already read them repeatedly. On the word \u201cinducement\u201d we may be not be able to do any better than that, but we\u2019ll see what we can do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-4\">I, actually, have a full schedule starting at 8:30 of sentencing and pleas to take today, but we\u2019ll get right on this and see what we can do with it and get an answer to you as quickly as we can, even if it\u2019s nothing more than, \u201cplease re-read Instruction Number whatever.\u201d Okay?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The jury then returned to its deliberations, and the district court instructed the prosecutor and defense counsel to take a few minutes to research some examples of \u201cinducement.\u201d However, the jury, in about ten minutes, returned a verdict before the district court had further conferred with counsel about the matter or given any additional instruction on inducement. No objection was made at trial to receiving the jury\u2019s verdict without further instruction to the jury on \u201cinducement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The jury by its verdict acquitted Salazar on Count 1, but convicted him on Count 2. Salazar was later sentenced to 41 months imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Salazar appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">On appeal, counsel raises two issues: (1), \u201c[w]hether the modified <em>Allen </em>charge given to the jury was coercive;\u201d and (2), \u201c[wjhether it was plain error for the district court not to answer a jury question when the jury indicates through its query that it is confused as to an important legal element in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">Neither of the two matters urged in this court as grounds for reversal was raised in the district court. Thus, counsel necessarily relies on the \u201cplain error\u201d rule. Fed. R. Crim.P. 52(b). That rule provides that a \u201c[pjlain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d If there be \u201cerror\u201d that is \u201cplain\u201d and affects \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d a court of appeals has \u201cdiscretion\u201d which shall not be exercised unless the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S. Ct. 1770,123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">1. <em>Allen </em>Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b838-14\">An <em>Allen </em>instruction has long been sanctioned, depending, of course, upon its content and the context in which it is given, and we have previously held that, although it is \u201cpreferred practice\u201d that it be given along with the other instructions before the jury commences its deliberations, \u201cthere is no per se rule against giving an <em>Allen </em>charge after a jury has commenced deliberations.\u201d <em>United States v. Arney, </em>248 F.3d 984, 988 (10th Cir.2001). As above stated, in the instant ease the <em>Allen </em>instruction was not given to the jury before it began its deliberations but was given after the jury indicated that it might be \u201chung.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-15\">The \u201ccontent\u201d of the <em>Allen </em>instruction given to the jury in the present case is in accord with prior pronouncements of this court. It is a so-called \u201cmodified\u201d charge that was directed to all members of the jury rather than being directed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>\u201cthose holding the minority view.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For extensive background on this matter, <em>see United States v. McElhiney, </em>275 F.3d 928 (10th Cir.2001). In <em>McElhiney, </em>we held that the <em>Allen </em>instruction given the jury was \u201cimpermissibly coercive\u201d and reversed the conviction. However, the facts and circumstances of the present case are far different than those in <em>McElhiney, </em>and the <em>Allen </em>instruction given in the instant case was not \u201cimpermissibly coercive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">2. Inducement</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">As above stated, the district court instructed the jury on the defense of entrapment and in connection therewith gave a separate instruction on \u201cinducement,\u201d and there was no objection to either. When the jury sent a note to the court indicating that they would like an additional instruction on \u201cinducement,\u201d the district court, in open court with counsel and the jury present, verbally responded to the note, the response thereto being set forth above. That response was candid and impartial in tone, and stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that there well might not be \u201canything that we can give you beyond what\u2019s already in the instructions,\u201d the court adding \u201cI\u2019m sure you have already read through them repeatedly.\u201d As an addendum to the foregoing, the district court again stated \u201c[o]n the word \u2018inducement,\u2019 we may not be able to do any better than that, but we\u2019ll see what we can do.\u201d It was in this setting that the jury resumed its deliberations and shortly thereafter returned its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">In our view, under the totality of the circumstances, we fail to detect \u201cerror,\u201d which was \u201cplain error\u201d and affected \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d let alone \u201cplain error\u201d that \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">There is some suggestion by counsel that since the jury acquitted Salazar on Count 1 and convicted him on Count 2, such somehow shows that the jury was \u201cconfused\u201d on the question of \u201cinducement.\u201d The government, in turn, argues that the two verdicts, rather than being inconsistent, were in fact consistent and quite understandable. In this regard, the government concedes that as to the first possession on May 17, 2000, the jurors might well have thought there was \u201cinducement,\u201d but that as to the second possession, occurring some three weeks later on June 3, 2000, the jury might well have concluded, as it did, that Salazar was not induced or entrapped a second time when he was attempting to sell four times the amount of cocaine involved in the first sale. In any event, we decline to speculate on that matter. \u201c[A] verdict will not be upset on the basis of speculation.\u201d <em>Howard D. Jury, Inc. v. R &amp; G Sloane Mfg. Co., </em>666 F.2d 1348,1351 (10th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b836-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-8\">. After the jury's verdict was announced in open court, the district court polled the individual jurors, each juror stating that the ver-diet as read in open court was his, or her, verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
