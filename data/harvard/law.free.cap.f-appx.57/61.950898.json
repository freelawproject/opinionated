California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-21\">After a complete and careful review of the entire record in this matter it is clear that there are no meritorious issues present and that this appeal is wholly frivolous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-22\">Our jurisprudence requires that counsel in an <em>Anders </em>situation adequately attempt to uncover the best arguments for his or her client. <em>See United States v. Marvin, </em>211 F.3d 778 (3d Cir.1999). Counsel\u2019s brief represents that he has referred to those portions of the record that might arguably support the appeal and direct the Court to the relevant law. Having read the record, we are satisfied that counsel has fulfilled his <em>Anders </em>obligations, and agree with his estimate of the appeal. Counsel\u2019s brief addressed two questions: (1) was Mosier\u2019s guilty plea entered knowingly and voluntarily and in conformity with the law; and (2) was the sentence imposed legal. We have reviewed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>comprehensive sentencing colloquy including the comprehensive advice of rights and accompanying waivers offered, as well as extensive description of the factual basis for the plea, including Mosier\u2019s admissions that he was guilty as charged. We find no basis for appeal with respect to voluntariness of the plea. Neither do we discern any problems with the sentence, or any other possible grounds for appeal. We will therefore grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw, and will affirm the judgment on the merits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-23\">. Mosier filed his appeal pro se, and we afforded him an opportunity to file a pro se brief. Mosier filed a motion for an extension of time, which we granted on July 18, 2002, extending this time for filed of a brief to August 26, 2002. Mosier did not file a brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-14\">. We also note our view that, because the issues presented in the appeal lack legal merit, they do not require the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. Third Cir. LAR 109.2(b)(2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
