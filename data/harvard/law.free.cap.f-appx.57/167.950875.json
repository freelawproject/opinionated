To be entitled to a certificate of appealability, an appellant must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). When dismissal occurs on procedural grounds, the petitioner \u201cmust demonstrate both: (1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right,\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318,151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"pAxg\">Upon examination of Smith\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition and the record, we cannot conclude that reasonable jurists would find it debatable whether the district court correctly concluded the petition was untimely. <em>See Smith v. Woodard, </em>No. CA-00-914-5-F-3 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 5, 2002).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-24\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-25\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b203-18\"> The one-year limitations period commenced on October 5, 1998, ninety days after the North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed Smith\u2019s conviction on July 7, 1998. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A); <em>Harris v. Hutchinson, </em>209 F.3d 325, 327 (4th Cir.2000). Smith\u2019s subsequent pursuit of collateral review in the North Carolina Court of Appeals was properly filed, and tolled his one-year filing period; however, Smith's pursuit of collateral review in the North Carolina Supreme Court was improperly filed, and did not toll his filing period. <em>Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 8, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000). Consequently, Smith\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 was due by May 14, 2000. Smith's petition was signed and therefore filed on December 1, 2000. <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 270, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). Accordingly, Smith's 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
