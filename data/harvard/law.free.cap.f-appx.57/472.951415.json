McAvoy, <em>Judge) </em>dismissing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In 1995, Hawkins was convicted following a plea of guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts of being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and sentenced to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed Hawkins\u2019s conviction, and the Supreme Court denied his petition for certio-rari.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">In 1999, Hawkins filed in the District of Massachusetts a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was denied. Later, Hawkins filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the Northern District of New York, which that court transferred to the First Circuit. The First Circuit treated Hawkins\u2019s petition as an application for authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition, and the court denied the application. Hawkins then filed in the Northern District of New York a second petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, which the District Court treated as a \u00a7 2255 petition and transferred to the sentencing court, the District of Massachusetts, which denied Hawkins\u2019s petition as an uncertified successive \u00a7 2255 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">On March 15, 2001, Hawkins filed a third \u00a7 2241 petition in the Northern District of New York, the petition at issue in this appeal. In this petition, Hawkins argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740,146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), and <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), established that he is actually innocent, as there was no evidence showing that the firearm he possessed had been \u201cin commerce.\u201d Adopting a Report and Recommendation of United States Magistrate Judge David R. Homer, the District Court granted the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss Hawkins\u2019s habeas petition and denied the petition. Hawkins appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">We have seen nothing in the record to indicate that Hawkins\u2019s plea of guilty was entered conditionally; therefore, he waived his right to review of any nonjurisdictional contentions, either on direct appeal or by collateral attack. <em>See Hayle v. United States, </em>815 F.2d 879, 881 (2d Cir.1987). To the extent that Hawkins would seek to characterize his invocation of the new Supreme Court cases as a jurisdictional argument, this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">We have held that \u201cneither <em>Morrison </em>nor <em>Jones </em>requires us to revisit our prior holding that only a minimal nexus with interstate commerce is necessary under \u00a7 922(g).\u201d <em>United States v. Gaines, </em>295 F.3d 293, 302 (2d Cir.2002) (citing <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>238 F.3d 213, 216-17 (2d Cir.2001) <em>(per </em>curiam)). To the extent that Hawkins asserts that the wording of the indictment (alleging that Hawkins possessed firearms and ammunition \u201cin and affecting commerce\u201d) required the Government to establish both that he possessed firearms and ammunition \u201cin commerce\u201d and that he possessed firearms and ammunition \u201caffecting commerce,\u201d his claim fails. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), (g)(1) (\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punisha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>ble by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to ... possess in <em>or </em>affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition ....\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>United States v. Canady, </em>126 F.3d 352, 357 n. 2 (2d Cir. 1997) (holding that \u201cindictments worded in the conjunctive, charging violations of statutes that are worded in the disjunctive, can be supported by proof of either of the means of violating the act\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">We have considered the appellant\u2019s other contentions and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
