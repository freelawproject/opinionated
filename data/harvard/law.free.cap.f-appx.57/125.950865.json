On March 4, 2002, the District Court substituted the United States of America (\u201cthe Government\u201d) for all of the defendants, except Lucia Mancini. Subsequently, the District Court entered summary judgment in favor of the Government. The Sisks now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-17\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we have jurisdiction over \u201cfinal\u201d orders of a district court. \u201cOrdinarily, an order which terminates fewer than all claims, or claims against fewer than all parties, does not constitute a \u2018final\u2019 order for purposes of appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d <em>Carter v. City of Philadelphia, </em>181 F.3d 339, 343 (3d Cir.1999); <em>see also Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945) (stating that, generally, a decision is final for purposes of section 1291 only when it \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment\u201d). Our review of the record has uncovered that the Sisks\u2019 claims against Mancini have not been adjudicated in any way by the District Court and no exception to the rule that we review only final orders applies. <em>See, e.g., </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) (stating that an order that does not adjudicate all claims against all parties may be considered \u201cfinal\u201d and immediately appealable under section 1291 when the district court makes an express determination that there is no just cause for delay and expressly directs entry of final judgment). We asked the parties to address the issue and they have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>not pointed to any evidence indicating that Mancini is not a party to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
