When, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2254 petition solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability mil not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have reviewed the record and conclude that Bryant fails to satisfy the first prong of the test recited in <em>Rose. </em>Therefore, we need not determine whether the district court\u2019s procedural ruling that Bryant\u2019s petition was time-barred was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-22\">Bryant fails to make any argument on appeal that his \u00a7 2254 petition states a meritorious claim of the denial of a constitutional right. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss Bryant\u2019s appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
