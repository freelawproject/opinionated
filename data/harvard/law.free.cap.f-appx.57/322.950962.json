Plaintiffs seek to invalidate the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA), in which 46 states and several U.S. territories agreed to settle their claims against the cigarette manufacturers for recovery of smoking-related healthcare costs. Plaintiffs sought leave from the district court to file an amended com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>plaint alleging that, through the MSA, Defendants are operating an output cartel and controlling cigarette prices in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-7. The district court denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Plaintiffs assert that the district court committed an error of law by relying on undue delay alone as justification for denying their motion to amend. <em>See Bowles v. Reade, </em>198 F.3d 752, 758 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cUndue delay by itself ... is insufficient to justify denying a motion to amend.\u201d). However, we also have held that, even if a district court provides an insufficient explanation for denying a motion to amend, we may affirm if a satisfactory ground for denial is \u201creadily apparent\u201d from the record. <em>Ascon Props., Inc. v. Mobil Oil Co., </em>866 F.2d 1149,1160 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">It is readily apparent from this record that Defendants will suffer prejudice if Plaintiffs are allowed to amend their complaint. <em>See Griggs v. Pace Am. Group, Inc., </em>170 F.3d 877, 880 (9th Cir.1999) (citing prejudice to the opposing party as a ground for denial of leave to amend). Although the parties engaged in discovery with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 other claims, they would have to reopen discovery if amendment were allowed. <em>See Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Network Solutions, Inc., </em>194 F.3d 980, 986 (9th Cir.1999) (stating that a \u201cneed to reopen discovery and therefore delay the proceedings supports a district court\u2019s finding of prejudice from a delayed motion to amend\u201d). Further, because dismissal of the entire action would be warranted if Plaintiffs had not belatedly sought to allege antitrust violations, Defendants will incur additional litigation expenses if Plaintiffs\u2019 amendment is allowed. <em>See Ascon Props., </em>866 F.2d at 1161 (\u201cTo put [the defendant] through the time and expense of continued litigation on a new theory, with the possibility of additional discovery, would cause undue prejudice.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). In the circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b358-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
