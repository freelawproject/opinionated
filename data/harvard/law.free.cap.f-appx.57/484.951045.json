Baghdady (\u201cGeorge\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s February 14, 2002 judgment, entered after the jury\u2019s verdict, dismissing George\u2019s complaint against his brother, Sami J. Baghdady (\u201cSami\u201d). The complaint charged Sami with breach of contract, fraud and unfair trade practices in association with the transfer of George\u2019s ownership in a parcel of land in Lebanon to Sami. George argues that the district court erred by: 1) failing to either dismiss his contract and Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (\u201cCUTPA\u201d), Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 42-110a et seq., claims as legally insufficient or present those claims to the jury; 2) failing to engage in choice of law analysis, and, by extension, failing to apply Lebanese law; 3) concluding that his contract claim was barred by the statute of frauds; 4) holding that his CUTPA claim was legally insufficient; and 5) excluding evidence about a second plot of land adjoining the property at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">As an initial matter, we reject Sami\u2019s contention that we should not consider the merits of George\u2019s arguments because they have been inadequately briefed, in violation of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(9). George\u2019s briefs are sufficiently compliant with Rule 28 to warrant this Court\u2019s review of the arguments contained within them. <em>Cf. Sioson v. Knights of Columbus, </em>303 F.3d 458, 459-60 (2d Cir.2002) (per curiam) (dismissing appeal for failure to submit an adequate brief where appellant\u2019s brief did not have a statement of facts or summary of the argument, \u201cfurnishe[d] ... only a precis on the law ... [and included] not one fact, or supposed fact, let alone a fact properly cited to the record, in the briefs \u2018argument\u2019 section\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">However, after consideration of George\u2019s arguments, we reject each of them, in turn. First, the district court\u2019s refusal to present George\u2019s contract and CUTPA claims to the jury does not provide a basis for disturbing the judgment because, as we hold below, George\u2019s contract and CUTPA claims fail as a matter of law. Second, there was no error in the district court\u2019s failure to address the choice of law issue because George never raised it before the district court as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">Third, George\u2019s contract claim was barred by the statute of frauds because there was no written evidence of the essential terms of the alleged contract. <em>See Lynch v. Davis, </em>181 Conn. 434, 435 A.2d 977, 979 (Conn.1980) (\u201cessential terms] must at least consist of the subject of the sale, the terms of it and the parties to it\u201d; \u201cA memorandum is insufficient if it fails to specify the terms of payment of any part of the purchase price____\u201d). The part performance exception is inapposite because any steps taken were not in furtherance of the contract which George claims existed. <em>See Dunham v. Dunham, </em>204 Conn. 303, 528 A.2d 1123,1130 (Conn.1987) (\u201cThe doctrine of part performance requires, ... as an essential element, conduct that is referable to and consistent with an oral agreement between the parties.\u201d (internal punctuation removed)).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Fourth, George\u2019s CUTPA claim is legally insufficient because, although the complaint summarily alleges the he and Sami \u201cwere engaged in trade or commerce at all times material to this proceeding,\u201d there is no evidence that Sami was in the \u201ctrade or business\u201d of purchasing property. <em>See Quimby v. Kimberly Clark Corp., </em>28 Conn. App. 660, 613 A.2d 838, 844 (Conn.App.Ct. 1992) (\u201cIn order to allege a CUTPA violation properly, the plaintiff must allege ... that the acts complained of were performed in a \u2018trade or business.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Pfeffer v. Fontana, </em>No. CV 970340872, 1997 WL 809935, at *2 (Conn.Super.Ct. Dec.30, 1997) (weight of authority holds that a onetime sale of real estate by one not engaged in the business of selling real estate does not state a claim under CUTPA). Nor did George establish a sufficient nexus between the alleged real estate transaction and either the public interest, <em>see Conaway v. Prestia, </em>191 Conn. 484, 464 A.2d 847, 852 (Conn.1983), or trade or commerce within Connecticut. <em>See </em>Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 42-110a (defining \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d as \u201cthe sale or ... the offering for sale ... [of] any property, [including] real [property] ... <em>in this state\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Finally, even if the district court erred by excluding the proffered evidence about the adjoining parcel, any such error was harmless. That evidence was relevant, if at all, only to the issue of damages. Because we affirm the dismissal of George\u2019s complaint in its entirety, damages are no longer at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">We have considered all of George\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
