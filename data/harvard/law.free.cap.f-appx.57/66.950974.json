Because Prokic faded to properly raise this issue in his brief and because 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(d)(2)(i)(D) (2001) provides for summary dismissal if a brief or statement is not filed after a party has indicated that he or she will do so, we affirm the decision of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">Prokic is a 63-year-old native and citizen of Serbia, in the Republic of Yugoslavia, who was admitted to the United States on December 9, 1992. He entered on a six month visitor visa and never left. Instead, Prokic filed an application for asylum, which was eventually referred to an immigration judge. On or about September 4, 1997, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) placed Prokic in removal proceedings for having remained in the United States longer than permitted. On April 14, 1998, an immigration judge found Prokic removable as charged and ruled that he was ineligible for asylum. However, the immigration judge granted Prokic voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-14\">Prokic filed a notice of appeal with the BIA and indicated that he would file a brief. The BIA set a briefing schedule on September 4, 1998, which required Prokic\u2019s brief to be filed by October 5, 1998. On September 11, 1998, the INS filed a notice that it concurred with the decision of the immigration judge and would not be filing a formal brief. Prokic did not respond to the notice and failed to file a brief. On March 22, 2002, the BIA summarily dismissed the appeal because Prokic had failed to file a brief and failed to explain his failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-16\">We have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final order of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). We review the BIA\u2019s decision unless the BIA defers to the decision of the immigration judge. <em>See Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 549 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-18\">Prokic argues that he produced sufficient evidence to establish a well-founded fear of persecution in Serbia. However, as we have stated, the BIA dismissed Prokic\u2019s appeal for failure to file a brief. Specifically, the BIA ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-19\">The appeal is dismissed. The appellant checked Box 6 on the Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) indicating that a separate written brief or statement would be filed in addition to the reasons for appeal accompanying the Notice of Appeal. Block 6 is immediately followed by a clear warning that the appeal may be subject to summary dismissal if the appellant indicates that such a brief or statement will be filed and, \u201cwithin the time set for filing, you fail to file the brief or statement and do not reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>explain such failure.\u201d The appellant was granted the opportunity to submit a brief or statement in support of the appeal. However, the record indicates that appellant did \u201cnot file such brief or statement, or reasonably explain his or her failure to do so, within the time set for filing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(d)(2)(i)(D).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">In order for ProMe to prevail on this appeal, he must first establish that the BIA erred in dismissing his appeal for failure to submit a brief. \u201cAn issue is waived unless a party raises it in its opening brief.\u201d <em>See Laborers\u2019 Int\u2019l Union of N. Am. v. Foster Wheeler Corp., </em>26 F.3d 375, 398 (3d Cir.1994). Because Prokic neglected to put forth any argument challenging the BIA\u2019s summary dismissal of his appeal, he has waived his challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">However, even if Prokic were to have raised this issue in his brief, we would affirm the decision of the BIA. \u201cAn appellant\u2019s failure to file a brief is a serious procedural default, and, at least when the appellant is represented by counsel, as in the present case, or declines an offer of counsel, dismissal is an appropriate sanction.\u201d <em>Stroe v. INS, </em>256 F.3d 498, 499 (7th Cir.2001). Notice of Appeal, Form EOIR-26, contains a clear warning that an appeal may be subject to summary dismissal if the appellant indicates that a brief will be filed and then fails to file a brief within the allotted time and without explanation. Dismissal under such circumstances is appropriate pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(d)(2)(i)(D) (2001). Prokic fails to set forth any explanation for why he failed to comply with the clear directive contained in the Notice of Appeal and the Code of Federal Regulations. As a result, based on the BIA\u2019s straightforward application of the relevant code provision, we find no reason to grant the petition to review the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, we affirm the Order of the Board of Immigration Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
