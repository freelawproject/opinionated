Gilchrist\u2019s case was referred to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that the employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment be granted and clearly advised Gilchrist that failure to file specific and timely objections to his recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Gilchrist failed to file specific objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-22\">Pursuant to \u00a7 636(b)(1), a district court is required to conduct a de novo review of those portions of the magistrate judge\u2019s report to which a specific objection has been made. The court need not conduct de novo review, however, \u201cwhen a party makes general and conclusory objections that do not direct the court to a specific error in the magistrate\u2019s proposed findings and recommendations.\u201d <em>Orpiano v. Johnson, </em>687 F.2d 44, 47 (4th Cir.1982); <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b). The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to so object will waive appellate review. <em>Orpiano, 687 F.3d </em>at 47. As found by the district court, Gilchrist has waived appellate review by failing to direct the district court to specific errors in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. <em>United States v. Schronce, 727 </em>F.2d 91, 93-94 (4th Cir.1994) (failure to file objections waives appellate review). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b613-17\"> The district court also found that the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to grant summary judgment was correct, in any event, as the record was undisputed that Gilchrist voluntarily left his employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
