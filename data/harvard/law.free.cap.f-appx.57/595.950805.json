We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-24\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment is appropriate only if there are no material facts in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-25\">We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint appendix, and the district court\u2019s order. The district court properly concluded Olarinde failed to present evidence that could establish that Holy Cross\u2019 proffered reasons for failing to promote her were a pretext for illegal discrimination. <em>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 147-48, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Olarinde v. Holy Cross Hosp. of Silver Spring, Inc., </em>CA-01-3101-PJM (D. Md. filed Aug. 15, 2002; entered Aug. 16, 2002). We grant Holy Cross\u2019 motion to submit this appeal on the briefs and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
