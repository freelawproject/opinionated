An appeal may not be taken to this court in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>\u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). When, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2254 petition solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right,\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have reviewed the record and, for the reasons stated below, conclude that Lester has not made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In March 1975, Lester pled guilty in South Carolina state court to murder and armed robbery, for which he received consecutive fifteen year prison terms on the armed robbery counts and life in prison on the murder count. Lester did not file a direct appeal. His first state application for post-conviction relief was denied in June 1983. On July 5, 1995, Lester filed a second state application for post-conviction relief, which was denied on June 9, 1997. His third application, filed in March 1998, was dismissed on March 22,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">On September 23, 1999, Lester filed a federal habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Lester dated the petition August 10, 1999. The magistrate judge recommended granting Respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the petition was untimely filed, procedurally barred, and meritless. The district court did not expressly adopt the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, but concluded that Lester\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely and therefore granted Respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Under this circuit\u2019s local rules, this court \u201climit[s] its review to the issues raised in the informal brief.\u201d 4th Cir. R. 34(b). The court expressly warned Lester that it would not consider issues not specifically raised in his informal brief. Despite this warning, Lester failed to challenge in his informal brief the district court\u2019s conclusion that his \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely, and instead argued the merits of his petition. Therefore, he waived the issue of timeliness and cannot meet the criteria for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Even if he had not waived the timeliness issue, we find that Lester\u2019s habeas petition was time barred. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) (2000), a one-year limitations period applies to the filing of \u00a7 2254 petitions. The statutory period is tolled during the pendency of any properly filed state collateral review proceedings. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2); <em>Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 8-9, 121 S.Ct. 361,148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000). Because Lester\u2019s convictions became final before the enactment of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996) (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), the one-year limitations period commenced on April 24, 1996. <em>Harris v. Hutchinson, </em>209 F.3d 325, 327-28 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">At the time the limitations period began to run, Lester had an application for post-conviction relief pending in state court. That petition was denied on June 9, 1997. Under the AEDPA, \u201cthe limitations period is tolled from the time an application for state post-conviction relief is initially filed until it is finally disposed of by the state courts, including times between denials of claims and appeals.\u201d <em>Spencer v. Sutton, </em>239 F.3d 626, 629 (4th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Hernandez v. Caldwell, </em>225 F.3d 435, 438 (4th Cir.2000)). This Court has stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) the entire period of state post-conviction proceedings, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>initial filing to final disposition by the highest state court (whether decision on the merits, denial of certiorari, or <em>expiration of the period of time to seek farther appellate </em>review), is tolled from the limitations period for federal habeas corpus petitioners who were already involved in state post-conviction proceedings on April 24,1996.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><em>Taylor v. Lee, </em>186 F.3d 557, 561 (4th Cir. 1999) (emphasis added); <em>see also Carey v. Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 2136, 2138, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002). Neither the Supreme Court nor this court has specifically addressed the issue of whether the time for filing an appeal of the denial of post-conviction relief is counted in the tolling period when no notice of appeal is filed. In this case it makes no difference because, even if the period is included, Lester\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">As stated above, Lester\u2019s second state post-conviction application was pending when the AEDPA\u2019s limitations period began running on April 24, 1996. The state court denied the application on June 9, 1997, and, under South Carolina\u2019s procedural rules, Lester had thirty days to appeal. <em>See </em>S.C.R. Civ. P. 71.1(f); S.C.App. Ct. R. 203(b), 227(b). Therefore, if the appeal period is included in the tolling, Lester\u2019s application for post-conviction relief was pending, and the AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations did not begin to run, until July 9, 1997. Lester\u2019s third state application for post-conviction relief was filed on March 27, 1998, and dismissed on March 22, 1999. Thus, the AEDPA limitations period also was tolled beginning on March 27, 1998. The period was tolled, at the latest, until April 21, 1999, the date the time expired for Lester to appeal from the March 22, 1999, order dismissing his third application.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Counting the 260 days between Lester\u2019s second and third applications for post-conviction relief, and resuming the running of the limitations period on April 22, 1999, Lester had 105 days, or until August 4, 1999, to file his federal habeas petition. However, Lester did not file his \u00a7 2254 petition until, at the earliest, August 10, 1999.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Lester\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely, Lester cannot meet the criteria for obtaining a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">As part of its analysis, the district court discussed Rule 9(b) of the Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 Cases. This rule addresses second or successive \u00a7 2254 petitions. The district court appears to have discussed this rule in relation to Lester\u2019s multiple state habeas corpus petitions. We note that Rule 9(b) is inapplicable to Lester\u2019s case because the rule concerns second or successive federal \u00a7 2254 petitions, rather than state post-conviction petitions, and this was Lester\u2019s first \u00a7 2254 petition. In any event, Lester waived this issue by failing to raise it in his informal brief and, as discussed above, Lester\u2019s petition was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">For these reasons, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss Lester\u2019s appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\"> We note that Lester\u2019s third state application for post-conviction relief was dated March 24, 1998, although it was not filed until March 27, 1998. Even if we considered the application to be filed as of March 24, 1998, the additional three days of tolling would have given Lester until Monday, August 9, 1999, at the latest, to file his \u00a7 2254 petition. Thus, his petition still would be untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
