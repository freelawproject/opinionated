However, the petitioner, Manuel Zazueta-Car-rillo, did not make that argument before the Board of Immigration Appeals or before the immigration judge below, which defeats his claim at the outset.</p>\n<p id=\"A1S\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), \u201c[a] court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies as of right.\u201d We have held that \u201c[f]ailure to raise an issue in an appeal to the BIA constitutes a failure to exhaust remedies with respect to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>question and deprives this court of jurisdiction to hear the matter.\u201d <em>Ochave v. INS, </em>254 F.3d 859, 867 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Vargas v. INS, </em>831 F.2d 906, 907-08 (9th Cir.1987). Because Zazueta-Carrillo did not make his argument presented here before the administrative tribunals, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"ADe\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b796-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
