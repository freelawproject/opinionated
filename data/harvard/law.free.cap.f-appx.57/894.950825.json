James appeals from a judgment entered in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York (Elfvin, <em>J.) </em>on May 30, 2002, denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. James is currently serving a sentence for his 1988 conviction in New York state court on counts of first-degree manslaughter, second-degree (felony) murder, burglary, and assault. On appeal, as in the district court, James argues that his trial counsel had a <em>per se </em>conflict of interest that violated his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel because his lawyer concealed evidence of James\u2019s crime, instructed James to lie to authorities, was arrested for interfering with James\u2019s arrest, and eventually faced prosecution for obstruction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See Ryan v. Miller, </em>303 F.3d 231, 245 (2d Cir.2002). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>See Morris v. Reynolds, </em>264 F.3d 38, 45 (2d Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>536 U.S. 915, 122 S.Ct. 2381, 153 L.Ed.2d 199 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">1. James\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim finds arguable support in precedents of this Court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Fulton, </em>5 F.3d 605, 612 (2d Cir. 1993) (holding that a cooperating co-defendant\u2019s \u201callegations that lead trial counsel was engaged with him in heroin trafficking created an actual conflict of interest of the sort that requires application of the <em>per se </em>rule\u201d); <em>United States v. Cancilla, </em>725 F.2d 867, 867 (2d Cir.1984) (recognizing a <em>per se </em>conflict of interest where there is evidence that \u201ccounsel had himself engaged in criminal activity related to the conduct for which defendant was convicted\u201d); <em>Solina v. United States, </em>709 F.2d 160, 161,168 (2d Cir.1983) (recognizing a <em>per se </em>conflict of interest where a defendant was represented at trial by a person not admitted to the bar).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">2. However, where a habeas petitioner\u2019s claim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,\u201d our review is circumscribed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-6\">An application ... shall not be granted with respect to [such a] claim ... unless the adjudication of the claim (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). James asserted his ineffective assistance claim in a \u00a7 440 motion for post-conviction relief, which the state court denied; the Appellate Division denied leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">3. James can rely on none of the exceptions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). First, James does not contend that the state court denied his claim based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">Second, the state court ruling did not result in \u201ca decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, <em>as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) (emphasis added); <em>see also Gilchrist v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>260 F.3d 87, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (defining \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d as \u201c \u2018the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of [the Supreme Court\u2019s] decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1064, 122 S.Ct. 1933, 152 L.Ed.2d 839 (2002). No Supreme Court holding has recognized the particular claim James asserts; the Supreme Court has identified only one circumstance as constituting a <em>per se </em>conflict of interest: compelled representation of multiple defendants with divergent interests. <em>See Holloway v. Arkansas, </em>435 U.S. 475, 484-91, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978). Nor can James establish that the state court \u201cunreasonably failed to extend a clearly established, Supreme Court defined, legal principle to [a] situation[ ] which that principle should have, in reason, governed.\u201d <em>Kennaugh v. Miller, </em>289 F.3d 36, 45 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 251, 154 L.Ed.2d 187 (2002). At least one circuit has expressly declined to follow the rule we announced in <em>Cancilla </em>and related cases. <em>See United States v. Wallace, </em>276 F.3d 360, 368 (7th Cir.) (noting Seventh Circuit\u2019s rejection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>Cancilla\u2019s <em>per se </em>rule), <em>cert. denied, </em>536 U.S. 924, 122 S.Ct. 2592, 153 L.Ed.2d 781 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">In <em>Mickens v. Taylor, </em>535 U.S. 162, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002), the Supreme Court recently declined to recognize a <em>per se </em>conflict of interest where a defendant who was tried and convicted for murder was represented at trial by a lawyer who had previously represented the murder victim. <em>Id. </em>at 1245. The Court observed that it has so far declined to extend Holloway\u2019s <em>per se </em>rule to other circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 1242. The Court noted that <em>Holloway </em>\u201cstressed the high probability of prejudice arising from multiple concurrent representation, and the difficulty of proving that prejudice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1245, and it questioned whether actual conflicts of interest \u2014 let alone <em>per se </em>conflicts \u2014 exist in various contexts in which circuit courts have identified them. <em>Id. </em>(citing cases). Thus, <em>Cancilla </em>notwithstanding, and however much we might wish to encourage the state courts to follow <em>Cancilla, </em>they were not <em>required </em>to extend the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>per se </em>rule to James\u2019s situation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-12\">. James asserted other claims in the district court, but the court granted a certificate of appealability \"solely on his conflict of interest claim.\u201d Judgment in a Civil Case, dated May 30, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b933-8\">. James does not sirgue that it would be an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent to refuse to apply the \"actual conflict\u201d standard set forth in <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 350, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980), to the circumstances of this case, and we express no view on that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
