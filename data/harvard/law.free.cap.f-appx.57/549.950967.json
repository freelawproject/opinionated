Graham first argues that a prior vacatur of a criminal forfeiture of the 6.05 acre parcel bars the civil forfeiture action. We find no such bar. There was no double jeopardy violation because civil forfeitures, like the one here under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a)(7) (2000), do not constitute punishment for double jeopardy purposes. <em>United States v. Ursery, </em>518 U.S. 267, 270-71, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 135 L.Ed.2d 549 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Next, Graham argued that the Government did not timely file the civil forfeiture action. The district court did not address the timeliness issue in its order. Under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 (2000), a forfeiture complaint must be filed \u201cwithin five years after the time when the alleged offense was discovered____\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Graham argues that the main reliance on forfeiting the property is a home invasion effected in January 1993. The Government did not file the civil forfeiture action until September 24, 1999\u2014 more than five years after the home invasion. The Government\u2019s forfeiture claim relied upon the sworn declarations of Stephen Netherland, Criminal Specialist, North Carolina Bureau of Investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-17\">After a careful review of the record before us, we find that Stephen Nether-land\u2019s declarations do not clearly state all the necessary dates to determine the timeliness of the Government\u2019s filing. Particularly inconclusive is the date on which government agents first learned from Kenneth Spence that his home had been invaded by a group, of which Graham was part, and that Spence found his stolen marijuana on Graham\u2019s property. We note the civil forfeiture record also does not contain any trial testimony from Netherland, nor does it contain the relevant portions of Richard Crowell Arp, Jr.\u2019s testimony regarding his cooperation with Netherland.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-18\">For these reasons, we find it necessary to remand the case to the district court for a determination of whether the Government timely filed the civil forfeiture action. We deny Graham\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-19\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b586-13\"> Although \u00a7 1621 addresses forfeitures effected under the customs laws, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(d) (2000) specifically adopts the provisions regarding forfeiture for customs violations. This includes the five-year limitations period. <em>See United States v. James Daniel Good, </em>510 U.S. 43, 63, 114 S.Ct. 492, 126 L.Ed.2d 490 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
