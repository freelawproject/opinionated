Larimer, <em>Chief Judge). </em>On March 6, 2002, a jury convicted Wileher of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). The only eyewitness connecting Wileher to the gun in question was Wilcher\u2019s former girlfriend, Sabrina Hampton, who so testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-19\">On appeal, Wilcher\u2019s sole contention is that Hampton was a \u201cscorned woman\u201d and thus an incredible witness as a matter of law. Athough Wileher acknowledges that this court defers to the jury\u2019s determination as to witness credibility, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Griffith, </em>284 F.3d 338, 348 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 461,154 L.Ed.2d 352 (2002), he urges us to follow our apparent dicta in <em>United States v. Shulman, </em>624 F.2d 384, 388 (2d Cir.1980), in which we suggested that \u201ctheoretically the testimony of a witness might be so incredible that no reasonable juror could believe him.\u201d We decline to do so because we do not think the jury acted unreasonably in crediting Hampton.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-22\">The judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
