Pope appeals from a January 10, 2002 order and decision affirming the final decision of defendant-appellee that Pope was ineligible for disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423 <em>et seq. </em>Pope alleges that because of a heart condition and the medication required to treat it, he is totally disabled and permanently unable to do any gainful work.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-25\">We may set aside a decision of the Commissioner that is based upon legal error or not supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Yancey v. Apfel, </em>145 F.3d 106, 111 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>Pope argues that the decision was not supported by substantial evidence because the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) did not give controlling weight to the opinions of his treating doctors. A treating doctor\u2019s opinion is given controlling weight on issues not reserved for the Commissioner if it is \u201cwell-supported by medically acceptable clinical laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent the other substantial evidence.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). The one doctor to find, based on his own assessment, that Pope had was unable to work was Pope\u2019s general physician. He stated that Pope suffers from \u201cextreme fatigue\u201d that is \u201cdebilitating\u201d and that requires \u201cfrequent rest,\u201d such that Pope is \u201ccompletely disabled.\u201d His opinion that Pope is \u201ccompletely disabled\u201d may not be given controlling weight because this issue is reserved for the Commissioner. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(1). His other opinions need not be given controlling weight because they conflict with substantial evidence. Pope\u2019s cardiologist\u2019s notes strongly suggest that he believed Pope was precluded only from certain (high stress) jobs. Two agency review physicians concluded that Pope could sit or stand for six hours at a time with only normal breaks. While the agency reviewer assessments fall short of the requirements of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(f)(1), they were not so vague as to be of no evidentiary value. <em>Cf. Curry v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 117, 123 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Pope also argues that the ALJ erred by not considering and commenting on the entire record, and by mischaracterizing Pope\u2019s testimony. The ALJ must \u201creview all of the evidence relevant\u201d to a claim under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c), but he does not err by failing to explicitly mention all of that evidence. Similarly, the ALJ\u2019s characterization of Pope\u2019s testimony is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">In addition, Pope argues that the ALJ erred by making a decision based on inconsistencies in the record. An ALJ has an independent duty to resolve ambiguities and inconsistencies. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(3) &amp; (4); <em>cf. Rosa v. Callahan, </em>168 F.3d 72, 79 (2d Cir.1999). However, where the inconsistencies do not appear resolvable, the ALJ may decide based on the available evidence. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(4). The inconsistencies here appeared to be irreconcilable differences of opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">We conclude by finding that there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision. Since the ALJ found that Pope showed he could not perform his past work, the ALJ had the burden of proving that Pope could do other work. <em>See Curry v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d at 123. The ALJ met this burden. The reviewing doctors found that he could sit or stand for six hours at a time, and his treating cardiologist characterized Pope as an ideal candidate for cardiovascular rehabilitation. Pope testified that he exercised, attended community meetings, drove, and engaged in light activities. In addition, an occupational expert testified Pope was qualified for a variety of low stress, sedentary jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
