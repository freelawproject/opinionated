He contends that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated when he was not provided substitute counsel during his motion for new trial. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Because the facts are known to the parties, we do not recite them here. We may reverse the state court\u2019s decision under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) when the decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Neal was not entitled to an automatic appointment of substitute counsel during his new trial motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The only remaining way for Neal to show that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated, thus that the decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of federal law,\u201d is to show that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. In <em>Strickland, v. Washington, </em>the Supreme Court said that \u201c[t]he benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial court cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under <em>Strickland, </em>Neal must prove not only that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because he was denied effective assistance of counsel, but also that he suffered actual prejudice because of the violation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, in <em>Mickens v. Tay</em>lor;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Supreme Court explained an exception to <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>test by presuming prejudice. The Court stated, \u201c[w]e have spared the defendant the need of showing probable effect upon the outcome, and have simply presumed such effect, where assistance of counsel has been denied entirely or <em>during a critical stage of the proceeding. </em>\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-15\">Neal must still show that \u201csome effect on counsel\u2019s handling of particular aspects of the trial was likely.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In other words, Neal\u2019s counsel\u2019s behavior during the hearing must have been influenced by the conflict. Ultimately, Neal failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The record is devoid of any evidence that Neal\u2019s counsel was adversely affected by the conflict. In fact, the record evidences the opposite: Neal\u2019s counsel clarified the basis for Neal\u2019s motion. Additionally, counsel doubled-checked with Neal that he was accurately conveying Neal\u2019s complaints to the court. Because Neal did not prove his counsel was influenced by the conflict, we hold that he was not denied effective representation of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\">. <em>Van Tran v.
