R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-19\">Christopher Johnston, acting pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights action filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court dismissed his claim under Fed.R.CivP. 12(C) because it was time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-20\">Mr. Johnston was arrested by Denver police detectives on November 6, 1997. On June 10, 1999, he timely filed claims arising out of this incident in state court. On July 23, 2001, based on the same incident but following it by more than three years and eight months, Mr. Johnston filed his civil rights claims in federal court. The defendants named in the federal action were not named in the state action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge, the federal district court on August 23, 2002, entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of Messrs. Young, Ed-inger and Salazar because Mr. Johnston filed his federal complaint outside the two-year statute of limitations governing the action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-21\">We treat a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(C) like we do a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and we review the decision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>district court de novo. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Farm Credit Bank of Wichita, </em>226 F.3d 1138, 1160 (10th Cir.2000). \u201cStatute of limitations questions may ... be appropriately resolved on a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) motion.\u201d <em>Aldrich v. McCulloch Properties, Inc., </em>627 F.2d 1036, 1041 n. 4 (10th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Mr. Johnston argues his federal complaint was timely under the \u201crelation back\u201d provisions of Fed.R.CivP. 15(C). He errs. The \u201crelation back\u201d language of Fed. R.CivP. 15(C) allows an amendment to a pleading, when otherwise permitted by the rule, to relate back to the date of filing of the original pleading under certain circumstances. Mr. Johnston seeks to have his federal complaint \u201crelate back\u201d to his state filing, thereby making it timely. Such a unique application of the \u201crelation back\u201d doctrine, for which Mr. Johnston offers no authority, violates a fair reading of Fed. R.CrvP. 15(C) and offends accepted principles of federal-state comity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Mr. Johnston claims the magistrate judge was biased and inappropriately suggested the \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d strategy to the defendants. The argument is without merit and warrants no discussion. Similarly, his claim that the magistrate judge omitted certain factual data in his recommendation to the district court judge is not supported by the record and is otherwise undeveloped. We therefore decline to consider it. <em>Murrell v. Shalala, </em>43 F.3d 1388, 1389 n. 2 (10th Cir.1994). He further contends the magistrate judge erred by failing to remove his claims from state court to federal court. This argument is unpersuasive for two reasons. First, removal is the prerogative of the defendant only (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a)); and second, the state court action was already concluded when the magistrate judge filed his recommendation to the district court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Judgment AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-15\">. We liberally construe a pro se appellate brief. <em>Cummings v. Evans, </em>161 F.3d 610, 613 (10th Cir. 1998), <em>cert. denied, 526 </em>U.S. 1052, 119 S.Ct. 1360, 143 L.Ed.2d 521 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b429-22\">. <em>See </em>Civil Action No. 99-CV-3555, District Court, City and County of Denver, Colorado, where the state court granted summary judgment to defendants on all grounds on September 7, 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b429-23\">. Mr. Johnston concedes his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim is subject to Colorado\u2019s two-year statute of limitations period for personal injury. <em>See Workman v. Jordan, </em>32 F.3d 475, 482 (10th Cir. 1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1015, 115 S.Ct. 1357, 131 L.Ed.2d 215 (1995); Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-80-102 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b430-6\">. Mr. Johnston attributes his tardy federal claim to a tortured discovery process in his state case that delayed discovery of the identities of the three defendants he later named in the federal case. He does not explain why he failed to timely file his federal claim with unnamed defendants and later move to amend under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15 after the defendants were identified.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
