Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-22\">Barnes did not file a complaint to initiate the current lawsuit. Rather, he simply filed a \u201cPetition for Permanent Injunction.\u201d The document did not set forth the basis of federal jurisdiction. In his petition for permanent injunction and supporting memorandum, Barnes asserted a violation of Article 1, \u00a7 9, Clause 8 of the Constitution of the United States of America and a violation of the First Amendment Establishment Clause, Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He claimed that the framers of the Constitution initially violated the above provisions by making the following statement in Article VII of the Constitution: \u201cthe Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty Seven.\u201d He claimed that the foregoing language grants a title of nobility to, respects, and is based on the establishment of the Christian religion. He sought a permanent injunction directing the defendants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>cease and desist from imposing the current dating system on him and directing them to adopt a new dating system for the United States of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">On June 20, 2001, the district court dismissed the action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a) and 12(h)(3) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Barnes then filed a \u201cMotion for Reconsideration\u201d on June 27, 2001, which the district court denied by order entered February 14, 2002. Thereafter, on February 22, 2002, Barnes filed a \u201cMotion to Amend Complaint.\u201d Within the motion to amend, Barnes requested the court to \u201creconsider this case and grant relief as demanded in Plaintiff[\u2019s] original petition.\u201d Because the underlying judgment had neither been set aside nor vacated, the district court denied the motion to amend. The request for reconsideration, which the district court construed as being brought under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b), was denied as well. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Because Barnes filed the motion to amend the pleadings after the entry of judgment in the case, the motion is properly construed as a motion for relief from judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). The standard of review is abuse of discretion; the appeal does not bring up the final judgment for review. <em>See Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr. of Ill., </em>434 U.S. 257, 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978); <em>Peake v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>717 F.2d 1016, 1020 (6th Cir.1983). Abuse of discretion exists when the reviewing court is firmly convinced that a mistake has been made. <em>See Romstadt v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>59 F.3d 608, 615 (6th Cir.1995). A court abuses its discretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact or when it improperly applies the law or uses an erroneous legal standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to amend the pleadings construed as a motion for relief from judgment. Barnes fails to establish grounds for relief under Rule 60(b). A party may obtain relief from judgment for various reasons including mistake, newly discovered evidence, fraud, a void judgment, or a satisfaction or release from a prior judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(l-5). Additionally, a party is entitled to relief upon a showing of exceptional or extraordinary circumstances. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6). Barnes has failed to satisfy any of the standards set forth in Rule 60(b). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(l)-(6). Furthermore, a Rule 60(b) motion is properly denied where the movant attempts to use such a motion to relitigate the merits of a claim and the allegations are unsubstantiated. <em>See Mastini v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>369 F.2d 378, 379 (2d Cir.1966) (attempt to relitigate a patent claim based upon unsubstantiated allegations of fraud). The present motion is Barnes\u2019s latest attempt to relitigate his case regarding the dating system as set forth in his petition for injunctive relief. Barnes\u2019s claims have been fully considered by the district court. Because Barnes sought only to relitigate issues already decided, the district court acted within its considerable discretion by denying relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
