An appeal may not be taken to this court from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court on the merits absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). As to claims dismissed by a district court solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both: \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right; and (2) that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595,146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-19\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that DeLoach has not satisfied either standard. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>See Miller-El v. Cock-rell </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039-40,154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-21\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
