Because the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion, we will affirm the BIA and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-21\">We write for the parties, who are already familiar with the facts of this case. Therefore we limit our discussion to those facts essential to our decision. Tesfaldet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Abraha, a native and citizen of Ethiopia, applied for asylum and withholding of removal. An Immigration Law Judge denied Abraha\u2019s application. Abraha sought timely review by the Board of Immigration Appeals. The Board conducted <em>de novo </em>review of the claim and upheld the ILJ\u2019s decision on December 18,2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Within the thirty days allowed to challenge the Board\u2019s decision, Abraha filed a motion for reconsideration. The Board denied Abraha\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and Abraha now timely appeals from that decision. We review the Board\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>See Nocon v. INS, </em>789 F.2d 1028, 1029 (3d Cir.1986). To obtain reconsideration, the alien must specify errors of fact or law in the Board\u2019s decision, supported by pertinent authority. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In his motion for rehearing before the Board, Abraha distinguished his case from <em>Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185 (5th Cir. 1994), which the Board cited in its December decision. In distinguishing his case from <em>Faddoul, </em>Abraha did not point to any legal error committed by the Board, and he does not now challenge the Board\u2019s explanation that it cited <em>Faddoul </em>only for the proposition that matters of citizenship are left to the sovereign. Similarly, Abr-aha did not specify any factual errors in the Board\u2019s December decision. As the Board noted in denying the motion for reconsideration, \u201cthe facts indicated by the respondent ... were all factors which we took into consideration in our previous order.\u201d App. at 14. Because Abraha failed to meet the requirements of specifying legal and factual errors to obtain a rehearing, the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion. <em>See e.g., Nocon, </em>789 F.2d at 1033.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Instead of focusing on his challenge to the Board\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration, Abraha attempts to challenge Board\u2019s underlying December decision. However, the December decision is not properly before us. Although Abraha filed his petition for review within 90 days of the Board\u2019s first decision, he only sought review of the Board\u2019s decision \u201cdenying the Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Reconsider the Board\u2019s dismissal of his appeal of the denial of his application ...\u201d App. at A-3. Review of the original decision and review of the motion for reconsideration are distinct. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 115 S.Ct. 1537,131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Nocon, </em>789 F.2d at 1033-34. In a challenge to the motion to reconsider we cannot review the underlying decision as if it were properly before us, for to do so would be inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stone. </em>Because the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Arbaha\u2019s motion for reconsideration, we will affirm the Board\u2019s decision and deny the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
