We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-21\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-22\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on October 19, 2001. The notice of appeal was filed on November 20, 2001.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Jenkins failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b207-19\"> We originally remanded this case to the district court to determine when Jenkins gave her notice of appeal to prison officials for mailing. On remand, the district court held an evidentiary hearing and determined that Jenkins handed her notice of appeal to prison officials on November 20, 2001. The district court\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence and we find no bases to disturb it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
