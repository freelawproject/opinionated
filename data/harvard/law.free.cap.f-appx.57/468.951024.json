Jacobson to five years of probation, with the first six months spent in home detention.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When calculating the sentencing range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d), the district court granted a seven level downward departure (reducing the total offense level from seventeen to ten). The government challenges both the grounds for and the extent of this departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-16\">First, the government challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion'that the factual requirements for a diminished capacity departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13 were satisfied. \u201cTo establish diminished capacity ... a defendant [must establish] by a preponderance of the evidence that he suffers from \u2018reduced mental capacity\u2019 and that a \u2018causal link [exists] between that reduced capacity and the commission of the charged offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ven-trilla, </em>233 F.3d 166, 169 (2d Cir.2000) (per curiam) (citations omitted). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Guzman, </em>282 F.3d 177,182 (2d Cir.2002). There was no clear error in the district court\u2019s findings, based primarily on the report of Dr. Samuel Kent, as to both the existence of Jacobson\u2019s significantly reduced mental capacity and the causal connection between that reduced mental capacity and his criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-17\">Next, the government argues that the district court erred by considering Jacobson\u2019s \u201cacceptance of responsibility to pay restitution,\u201d and the effect of his incarceration on innocent third parties when determining the extent of the downward departure, citing <em>United States v. Rioux, </em>97 F.3d 648 (2d Cir.1996). In <em>Rioux, </em>we held that \u201c[i]n extraordinary cases ... the district court may downwardly depart when a number of factors that, when considered individually, would not permit a downward departure, combine to create a situation that \u2018differs significantly from the \u201cheart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>land\u201d cases covered by the guidelines.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 668 (quoting U.S.S.G. 5K2.0 cmt.). We find no error in the district court\u2019s reliance on these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Finally, the government asserts that a seven-level departure was excessive. \u201c[W]e review [a] departure for reasonableness, giving considerable deference to the district court.\u201d <em>Guzman, </em>282 F.3d at 182. Given the nature of Jacobson\u2019s diminished mental capacity, and the other factors considered by the district court, the district court\u2019s decision was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-13\">. Jacobson was also ordered to pay restitution of $786,585.72 and a fine of $50,000, perform 250 hours per year of community service, and to enter into mental health treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
