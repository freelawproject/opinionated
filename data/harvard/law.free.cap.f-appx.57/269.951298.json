On appeal, he argues that the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> erred in denying him \u201csafety-valve\u201d relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5), based upon the court\u2019s finding that he had not been fully truthful in his statements to the government about the source of the methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-23\">To qualify for the reduction, \u201ca defendant carries the burden of demonstrating that \u2018he has truthfully provided to the Government all information regarding the relevant crime before sentencing.\u2019 \u201d <em>See United States v. Santana, </em>150 F.3d 860, 864 (8th Cir.1998) (quoted source omitted). We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in determining that, as the government contended, Mr. Ortiz-Sanchez had not been fully truthful. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Dell, </em>204 F.3d 829, 838 (8th Cir.2000) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>We agree with the district court that Mr. Ortiz-Sanchez\u2019s account of how he obtained the large quantities of methamphetamine underlying his offense \u2014 from a person for whom Mr. Ortiz-Sanchez could provide only a physical description, and whom he allegedly had no way of contacting except by visiting a specific bar repeatedly until they met \u2014 was both inconsistent with normal drug-trafficking practices and not credible. Further, efforts to locate the described individual were unsuccessful, and the government adduced evidence that Mr. Ortiz-Sanchez had called specific numbers around the time that negotiations were underway for the methamphetamine at issue, suggesting that he did have specific suppliers whom he knew how to contact. <em>See United States v. Velasquez, </em>141 F.3d 1280, 1283 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 897, 119 S.Ct. 223, 142 L.Ed.2d 183 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-16\">.
