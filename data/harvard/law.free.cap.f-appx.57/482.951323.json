For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the District Court. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Azzara was arrested pursuant to a complaint on September 25, 2002, and charged with mailing threatening communications in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 876, and with Hobbs Act extortion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951. Specifically, the complaint charged that Azzara wrote a letter to his ex-girlfriend\u2019s father threatening to attempt to ruin the ex-girlfriend\u2019s business career by publishing on the internet video of Azzara and the woman engaged in \u201cS <em>&amp; </em>M\u201d sexual activity unless the woman\u2019s employer paid him $3,000,000. Azzara was formally indicted on these charges on November 13, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">At the close of Azzara\u2019s initial appearance before Magistrate Judge George A. Yanthis, the court ordered him detained pending trial. Azzara appealed this determination, and the district court (Colleen McMahon, <em>Judge) </em>continued the detention, finding that Azzara posed a threat to the complainant and her family, and that no condition or combination of conditions was reasonably likely to ensure his appearance at trial. The court based its conclusions on a psychiatric evaluation and on Azzara\u2019s history of failure to comply with court orders in matters having to do with the complainant. After new counsel was substituted, the court revisited the issue of bail, holding two hearings at which the court considered the provenance and probative value of two letters recovered during a search pursuant to a search warrant of Azzara\u2019s room, one of which, from December 2001, expressed Azzara\u2019s intent to \u201cpay back\u201d his former girlfriend for perceived wrongs and to ignore any court orders limiting his conduct \u201cregardless of the consequences.\u201d The court also heard further argument concerning Azzara\u2019s previous arrest in Florida for an incident involving the complainant and her family. At the close of the second hearing, the court reaffirmed its ruling. This motion followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">This Court reviews the district court\u2019s determination of historical facts for clear error. <em>See United States v. Gotti, </em>794 F.2d 773, 778 (2d Cir.1986). The ultimate determination of whether any conditions will assure defendant\u2019s appearance is a mixed question of law and fact, <em>see United States v. Ferranti, </em>66 F.3d 540, 542 (2d Cir.1995), and this Court will set aside a determination if it is based on a mistake of law, <em>see United States v. Shakur, </em>817 F.2d 189,197 (2d Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">A district court may deny bail if, after a hearing, it finds that \u201cno condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">Having considered all of appellant\u2019s arguments and reviewed the record, we conclude that the district court\u2019s factual findings are not clearly erroneous. Azzara does not contest the essential accuracy of the facts relied upon by the district court. Instead, he argues that the court erred by placing too much emphasis on certain facts and not enough on others. Azarra essentially takes exception to how the district court weighed the evidence. Under the deferential standard of review applicable here, this argument is futile. The district court considered the proper factors, and there is more than enough evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>record to support its findings. Azzara has failed to show that the district court\u2019s factual finding were erroneous, much less clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
