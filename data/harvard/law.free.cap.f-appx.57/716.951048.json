On appeal, he argues that the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> erred in denying him \u201csafety-valve\u201d relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5) (2001), based upon the Court\u2019s finding that he had not been fully truthful in his safety-valve proffer to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">One of the requirements for safety-valve relief is that the defendant demonstrates he truthfully provided the government, before his sentencing, with all the information he has about the relevant crime. <em>United States v. Santana, </em>150 F.3d 860, 864 (8th Cir.1998). In concluding that Contreras had been less than forthcoming during his proffer interview, the District Court found absurd Contreras\u2019s claim that $5,000 of the $6,000 seized by officers during a search of his apartment (where drugs and drug scales were also found) came from a lottery game among Contreras, his friends, and family. Further, his denial of ever selling methamphetamine was belied by a controlled buy of methamphetamine from Contreras that occurred only days before his arrest on the instant offense. <em>See United States v. Velasquez, </em>141 F.3d 1280, 1283 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 897, 119 S.Ct. 223, 142 L.Ed.2d 183 (1998). We conclude the District Court did not clearly err in determining that, as the government contended, Contreras had not been fully truthful. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Dell, </em>204 F.3d 829, 838 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-9\">.
