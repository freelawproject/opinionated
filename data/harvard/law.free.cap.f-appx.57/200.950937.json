An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certif\u00edcate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). When, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2254 petition solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and (2) that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019\u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) <em>(quoting Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Lina-men has not made .the requisite showing. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039-40, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Moreover, Linamen has waived his right to challenge the district court\u2019s finding regarding timeliness because he did not challenge that finding in his informal briefs. 4th Cir. R. 34(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-19\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We also deny Linamen\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and preliminary injunction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-20\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
