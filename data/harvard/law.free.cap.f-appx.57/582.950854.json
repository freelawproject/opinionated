To be entitled to a certificate of appealability, Jackson must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). When a district court dismisses on procedural grounds, the petitioner \u201cmust demonstrate both (1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right,\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001) . Upon independent examination of Jackson\u2019s petition, we cannot conclude that reasonable jurists would find it debatable whether the district court correctly concluded the petition was untimely. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931, 2003 WL 431659, at *10 (U.S. Feb. 25, 2003) (No. 02-7662). Accordingly, we grant Jackson\u2019s motion to supplement his informal brief, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
