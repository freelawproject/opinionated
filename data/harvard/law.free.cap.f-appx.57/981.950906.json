Massanari, </em>No. 01-0289 (W.D.Pa. Apr. 29, 2002). Because the Commissioner\u2019s final decision was supported by substantial evidence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-18\">On January 23,1997, Hagner applied for CIB and SSI benefits, alleging disability due to a back injury for the period beginning January 2, 1994. The Commissioner denied both his application and his request for reconsideration. After an administrative hearing at which Hagner and a vocational expert testified, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) determined that Hag-ner was able to perform a wide range of light exertional activity and that he therefore was not disabled within the meaning of the SSA. Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Hagner was not entitled to CIB or SSI benefits. The Appeals Council denied Hagner\u2019s request for review, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the final decision of the Commissioner. Hagner instituted a civil action in the district court to obtain review of that decision. Both parties moved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>summary judgment, and the court referred the case to a magistrate judge who filed a Report and Recommendation proposing that Hagner\u2019s appeal be denied. The court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation as its opinion and granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Hagner timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">We must uphold the district court\u2019s decision if the Commissioner\u2019s final decision was supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Hartranft v. Apfel, </em>181 F.3d 358, 360 (3d Cir.1999) (citing <em>Monsour Medical Center v. Heckler, </em>806 F.2d 1185, 1190 (3d Cir.1986)). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (citation omitted). It is not \u201ca large or considerable amount of evidence, but rather \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">On appeal, Hagner first argues that the ALJ failed to give proper weight to the reports of his treating physician, Dr. Taylor. It is true that an ALJ must give a treating physician\u2019s opinion controlling weight if it \u201cis well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the] case record.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). However, an ALJ may reject the opinion of a treating physician if it is \u201cconclusory and unsupported by the medical evidence.\u201d <em>Jones v. Sullivan, </em>954 F.2d 125, 129 (3d Cir.1991). Dr. Taylor opined that Hagner was temporarily disabled and that he could stand and walk less than two hours and sit less than six hours in an eight-hour workday. Nonetheless, the ALJ accorded Dr. Taylor\u2019s opinions \u201conly minimal weight\u201d because they were offered on \u201ccheck-the-box\u201d forms, were unsupported by objective findings, and were inconsistent with the follow-up notes submitted by Dr. Taylor. Moreover, the ALJ noted that another treating physician\u2019s report, that of Dr. Jones, did not preclude all substantial gainful activity and that the state agency physicians who reviewed Hagner\u2019s medical records concluded that he could generally perform light work activity. We therefore conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision not to give Dr. Taylor\u2019s opinion controlling weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">Hagner next argues that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Hagner\u2019s testimony regarding his back pain was not credible. Based on inconsistencies between Hagner\u2019s testimony and the record, the ALJ found Hagner\u2019s allegation of debilitating back pain to be \u201cexaggerated and not fully credible.\u201d In particular, the ALJ found that objective medical evidence \u2014 including imaging studies of Hagner\u2019s spine, four physicians\u2019 reports, and the conservative course of medical treatment that Hagner underwent \u2014 did not support Hagner\u2019s allegation of debilitating pain. The ALJ also pointed to specific discrepancies including Hagner\u2019s lack of muscle atrophy, despite his claim that he could not walk for more than five minutes at a time or lift anything, and Hagner\u2019s weight gain despite his testimony that he eats little due to his pain. We therefore conclude that there is substantial evidence in the record from which the ALJ could find that Hagner\u2019s testimony regarding the severity of his back pain was not fully credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">Finally, Hagner asserts that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions to the vocational expert did not accurately portray Hagner\u2019s individual limitations and impairments and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>therefore could not provide substantial evidence for his decision. Specifically, Hag-ner contends that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions neglected to include (1) the individual limitations set forth in the treating physician\u2019s functional capacity assessment; and (2) the psychological and pain symptoms that affect Hagner\u2019s concentration, sleep, memory, and ability to tolerate stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">We disagree; the ALJ\u2019s questions were fully in accordance with law. It is correct that \u201c[a] hypothetical question posed to a vocational expert \u2018must reflect <em>all </em>of a claimant\u2019s impairments,\u2019 \u201d <em>Burns v. Barnhart, </em>312 F.3d 113, 123 (3d Cir.2002) (quoting Ch<em>rupcala v. Heckler, </em>829 F.2d 1269, 1276 (3d Cir.1987) (emphasis added)), and that \u201c[w]here there exists in the record medically undisputed evidence of specific impairments not included in a hypothetical question to a vocational expert, the expert\u2019s response is not considered substantial evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">However, the ALJ asked the vocational expert to identify any jobs that would accommodate the needs of a hypothetical person with Hagner\u2019s age, education, and vocational profile who could perform \u201clight exertion\u201d limited to \u201csimple, routine, repetitive, low stress work.\u201d The ALJ also asked the expert to assume that the hypothetical person required \u201ca sit/ stand option.\u201d We conclude that those hypothetical questions accurately portrayed Hagner\u2019s impairments. First, with regard to Hagner\u2019s functional capacity, we reiterate that the ALJ properly accorded the treating physician\u2019s report less than controlling weight and rejected that physician\u2019s functional capacity assessment. Instead, the ALJ incorporated into his hypothetical questions a functional capacity limitation that was supported by objective medical evidence: namely, that Hagner was capable of performing a limited range of light work. Secondly, with regard to Hagner\u2019s psychological and pain symptoms, we restate that the ALJ found Hag-ner\u2019s subjective claims of disabling pain to be overstated. The ALJ also acknowledged a psychologist\u2019s report indicating that Hagner\u2019s memory was intact and that Hagner\u2019s depression, although it affected his concentration, was not disabling. Again, the ALJ relied on the objective medical evidence in determining what limitations to accord the hypothetical person and excluded Hagner\u2019s exaggerated symptoms of pain. The ALJ did take into account Hagner\u2019s mental disorder and accordingly included the limitation of \u201csimple, routine, repetitive, low stress work.\u201d We thus conclude that the hypothetical questions posed by the ALJ accurately reflected Hagner\u2019s physical and mental impairments and were therefore properly relied on by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">Because we find that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s denial of CIB and SSI benefits to Hagner, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
