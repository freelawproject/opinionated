Havens alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, et seq., and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621, et seq. Havens asserted that DuPont retaliated against Havens for filing a previous lawsuit and committed sex and age discrimination by failing to promote Havens to a higher paid position. DuPont instead promoted five male candidates, all younger than Havens. After the close of discovery, DuPont moved for summary judgment. On April 11, 2002, the District Court granted DuPont summary judgment on all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-22\">We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 over a final decision of a district court. We exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and review the facts in the light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment was entered. <em>See Brooks v. Kyler, </em>204 F.3d 102, 105 n. 5 (3d Cir. 2000). Summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue of material fact and if, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). At the summary judgment stage, the judge\u2019s function is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter, but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">After a careful review of the record and the Parties\u2019 arguments, we find no basis for disturbing the District Court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned opinion. Havens produced neither evidence that she was denied a promotion in retaliation for filing another lawsuit nor evidence that DuPont\u2019s non-discriminatory reasons for denying her a promotion were pretextual. Therefore, we will affirm the judgment for substantially the same reasons set forth in the record.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
