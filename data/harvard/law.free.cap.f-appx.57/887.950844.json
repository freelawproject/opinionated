Upon his release from incarceration, Gill was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>convicted of violating his supervised release by assaulting his fianc\u00e9 with a razor. This violation resulted in a sixty day imprisonment, followed by a four year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The instant appeal involves Gill\u2019s violation of the conditions of his second term of supervised release. On April 24, 2002, Gill pled guilty to violating his supervised release by 1) possessing and using cocaine and marijuana and 2) associating with a known felon. The Probation Department also charged Gill with failing to pay restitution, but the government dropped that charge in exchange for his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">The District Court sentenced Gill on May 6, 2002. Prior to sentencing, the Probation Department submitted a memorandum to the court recommending a ten-month incarceration. The Probation Department questioned Gill\u2019s sincerity in maintaining a job and noted that Gill had been uncooperative towards his conditions of supervision and the supervision process in general. The memorandum concluded that a custodial sentence was needed to instill in Gill the importance of abiding by the terms of supervised release and leading a law-abiding lifestyle. The District Court adopted the Probation Department\u2019s recommended ten-month imprisonment, with a reduction to reflect time already served. The District Court also imposed a three year supervised release following Gill\u2019s discharge and reimposed restitution, provided Gill regains employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">On appeal, Gill argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the District Court considered improper factors, namely the convenience of the United States Marshals Service, in determining his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">This argument fails for the simple reason that there is no indication that the convenience of the Marshals Service played any part in the District Court\u2019s deliberations. The District Court made clear that it was imposing its sentence based on the recommendations by the Probation Department: \u201cI am going to sentence you ... at the probation department\u2019s request for ten months.\u201d The Probation Department\u2019s memorandum, in turn, made no mention of the Marshals Service, but instead based its recommendation on Gill\u2019s dubious desire to maintain a job and his uncooperative attitude during his supervised release. As the Probation Department explained in its memorandum, \u201ca custodial sentence within the recommended Guideline Range is warranted in order to instill in this offender the importance of complying with the Conditions of Supervised Release and leading a law-abiding lifestyle.\u201d The District Court similarly told Gill that it was ordering incarceration because \u2018You have too bad a record for me to give you another chance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">The matter of the convenience of Marshals Service only came into play when the District Court proposed a settlement to both parties on April 26, 2002. The court\u2019s proposal entailed delaying Gill\u2019s sentencing until June 1, 2002, during which time United States Marshals would have escorted Gill to and from his doctor\u2019s office to allow Gill to have a preoperative appointment and subsequent surgery. Following the surgery, the court would have placed Gill on probation or renewed his supervised release for a period of three years. The District Court, however, made clear that it was merely articulating a proposed settlement that the parties were free to accept or reject. The government expressed concerns with this proposal because of the burden it would place on the Marshals and ultimately rejected the proposal. Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s proposed settlement was rejected, and the District Court considered its ultimate sentence which, as discussed earlier, was based on the Probation Department\u2019s recommendations free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>from any consideration of the Marshals Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Moreover, during the District Court\u2019s exchange with the government regarding its proposed settlement, the court left no doubt that it considered the convenience of the Marshals Service wholly irrelevant to the sentence Gill would receive. The court commented, \u201cThe marshals don\u2019t run this court.\u201d There is no reason to suspect that the District Court, when ultimately imposing Gill\u2019s sentence, altered this view and considered the convenience of the Marshals Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">We also note that the imposed sentence was appropriate. A district court faced with a violation of supervised release \u201chas broad discretion to revoke its previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>United States v. Wirth, </em>250 F.3d 165, 169 (2d Cir.2001) (per curiam). In these circumstances, a sentencing court is not bound by any particular Guideline, but is advised to consider policy statements contained in the Guideline Manual. <em>Id.; United States v. Sweeney, </em>90 F.3d 55, 57 (2d Cir.1996). \u2018We reverse a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence in the absence of an applicable sentencing guideline only if \u2018it is plainly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wirth, </em>250 F.3d at 169 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Gill pleaded guilty to violating his supervised release by, <em>inter alia, </em>possessing a controlled substance. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e)(3), 3583(g)(1), if a defendant violates a condition of supervised release by possessing a controlled substance, the court shall revoke the term of supervised release and require the defendant to serve a term of imprisonment not to exceed the maximum term of supervised release authorized by the statute for the offense that resulted in the term of supervised release. The sentence Gill received, therefore, was entirely reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">We have reviewed all of the defendant-appellants\u2019s other arguments and affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
