He was sentenced on July 12, 2002 to a five-year term of probation, including travel restrictions, a $10,000 fine, and a mandatory $200 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-15\">Mr. Bella raises three arguments on appeal: (1) that the government\u2019s refusal to file a motion pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (\u201c5K1.1 motion\u201d) violated his due process rights; (2) that his case should be remanded to the District Court to determine whether the government acted in bad faith in failing to file the 5K1.1 motion; and (3) that plain error review applies to this appeal in view of defense counsel\u2019s failure to object at sentencing to the government\u2019s refusal to file the 5K1.1 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-16\">The government maintains, however, that it sent to the District Judge a letter, dated July 11, 2002, detailing Mr. Bella\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>cooperation. The defendant acknowledges that he received a copy of this letter. Moreover, at sentencing, defense counsel discussed the contents of the government\u2019s letter in great detail, identifying it as \u201ca 5K1.1 letter.\u201d The sentencing transcript includes these comments of defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-5\">[T]he government has provided the Court with a 5K1.1 letter. Mr. Bella has cooperated extensively with the government. There\u2019s a recommendation, with the Court\u2019s discretion, that the Court go under the guidelines, below the guidelines which are in this case low as it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-6\">I just want to point out a couple [of] criteria, Judge, and point out that the defendant meets all the criteria for the Court in its discretion to go below the guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-7\">The first criteria is the significant [sic] and usefulness of the defendant\u2019s assistance to the government. I point out that the last paragraph of the government\u2019s letter, \u201cBella\u2019s cooperation in this matter was absolutely essential to the arrest and successful prosecution of four others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-8\">The second criteria is the truthfulness and reliability [sic]. That goes without saying because four people were prosecuted successfully, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-9\">Number 3, the nature and extent of his help.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-10\">The third paragraph on the second page, Judge, shows that Mr. Bella wore a wire; there were consensual tapings and that is an essential step for a cooperator to take, because the paragraph in criteria number 4, the risk of injury, there certainly is a risk when someone wears a wire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-11\">Now the person who was the object of this wire could do nothing or could do something great. Mr. Bella didn\u2019t know what could happen but it could be anything in there and it\u2019s a psychological problem that goes on with those types of things when you wear a wire and; 5, the timeliness of his assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-12\">The last paragraph of the first page the government points out upon his arrest, Bella immediately cooperated and he did. As soon as he was arrested he realized the gravity of his mistake and stupidity and wanted to help. For the last four years he has been honest and ready to help. I ask the Court to take these matters into consideration and consider sentencing the defendant and to depart from the guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">Even if plain error review applies to defendant\u2019s claims on appeal, those claims lack merit. From the sentencing colloquy it is clear that the District Court was made aware of the contents of the government\u2019s letter and fully understood the extent of the defendant\u2019s cooperation. There is no basis for a claim that the government violated defendant\u2019s due process rights or acted in bad faith. We have considered all of defendant\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">The judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
