We have jurisdiction pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482. The existence of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law reviewed de novo. <em>See Crawford v. Commissioner, </em>266 F.3d 1120, 1123 (9th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U. S. 1135, 122 S.Ct. 1080, 151 L.Ed.2d 980 (2002). The Tax Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings regarding the admission of evidence are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Hudspeth v. Commissioner, </em>914 F.2d 1207, 1213 (9th Cir.1990). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">Holliday\u2019s contention that the Tax Court did not have jurisdiction over her appeal from a collections due process (\u201cCDP\u201d) hearing fails because the Tax Court has jurisdiction over such an appeal if it has jurisdiction over the underlying tax liability. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). Because Holliday\u2019s CDP hearing was based on her liability for unpaid income tax, the Tax Court has exclusive jurisdiction over her appeal. <em>See Goza v. Commissioner, </em>114 T.C. 176, 182, 2000 WL 283864 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">Holliday\u2019s contention that the Tax Court erred by admitting into evidence documents that were not produced at the CDP hearing fails because the \u201crecord review\u201d provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) do not apply to the Tax Court. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a)(1) (APA does not apply where \u201ca matter [is] subject to a subsequent trial of the law and the facts de novo in a court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b811-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
