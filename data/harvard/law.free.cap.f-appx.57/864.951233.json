Nos. 5,676,689 (\u2019689 patent) and 5,861,004 (\u2019004 patent). Based on the construction of two of those claim terms, namely \u201cclosure device\u201d and \u201cpuncture closure,\u201d Kensey, St. Jude Medical, Inc., and Sherwood Medical Co. (collectively appellants) stipulated that the accused devices did not infringe the \u2019689 or the \u2019004 patent. Appellants contest the construction of all three disputed claim terms. Because the district court properly construed \u201cclosure device\u201d and \u201cpuncture closure,\u201d this court <em>affirms </em>the holding of nonin-fringement of the \u2019689 and \u2019004 patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">This court reviews claim construction without deference. <em>Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1448, 1456, 46 USPQ2d 1169,1173 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">The district court construed \u201cclosure device,\u201d as recited in the \u2019689 patent, to require that the device use \u201can anchor, plug, and filament bound together in a pulley like arrangement whereby the filament draws the anchor and plug together so as to effectuate a seal.\u201d <em>Kensey Nash Corp. v. Perclose, Inc., </em>No. 98-1629, 2000 WL 1868391 (E.D.Pa. Dec.22, 2000). Thus, the court restricted the meaning of closure device to a device using an anchor-plug-filament (A-P-F) setup.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-15\">The specification of the \u2019689 patent supports the district court\u2019s construction of \u201cclosure device.\u201d The specification repeatedly refers to the \u201cclosure device\u201d as having an anchor, a seal (i.e., plug), and a filament. For example, in the background section, the specification refers to an earlier Kensey patent as having a closure device. It then states: \u201cThe closure device comprises three components, namely, an anchor member, a sealing member, and a filament, e.g., suture.\u201d \u2019689 patent, col. 1,11. 45-47. While the background section normally refers to the prior art and not the claimed invention, here Kensey ascribes a definition to \u201cclosure device\u201d in the background section and never alters that definition throughout the specification \u2014 even when using that term in reference to the invention of the \u2019689 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-16\">Moreover, the prosecution history limited \u201cclosure device\u201d to an A-P-F device. Original claim 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,517 (\u2019517 patent), the great-grandparent of the \u2019689 patent, recited a \u201cclosure device\u201d without reciting an anchor, seal, or fila<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>ment. In a Rule 131 declaration filed during prosecution of the \u2019517 patent, however, Kensey stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-4\">The claimed invention of this application is a closure device....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-5\">The broadest claims of this application call for the closure comprising a sealing portion arranged to be located outside of the interior of a blood vessel and an anchor portion to be located inside of the interior of the blood vessel. The de-ta\u00f1ed dependent claims caU for among other things, the anchor portion including at least one chamber in which a radiopaque material is located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Thus, even though claim 1 (the only independent claim of the \u2019517 patent) refers only to a \u201cclosure device,\u201d Kensey represented to the examiner that the closure device had a seal on the outside and an anchor on the inside of the blood vessel. Relying on the doctrine of claim differentiation, Kensey argues that this representation is not limiting because dependent claims 2 and 4 add the anchor, seal, and filament as additional limitations. The doctrine of claim differentiation, however, is a guide only and does not trump a clear and express limiting reference made during prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Further, other portions of the prosecution history demonstrate that \u201cclosure device\u201d is limited to an A-P-F device. During prosecution of the \u2019689 patent, Kensey attempted to get a dependent claim directed to a suture type closure device (i.e., one using filament without an anchor and plug). The examiner rejected the claim on the basis that no such arrangement was shown or described in the specification. In other words, Kensey faded to obtain even a dependent claim from the United States Patent and Trademark Office that would cover a suture type closure device. Nevertheless, appe\u00fcant\u2019s asserted claim construction before this court attempts to recapture the very scope rejected by the examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">The district court also relied on a double patenting rejection made during prosecution of the \u2019689 patent to support its holding that \u201cclosure device\u201d is limited to an A-P-F device. The \u2019689 patent claims priority to U.S. Patent No. 5,222,974 (\u2019974 patent). The examiner rejected original claims 1-50 of the \u2019689 patent as amounting to double patenting over claim 8 of the \u2019974 patent. Claim 8 included language expressly limiting the closure to an A-P-F device. The examiner found that claim 8 would cover the invention in the pending claims, and likewise, that if allowed, the pending claims would cover claim 8. Kensey argues that this rejection is based on the fact the pending claims were broader than claim 8 of the \u2019974 patent (i.e., genus claims for earlier species claim) \u2014 rather than a finding that both claims covered an A-P-F device. Based on the examiner\u2019s rejection, however, it is clear that the examiner viewed the \u201cclosure device\u201d of the pending claims as an A-P-F device.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">This court has considered all of Kensey\u2019s arguments, but finds them unpersuasive given the clear limitation of \u201cclosure device\u201d in the specification and prosecution history of the \u2019689 patent. In this case, Kensey clearly ascribed a narrower meaning to \u201cclosure device\u201d as being an A-P-F device, and it cannot escape that definition now. Thus, the district court\u2019s construction of \u201cclosure device\u201d is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">Kensey also appeals the construction of \u201cpuncture closure\u201d as recited in the claims of the \u2019004 patent. The district court held that \u201cpuncture closure\u2019 referred to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"akc-dedup-0\">closure devices (1) that use an anchor, plug, and filament bound together in a pulley like arrangement whereby the filament draws the anchor and plug together so as to effectuate a seal and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>that have a filament knot which holds the closure in place by holding the plug in place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Thus, the court held that \u201cpuncture closure\u201d is the same as \u201cclosure device\u201d (i.e., an A-P-F device) but with an added element: a filament lock. The court based its construction on its belief that \u201cpuncture closure\u201d refers to the same devices as identified for \u201cclosure device\u201d in the \u2019689 patent. The district court then added the filament lock requirement based on other language in the claims of the \u2019004 patent. The \u2019004 patent is a continuation of the \u2019689 patent. Because a continuation cannot add new material, the usage of \u201cpuncture closure\u201d must accord with the teachings of the \u2019689 patent. Other than in the invention title, the term \u201cpuncture closure\u201d appears only once in the specification of the \u2019689 patent. That instance refers to a \u201chemostatic puncture closure device,\u201d indicating that the specification treats \u201cpuncture closure\u201d and \u201cclosure device\u201d as interchangeable terms. \u2019689 patent, col. 14, 1. 41. The \u2019004 patent continues to refer to \u201cclosure device 22\u201d throughout the specification in a manner that equates that term with \u201cpuncture closure.\u201d Similarly, in the \u2019004 patent, the term \u201cpuncture closure\u201d appears only in the claims, the summary of the invention, and in one reference to \u201chemostatic <em>puncture closure device. </em>\u201d \u2019004 patent, col. 14, 1. 48 (emphasis added). Hence, the district court correctly construed \u201cpuncture closure\u201d as an A-P-F closure device with a filament lock.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Appellants stipulated to noninfringement on the basis of the district court\u2019s construction of only \u201cclosure device\u201d and \u201cpuncture closure.\u201d Because this court affirms the district court\u2019s construction of both of these terms, this court declines to consider the construction of the third disputed claim term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
