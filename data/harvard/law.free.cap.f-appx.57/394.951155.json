Vargas was driving with a female passenger, Irene Gomez. Transparent plastic covered the rear license plate of Vargas\u2019 vehicle and a plastic tag holder obscured the state name. Oklahoma Highway Patrol Trooper Colby Cason stopped Vargas for an improper tag display, in violation of Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 47, \u00a7 1113(A)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Trooper Cason informed Vargas that he would issue a warning citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Trooper Cason requested that Vargas accompany him to his squad car, and he directed Vargas to sit in the front passenger side of the squad car while he ran a check on Vargas\u2019 driver\u2019s license and license plate number. The computer check uncovered no outstanding warrants or other problems associated with Vargas or his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">While filling out the warning citation form, Trooper Cason asked Vargas several questions. He inquired about Vargas\u2019 destination, and Vargas responded that he was on his way to St. Louis to visit his brother. Trooper Cason then asked where Vargas\u2019 brother lived in St. Louis. Vargas said that he did not know the part of town, but he knew how to get there. While in the front seat of the squad care, Vargas appeared \u201cextremely nervous\u201d and the artery in his neck was beating rapidly. Trooper Cason also noticed that Vargas\u2019 female passenger, still in Vargas\u2019 vehicle, continually turned around and watched from the visor mirror of the car. When Trooper Cason inquired about Vargas\u2019 female passenger, Vargas told him that she was his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">Because Vargas had not brought his vehicle registration with him to the squad car, Trooper Cason went to retrieve it from Vargas\u2019 vehicle. At this time, Trooper Cason noticed that Gomez, the female passenger \"in Vargas\u2019 vehicle, also appeared extremely nervous. Trooper Ca-son observed that Gomez appeared too young to be Vargas\u2019 mother. When Trooper Cason asked Gomez where she and Vargas were traveling, she responded that they were going to visit an \u201camigo.\u201d While Trooper Cason was talking with Gomez, Vargas had opened the passenger door of the squad car and stuck his head out, as if to listen to the conversation. As Trooper Cason returned to the squad car, he noticed that the back seat of Vargas\u2019 vehicle appeared \u201cunusual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">Trooper Cason then returned to his squad car. He asked Vargas why Gomez appeared so nervous. Vargas then told Trooper Cason that Gomez was an illegal alien. At this point, after Vargas signed the warning citation, Trooper Cason gave Vargas a copy of the warning citation along with his driver\u2019s license.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After returning Vargas\u2019 driver\u2019s license, Cason asked Vargas for permission to search his vehicle. Vargas responded, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d At the suppression hearing, Cason testified that when he asked Vargas for consent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>search his car, Vargas was not free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">During the initial part of the search, Trooper Cason (1) examined the wheels of the car, (2) examined the car doors and \u201cpopped\u201d the door panels to look behind them, and (3) searched a bag found in the back seat. Cason then opened the trunk and smelled Bondo<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and he noticed that visible modifications had been made to the trunk. At this point, Trooper Cason called for assistance. One hour into the search, the assisting officer arrived with a drug-detection dog. The dog alerted to the presence of drugs. Using an \u201coptoscope\u201d (a remote-vision device), the officers examined a hidden compartment in the backseat/trunk area of the vehicle. They found two kilograms of cocaine in the compartment. At this point, the officers read Vargas his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">On January 9, 2002, a grand jury returned an indictment charging Vargas with one count of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(l)(B)(ii). On January 31, 2002, Vargas filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. After a hearing, the district court denied Vargas\u2019 motion, concluding that (1) Trooper Cason had objectively reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity at the time he requested permission to search Vargas\u2019 vehicle, and (2) Vargas validly consented to the search. Vargas entered a conditional plea of guilty on March 28, 2002, reserving his right to appeal the ruling of the district court denying his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Vargas challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress on numerous grounds, including: (1) Trooper Cason\u2019s detention exceeded the legitimate scope of the stop; (2) Trooper Cason did not have probable cause for the further detention and the search; and (3) Vargas did not voluntarily consent to the search of his vehicle. We consider each contention in turn. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">II. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress under a clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Soto, </em>988 F.2d 1548, 1551 (10th Cir.1993) (citations omitted). In conducting our review, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The ultimate determination of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment, however, is a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">B. <em>Overview of Applicable Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">In reviewing the constitutionality of traffic stops under the Fourth Amendment, we conduct a two-step inquiry. First, we must determine \u201cwhether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lerma, </em>14 F.3d 1479, 1483 (10th Cir.1994). Second, we must consider \u201cwhether the action was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that first justified the interference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further detention or questioning, unrelated to the traffic stop, is only permissible (1) where the officer has \u201cobjectively reasonable and articulable suspicion that illegal activity has occurred or is occurring,\u201d or (2) \u201cif the initial detention has become a consensual encounter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>C. <em>Whether Trooper Cason\u2019s Detention of Vargas was Reasonable at Its Inception.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u201c[A] detaining officer must have an objectively reasonable articulable suspicion that a traffic violation has occurred or is occurring before stopping [an] automobile.\u201d <em>Soto, </em>988 F.2d at 1554 (citation omitted). In this case, Trooper Cason observed that the license plate of Vargas\u2019 vehicle was covered by a tag mount, and that a plastic covering obscured the entire tag. This observation gave Trooper Cason reasonable suspicion that Vargas\u2019 vehicle was in violation of Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 47, \u00a7 1113(A)(2). Accordingly, Trooper Ca-son\u2019s initial stop of Vargas was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Soto, </em>988 F.2d at 1554.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">D. <em>Whether Trooper Cason\u2019s Actions Were Reasonably Related in Scope to the Circumstances That Initially Justified the Detention.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u201cDuring a routine traffic stop, the detaining officer may request a driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration, run a computer check on the car and driver, and issue a citation.\u201d <em>Soto, </em>988 F.2d at 1554 (citations omitted). In addition, the detaining officer may question the vehicle\u2019s occupants regarding their identity, travel plans, and ownership of the vehicle. <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>867 F.2d 1261, 1263 (10th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">In this case, Trooper Cason detained Vargas while he conducted a check on Vargas\u2019 driver\u2019s license and license plate number and issued a warning citation. Although Trooper Cason asked Vargas several questions while he filled out the citation form, the questions related to Vargas\u2019 ownership of the vehicle, the identity of Vargas\u2019 female passenger, and his travel plans. Thus, under <em>Soto </em>and <em>Rivera, </em>Trooper Cason\u2019s actions were within the legitimate scope of the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">The fact that Trooper Cason ordered Vargas out of the car and directed him to sit in the front seat of the squad car does not alter this conclusion. \u201c[T]he intrusiveness of a search or seizure will be upheld if it was reasonable under the totality of the circumstances. Reasonableness is determined by balancing the governmental interest in crime prevention against the citizen\u2019s right to be free from governmental intrusion.\u201d <em>United States v. Perdue, </em>8 F.3d 1455, 1462 (10th Cir.1993) (citations omitted). We find that Trooper Cason\u2019s decision to direct Vargas to sit in the front seat of the squad car was reasonable for several reasons. First, in relocating Vargas, Trooper Cason justifiably protected himself from any weapons concealed in the vehicle. <em>See Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 410, 117 S.Ct. 882, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997) (removal of passenger from vehicle for security and safety reasons is legitimate during <em>Terry </em>stop); <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 111, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977) (a concern for officer safety justifies ordering a driver out of his or her vehicle). Second, Trooper Ca-son\u2019s decision to ask Vargas to accompany him to his squad car while he ran the computer checks likely increased the overall safety of the situation. Standing on the shoulder of the highway places both the officer and the person detained in some degree of danger of injury due to a traffic accident. Relocating to the officer\u2019s squad car reduces the potential for injury. Third, separating Vargas and Gomez served the investigatory purpose of removing any opportunity for the two to concoct a consistent explanation regarding the purpose of their travel. Fourth, placing Vargas in the front seat of the squad car \u2014 for this limited duration \u2014 likely lead to a less intrusive encounter. The Supreme Court in <em>Mimms </em>acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>that ordering a driver out of the car results in additional public exposure, although the Court characterized the additional intrusion as <em>de minimis. Id. </em>By allowing Vargas to wait in the front seat of the squad car, Trooper Cason removed this <em>de minimis </em>additional intrusion while still furthering the purpose of officer safety as articulated in <em>Mimms. </em>Finally, because Trooper Cason questioned Vargas while running the computer check and filling out the warning citation form, he likely shortened the overall duration of the encounter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">E. <em>Whether Trooper Cason\u2019s Request to Search Vargas\u2019 Vehicle, Unrelated to the Initial Traffic Stop, Was Reasonable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Once an officer has issued a citation in a traffic stop, \u201c \u2018[i]f the driver produces a valid license and proof of right to operate the vehicle, the officer must allow him to continue on his way without delay for further questioning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Soto, </em>988 F.2d at 1554 (citing <em>United States v. Pena, </em>920 F.2d 1509, 1514 (10th Cir.1990)). However, further detention or questioning \u2014 unrelated to the traffic stop \u2014 is permissible in two instances: (1) if the officer has \u201cobjectively reasonable and articulable suspicion that illegal activity has occurred or is occurring;\u201d or (2) \u201cif the initial detention has become a consensual encounter.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Lerma, </em>14 F.3d at 1483 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">1. <em>Whether Vargas Voluntarily Consented to the Search of His Vehicle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">\u201cWhether or not a party has voluntarily consented to a search is a question of fact that the district court must evaluate in view of the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Doyle, </em>129 F.3d 1372, 1377 (10th Cir.1997) (citations omitted). In the present case, the district court found that Vargas\u2019 consent was voluntarily given, and \u201cwe must accept that finding unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Soto, </em>988 F.2d at 1554. The fact that a party is being detained at the time consent is given does not necessarily render the consent involuntary. <em>Doyle, </em>129 F.3d at 1377 (citations omitted). In the context of a routine traffic stop, we have previously held that once an officer has returned a driver\u2019s documentation, any subsequent encounter is \u201cconsensual\u201d so long as \u201c \u2018a reasonable person under the circumstances would believe he was free to leave or disregard the officer\u2019s request for information.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Elliot, </em>107 F.3d 810, 814 (10th Cir.1997) (citing <em>United States v. McKneely, </em>6 F.3d 1447, 1451 (10th Cir.1993)). In determining whether a reasonable person would have felt free to leave or disregard the officer\u2019s questioning, we consider the totality of the circumstances. <em>Doyle, </em>129 F.3d at 1377.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-14\">In this case, Trooper Cason returned <em>Vargas\u2019 </em>documentation prior to his request for permission to search Vargas\u2019 vehicle. On the other hand, Vargas was still in the front seat of Trooper Cason\u2019s squad car. Further, Cason testified that Vargas was not free to leave at the time of his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-15\">We need not decide whether Vargas was in custody at the time of Cason\u2019s request, because custody does not necessarily render consent involuntary. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Rather, we must consider the totality of the circumstances. Here, Vargas points to no evidence <em>of overt </em>coercion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number><em>See Soto, </em>988 F.2d at 1558. Trooper Ca-son did not unholster his weapon, use an authoritative tone, or physically harass Vargas. Further, Cason was the only officer present at the time of Vargas\u2019 consent. Vargas consented while seated in the front seat of Cason\u2019s squad car, parked on the shoulder of a public highway in broad daylight. Further, unlike <em>Soto, </em>Trooper Ca-son had already returned Vargas\u2019 documentation. Based on these facts, we hold that the district court\u2019s conclusion that Vargas voluntarily consented to the search of his vehicle was not clearly erroneous. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Of course \u201cillegal\u201d detention, or detention in the absence of reasonable suspicion, might present a different case. But here, even if Vargas was not free to leave at the time of Trooper Cason\u2019s request, any additional detention beyond the scope of the initial traffic stop was justified based on Trooper Cason\u2019s objectively reasonable, articulable suspicion of illegal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Trooper Cason possessed reasonable, ar-ticulable suspicion of criminal activity based on numerous observations made during the routine traffic stop. First, Trooper Cason testified that both Vargas and Gomez appeared extremely nervous during the encounter. <em>See Soto, </em>988 F.2d at 1556; <em>United States v. Turner, </em>928 F.2d 956, 959 (10th Cir.1991). Second, Vargas told Trooper Cason that Gomez was his mother, a statement that was inconsistent with Cason\u2019s observation of Gomez\u2019s apparent age. <em>Cf. Turner, </em>928 F.2d at 959 (\u201cDefendant claimed that he was an auto mechanic, but the officer observed that his hands were well-manicured and did not appear to be in the condition of someone who works as an auto mechanic.\u201d). Third, Vargas and Gomez offered conflicting accounts as to the purpose of their travel, and Vargas could not specify where in St. Louis his brother lived. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>867 F.2d 1261, 1264 (10th Cir. 1989) (finding reasonable suspicion based in part on defendant\u2019s conflicting and inconsistent responses to officer\u2019s questions); <em>see also United States v. Kopp, </em>45 F.3d 1450, 1454 (10th Cir.1995) (finding reasonable suspicion based in part on findings that (1) the defendant\u2019s explanations of his travel plans and purpose were not plausible, (2) the defendant could not provide an address for his destination, and (3) the defendant\u2019s explanation regarding travel plans was inconsistent with the explanation his passenger gave). Fourth, Trooper Ca-son observed that the back seat of Vargas\u2019 vehicle appeared \u201cunusual.\u201d In light of these facts, we cannot say that the district court was clearly erroneous in concluding that Trooper Cason had reasonable, articu-lable suspicion of criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">2. <em>Whether the Scope of Trooper Cason\u2019s Search was Reasonable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">Ordinarily, an individual\u2019s consent to an officer\u2019s request to search her vehicle authorizes a thorough and complete search of the vehicle, absent either (1) a request by the officer with a limitation in scope, or (2) a limiting instruction included in the individual\u2019s consent. <em>See Elliott, </em>107 F.3d at 815 (citing cases). In this case, Trooper Cason did not limit his request for consent. Nor did Vargas\u2019 response (\u201cGo ahead\u201d) in any way limit his consent. Thus, Vargas consented to a thorough search of his vehicle, and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol\u2019s search pursuant to Vargas\u2019 consent comported with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">For the above reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Vargas\u2019 motion to suppress and AFFIRM Vargas\u2019 conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.

Although Vargas testified that Trooper Ca-son had not returned his driver\u2019s license at the time he requested permission to search the vehicle, the district court accepted Trooper Cason\u2019s testimony on this fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\">.

We do not suggest that detention in a police car is per se reasonable under <em>Terry. Cf. United States v. Speal, </em>No. 97-3344, 1998 WL 886757, at *3 (10th Cir.

Vargas also argues that under Oklahoma law, a consent to search given during custodial interrogation must be preceded by a proper <em>Miranda </em>warning.
