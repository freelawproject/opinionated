We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision upholding the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits. <em>E.g., Moore v. Comm\u2019r of Social Sec. Admin., </em>278 F.3d 920, 924 (9th Cir. 2002). The decision of the Commissioner must be affirmed if it is supported by substantial evidence and the Commissioner applied the correct legal standards. <em>Id. </em>Substantial evidence is more than a \u201cmere scintilla,\u201d but less than a preponderance. <em>See Mayes v. Massanari, </em>276 F.3d 453, 459 (9th Cir.2001). If the evidence can reasonably support either affirming or reversing the Secretary\u2019s conclusion, the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Commissioner. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">Langston contends that the ALJ did not make the proper factual findings in support of his conclusion, at step four of the five-part sequential inquiry, that Langston was not disabled because she retained the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to return to her former occupation. Although the claimant bears the burden of establishing that she cannot return to her former work, the Social Security regulations require that the ALJ\u2019s decision, \u201c[i]n finding that an individual has the capacity to perform a past relevant job,\u201d contain the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-15\">1. A finding of fact as to the individuals\u2019 RFC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-16\">2. A finding of fact as to the physical and mental demands of the past job/occupation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-17\">3. A finding of fact that the individual\u2019s RFC would permit a return to his or her past job or occupation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-18\">S.S.R. 82-62. Langston is correct that the ALJ\u2019s decision fails to make the required finding with regard to the mental demands of her past occupation. The ALJ considered only the physical demands of her former occupation, and the decision stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>only that her work as a collection agent is \u201cusually performed at the \u2018light\u2019 exertional level.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the demands of the job are \u201cconsistent with the claimant\u2019s [RFC] described above,\u201d does not address the occupation\u2019s mental demands. Accordingly, we remand to the district court with instructions to remand the case to the ALJ to establish the mental demands of Langston\u2019s former occupation and then to determine whether Langston can perform this job in light of her mental impairments. We note that, once the ALJ has conducted the inquiry necessary to make these findings of fact, it may become necessary to decide whether she can perform other jobs in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b366-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
