Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>No. SF-0432-99-0350-C-2, 91 M.S.P.R. 181, 91 M.S.P.R. 131 (M.S.P.B. Feb.14, 2002). This court <em>affirms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b460-19\">In its final order of February 14, 2002, the Board denied Mr. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s petition because it presented no new, previously unavailable, evidence. The Board could only grant the petition if new evidence emerged or the administrative judge made a legal error. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.115(d) (2002). In this case, the Board properly denied the petition after determining that neither condition was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-20\">The settlement agreement relates to earlier complaints by Mr. O\u2019Sullivan to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and, on different grounds, an appeal by Mr. O\u2019Sullivan to the Board. During a 1997 reduction in force, the Department of the Navy (Navy) reassigned Mr. O\u2019Sullivan to a different position at the same GS-11 level with no grade reduction or loss of pay. In October 1997, Mr. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s job performance was rated as \u201cminimally successful.\u201d In March 1998, Mr. O\u2019Sullivan filed a complaint with the EEOC alleging discrimination. Mr. O\u2019Sullivan subsequently filed two more related EEO complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-21\">On April 9, 1999, the Navy terminated Mr. O\u2019Sullivan from his position as a program analyst, GS-11. Mr. O\u2019Sullivan filed a first appeal to the Board regarding his termination. On June 30, 1999, Mr. O\u2019Sullivan and the Navy entered into a settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>ment agreement resolving that first appeal to the Board. The settlement agreement between Mr. O\u2019Sullivan and the Navy provided that Mr. O\u2019Sullivan would withdraw the appeal to the Board regarding his 1999 removal. In turn, the Navy converted Mr. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s termination to a voluntary retirement, paid Mr. O\u2019Sullivan $4,500, and promised that his EEO complaints would not be affected by the dismissal of his Board appeal. In an initial decision dated June 24, 1999, the Board\u2019s administrative judge had found that the settlement agreement was \u201clawful on its face, that it appears to have been freely reached by the parties, and that the parties understand its terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">On September 17, 1999, the EEOC returned Mr. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s EEO complaints to the Navy. The EEOC mistakenly identified the complaints as \u201cmixed case complaints\u201d under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.302(a), and stated that the Navy had not followed \u201cmixed case complaint\u201d procedures. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1614.302(b); 1614.302(d)(2) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">On September 30, 2000, Mr. O\u2019Sullivan filed a first petition to the Board to enforce the settlement agreement. On October 16, 2000, the Navy and Mr. O\u2019Sullivan executed a joint stipulation in a letter to the EEOC stating that the EEO complaints were not mixed case complaints because they fell outside the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. On November 24, 2000, the administrative judge granted Mr. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s request to withdraw the first petition for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">On July 25, 2001, Mr. O\u2019Sullivan filed a second petition to the Board seeking enforcement of the settlement agreement, alleging that the Navy violated the settlement agreement because the EEOC failed to grant him a hearing in his EEO complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The Board\u2019s initial decision of October 18, 2001, denied Mr. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s second petition for enforcement of the settlement agreement because Mr. O\u2019Sullivan \u201cfailed to specifically allege how the dismissal of his Board appeal had any effect whatsoever on the EEOC\u2019s processing of his discrimination complaints, or how any such effect could be attributable to any violation of the settlement agreement by the agency\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">On February 14, 2002, the Board issued its Final Order rejecting Mr. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s appeal of that initial decision, and his petition for review in this court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">This court sustains a final decision of the Board unless it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law. When the Board\u2019s final decision rests on fact-findings supported by substantial evidence, we must accept those found facts as true. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">In the final order of February 14, 2002, the Board concluded that there was no new, previously unavailable, evidence and that the administrative judge made no error in law or regulation that affects the outcome. Absent such error or evidence, the Board could not grant Mr. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s request. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.115(d) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">The record shows that the Board\u2019s decision is correct. The record contains no new evidence before the Board. The record also shows no error in law or regulation. Mr. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s brief contains no explanation of how the dismissal of his Board appeal affected the EEO proceeding. Mr. O\u2019Sullivan alleged that the Navy did not satisfy procedural requirements for \u201cmixed case complaints\u201d as specified in the EEOC\u2019s letter dated September 17, 1999. However, that allegation is groundless be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>cause Mr. O\u2019Sullivan and the Navy executed a joint stipulation on October 16, 2000, stating that Mr. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s complaints were not \u201cmixed case complaints.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Because the Board\u2019s final decision rests on correct law and on application of that law to facts for which substantial evidence exists in the record, this court affirms.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
