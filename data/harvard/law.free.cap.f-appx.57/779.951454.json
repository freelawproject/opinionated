We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-20\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Benn v. Lambert, </em>283 F.3d 1040, 1051 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 341, 154 L.Ed.2d 249 (2002). We may not grant relief unless the state court\u2019s adjudication of Dao\u2019s claims \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). We are not permitted to substitute our judgment for that of the state court. <em>Woodford v. Visciotti, </em>537 U.S. 19, 123 S.Ct. 357, 360, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 957,154 L.Ed.2d 855 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-25\">Dao contends that the trial court\u2019s admission of nontestifying accomplice Cuong Phan\u2019s out-of-court statements violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. Like the California Court of Appeal, we decline to decide whether the admission of the statements violated the Sixth Amendment, because even if we assume that a Confrontation Clause violation occurred, the error was harmless. Phan\u2019s statements, which placed Dao at the murder scene with a gun of a different caliber from the murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>weapon, were corroborated by the far more damaging testimony of Sat Tai Yu, who stated that he saw Dao fire shots with a .25 caliber gun at the murder scene, and Jimmy Quach and Tammy Tran, both of whom testified that Dao admitted to the murder. Moreover, the government did not rely heavily on Phan\u2019s statements in its closing argument, and the court instructed the jury that it was not to consider the testimony of accomplices unless that testimony was corroborated by other evidence. Any error in the admission of the statements therefore did not have a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d on the jury\u2019s verdict, <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 622,113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted), and the California Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that the error was harmless was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b815-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
