Bravo-Adame filed a pro se notice of appeal that was untimely, and a subsequent motion in the district court for an extension of time in which to file the notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). The district court denied the request, finding that Bravo-Adame had not shown excusable neglect for failing to file a timely notice of appeal. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Prairie Pharmacy, Inc., </em>921 F.2d 211, 212 (9th Cir.1990), we affirm the district court\u2019s denial because Bravo-Adame has not demonstrated that he \u201cdid all he could do under the circumstances\u201d to file a timely notice of appeal. <em>See United States v. Houser, </em>804 F.2d 565, 569 (9th Cir.1986); <em>see also Prairie Pharmacy, </em>921 F.2d at 212 (\u201c[W]e may reverse only if there is no reasonable basis in the record to support the district court\u2019s decision.\u201d). We therefore lack jurisdiction over this appeal. <em>See United States v. Eccles, </em>850 F.2d 1357, 1363 (9th Cir.1988) (stating that the filing deadline of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b) is mandatory and jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b799-38\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
