Swanson and his wife Dixie C. Swanson appeal pro se the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law following a bench trial. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision, and we review de novo the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions of law and for clear error its findings of fact. <em>Eskanos &amp; Adler, P.C. v. Leetien, </em>309 F.3d 1210,1213 (9th Cir.2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">This appeal arises from an adversary proceeding commenced by the Chapter 7 Trustee of debtors RaeJean Bonham and her two shell corporations, World Plus, Inc. CWPI\u201d) and Atlantic Pacific Funding Corporation (\u201cAPFC\u201d), through which Bonham operated a Ponzi scheme. The Chapter 7 Trustee alleged that the Swan-sons accepted payments from APFC that constituted fraudulent conveyances. The bankruptcy court found that the Swansons had not acted in good faith, and therefore ordered that they repay the amount of the fraudulent conveyances.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">The Swansons\u2019 principal contention is that the substantive consolidation of Bonham\u2019s personal bankruptcy estate with WPI and APFC was erroneous. This contention is precluded by <em>Alexander v. Compton (In re Bonham), </em>229 F.3d 750, 763-71 (9th Cir.2000), in which we affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s substantive consolidation order. <em>See Disimone v. Browner, </em>121 F.3d 1262, 1266 (9th Cir.1997) (applying law of the case doctrine even though petitioners were not parties to the earlier litigation). The Swansons\u2019 contention that they are not liable for fraudulent conveyances because they are lenders not investors fails for the same reason. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion that the Swansons did not act in good faith is not clearly erroneous. For example, at the bench trial, the Swansons admitted that they did not undertake any investigation of Bonham or her corporations, and that they did not understand her business. <em>See Hayes v. Palm Seedlings Partners-A (In re Agric. Research &amp; Tech. Group, Inc.), </em>916 F.2d 528, 536 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-16\">The district court properly concluded that the Chapter 7 Trustee timely commenced this adversary proceeding against the Swansons within two years of the entry of the order for relief. <em>See </em>11 U.S.'C. \u00a7 546(a)(1)(A). In addition, the district court correctly held that the Trustee was empowered to avoid the fraudulent transfer under Alaska law because the transfer occurred within six years of the filing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544(b)(1) (authorizing trustee to avoid conveyances voidable under applicable state law); Alaska Stat. \u00a7 34.40.010 (defining void conveyances); <em>Johnson v. Baum, </em>No. S-10073, 2002 WL 31097682, at *4 &amp; n. 15 (Alaska Sept. 18, 2002) (applying six-year statute of limitations of former Alaska Stat. \u00a7 09.10.050 to claim that accrued before August 7,1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The Swansons lack standing to object to other allegedly inappropriate conduct by the Trustee and his counsel, including dismissal of Bonham\u2019s personal civil rights lawsuit against a television station, retention of co-counsel, and receipt of \u201ckickbacks.\u201d <em>See Fondiller v. Robertson (In re Fondiller), </em>707 F.2d 441, 442-43 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">There is no support in the record for the Swansons\u2019 contention that the bankruptcy judge forced them to engage in settlement negotiations with the Trustee. Similarly, the Swansons failed to show that they were prejudiced by the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of their attorney\u2019s request to withdraw and their motion for a continuance to find a new attorney, both made on the eve of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The Swansons\u2019 remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">We grant the Swansons\u2019 motion to file a late reply brief and motion to file an oversized reply brief. The clerk shall file the brief received on October 29, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">We grant the Trustee\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b339-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
