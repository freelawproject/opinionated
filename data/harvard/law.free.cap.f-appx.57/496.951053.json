Quintana and Libertad Quintana seek monetary damages, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the defendant Beverly J. Shields, the Deleware County Treasurer (1) violated their rights to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and their rights under New York State Real Property Tax Law \u00a7 1125 by failing to provide them with adequate notice of a state court foreclosure proceeding and (2) violated Jorge Quintana\u2019s right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment by foreclosing on his property for reasons related to his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">In a Decision and Order filed on June 24, 2002, the District Court held that it was without jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs claims because the claims were \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with claims already litigated in the state court forfeiture proceeding and, therefore, could not be raised in federal court under the <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>doctrine. <em>Quintana v. </em>Shields, No. 02-CV-0653 (TJMXGLS) (N.D.N.Y. June 24, 2002). For substantially the reasons stated by the District Court, we agree that plaintiffs\u2019 claims should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">We have considered all of the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments. The judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
