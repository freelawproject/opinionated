The court considers whether Solomon\u2019s petition for review should be dismissed as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-20\">On October 11, 2002, the Merit Systems Protection Board issued a final decision in Solomon\u2019s case, specifying that its decision was final and that any petition for review must be received by this court within 60 days of receipt of the Board\u2019s decision. Solomon acknowledges that he received the decision on October 18, 2002. His petition for review was received by the court on December 20, 2002, more than 60 days after Solomon\u2019s receipt of the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-22\">Our review of a Board decision is governed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1), which provides that \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law, any petition for review must be filed within 60 days after the date the petitioner received notice of the final order or decision of the Board.\u201d This filing period is \u201cstatutory, mandatory, [and] jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Monzo v. Dept, of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, </em>735 F.2d 1335, 1336 (Fed.Cir. 1984). Thus, under the time provision of the statute, Solomon\u2019s petition for review was due in this court within 60 days of receipt of the Board\u2019s final decision, i.e., December 17, 2002. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 25(a) (a filing is not timely unless the clerk receives the papers within the time fixed for filing). Because it was received after that date, this court must dismiss Solomon\u2019s petition as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-23\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b471-24\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-25\">(1) The motion for leave to file out of time is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-26\">(2) Solomon\u2019s petition for review is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-27\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
