Skibinski, appearing pro se, appeals the dismissal arguing the merits of both (1) her claim pursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>against her former employer, Zevnik, Horton, Gui-bord, McGovern, Palmer &amp; Fogani, LLP (\u201cthe Zevnick firm\u201d) and (2) her allegation of improper investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). Additionally, Skibinski urges that the district court erred when it found the action time-barred and dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) de novo. <em>See Cooper v. Parsky, </em>140 F.3d 433, 440 (2d Cir.1998). In addition, pro se submissions are construed liberally and are treated as raising the strongest arguments that they might suggest. <em>Graham v. Henderson, </em>89 F.3d 75, 79 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">Skibinski\u2019s claims against the EEOC must fail. As the district court correctly noted in an earlier ruling dismissing Skibinski\u2019s complaint against the EEOC and granting leave to amend, employees have no express or implied cause of action under Title VII to sue the EEOC for improper investigation or processing of employment discrimination claims. <em>See Baba v. Japan Travel Bureau Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>111 F.3d 2, 6 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">As for Skibinski\u2019s claim against her former employer, the Zevnick firm, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l), a plaintiff must file an ADEA complaint within 90 days of receipt of a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC. When Skibinski filed her initial complaint, she was 29 days beyond the statutory deadline. In granting leave to amend the complaint, the district court noted that under certain circumstances, equitable tolling may apply, <em>see Baldwin County Welcome Ctr. v. Brown, </em>466 U.S. 147, 151, 104 S.Ct. 1723, 80 L.Ed.2d 196 (1984) (per curiam), and implicitly encouraged Skibinski to adequately explain her late filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">However, upon refiling and on appeal, Skibinski has alleged only, and without specifics, that she had difficulty obtaining documents from the EEOC. This is insufficient to obtain equitable tolling. <em>See Baldwin, </em>466 U.S. at 151-52, 104 S.Ct. 1723. Because Skibinski\u2019s complaint was not timely filed, and for substantially the same reasons as those cited by the district court, we affirm the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
