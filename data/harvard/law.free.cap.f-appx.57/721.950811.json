The district court sentenced Harrington to 84 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. On appeal, Harrington\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue: the district court engaged in double counting by increasing appellant\u2019s adjusted offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) for possessing a stolen firearm. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-18\">Harrington may not challenge the two-level increase, because he specifically stipulated to it in his plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995) (defendant who explicitly and voluntarily exposes himself to specific sentence may not challenge that punishment on appeal). In any event, the increase was proper under applicable commentary, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.12), and thus no impermissible double counting occurred, <em>see United States v. Hawkins, </em>181 F.3d 911, 912-13 (8th Cir.) (court may impose 2-level increase under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) if base offense level is not calculated under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(7)), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 981, 120 S.Ct. 436, 145 L.Ed.2d 341 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-19\">Having reviewed the record, we find no nonfrivolous issues. <em>See Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988). Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-20\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-22\">.
