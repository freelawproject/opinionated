Mukasey, Judge), revoking his bail and ordering his continued detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">We review the district court\u2019s revocation of bail and factual determination that the defendant is a flight risk for clear error, but if the court does not formally review the statutory factors in reaching its conclusion, we apply a more flexible standard. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>823 F.2d 4, 5-6 (2d Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Becton argues that (1) because his conspiracy indictment was based on the same overt acts as his earlier indictment, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f), the government lacked the necessary new information and changed circumstances to reopen his bail proceeding; and (2) the district court did not engage in sufficient \u201cwritten fact-finding\u201d as required in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\u00a9 to demonstrate appropriate consideration of the statutory factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(a), when a person is charged in a superceding indictment, a new detention proceeding is appropriate in light of the changed circumstances and new factors. In this case, the presumption regarding flight risk has changed because Becton now faces a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence. \u201cSubject to rebuttal by the person, it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the community if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person committed an offense for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed in the Controlled Substances Act.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e). Thus, because of the government\u2019s proffer regarding its murder investigation of Becton and his new conspiracy charge, the circumstances have changed sufficiently to justify a new bail hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">In <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>we affirmed a detention in the absence of a written statement from the court indicating its consideration of the statutory factors and fact-finding, when a defendant facing a ten-year mandatory minimum had not sufficiently rebutted that statutory presumption of a flight risk and the government\u2019s proffer was compelling. 823 F.2d at 6. Here, the detention order cites the \u201creasons set forth in open court\u201d as the basis for detention and although not listed in the order, those reasons are evident from the record and sufficient to justify Becton\u2019s continued detention, even under our more flexible standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
