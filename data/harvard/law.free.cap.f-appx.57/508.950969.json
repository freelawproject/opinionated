As part of the plea agreement, Waller agreed to cooperate fully with the government. In exchange, the government agreed to move for a downward departure pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K1.1 (2001) (hereinafter \u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cthe Guidelines\u201d) if Waller provided \u201csubstantial assistance in the investigation of one or more persons who have committed offenses.\u201d The government also stated that it \u201cm[ight] move the sentencing judge, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), to depart from any applicable statutory minimum sentence.\u201d The applicable statutory minimum term of imprisonment for the cocaine conspiracy charge is 120 months. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii)(II).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Based on Waller\u2019s offense level of 35 and a criminal history category of V, the District Court determined at sentencing that the appropriate Guidelines range was 262 to 327 months. The government moved for a downward departure under \u00a7 5K1.1 based on Waller\u2019s substantial assistance, and the District Court sentenced Waller to 160 months, departing downward by 102 months. The government did not, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), move to depart downward from the applicable statutory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">In this appeal, Waller complains that the District Court failed to conduct a legally sufficient assessment of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Kl.l\u2019s enumerated factors when ruling upon the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. We exercise plenary review over claims of sentencing error based upon a mistake of law or an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Torres, </em>251 F.3d 138, 145 (3d Cir.2001). We find that the District Court properly indicated its consideration of \u00a7 5Kl.l\u2019s enumerated factors, and we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">In <em>United States v. Torres, </em>we held that when considering a downward departure for substantial assistance,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">[A] sentencing court not only must conduct a qualitative, case-by-case analysis but also must examine \u00a7 5Kl.l\u2019s enumerated factors. That is, when presented with a motion for downward departure a sentencing judge must, at a very minimum, indicate his or her consideration of \u00a7 5Kl.l\u2019s five factors in determining whether and to what extent to grant a sentencing reduction. Further, a sentencing judge must indicate his or her consideration of any factors outside those listed in \u00a7 5K1.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">251 F.3d at 147. Courts must consider the following five factors under \u00a7 5K1.1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-12\">(1) the court\u2019s evaluation of the significance and usefulness of the defendant\u2019s assistance, taking into consideration the government\u2019s evaluation of the assistance rendered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-13\">(2) the truthfulness, completeness, and reliability of any information or testimony provided by the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-14\">(3) the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s assistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-15\">(4) any injury suffered, or any danger or risk of injury to the defendant or his family resulting from his assistance; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-16\">(5) the timeliness of the defendant\u2019s assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. In Torres, we also \u201cstrongly urge[d],\u201d but did not require, sentencing judges to \u201cmake specific find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>ings regarding each factor and articulate thoroughly whether and how they used any proffered evidence to reach their decision.\u201d 251 F.3d at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">We are satisfied that the District Court more than met the requirements of <em>Torres. </em>The government\u2019s letter brief and the sentencing transcript demonstrate that the District Court expressly considered arguments regarding 5Kl.l\u2019s enumerated factors, and that the District Court considered several non-enumerated factors. The government\u2019s letter brief properly brought the <em>Torres </em>decision to the District Court\u2019s attention, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">Consistent with the decision of <em>United States v. Torres, </em>251 F.3d 138 (3d Cir. 2001), in ruling on the Government\u2019s motion for a downward departure under Section 5K1.1, the Court must conduct \u201ca qualitative, case by case analysis [and] also ... examine Section 5Kl.l\u2019s enumerated factors\u201d as well as any other factor the Court deems relevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">In addition, the government presented arguments concerning each of the \u00a7 5K1.1 factors in both its letter brief and at sentencing. Defense counsel provided additional evidence regarding Waller\u2019s assistance pursuant to the five factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">After hearing the arguments of the parties, the District Court indicated on the record that it recognized its duty to consider \u00a7 5Kl.l\u2019s five enumerated factors. The Court stated that \u201cin considering the cooperation [of the defendant] under 5K1.1, the Court has to review certain relevant factors; the nature and extent of the assistance given by the defendant.\u201d The District Court then explicitly discussed each of the five factors, and how the defendant\u2019s conduct was relevant to each factor. We conclude that the Court satisfied its duty \u201cto indicate [its] consideration\u201d of the 5K1.1 factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The Court also clearly stated on the record that it had considered the following non-enumerated factors: the seriousness of the drug conspiracy, the firearms offenses that Waller committed separately from his co-defendants, and the relative responsibility of the various defendants involved in the drug conspiracy. Accordingly, the District Court properly indicated its consideration of \u00a7 5Kl.l\u2019s enumerated and non-enumerated factors under <em>Torres.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">We turn briefly to the defendant\u2019s argument that the District Court did not conduct an individualized, qualitative analysis in sentencing the defendant by failing to ask the government why it did not file a motion to depart below the statutory mandatory minimum pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). This argument lacks merit. The defendant conceded that the plea agreement gave the government sole discretion to decide whether to move pursuant to \u00a7 3553(e). The District Court had no duty to question the government on why it chose not to exercise its discretion to file such a motion. The government\u2019s recommended sentence of 168 months represented a <em>substantial </em>departure, but did not come close to falling below the statutory minimum of 120 months. Even Waller himself did not ask for a sentence below the mandatory minimum. Hence, the government is correct that the question of whether to impose a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum was not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">The judgment of the District Court will be AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
