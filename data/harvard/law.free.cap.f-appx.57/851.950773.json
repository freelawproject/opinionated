R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">Defendant Harold Eugene Combs seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) from this court in order to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief in his motion brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We deny Mr. Combs\u2019 application and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-18\">To be entitled to a COA, Mr. Combs must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). He can make this showing by establishing that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). We will grant relief if we determine that \u201cthe judgment was rendered without jurisdiction, or that the sentence imposed was not authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack, or that there has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-19\">Mr. Combs was charged along with four co-defendants in a twenty-two count indictment. The jury found him guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine base, interstate transportation in aid of racketeering, use of a telephone to further the conspiracy, and money laundering. He was sentenced to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-20\">Mr. Combs filed an appeal in which he argued he was denied a fair trial and deprived of due process due to perjured testimony from government witnesses. This court affirmed his conviction. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number><em>States v. Combs, </em>No. 97-6219, 1998 WL 17767 (10th Cir. Jan.20,1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Mr. Combs filed this motion seeking relief under \u00a7 2255 in district court in which he alleged he had received ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel because trial counsel had failed to object to (1) cooperating witness testimony, (2) jury instruction No. 30 on interdependence, and (3) his sentence which exceeded the sentencing guideline range. He contended that appellate counsel was ineffective because he had failed to raise those issues. Mr. Combs then moved to amend his complaint to add several claims based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The district court granted the motion, but denied relief holding that Mr. Combs had failed to show ineffective assistance of counsel and that <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactive to habeas petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">On appeal, Mr. Combs argues only that the district court erred in denying his <em>Ap-prendi </em>claims. He maintains the trial court improperly imposed a sentence beyond the statutory maximum and removed essential elements from the jury\u2019s province because the jury was not instructed to determine the type and quantity of drugs involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">This court has held that <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactive to initial \u00a7 2255 motions. <em>United States v. Mora, </em>293 F.3d 1213,1219 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 388, 154 L.Ed.2d 315 (2002). Reasonable jurists could not debate whether his \u00a7 2255 \u201cpetition should have been resolved in a different manner\u201d or whether \u201cthe issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595 (internal quotation marks omitted). Consequently, Mr. Combs has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d and is not entitled to a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">We deny a COA and DISMISS this appeal. Mr. Combs\u2019 motion to proceed in forma pauperis is GRANTED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b888-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
