The District Court issued sixteen Writs of Execution and Attachment and Restraining Notices. Because of a parallel New York proceeding involving overlapping questions about ownership of certain proceeds, the District Court stayed its proceeding in the interests of judicial economy and to avoid potentially inconsistent rulings. The District Court then stayed enforcement of the restraints until it could address the validity of the restraints on the basis of an adequate record and with the benefit of the potentially dispositive ruling in New York on many of the same legal and factual issues. The only issue we need decide is whether we have appellate jurisdiction over two sets of non-final orders of the District Court temporarily staying pro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>eeedings during the pendency of parallel proceedings in another federal district court. We conclude that we do not have jurisdiction and will dismiss the appeal, because the stay orders are not final under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">To be considered final, an order must first \u201cdispose of all claims presented to the district court\u201d and, second, the order must leave \u201cnothing further for the district court to do.\u201d <em>Michelson v. Citicorp Nat\u2019l Servs., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 508, 513 (3d Cir. 1998). We have frequently iterated \u201cthe usual rule that a stay is not ordinarily a final decision for purposes of \u00a7 1291, since most stays do not put the plaintiff effectively out of court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508 (quoting <em>Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 10, n. 11, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Here, the District Court explicitly held in the May 10 order that the Stay Orders were not final, did not resolve all of the outstanding issues, and were subject to the District Court\u2019s further review. The District Court did not rule on the merits of the arguments raised in the Motion to Quash, and reserved the right to revisit the issue of enforceability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">This ruling, as well as the court\u2019s April 26, 2002 Memorandum and Order, should not be interpreted as in any way making a determination of the validity, or invalidity, of the writs and notices at issue. Consideration of that matter, if necessary, is deferred until another day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQb\">The District Court is simply deferring issuing a final decision on the merits until the conclusion of related proceedings, which could have <em>res judicata </em>implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">There exists, however, \u201ca narrow class of collateral orders which do not meet [the] definition of finality, but which are nevertheless immediately appealable under \u00a7 1291.\u201d <em>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.. </em>517 U.S. 706. 712. 116 S.Ct. 1712. 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996). KBC argues that the collateral order exception to the finality requirement-known as the <em>Cohen </em>Doctrine-allows jurisdiction in the instant case. In order to qualify for this exception, KBC must satisfy the three-pronged collateral order test. <em>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas, </em>485 U.S. 271, 276, 108 S.Ct. 1133, 99 L.Ed.2d 296 (1988). We have \u201cconsistently maintained that the collateral order doctrine must be sparingly applied, \u2018lest the exception swallow up the salutary general rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gold v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>723 F.2d 1068 (3d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Here, we conclude that the narrow collateral order exception is inapplicable because disputed questions have not been \u201cconclusively\u201d determined. <em>Gulfstream, </em>485 U.S. at 276,108 S.Ct. 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">In addition, we find Appellant\u2019s contention that the stay orders are appealable interlocutory orders under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) to be sophistic. <em>See Cofab, Inc. v. Philadelphia Joint Bd., Amalgamated Clothing &amp; Textile Workers Union, 141 </em>F.3d 105, 108 (3d Cir.1998) (\u201cThe district court \u2018enjoined\u2019 no party or proceeding but rather stayed its own action regarding the arbitration award pending the outcome of a final NLRB ruling.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">In sum, the stay order is not final and we will dismiss the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
