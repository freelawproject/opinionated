Schwartz, Judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Defendant-Appellant Benjamin Breen appeals from a judgment of conviction entered on December 13, 2001 by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York following his plea of guilty on August 11, 1997, before Robert P. Patterson, <em>Judge, </em>to a two-count information charging him with (1) receiving and selling stolen property having an approximate value of $1,000,000, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2315 and 2, and (2) possessing a firearm with an obliterated manufacturer\u2019s serial number, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(k) and 2. Defendant was sentenced on December 12, 2001 by Judge Allen G. Schwartz to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release and was ordered to pay a special assessment of $200. This sentence constituted a downward departure of 24 months from the applicable guidelines range on the Government\u2019s motion pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">On appeal, defendant claims that (1) the extent of the District Court\u2019s downward departure did not properly reflect the extent of his assistance to the Government but rather was based on unsubstantiated and inaccurate assertions; and (2) he received ineffective assistance of counsel in his plea negotiations with the Government. With respect to the first claim, defendant contends that, in declining to fashion a greater departure, Judge Schwartz improperly relied on his own opinion as to defendant\u2019s candor in testimony that he provided as a cooperating witness in a trial over which Judge Schwartz presided.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">This claim has no merit. It is well established that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the extent of a downward departure. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3742(a)(1)-(3); <em>United States v. Hargrett, </em>156 F.3d 447, 450 (2d Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Lawal, </em>17 F.3d 560, 562, 563-64 (2d Cir. 1994). In any event, Judge Schwartz was authorized to consider \u2014 and the record reflects that he did consider \u2014 \u201cthe truthfulness, completeness, and reliability of any information or testimony provided\u201d by defendant in deciding whether, or to what extent, to grant a departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">The only support for defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim is an affidavit submitted by his former attorney who represented him during the proceedings below. This affidavit was not before the District Court and is thus not properly before us. Where a defendant raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that is unsupported by the record on appeal or requires consideration of extrinsic materials, we have held that it is preferable to deny the claim without prejudice to its consideration in a properly filed habeas petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Billy-Eko v. United States, 8 </em>F.3d 111, 114-16 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s appeal as regards his sentence is DISMISSED for lack of appellate jurisdiction, and his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
