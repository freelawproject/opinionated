Hercules Inc., </em>214 F.3d 155 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-22\">Inasmuch as we write only for the parties, it is not necessary to recite the factual or procedural background of this case. Moreover, in its Memorandum Opinion, the district court carefully and completely explained its reasons for finding that Hidy\u2019s claim is time-barred. <em>Hidy v. TIAA Group Long Term Disability Benefits Ins. Policy, </em>2002 WL 450084 (D.Del. March 19, 2002). We can add nothing to the district court\u2019s thoughtful analysis, and we will not attempt to gild the lily by engaging in a redundant discussion simply to reach the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-23\">Accordingly, we will affirm the district court substantially for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s opinion without further elaboration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
