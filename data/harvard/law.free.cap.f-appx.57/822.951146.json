Fuentes was found guilty of two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and sentenced to concurrent terms of seventy-eight months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release thereafter. On appeal, Fuentes challenges only the calculation of his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in: (1) using an ancient felony conviction to calcu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>late his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), a provision generally applicable to defendants with two prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or controlled substance offenses; and (2) refusing to grant a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(2) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because the government has confessed error and our independent review confirms that the district court clearly erred in its application of \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), we vacate and remand for resentencing on the first claim. We affirm as to the second allegation of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">In calculating Fuentes\u2019s base offense level, the district looked to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), which instructs the sentencing court to apply a base offense level of twenty-four \u201cif the defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d The pre-sentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) reveals two such prior felony convictions: (1) a 1979 conviction for accessory to second-degree murder; and (2) a 1985 conviction for distribution of a controlled substance. In 1989, Fuentes committed a parole violation relating to the 1979 conviction and was placed in custody until May 7,1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">In determining whether a prior felony conviction counts towards a defendant\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1, application note 15 indicates that the court should \u201cuse only those felony convictions that receive criminal history points [under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1].\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 15. The definitions and instructions for computing criminal history under \u00a7 4A1.1 are contained in \u00a7 4A1.2(e), and specify that only prior sentences exceeding one year and imposed within fifteen years of the instant offense are counted. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l). While Fuentes was assessed three criminal history points for his 1979 conviction and subsequent 1989 parole violation, he received no criminal history points for his 1985 felony conviction in the PSR. Despite this, trial counsel failed to object to the district court\u2019s determination that Fuentes\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) was twenty-four, a base offense level indicating that both of Fuentes\u2019s prior felony convictions were used in calculating his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">Fuentes did object, however, to the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, arguing that he had never contested the fact that he possessed the guns or that he had two prior felony convictions. Based in part on <em>United States v. Reed, </em>114 F.3d 1053, 1058 (10th Cir.1997), where we observed that \u201c[a] defendant who requires the government to make its proof by going to trial generally will not be allowed a two-level departure for acceptance of responsibility,\u201d the district refused to grant the reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">Fuentes failed to raise below the issue of the district court\u2019s use of an ancient felony conviction to calculate his sentence under \u00a7 2K2.1. Thus, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Farnsworth, </em>92 F.3d 1001, 1007-08 (10th Cir.1996) (limiting review of the precise issue raised in the instant case to plain error because it had not been raised below); Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b) (\u201cA plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d). Plain error is (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights of a defendant, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>ty, or public perception of judicial proceedings. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997). In <em>Farnsworth</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>this court examined the precise issue now before us and determined that \u201cbasing a sentence on the wrong Guideline range constitutes a fundamental error affecting substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 92 F.3d at 1007 08 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">On appeal, Fuentes acknowledges that trial counsel failed to raise the issue below, but argues that the district court committed plain error affecting his substantial rights in determining that his base offense level was twenty-four. The government, for its part, agrees with Fuentes, and urges this court to vacate Fuentes\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. Fuentes asserts that the trial court should have looked to \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) (setting a base offense level of twenty for those defendants with one qualifying prior felony conviction) rather than \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) (setting a base offense level of twenty-four for those defendants with at least two qualifying prior felony convictions). We agree. Fuentes\u2019s 1985 conviction did not result in any criminal history points, and \u00a7 2K2.1, cmt. n. 15 specifically indicates that only those felony convictions that receive criminal history points are to be used in calculating base offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1. Thus, the district court\u2019s use of this 1985 conviction as one of the two predicate felony convictions under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) was improper and erroneous, affecting Fuentes\u2019s substantial rights. In these circumstances, Fuentes\u2019s sentence must be vacated and the case remanded for resentenc-ing.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">Fuentes also argues that the district court erred in denying a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. We review a determination that a defendant is not entitled to an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>United States v. Day, </em>223 F.3d 1225,1230 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">In most cases, a defendant who requires the United States to prove the charges contained in the indictment does not qualify for the adjustment under \u00a7 3E1.1, and it is the defendant\u2019s \u201cburden to establish an entitlement to this reduction.\u201d <em>Reed, </em>114 F.3d at 1058. Nevertheless, a defendant who stands trial is not thereby automatically excluded from receiving an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, as application note 2 makes clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-12\">This adjustment is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse.... In <em>rare </em>situations a defendant may clearly demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>strate an acceptance of responsibility for his criminal conduct even though he exercises his constitutional right to a trial. This may occur, for example, where a defendant goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt (e.g., to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his conduct). In each such instance, however, a determination that a defendant has accepted responsibility will be based primarily upon pre-trial statements and conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 2 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Fuentes argues that his case presents one of those rare circumstances when a defendant may clearly demonstrate an acceptance of responsibility even though he exercises his constitutional right to a trial, because he never challenged the factual elements that he possessed firearms after having been convicted of two felonies, and sought only to present an entrapment defense. Fuentes notes that we have held that application of the reduction for acceptance of responsibility is not necessarily precluded by raising an entrapment defense at trial. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>182 F.3d 1165, 1173 (10th Cir.1999). In the same case, however, we also emphasized that our decision that raising an entrapment defense does not preclude application of the adjustment \u201cdoes not mean that the simple assertion of the entrapment defense coupled with acknowledgment of the underlying criminal activity automatically entitles a defendant to a two-point acceptance of responsibility reduction.\u201d <em>Id, </em>Because these circumstances do not automatically entitle a defendant to a two-point reduction, the district court had discretion to conclude, as it did, that Fuentes put the government to the burden of trial based on questions of fact. In reviewing the court\u2019s conclusion, we are mindful that \u201c[t]he sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility\u201d and that \u201cthe determination of the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 5. Given the record before us,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we are unable to conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that Fuentes put the government to the burden of trial based on questions of fact and was therefore ineligible for a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Fuentes\u2019s sentence is VACATED in part and the matter is REMANDED for recalculation of sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b859-10\"> At the parties' request, the case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(f) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-6\">. In <em>Farnsworth, </em>the court examined the pertinent note of commentary to the edition of the Sentencing Guidelines then applicable. 92 F.3d at 1007 (noting that the \"court is to count any such prior conviction that receives any points under \u00a7 4A1.1\u201d (quotation omitted)). While the instant case deals with the 2001 edition of the Sentencing Guidelines, the slight difference in the wording of the particular commentaiy notes is not significant. Under either phrasing, the fact that no criminal history category points were assessed to Fuentes for the 1985 Texas conviction is determinative of whether that conviction can be used for purposes of determining Fuentes\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b861-14\">. After all the calculations were made, Fuentes had a total offense level of 26, criminal history category III, resulting in a guideline range of 78-97 months. If the 1985 Texas conviction had not been used in calculating Fuentes\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), Fuentes would likely have had a total offense level of 22, criminal history category III, with a guideline range of 51-63 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b862-6\">. Fuentes freely admitted that he possessed firearms. However, in addition to raising an entrapment defense, Fuentes argued at trial that the government had not succeeded in proving that he possessed a firearm as a convicted felon within the meaning of the statute because he believed that his civil rights had been restored. The district court rejected Fuentes's argument on two grounds: (1) factually, Fuentes\u2019s civil rights had not been restored, and (2) Fuentes\u2019s belief that they had been restored is no defense to a general intent crime like being a \"felon in possession of a firearm.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
