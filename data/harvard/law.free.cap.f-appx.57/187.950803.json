Faulk appeals his conviction and 120-month custodial sentence following his guilty plea to conspiring to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000). Prior to accepting the guilty plea, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to deny Faulk\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>a 1996 traffic stop in Maryland and the search of his mother\u2019s apartment immediately following his arrest in New York in 1998. Faulk\u2019s plea agreement preserved his right to appeal the district court\u2019s suppression determination, and we affirm the denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">This court reviews the factual findings underlying a motion to suppress, including credibility determinations, for clear error, and any legal determinations de novo. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Murray, </em>65 F.3d 1161, 1169 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). The factual determination that valid consent to the search was given is also reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>300 F.3d 415, 423 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 614, 154 L.Ed.2d 552, 71 U.S.L.W. 3389 (2002). The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating a Fourth Amendment violation, <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 130 n. 1, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978), and this court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Faulk\u2019s assertion that two separate Fourth Amendment violations preceded the seizure of five kilograms of cocaine from his car following a 1996 traffic stop in Maryland is unpersuasive. The magistrate judge properly determined that the circumstances surrounding Faulk\u2019s travel provided the reasonable and particularized suspicion of criminal activity necessary to extend a valid traffic stop. <em>See United States v. Brugal, </em>209 F.3d 353, 358 (4th Cir.2000) (en banc). Further, Faulk fails to demonstrate clear error in the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that he consented to the search of his car and that his testimony to the contrary was not credible. <em>See Carter, </em>300 F.3d at 423; <em>Murray, </em>65 F.3d at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Similarly, we find no clear error in the magistrate judge\u2019s determination that Faulk\u2019s mother consented to the search of her apartment immediately following Faulk\u2019s arrest there in 1998. The Government presented a signed consent to search form, and we find no clear error in the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that Faulk\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing denying she signed the consent form was not credible. <em>See Murray, </em>65 F.3d at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Accordingly, because we find no clear error in any of the magistrate judge\u2019s determinations, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Faulk\u2019s motion to suppress. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
