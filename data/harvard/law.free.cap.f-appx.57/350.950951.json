We have jurisdiction under 8 U. S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual determinations concerning a petitioner\u2019s eligibility for asylum, and must uphold them unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812,117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-19\">Tsoukanov testified that he fears the Soviets may return to power and punish him for his participation in the Estonian People\u2019s Front, an anti-Soviet organization with which he was involved in 1987. This evidence does not compel the conclusion that Tsoukanov has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339 (9th Cir.1995). Accordingly, Tsoukanov is not eligible for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-20\">Tsoukanov, in failing to qualify for asylum, necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-21\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b386-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
