The district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> dismissed his claims, and he appeals. After careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-19\">Harms did not exhaust his administrative remedies, which is a prerequisite to filing suit in federal court. <em>See McAdams v. Reno, </em>64 F.3d 1137, 1141 (8th Cir.1995). Although he initially pursued his claims with the Merit System Protection Board, he subsequently abandoned those claims. As a result, he is now precluded from raising them in this civil action. <em>See id. </em>at 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-20\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-21\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b756-23\">.
