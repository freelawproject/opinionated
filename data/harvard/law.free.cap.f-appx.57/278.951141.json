Radford also appeals the denial of his motion to amend his complaint to allege only exhausted claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-22\">Upon de novo review, <em>see Cody v. Weber, </em>256 F.3d 764, 767 (8th Cir.2001), we conclude there was some evidence that Rad-ford committed actual rule violations. <em>See Moore v. Plaster, </em>266 F.3d 928, 931 (8th Cir.2001) (retaliation claim may be defended by showing \u201csome evidence\u201d that inmate actually committed rule violation), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1037, 122 S.Ct. 1797, 152 L.Ed.2d 655 (2002); <em>Henderson v. Baird, </em>29 F.3d 464, 465, 469 (8th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>515 U.S. 1145, 115 S.Ct. 2584, 132 L.Ed.2d 833 (1995). We also conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>his damages claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477,114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). <em>See Portley-El v. Brill, </em>288 F.3d 1063, 1066-67 (8th Cir. 2002). Finally, we find no error in the denial of Radford\u2019s motion to amend, because his complaint was not dismissed on exhaustion grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-11\">.
