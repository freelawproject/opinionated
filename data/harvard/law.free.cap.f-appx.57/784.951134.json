R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Defendant Jimmy Swanson, d/b/a/ Silver Star Limousine and Executive West Sales, Inc. (Executive West), appeals the district court\u2019s denial of Swanson\u2019s motion to set aside a default judgment entered for plaintiff Robert Williams. Because we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Williams filed this action against Swanson, Executive West, and two co-defendants seeking damages for violations of the Federal Odometer Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 32701-32711 (formerly codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981-1991), the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968, common law fraud, and breach of warranty of title in connection with Williams\u2019 purchase of a limousine in 1989. Although Swanson and Executive West were served, they failed to answer. The district court subsequently dismissed the two co-defendants without prejudice pursuant to a stipulated release filed by Williams. Because Swanson and Executive West failed to answer or otherwise appear, the court entered a default judgment against them. After an eviden-tiary hearing, Williams was awarded a total of $55,633.89 in damages. Swanson then filed a motion to set aside the default judgment, which the court denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">\u201cDecisions to enter judgment by default are committed to the district court\u2019s sound discretion, and our review is for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Dennis Garberg &amp; Assocs. v. Pack-Tech Int\u2019l Corp., </em>115 F.3d 767, 771 (10th Cir.1997). We will not disturb the court\u2019s determination without a clear showing that it was based on a clearly erroneous factual finding or an erroneous legal conclusion or that it manifests a clear error of judgment. <em>See Cartier v. Jackson, </em>59 F.3d 1046, 1048 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">As a preliminary matter, we address Swanson\u2019s contention that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Obviously, without subject matter jurisdiction an entry of a default judgment would be erroneous. <em>See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 94, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (\u2018Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.\u201d) (quotation omitted); <em>Hernandez v. Conriv Realty Assocs., </em>182 F.3d 121, 123 (2d Cir.1999) (\u201cArticle III deprives federal courts of the power to dismiss a case with prejudice where federal subject matter jurisdiction does not exist.\u201d). Swanson makes two arguments to support his contention. First, because the amount actually awarded Williams was less than $75,000, Swanson argues that the court lacked diversity jurisdiction. Second, because he claims Williams\u2019 Odometer Act claim was without foundation, Swanson argues that the court lacked federal question jurisdiction. We need not address the first argument because we conclude the court clearly had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">Section 1331 confers original jurisdiction on the district courts to hear civil cases \u201carising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. \u201cUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, federal question jurisdiction must appear on the face of a plaintiffs well-pleaded complaint. The complaint must identify the statutory or constitutional provision under which the claim arises, and allege sufficient facts to show that the case is one arising under federal law.\u201d <em>Martinez v. United States Olympic Comm., </em>802 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>1275, 1280 (10th Cir.1986) (citations omitted). In light of this standard, it is clear that the district court had jurisdiction to hear the instant dispute. Williams\u2019 complaint was drawn so as to seek recovery under, among other things, the Federal Odometer Act, and he alleged facts directly related to his claim arising under that statute. Moreover, \u201c^jurisdiction ... is not defeated ... by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which [a plaintiff] could actually recover.\u201d <em>Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 682, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946). Therefore, Williams\u2019 allegations involving the application of the Odometer Act were a matter of federal concern that conferred jurisdiction on the district court notwithstanding Swanson\u2019s claim that those allegations should fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Swanson next contends that the court lacked jurisdiction over him because the summons was defective for failure to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(a), which requires the summons to \u201cstate the time within which the defendant must appear and defend,\u201d and with Local Rule 4.2, which requires plaintiffs to obtain an order of the clerk of the court authorizing a private process server. The district court relied on <em>Sanderford v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America, </em>902 F.2d 897, 900 (11th Cir.1990), which held that if a summons is in substantial compliance with Rule 4(b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and if the defendant has not shown prejudice by the defect, he must raise his insufficiency of process defense by a motion or in a responsive pleading, or risk waiving that defense after a default judgment. We agree with the district court that Swanson\u2019s argument that the district court did not obtain jurisdiction over him due to a defect in the summons is meritless. The record confirms the court\u2019s observation that Swanson had actual knowledge of the action against him, and that he contacted his attorney in connection with the matter. <em>See </em>Aplt.App. at 32 (affidavit of Jimmy Swanson). The district court\u2019s finding that Swanson was not prejudiced by the defective summons, but rather by his own inaction in the lawsuit, and the court\u2019s rejection of Swanson\u2019s argument that a private process server was not properly authorized are not clearly erroneous. <em>Cf. Kitchens v. Bryan County Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>825 F.2d 248, 255-56 (10th Cir.1987) (noting that, despite a Rule 4 defect in that case, \u201cthe federal courts generally take a permissive attitude towards the mechanism employed for service of process when defendant actually receives notice\u201d) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">Swanson also argues that the district court abused its discretion by concluding that he did not prove that his failure to respond was due to excusable neglect. Specifically, Swanson contends that he reasonably held a mistaken belief that his co-defendant\u2019s attorneys, or that his own attorney was handling the lawsuit for him. The district court applied the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis for determining \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d as set forth in <em>Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates Ltd. Partnership, </em>507 U.S. 380, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993), and determined that Swanson had not sufficiently established it. We agree with the court\u2019s determination. While it is unfortunate that Swanson relied to his detriment on assurances made by counsel, such reliance does not, by itself, demonstrate \u201cex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>cusable neglect.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 396-97, 113 S.Ct. 1489 (holding appellate court erred in not attributing to clients the acts or omissions of their attorneys in assessing excusable neglect). Swanson\u2019s arguments to the contrary do not persuade us that the district court\u2019s determination was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Swanson\u2019s related argument that he has a meritorious defense to Williams\u2019 complaint also fails. As explained by the district court, the requirement that a party demonstrate that his or her defense is meritorious is <em>in addition </em>to the threshold showing of excusable neglect. <em>Otoe County Nat\u2019l Bank v. W &amp; P Trucking, Inc., </em>754 F.2d 881, 883 (10th Cir.1985). Given its conclusion that Swanson failed to show excusable neglect, it was not required to address arguments related to this additional requirement. <em>See Cashner v. Freedom Stores, Inc., </em>98 F.3d 572, 578 n. 2 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">YI.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Swanson\u2019s arguments that (1) he may be entitled to a dismissal or setoff for money already paid to Williams based on Williams\u2019 release of Swanson\u2019s co-defendants in this case; and (2) the entry of default is void due to the court\u2019s failure to dismiss the case after October 31, 2000, are waived because they were not raised before the district court. <em>See Crow v. Shalala, </em>40 F.3d 323, 324 (10th Cir.1994) (\u201cAbsent compelling reasons, we do not consider arguments that were not presented to the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">The judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b821-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b823-6\">. Rule 4(a) was amended in 1993 to include the pertinent provisions of former subdivision (b).
