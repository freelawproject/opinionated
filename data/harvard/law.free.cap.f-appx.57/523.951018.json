Debevoise, Senior Judge, United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b560-9\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">Thomas Schake appeals the order of the District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania denying his motion for post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1996). Because we agree with the District Court that Schake has not substantiated his charge of ineffectiveness of counsel, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">In 1993, Schake was convicted of three counts of conspiring to distribute and possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 841, and 846.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Schake was convicted on the strength of his signed confession, obtained after he was fully advised of his rights, the testimony of a confidential informant, Agnes Alon-so, who had purchased cocaine from Schake on numerous occasions, composite tapes made from a body recorder worn by Alonso during the drug sales, the testimony of two other law enforcement agents, and Schake\u2019s own testimony, during which he made a number of false and misleading statements, contradicted his own testimony at an earlier suppression hearing, and conceded that he had in fact sold cocaine to Aonso.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-15\">Schake filed motions for a new trial, which were denied. After sentencing, he appealed to this Court, arguing that the District Court had erroneously excluded evidence relevant to his entrapment defense, failed to recognize its authority to downward depart at sentencing, and, in a pro se brief, claiming judicial misconduct. We affirmed in a non-precedential opinion. <em>United States v. Schake, </em>70 F.3d 1258 (3d Cir.1995). Schake then filed a motion under section 2255, asserting a multitude of claims. The District Court granted Schake a hearing on the ineffective assistance of counsel claims and a claim of excessive fines, and rejected the other claims as lacking arguable merit. After the evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied Schake\u2019s remaining claims and granted a certificate of appealability with respect to both. Schake appeals the District Court\u2019s order denying his claims of ineffective assistance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2002), and we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2253(a) and 2255 (2002). Because claims of ineffective assistance of counsel present mixed questions of law and fact, our review is plenary. <em>United States v. Kauffman, </em>109 F.3d 186, 187 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">We agree with the District Court that Schake has failed to show how his trial counsel\u2019s arguably deficient performance \u201cprejudiced his trial to the extent that it undermined confidence in the trial\u2019s outcome.\u201d <em>Duncan v. Morton, </em>256 F.3d 189, 200 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 919, 122 S.Ct. 269, 151 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001). Because we write only for the parties, and the District Court\u2019s opinion is well-reasoned and exhaustive, we will restrict our discussion to the pertinent points.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">To prove ineffectiveness of counsel, Schake must show that his counsel \u201cmade errors so serious that [he] was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Schake identifies four errors that he believes entitle him to relief: 1) counsel\u2019s advice that he needed to admit to one of the elements of the offenses charged in order to obtain a jury instruction on entrapment; 2) counsel\u2019s lack of diligence in reviewing the composite tapes of the drug transactions; 3) counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cbolstering\u201d of the confidential informant through testimony that she had aided in securing the conviction of a co-conspirator; and 4) counsel\u2019s failure to call an exculpatory defense witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The District Court found that Schake\u2019s counsel was deficient in regard to his advice concerning the entrapment defense and his diligence in reviewing the tapes. Specifically, the Court found that counsel\u2019s failure to insure that he had copies of all of the original tapes and his ignorance of the holding in <em>Mathews v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 58, 108 S.Ct. 883, 99 L.Ed.2d 54 (1988), that a defendant need not admit to any element of the crime in order to secure a jury instruction on entrapment, fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. The Court noted that Schake\u2019s decision to testify and to attempt to establish entrapment was a reasonable strategic move, but that counsel\u2019s advice that Schake needed to concede an element of the offense when he testified was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">However, having found a deficient performance, the Court went on to find that Schake had suffered no prejudice. Regarding the entrapment advice, the Court found that although Schake\u2019s concession of guilt subjected him to impeachment because it was contrary to his denial of guilt at an earlier suppression hearing, Schake was already subject to impeachment regarding his denial of guilt, because that denial was contrary to his written confession and the information revealed on the audiotapes. Further, Schake\u2019s credibility was undermined by his assertion that he had had a sexual relationship with Alonso, which claim was soundly rebutted by the prosecution. Finally, although not necessary, Schake\u2019s concession made his entrapment defense more plausible than it would have otherwise seemed. Regarding the audiotapes, the Court found that there was no exculpatory material on the missed tapes, and that counsel had fought hard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>have the tapes excluded, and presented evidence to correct the government\u2019s transcripts and to have the tapes interpreted in a favorable manner. Additionally, Schake himself had been given the opportunity to offer his own explanation of the events and interpretation of the tapes. The Court therefore found no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Regarding the \u201cbolstering\u201d and the failure to call an exculpatory witness, the District Court found that counsel\u2019s performance was reasonable and reflected trial strategy. The Court found that counsel\u2019s failure to object to a single, brief question by the prosecutor regarding Alonso\u2019s role in the conviction of a co-conspirator was reasonable in light of counsel\u2019s fear that an objection would highlight the matter for the jury. The Court also found that counsel\u2019s failure to call that co-conspirator as a witness was also reasonable, as the co-conspirator was being prosecuted on drug charges at the time of Schake\u2019s trial and counsel feared he would be a reluctant witness. Furthermore, the supposedly exculpatory testimony consisted of nothing more than the co-conspirator\u2019s statement that Schake had no involvement in one of the transactions, a statement that was contradicted by the tapes, Alonso\u2019s testimony, and Schake\u2019s confession. Finally, Schake was allowed to testify that the co-conspirator had told Schake that he was solely responsible for the drug transaction in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Because we agree with the District Court that Schake has failed to show prejudice from his counsel\u2019s performance, we find it unnecessary to determine whether counsel\u2019s actions fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Given the overwhelming evidence of Schake\u2019s guilt, as shown by Schake\u2019s confession, Alonso\u2019s testimony, the tapes, and Schake\u2019s own testimony, we cannot say that absent counsel\u2019s mistakes, the outcome of the trial would have been different. We will therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-16\">.
