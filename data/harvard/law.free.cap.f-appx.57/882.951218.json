R.Civ.P. 35 (\u201cformer Rule 35\u201d) to correct a purportedly illegal sentence. In 1991, appellant was convicted, following a jury trial, of conspiracy to import heroin (Count I), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963, and two counts of importation of heroin (Counts II and III), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952. Judge Thomas C. Platt sentenced appellant to three consecutive 10-year terms of imprisonment and a lifetime special parole. In support of his Rule 35 motion, appellant argued that his sentence violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Judge Johnson, to whom the case was reassigned, construed the motion as a collateral attack and denied it on the basis that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral attack. We affirm for the reasons stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">Appellant asserts that his sentence violates <em>Apprendi </em>for several reasons. First, he argues that Judge Pratt\u2019s determination that his participation in the conspiracy (Count I) was not a \u201cstraddle\u201d offense <em>(ie., </em>one that involved conduct before and after November 1, 1987) was error, because under <em>Apprendi, </em>a jury rather than a judge must make that determination. As alleged in the indictment, Count I involved a conspiracy to import heroin \u201c[f]rom in or about and between January 1984 through December, 1987, both dates being approximate and inclusive.\u201d The district court found, however, that appellant\u2019s participation in the conspiracy terminated in August of 1984. <em>See United States v. Yu-Leung, </em>51 F.3d 1116, 1120-23 (2d Cir. 1995). Accordingly, the district court used the standards in effect prior to November 1, 1997 to determine appellant\u2019s sentence for all three counts. Appellant contends that a jury might have found that his involvement in the conspiracy extended past November 1, 1987, a finding that would have required him to be sentenced under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>891 F.2d 988, 995 (2d Cir.1989) (commission of offenses that \u201cstraddle\u201d the effective date of the Sentencing Guidelines must be sentenced under the Guidelines). Appellant also argues that the sentence imposed for all three counts violates <em>Apprendi </em>because the jury allegedly was not required to find (1) the precise dates of the offenses charged in Counts II and III of the indictment, and (2) the identities and quantities of the controlled substance at issue for all three counts. We find that, regardless of the procedural posture of appellant\u2019s motion <em>(i.e., </em>whether it is a motion pursuant to former Rule 35 or a collateral attack), appellant\u2019s motion was properly denied be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>cause none of the alleged errors led to an <em>Apprendi </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">First, given the facts of this case, <em>Apprendi </em>has no bearing on the propriety of the judge\u2019s determination that appellant\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy did not \u201cstraddle\u201d the effective date of the Guidelines. As we explained in <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>\u201c[t]he constitutional rule of <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply where the sentence imposed is not greater than the prescribed statutory maximum for the offense of conviction.\u201d 274 F.3d 655, 664 (2d Cir.2001). In this case, appellant\u2019s sentence of ten-years\u2019 incarceration for a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963 exceed neither the pre-November 1, 1987 statutory maximum, nor the statutory maximum in effect after that date. Under the pre-November 1, 1987 regime, appellant could have been sentenced for up to fifteen years\u2019 incarceration for his involvement in the conspiracy. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1) (1983). Had appellant been sentenced pursuant to the statute effective on November 1, 1987, he would have faced a statutory maximum of twenty years incarceration. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(3) (1988). Accordingly, even if <em>Apprendi </em>applies to appellant\u2019s motion, an issue we need not and do not consider, because the ten year sentence imposed for Count I does not exceed any possibly applicable statutory maximum, <em>Apprendi </em>imposes no requirement that a jury determine the termination date of appellant\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Second, the transcript of the jury instruction belies appellant\u2019s contention that the district court failed to instruct the jury with respect to the identity of the controlled substance for Counts I, II, and III, and the dates of the offenses with respect to Counts II and III. Furthermore, because the quantity of narcotics was not an element of a violation of Section 952 or Section 960 as those statutes were codified in 1984, and those sections did not at that time contain quantity-based sentencing enhancements, the district court was not required to instruct the jury with respect to the quantity of heroin alleged in Counts II and III. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952, 960(b) (1984). Moreover, even if the district court\u2019s charge of Counts II and III suffered from the defects appellant alleges, because appellant\u2019s sentences for those counts did not exceed the statutory maximum for violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952 in effect in 1984, the district court\u2019s charge could not have violated <em>Apprendi </em>in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">Finally, although appellant does not make the argument, any suggestion that the district court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences violates <em>Apprendi </em>is barred by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. White, </em>240 F.3d 127, 135 (2d Cir.2001) (determination of whether sentences run concurrently or consecutively is not subject to the <em>Apprendi </em>rule) (citing <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 474, 120 S.Ct. 2348)). Appellant alleges no other grounds for his assertion that his sentence was \u201cillegal,\u201d and we find none.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">We have considered all of appellant\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
