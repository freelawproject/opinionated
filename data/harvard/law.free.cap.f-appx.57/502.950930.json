Feldman, <em>Magistrate </em>Judge) denying his petition for habeas corpus relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Upon due consideration, it is ordered that the matter is remanded to the district court for supplementation of the record pursuant to the procedures described in <em>United States v. Jacobson, </em>15 F.3d 19, 21-22 (2d Cir.1994). Within 120 days of this order, the district court must make any findings of fact and conclusions of law necessary to enter judgment on the following issue: Did the state trial court deprive petitioner of the opportunity to present a meaningful defense, in violation of his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and his right to compulsory process under the Sixth Amendment, by ruling that the substance of Eric Williams\u2019 statement \u2014 otherwise inadmissible under <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968) \u2014 could be disclosed if petitioner\u2019s counsel cross-examined the prosecution\u2019s expert witness on the basis of her opinion or called his own expert witness?</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">The mandate shall issue forthwith and shall state that the parties are to inform the Clerk of this Court when the district court has issued its supplementation of the record in accordance with this order. Following such notification, jurisdiction of the appeal will be automatically restored to this Court, and the Clerk will reassign the appeal to this panel, without the need for either party to file a new notice of appeal. After jurisdiction is restored, the Clerk shall set an expedited briefing schedule, and the parties may, if they wish, submit supplemental letter briefs not to exceed twenty double-spaced pages confined to the issues addressed by the district court on remand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
