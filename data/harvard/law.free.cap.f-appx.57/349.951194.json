We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-16\">The permanent rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) apply to Chavez-Navarro because she was served with a Notice to Appear after April 1, 1997. <em>See Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594, 597 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-19\">We have jurisdiction to review Chavez-Navarro\u2019s contention that application of IIRIRA\u2019s permanent rules to her is imper-missibly retroactive and review de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 599. Because petitioner had no settled expectation that her asylum application would either be accepted or referred to immigration court proceedings before April 1, 1997, application of the permanent rules to Chavez-Navarro was not impermissibly retroactive. <em>See id. </em>at 602 (where petitioner presented herself to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) before April 1, 1997, her \u201cexpectation\u201d that proceedings would commence before the effective date of IIRIRA did not rise to level of \u201csettled expectation\u201d and application of the permanent rules was not impermissibly retroactive).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-20\">We lack jurisdiction to review the timing of the INS\u2019s decisions to deny Chavez-Navarro\u2019s asylum application and commence removal proceedings. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g); <em>Barahona-Gomez v. Reno, </em>236 F.3d 1115,1120 (9th Cir.2001) (asylum officer\u2019s decision whether to grant relief or refer to an IJ is unreviewable); <em>JimenezAngeles, </em>291 F.3d at 599 (timing of decision to commence proceedings is unreviewable).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-21\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b385-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
