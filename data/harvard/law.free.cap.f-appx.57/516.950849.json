Rahman is a Bangladeshi, Muslim female. She was hired by Citterio to work at its meat processing plant on a temporary basis from March 18, 1994 through May 20, 1994, and again from October 5, 1994 through December 21, 1994. Rahman worked at Proklean, an independent contractor with Citterio that provides sanitation services at Citterio\u2019s plant, from December 1996 through March 3, 1997. In 2000, Rahman commenced an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 1991, and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, 43 Pa.Stat. \u00a7 951 et seq., claiming Citterio discriminated against her on the basis of race, national origin, religion, and gender by not rehiring her between 1994 and 1999. The District Court granted Citterio\u2019s motion for summary judgment and we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">I. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The District Court had jurisdiction over Rahman\u2019s federal claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (2000) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (2000) and supplemental jurisdiction over her state claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a) (2000). We exercise jurisdiction over the District Court\u2019s final order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2002). We exercise plenary review over the Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same standard as the District Court. <em>Abramson v. William Paterson College of N.J., </em>260 F.3d 265, 276 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Citterio concedes for this appeal that Rahman has made out a prima facie case, but contends that she has not rebutted its proffered reasons for not hiring her: her poor performance during her two temporary jobs at the plant and her poor performance at Proklean. Rahman has offered no direct evidence of discrimination and relies entirely on circumstantial evidence. Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework, Rahman bears the burden of rebutting Citterio\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons. To meet this burden, she must \u201cdemonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, or contradictions in [Citterio\u2019s] proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them \u2018unworthy of credence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fuentes v. Perskie, </em>32 F.3d 759, 765 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">Rahman argues that the District Court incorrectly viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to Citterio, and that she has shown enough inconsistencies in Cit-terio\u2019s position to allow a jury to find intentional discrimination. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">First, the District Court carefully evaluated each piece of evidence Rahman offered and found it wholly lacking. Rah-man latches onto language in the Court\u2019s opinion stating that the fact that a letter from Rahman\u2019s manager describing her \u201cwork as \u2018ok\u2019 <em>does not mandate </em>the conclusion that [Citterio] was completely satisfied with [Rahman\u2019s] work,\u201d A17 (emphasis added), to argue that the Court was viewing the evidence in a light favorable to Citterio. Rahman cites to <em>Abramson, </em>260 F.3d at 277, in which we reversed summary judgment because the district court had incorrectly framed its analysis in terms of whether \u201ca reasonable person would \u2018necessarily construe\u2019 the conduct in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>question as being improperly motivated.\u201d However, a complete reading of the context of the District Court\u2019s statement reveals that the Court was not improperly framing the issue. The \u201cmandates\u201d statement was made in response to Rahman\u2019s assertion that the letter from her manager revealed a \u201cblatant contradiction\u201d between his pre- and post-litigation positions. The Court\u2019s response was that the letter saying her work was \u201cok\u201d does not blatantly contradict his later testimony that her work was \u201cbelow average.\u201d This was a proper response and does not reveal an incorrect reading of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Second, having independently reviewed the record and taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Rahman, we agree with the District Court that she has not shown such inconsistencies that a reasonable factfinder could find Citterio\u2019s reasons \u201cunworthy of credence.\u201d Correspondence between her and her manager at Citterio prior to the initiation of her suit, A136, and her manager\u2019s testimony, A119, show that the manager did not think she had performed well enough in her sanitation jobs at the plant and with Proklean, and that she had to be reshown how to do jobs. A122. Although it is true that other people who were non-Muslim were retained or hired during the time period that Rahman sought a job, those employees performed better overall than Rahman or were union members. Rahman relies on her own belief that she was a good worker, and comments from Citterio that she was \u201caverage\u201d dining her first temporary job, but that is not enough to rebut evidence that Citterio clearly thought she was not performing well the second time she was hired at Proklean. There is simply nothing here from which to infer intentional discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Because we agree with the District Court that Rahman has not raised any genuine issues as to any material fact, we will affirm the Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Citterio.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
