He appeals his sentence of 27 months in prison. Pursuant to \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5)(B) of the Sentencing Guidelines, the District Court applied a two level enhancement to his sentence because the offense involved the production of an unauthorized counterfeit access device. Sosanya claims that the District Court committed clear error in applying this enhancement, as his relevant conduct did not include involvement in the production of the counterfeit credit cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-12\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 to review the final judgment of the District Court. Whether a defendant\u2019s actions in furtherance of a bank fraud scheme constitute \u201crelevant conduct\u201d is a determination of fact. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>280 F.3d 318, 352 (3d Cir.2002). We review the District Court\u2019s finding of fact for clear error and give due deference to its application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e). Because we find no such error here, we will affirm the two level enhancement under \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-16\">Under \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5), if the offense involved the production or trafficking of any unauthorized access device or counterfeit access device, the offense level is increased by 2. If production or trafficking in counterfeit access devices is a reasonably foreseeable act that occurred during the commission of the offense or in preparation for that offense, \u00a7 lB1.3(a) of the Guidelines prescribes that that conduct is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-17\">Sosanya and co-defendants, Lloyd Mba-mali, Suzanne Moses, and another unnamed individual, went from London to the United States. The day before the trip, Mbamali gave them counterfeit credit cards. Once in the United States, they drew cash advances from several banks, using the counterfeit credit cards, and wired the money back to London. On October 19, 2000, two weeks before the trip to the United States, the \u201cDoctor,\u201d the leader of the scheme, had also sent Sosan-ya and Moses to Paris, France, where they used counterfeit credit cards, which may or may not have been the same cards used in the United States, to rent two automobiles. The automobiles were later reported stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-18\">Sosanya was involved in the scheme to commit bank fraud at least as early as the trip to Paris. Accordingly, all activity on or after October 19, 2000, involving that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>scheme, may be attributed to Sosanya for purposes of sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">The District Court found that Sosanya met the \u201cDoctor\u201d in England, knew about the credit card/bank fraud scheme, and expressed interest in conducting this scheme in the United States. The District Court also found that the production of counterfeit credit cards was \u201cpart of the relevant conduct of the conspiracy,\u201d and that Sosanya knew about a credit card making machine and a computer that contained the numbers. The District Court concluded that, as part of the relevant conduct concerning the conspiracy, it was reasonably foreseeable by Sosanya that the Doctor and Mbamali would produce the counterfeit credit cards in furtherance of the bank fraud scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">We conclude that the District Court appropriately considered the production of counterfeit credit cards, regardless of whether Sosanya actually took part in their production. Although \u201cthe scope of the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant ... is not necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy,\u201d conduct is relevant conduct if it is within the scope of the \u201ccriminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly undertake\u201d and is \u201creasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, Application Note 2. The bank fraud scheme that Sosanya agreed to jointly undertake could not be accomplished without the production of the counterfeit credit cards. It was, therefore, reasonably foreseeable to Sosanya that the counterfeit credit cards needed to be produced in order to accomplish this scheme. The District did not commit clear error in finding that the cards were produced after Sosanya joined the scheme. Therefore, the District Court properly applied \u00a7 2F1.1 to enhance Sosanya\u2019s offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of sentence of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
