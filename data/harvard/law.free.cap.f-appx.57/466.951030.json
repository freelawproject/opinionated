A one-count indictment charged Appellant with illegally reentering the United States after having been deported following conviction for an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). At the time of his conviction on this charge, Appellant was incarcerated on a state court conviction. Prior to and during sentencing in district court, Appellant sought a downward departure under Section 5K2.0 of the Sentencing Guidelines based on pre-writ and pre-indictment government delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-17\">The district court declined to downwardly depart, but instead imposed a 30-month term of imprisonment \u2014 a sentence lying at the low end of the applicable range. A post-sentence dialogue ensued regarding the issue of confinement credit. The district court expressed uncertainty over Appellant\u2019s entitlement to confinement credit noting, however, that it was an issue \u201cwithin the province of the Bureau of Prisons,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>not the sentencing court. At no time did the district court convey reluctance about its sentence, express uncertainty about its departure authority, or evince an intent to depart in light of its developing doubts about Appellant\u2019s entitlement to confinement credit. Appellant maintains that the district court misapplied the Guidelines when it declined to downwardly depart and misapprehended its departure authority because it <em>may </em>have assumed that Appellant would receive confinement credit from the Bureau of Prisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">A district court\u2019s decision not to depart downward is not reviewable except where there is an illegal sentence, a misapplication of the Sentencing Guidelines, or a clear misapprehension of departure authority, <em>United States v. Kalust, </em>249 F.3d 106, 110 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom., </em>534 U.S. 894, 122 S.Ct. 213, 151 L.Ed.2d 152 (2001), none of which are present here. Under certain circumstances, Section 5K2.0 of the Guidelines may be utilized as a \u201csentence compensator,\u201d <em>see, e.g., United States v. Montez-Gaviria, </em>163 F.3d 697, 702 (2d Cir.1998), or a \u201csentence equalizer,\u201d <em>United States v. Los Santos, </em>283 F.3d 422, 428 (2d Cir.2002), in granting a downward departure. In this analysis, courts must be ever mindful of the \u201cordinary accidents of acceleration and delay\u201d inherent in the criminal justice process. <em>See United States v. Acevedo, </em>229 F.3d 350, 356 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1027, 121 S.Ct. 602, 148 L.Ed.2d 514 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">We find nothing to suggest that the sentence imposed was illegal. Nor do we find that the district court misapplied the Guidelines or misapprehended its departure authority thereunder. Nothing in <em>Montez-Gaviria </em>or <em>Los Santos </em>mandates a departure given the facts and circumstances of this case and the district court\u2019s denial of a departure was a proper exercise of its sentencing discretion. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision not to downwardly depart is not reviewable and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
