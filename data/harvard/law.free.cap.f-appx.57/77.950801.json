Debevoise, Senior Judge, United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b114-17\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b114-18\">RENDELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b114-19\">Appellants (collectively referred to as \u201cRed Lion\u201d) seek review of orders of the Magistrate Judge granting the motions of Appellees (collectively referred to as \u201cState Farm\u201d) for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) and for leave to file a second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-20\">Normally, a court of appeals only has jurisdiction over appeals of \u201cfinal orders.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The Magistrate\u2019s order under Rule 60(b) was not a final order, but rather, was an interlocutory one. <em>See Parks v. Collins, </em>761 F.2d 1101, 1104 (5th Cir.1985) (Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)). As in this case, \u201c[w]hen an order granting Rule 60(b) motion merely vacates the judgment and leaves the case pending for further determination, the order is akin to an order granting a new trial and in most instances, is interlocutory and nonappealable.\u201d <em>National Passenger Railroad Corp. v. Maylie, </em>910 F.2d 1181, 1183 (3d Cir.1990) (citations omitted). Likewise, the Magistrate\u2019s order granting State Farm leave to file a second amended complaint was interlocutory. <em>Michelson v. Citicorp Nat\u2019l Servs., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 508, 512 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-21\">A party may appeal non-final \u2014 or, \u201cinterlocutory\u201d orders \u2014 under certain circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>stances. Most of these circumstances are outlined in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292. Here, none of these circumstances apply. Red Lion, nevertheless, argues that the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order is appealable for two reasons: (1) the order was not in her power to make \u2014 i.e., it was ultra vires \u2014 and (2) the District Court has failed to review its objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order. We find these arguments unavailing. Even if it were true that the Magistrate Judge\u2019s actions were ultra vires and that the District Court was derelict, we do not see \u2014 and appellants have failed show\u2014 how our jurisdiction is triggered. The District Court clearly has retained jurisdiction over the matter, which has not yet come to a conclusion. When the Court has finally disposed of the matter, Red Lion may appeal and raise the arguments it has presented to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeals for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
