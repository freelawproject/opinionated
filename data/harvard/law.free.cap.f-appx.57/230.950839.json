This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-19\">Following a jury trial in 1990. Burt was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, aiding and abetting the use and carrying of machine guns during drug trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 924(c), using and carrying non-machine gun firearms during drug trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), aiding and abetting the unlawful possession of unregistered machine gun in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Prior to sentencing, the district court vacated Burt\u2019s conviction on the \u00a7 924(c) count that did not involve machine guns. Burt was sentenced to 495 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the judgment of conviction and sentence was affirmed on appeal. <em>United States v. Sims, </em>975 F.2d 1225 (6th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-20\">In November 1992, Burt joined two of his co-defendants in filing a motion to va<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>cate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Burt then filed a second \u00a7 2255 motion. Both motions were denied in November 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In January 1995, Burt filed another \u00a7 2255 motion; it too was denied. This court affirmed the denial of this motion. <em>Burt v. United States, </em>No. 95-1288, 1995 WL 603317 (6th Cir. Oct.12,1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In December 1996, Burt filed a fourth motion to vacate sentence. That motion was denied on June 14, 2001. This court denied a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">On June 4, 2001, Burt moved this court for permission to file a second or successive application under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. While that motion was pending Burt filed the instant petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. On November 2, 2001, this court denied Burt\u2019s motion to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">In the instant \u00a7 2241 petition, Burt, citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), claimed that his convictions and sentences were invalid because the jury was not properly instructed with respect to the charges related to the machine gun. The district court dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition, Reconsideration was denied. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s judgment dismissing a habeas corpus petition. <em>Charles v. Chandler, </em>180 F.3d 753, 755 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Burt\u2019s petition. As a general rule, a petitioner challenging the legality of a sentence must bring his claim under \u00a7 2255 in the sentencing court, while a petitioner challenging the execution or manner in which the sentence is served may bring a claim under \u00a7 2241 in the court having jurisdiction over the prisoner\u2019s custodian, <em>United States v. Peterman, </em>249 F.3d 458, 461 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1008, 122 S.Ct. 493, 151 L.Ed.2d 404 (2001): <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 755-56. However, a federal prisoner may challenge his conviction and the imposition of a sentence under \u00a7 2241, instead of \u00a7 2255, if he is able to establish that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (last clause in fifth paragraph); <em>United States v. Hayman, </em>342 U.S. 205, 223, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952); <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 755-56. For example, a prisoner who can show that an intervening change in the law establishes his actual innocence can invoke the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 and proceed under \u00a7 2241. <em>Peterman, </em>249 F.3d at 461-62; <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 757. The prisoner has the burden of proving that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">Burt\u2019s claim constitutes a challenge to the legality of his sentence, and he did not establish that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. See <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 756. His claim does not involve an intervening change in the law that establishes his actual innocence. See <em>Pe-terman, </em>249 F.3d at 461-62; <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 757. Burt\u2019s reliance on <em>Apprendi </em>does not help him. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490. Although the Supreme Court announced a new rule of constitutional law in <em>Apprendi, </em>the rule has not been made retroactive to cases on collateral review. See <em>In re Clemmons, </em>259 F.3d 489, 491-92 (6th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Burt did not prove that he was entitled to proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Accordingly, the motion for in forma pauperis is granted for the limited purpose of deciding the merits of this appeal, and the district court\u2019s order is affirmed.
