Ford, Sr. applied for supplemental security income (\u201cSSI\u201d) benefits on September 28, 1997, alleging disability since December 31, 1995, due to mood swings, irritability, depression, and sleeplessness caused by bipolar disorder. In its Notice of Disapproved Claim dated January 9, 1998, the Social Security Administration (the \u201cSSA\u201d) informed Mr. Ford of its determination that he was not disabled. Ford then filed a Request for Reconsideration. The SSA thereafter affirmed its previous determination in its Notice of Reconsideration dated March 17, 1998. At Ford\u2019s request, an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held a hearing on his denial, at which Ford, his ex-wife, and a vocational expert, William H. Reed, Ph.D., testified. The ALJ concluded in his April 29, 1999 decision that Ford was ineligible for SSI benefits. On December 8, 2000, the SSA\u2019s Appeals Council denied Ford\u2019s subsequent request for review, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Ford initiated a civil action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision in the District Court. Both Ford and the Commissioner moved for summary judgment. The District Court denied Ford\u2019s motion and granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion. <em>Ford v. Massanari, </em>No. 01-cv-237 (W.D. Pa. June 7, 2002). This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because the Commissioner\u2019s final decision was supported by substantial evidence, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">Our review of Social Security appeals is limited to determining whether the Commissioner\u2019s final decision was supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (\u201cThe findings of the Commissioner of Social Security as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.\u201d). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla,\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (citation omitted); however, it is not \u201ca large or significant amount of evidence, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Social Security regulations prescribe a five-part test for evaluating a claim for SSI benefits. First, an applicant is required to establish that he is not working, or, if he is working, that he is not performing \u201csubstantial gainful activity.\u201d If the applicant meets that requirement, he is then required to show that he has an \u201cimpairment or combination of impairments which significantly limits [his] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\u201d If the applicant satisfies those first two requirements and also has \u201can impairment(s) which meets the duration requirement and is listed in appendix 1 [i.e., 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1; hereinafter, the \u2018Appendix\u2019] or is equal to a listed impairments),\u201d then he is deemed disabled without consideration of age, education, or work experience. If the applicant cannot make the showing detailed in the third part of the test, but nonetheless satisfies the requirements of the first two parts of the test, he then needs to show that his impairments prevent him from doing his past relevant work. If the applicant satisfies that fourth part of the test, then the burden shifts to the Commissioner to prove that the applicant can perform other work in the national economy. If the Commissioner is unable to provide such proof, then the fifth part of the test is satisfied and the applicant is considered to be disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>In the present case, Ford did meet the first two requirements of the test, but failed to meet the third or fourth. The record shows that the ALJ considered the opinions and assessments of all treating, examining, and evaluating medical sources of record, including those of Ford\u2019s treating psychiatrist, John Brooks, M.D. The ALJ found that, although Ford had not \u201cengaged in substantial gainful activity at any time since the alleged onset of his disability,\u201d and had provided evidence supporting a finding of his having \u201cbipolar affective disorder,\u201d a \u201csevere impairment\u201d as defined in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1521 and 406.921, he nonetheless failed to show that his impairment either met or was equivalent in severity to the criteria of any impairment listed in the Appendix. The ALJ found, moreover, that Ford retained the residual functional capacity to return to the work he had performed in the past as a stocker-cleaner. The ALJ concluded, therefore, that Ford was not under a disability, \u201cas that term is defined in the Social Security Act and regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">On appeal, Ford argues, first, that the ALJ failed to evaluate properly whether Ford\u2019s impairment met or equaled the listing for affective disorder at \u00a7 12.04 of the Appendix. In support of that argument, Ford asserts that the ALJ failed to apply 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d) properly, and that he \u201ccompletely discredit[ed] Dr. Brooks\u2019 opinion\u201d without articulating adequate reasons for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">Ford\u2019s argument is without substance. While the ALJ is to give a treating physician\u2019s opinion controlling weight if it \u201cis well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic tech-\u00f1iques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the] case record,\u201d 20 C.F.R. 404.1527(d)(2) (2002), an ALJ may reject the opinion of a treating physician if it is \u201ceonclusory and unsupported by the medical evidence.\u201d <em>Jones v. Sullivan, </em>954 F.2d 125, 129 (3d Cir.1991). In the present case, the record reflects that the ALJ reviewed the evaluations that Ford alleges were given insufficient weight, and found that those from March 1999 were indeed both eonclusory and \u201cnot supported by other objective evidence of record,\u201d and were \u201cbased on the claimant\u2019s own subjective estimation of his limitations and not specifically tied to the psychiatrist\u2019s or the therapist\u2019s own clinical observations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">Whether Ford was \u201cdisabled\u201d as that term is used in the Social Security Act is a legal conclusion reserved to the Commissioner or his delegate. The ALJ thus correctly stated that Brooks\u2019 and Duncan\u2019s opinions that Ford was disabled were not binding on him. Moreover, we agree with the District Court that, if the ALJ committed any error by failing to credit Brooks\u2019 and Duncan\u2019s opinions with regard to whether Ford\u2019s condition met the requirements of the listed elements, that error was harmless because the record clearly reflects that the discredited evidence was inconsistent with the remainder of the medical evidence generated by Ford\u2019s treating physicians at the Irene Stacy Mental Health Center, where Ford had been regularly treated; the observations of the state agency physicians and psychologists who reviewed Ford\u2019s medical records; and even Brooks own earlier reports.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>In view of the inconsistencies in the record, we conclude that the ALJ did not err by discrediting Brooks\u2019 conflicting opinion. Furthermore, the balance of the record provides substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s findings that Ford had only slight restriction of activities of daily living, had moderate difficulties in maintaining social functioning, often had difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace, and never had episodes of decompensation of extended duration. Based on those findings, it appears that only the third of the \u201cresults\u201d required by \u00a7 12.04 of Appendix 1 was present,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and therefore we conclude that substantial evidence also supports the ALJ\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Ford was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Ford also asserts that the ALJ erred by failing to consult with a medical expert regarding his residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) and whether he met the requirements of the listing. Contrary to Ford\u2019s assertion, however, the record clearly indicates that Ford\u2019s medical records from 1995 to 1997 were reviewed first by physician Jay Newberg, M.D., and psychologists Sharon Becker Tarter, Ph.D., and Roger Glover, Ph.D., in 1997; and then by physician K. Loe Le, M.D., and psychologist Raymond F. Dalton, Ph.D., in 1998. The record also reflects that the ALJ reviewed not only the reports of those professionals, but also subsequent reports prepared by Brooks and Duncan. The ALJ\u2019s decision to give reduced weight to Brooks\u2019 and Duncan\u2019s March 1999 letter and forms, as discussed above, does not negate his reliance on the remainder of the record. The record contains substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s finding that Ford retained the RFC to perform jobs that entailed simple, routine, one- or two-step tasks, but not work entailing handling more than occasional contact with co-workers, supervisors, or the public, or work that is unstable or requires significant or frequent decision making. Substantial evidence thus supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Ford had not met his burden of showing that he could not perform his past relevant work as a stocker-cleaner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">Finally, Ford argues that the ALJ erred by failing to make proper credibility findings as to the witnesses\u2019 testimony at the hearing. We disagree, observing that the ALJ did, in fact, articulate his reasons for his negative credibility findings. The ALJ found, for example, that \u201cFord\u2019s statements concerning his impairment and its impact on his ability to work are not entirely credible,\u201d because his work history was \u201ctoo sporadic to allow for a reasonable presumption that he is motivated to work and would in fact be working if it were not for the effects of his impairment. The record ... shows erratic earnings for a period that predates the onset of the claimant\u2019s affective disorder, as documented in the medical evidence.\u201d The ALJ also found that Ford\u2019s testimony regarding side effects of his medications did not entirely comport with his reports to his physicians. With regard to the testimony of Ford\u2019s ex-wife, the ALJ found that \u201c[tjestimony received from the claimant\u2019s wife is also somewhat suspect, as she has custody of their minor child and therefore retains a financial interest in the claimant receiving a disability income.\u201d On the basis of these statements, we find no error in the ALJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>discounting of the weight of Ford\u2019s and his ex-wife\u2019s testimony. We agree with the District Court that the ALJ\u2019s discussion of his reasons for not accepting the witnesses\u2019 testimony at face value, although brief, was clear and sufficiently detailed to permit effective review of his conclusions. <em>Ford, </em>slip op. at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">We have considered Ford\u2019s other arguments and do not find them persuasive. Because we find that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s denial of SSI benefits to Ford, we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">. For example, as pointed out by the District Court, Brooks' discredited March 1999 report \"does not explain what might have happened to warrant a dramatic change in the perceived severity of Ford's condition [relative to Brooks\u2019 February 1999 examination report]. It does not refer to any new clinical data, anecdotal evidence or tests. In fact, it appears that Dr. Brooks did not meet with or reassess Ford between the time of his relatively positive February consultation and the March report.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>slip op. at 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">.
