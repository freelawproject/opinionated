We review the district court\u2019s implementation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, <em>United States v. Webster, </em>108 F.3d 1156, 1158 (9th Cir.1997), the application of the Sentencing Guidelines to a particular case for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Leon-Reyes, </em>177 F.3d 816, 824 (9th Cir. 1999), and factual findings in the sentencing phase for clear error, <em>United States v. Ladum, </em>141 F.3d 1328,1344 (9th Cir.1998). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-24\">Thomas contends that the district court incorrectly calculated the amount of loss from his counterfeiting activities to be between $20,000 and $40,000, and, as a result, improperly applied a four-level increase in his offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2B5.1(a), 2F1.1(D) <em>&amp; </em>(E) (2000). The district court\u2019s finding that Thomas was the source of $32,400.00 bearing the same serial numbers and made using the same method was not clearly erroneous, as it was based on relevant information with sufficient indicia of reliability. <em>See United States v. Alonso, </em>48 F.3d 1536, 1546 (9th Cir.1995) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-25\">Thomas also contends he incorrectly received a four-level upward adjustment to his offense level for being the leader or organizer of more than five people in his criminal enterprise. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). The adjustment was appropriate because the evidence indicated Thomas received the largest compensation, formed the group, and recruited accomplices. <em>See United States v. Govan, </em>152 F.3d 1088, 1096 (9th Cir.1998); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b803-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
