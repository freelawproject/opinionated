Hall began supervised release in June 2001. In September 2002 the court revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to 24 months imprisonment. Hall appeals this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-22\">Given Hall\u2019s admission that he committed multiple violations of his supervised release conditions, revocation was proper. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion in setting the sentence. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>180 F.3d 920, 922-23 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Grimes, </em>54 F.3d 489, 492 (8th Cir.1995) (standard of review). Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-23\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-18\">. The Honorable Gary A.
