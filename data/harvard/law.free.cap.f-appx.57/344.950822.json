We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim, <em>Berry v. Valence Tech., Inc., </em>175 F.3d 699, 706 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-16\">The district court properly dismissed the Janossys\u2019 claim that General Motors violated the bankruptcy code because, contrary to the Janossys\u2019 allegations, the hen against their leased vehicle was not discharged in their bankruptcy proceeding. <em>See Newman v. First Sec. Bank of Boze-man, </em>887 F.2d 973, 976 (9th Cir.1989) (stating that debtor\u2019s discharge from bankruptcy does not waive or affect any lien on property in existence prior to bankruptcy adjudication).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-20\">The district court properly dismissed the Janossys\u2019 due process claim because they received notice and a hearing prior to the repossession. <em>See Halverson v. Skagit County, </em>42 F.3d 1257, 1260 (9th Cir.1994) (stating that due process requires notice and hearing prior to deprivation of significant property interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-21\">The district court properly dismissed the Janossys\u2019 Fourth Amendment claim that GMAC used the police to conduct an unlawful search and seizure of their automobile because the police had probable cause. <em>See Shwarz v. United States, </em>234 F.3d 428, 434 (9th Cir.2000) (holding no Fourth Amendment violation where property seizure based on valid entry order supported by probable cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-22\">The Janossys\u2019 conclusory allegations that the district court\u2019s decision was motivated by bias and malice lack merit. <em>See Yagman v. Republic Ins., </em>987 F.2d 622, 626-27 (9th Cir.1993) (concluding that speculative assertions of invidious motive are insufficient to show judicial bias).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-23\">The Janossys\u2019 remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-24\">The Janossys\u2019 motion to file a late reply brief is granted. The clerk shall file the reply brief received on September 30, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-25\">We deny the Janossys\u2019 request to supplement the record on appeal. <em>See Smith </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b380-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
