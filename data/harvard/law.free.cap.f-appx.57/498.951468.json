On July 26, 2002, the District Court sentenced Tapasco to 108 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-18\">On appeal, Tapasco argues that the District Court erred during his sentencing proceedings by declining to reduce his base offense level by two points pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 3B1.2(b), which provides for such an adjustment if a defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-19\">An adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2(b) is only appropriate where a defendant is \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant\u201d in such a crime. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 comment (n.3(A)); <em>see also United States v. Carpenter, </em>252 F.3d 230, 235 (2d Cir.2001) (requiring that conduct be compared not just to other participants in that particular conspiracy, but to other participants in any such crime). A defendant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to a minor role adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2(b), and we review a sentencing court\u2019s finding on this matter for clear error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Castano, </em>234 F.3d 111, 113 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-20\">During his plea allocution hearing, Ta-pasco acknowledged his participation in the conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Specifically, he admitted (1) that he rented a house in Queens where he knew that drugs would be stored in exchange for a promise of $5,000, and (2) that he personally participated in the sale of one kilogram of cocaine. Based upon these facts, the District Court did not clearly err in declining to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>decrease Tapasco\u2019s base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is hereby Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
