Plaintiffs argue that Defendants\u2019 implementation of these plans violated the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1962(e)-(d), 1964. The district court granted summary judgment in Defendants\u2019 favor. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-22\">A. <em>\u201cCharge back\u201d and \u201cinstant credit\u201d plans</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-23\">We assume for the sake of this disposition, but need not and do not decide, that only some of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims as to these two plans are time-barred. Even if some claims are not barred by the statute of limitations, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>There is no evidence that Defendants intentionally misrepresented anything about either the \u201ccharge back\u201d or the \u201cinstant credit\u201d plan. The details of each plan have been disclosed. For example, Kauders stated that he mailed a copy of the commission charge-back report to each Plaintiff with Plaintiffs\u2019 paychecks.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim hinges on their allegation that Defendants represented the plans as being legal, while knowing that the plans were illegal. However, there is no admissible evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact as to Defendants\u2019 knowledge concerning the legality of the plans. Plaintiffs rely on a 1981 advice letter from their employer\u2019s lawyer to their employer, which (they contend) implies that Defendants knew that the plans adopted several years later were illegal. However, the district court correctly ruled that this document is privileged and that the privilege never has been waived. No other evidence in the record raises an inference of the knowledge alleged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">B. <em>\u201cBonus Bucks </em>\u201d <em>plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Two plaintiffs allege that they received inflated 1099s as a result of their participation in the \u201cBonus Bucks\u201d plan. However, there is no evidence that either of them actually incurred any additional tax liability or whether, instead, they filed offsetting forms, declined to report the amount recited as income, or otherwise avoided paying taxes on these amounts. Without showing some concrete financial loss, Plaintiffs cannot state a RICO claim. <em>Forsyth v. Humana, Inc., </em>114 F.3d 1467, 1481 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">C. <em>Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">On cross-appeal, Defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying them costs. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">Defendants are the prevailing party in this action. Under Rule 54(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, costs are \u201callowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.\u201d We have held that this rule \u201ccreates a presumption in favor of awarding costs to a prevailing party.\u201d <em>Ass\u2019n of Mexican-Am. Educators v. California, </em>231 F.3d 572, 591 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc). If a district court denies costs to a prevailing party, it must give reasons explaining why the case is not ordinary and why it would be \u201cinappropriate or inequitable to award costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">The district court denied costs simply because it concluded that the RICO claims are \u201cintertwined\u201d with pendant state-law claims, which it dismissed without prejudice. However, the district court\u2019s decision to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 state-law claims does not change the fact that Defendants are fully the prevailing party in <em>this </em>federal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">On remand, the district court should reconsider whether to award costs: if not, it must explain its reasons; if so, it should consider the appropriate amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">AFFIRMED on appeal (No. 01-16561); REVERSED and REMANDED on cross-appeal (No. 01-17167). Costs on appeal No. 01-16561 are taxed against Plaintiffs-Appellants, and costs on cross-appeal No. 01-17167 are taxed against Plaintiffs-Ap-pellees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-15\">.
