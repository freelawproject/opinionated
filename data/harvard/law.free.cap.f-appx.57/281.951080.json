Hulsey brought a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action raising various constitutional and state-law claims arising from an alleged beating by certain defendants. Before entertaining defendants\u2019 motions based on the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, the Magistrate Judge conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine whether such remedies had been available to Hulsey. After the hearing, the Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal, citing numerous reasons for discrediting Hulsey\u2019s testimony about why he had been effectively prevented from complying with the prison grievance procedure. The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> conducted de novo review and adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report in its entirety. Hulsey appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-15\">Having reviewed the District Court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error, <em>see Choate v. Lockhart, </em>7 F.3d 1370, 1373 &amp; n. 1 (8th Cir. 1993), we affirm the dismissal, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (2000) (stating no \u00a7 1983 action shall be brought by inmate with respect to prison conditions until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted); <em>United States v. Womack, </em>191 F.3d 879, 885 (8th Cir.1999) (observing that a district court\u2019s credibility determination is \u201cvirtually unreviewable\u201d on appeal (citations and internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-16\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-13\">. The Honorable George Howard, Jr., United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable Jerry W. Cava-neau, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
