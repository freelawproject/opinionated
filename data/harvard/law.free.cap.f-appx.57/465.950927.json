Dearie, Judge) denying his motion to construe as a Rule 35 motion a government letter which outlines assistance provided by Persichetti in prosecuting Elvis Irizarry, a reputed member of a New Jersey crime syndicate. The district court found Appellant\u2019s motion untimely and without merit. Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal, dated March 20, 2002, was filed on April 1, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Appellant has essentially moved for a sentence reduction pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(b) on behalf of the government. Appellant\u2019s principal argument is that the government falsely represented that it would move for a Rule 35(b) sentence reduction in exchange for his assistance during the <em>Irizarry </em>trial. We note that there is no evidence, other than Appellant\u2019s unsupported allegations, that the government made any such representations and, on the contrary, the evidence tends to establish that the government made clear it was <em>not </em>promising a quid pro quo for Appellant\u2019s assistance. Nonetheless, in dismissing the motion on timeliness grounds, the district court\u2019s order, on its face, appears to presume that a Rule 35(b) motion had been otherwise properly filed by Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Assuming, without deciding, that Appellant properly filed a Rule 35(b) motion which the district court denied, our appellate jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 permits review only to the extent that we ordinarily could review a district court\u2019s sentencing decision. <em>See United States v. Doe, </em>93 F.3d 67, 68 (2d Cir.1996) (per curiam). Regarding sentence modifications or denials thereof, we review only for purposes of determining whether the district court\u2019s decision is illegal or results from a misapplication of the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Lawal, </em>17 F.3d 560, 562 (2d Cir.1994). Because Appellant alleges neither on appeal, his appeal does not fall within the limited jurisdiction conferred by Section 3742. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
