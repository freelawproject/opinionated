For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>On November 15, 2001, Pondexter filed a lawsuit against the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) and the Allegheny County Housing Authority (\u201cACHA\u201d) in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. On June 6, 2002, the District Court granted HUD\u2019s motion to dismiss, and ordered ACHA to answer. On September 13, 2006, the District Court granted ACHA leave to file a motion for summary judgment, which the District Court granted on September 4, 2007. Pondexter unsuccessfully sought reconsideration of that order and then appealed. His appeal is currently pending before this Court at C.A. No. 07-4431.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Mandamus is a drastic remedy that is available only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>See In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005). It is not a substitute for an appeal. <em>In re Chambers Dev. Co., </em>148 F.3d 214, 226 (3d Cir.1998) (\u201c[Mjandamus is not a substitute for appeal and a writ of mandamus will not be granted if relief can be obtained by way of our appellate jurisdiction.\u201d). As Pondexter\u2019s appeal of the District Court\u2019s orders is currently pending before this Court, he has not demonstrated that he is entitled to mandamus relief. According, we will deny his mandamus petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
