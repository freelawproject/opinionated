Mar. 31, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A71 499 609 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 22, 2006) and No. A71 499 609 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 24, 2002). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect our ultimate conclusion. <em>Jigme Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008). However, we accord <em>Chevron </em>deference to the BIA\u2019s construction of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). <em>See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 424, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999) (citing <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-14\">Upon review of the administrative record, we find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Indeed, in finding Tang not credible, the agency appropriately relied, in part, on the discrepancy between Tang\u2019s submission of an abortion certificate that she claimed to have received following her allegedly forced abortion, and a U.S. Department of State report indicating that such certificates are issued only for voluntary abortions. <em>See Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 263 (2d Cir.2007)(citing <em>Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 400 (2d Cir.2006)). Moreover, the agency reasonably relied, in part, on Tang\u2019s submission of false documents in support of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>petition for alien fianc\u00e9e, particularly where the record indicates that she was not fleeing persecution at the time of that petition. <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 170 (2d Cir.2007). The IJ also reasonably relied on Tang\u2019s omission from her original asylum application of her claim that she had been forced to have an abortion. <em>See Cheng Tong Wang v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 451, 453 (2d Cir.2006). Based on these proper findings, no error asserted by Tang would induce us to disturb the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 335 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Accordingly, the agency\u2019s denial of Tang\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief based on her claim of past persecution was proper. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Moreover, Tang has waived any challenge to the agency\u2019s decision insofar as it denied her application for relief based on her claimed fear of future persecution on account of the birth of her U.S. citizen children or based on her illegal departure from China. <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Finally, we find that the agency did not err in concluding that Tang was ineligible to adjust her status, where the person who filed the petition supporting her marriage-based application for adjustment of status is not the same person who petitioned for the fianc\u00e9e visa with which she entered the United States. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 245(d); <em>see also Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
