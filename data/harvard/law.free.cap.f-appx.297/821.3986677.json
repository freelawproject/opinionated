McCONNELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Mr. Elvin Clifford Watkins pled guilty to the charge of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and was sentenced to fifty-seven months imprisonment. He appeals that sentence on two grounds. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">I. Objection to the Quantity of Drugs Relied upon at Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">Mr. Watkins\u2019s sentence was based, in part, on the district court\u2019s finding that he possessed 188.7 pounds, or more than 80 kilograms, of marijuana. Mr. Watkins claims that he possessed only 170 pounds and that his guilty plea was based on that quantity. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the offense level for this crime is two levels higher if he possessed the larger quantity than if the drugs weighed only 170 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-14\">The district court\u2019s determination of drug quantity was based on a finding by the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (\u201cOSBI\u201d) and adopted in the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) that the drugs found in Mr. Watkins\u2019s possession weighed 188.7 pounds. During a hearing on a defense motion to suppress the drugs, however, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper who had seized the drugs testified that he thought the contraband weighed \u201capproximately 170 pounds.\u201d Mr. Watkins objected to the drug quantity finding in the PSR, but presented no evidence to the contrary. The OSBI prepared a second report, again finding that the drugs weighed more than 80 kilograms, which was consistent with the finding that the drugs and packaging weighed 188.7 pounds. The district court found the drugs weighed the higher amount and sentenced Mr. Watkins accordingly. That finding is supported by the evidence, and was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-15\">Mr. Watkins\u2019s first argument is that the sentencing judge improperly relied on the higher quantity of drugs stated in the PSR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>and not on the amount estimated by the trooper during the evidentiary hearing, which occurred before he decided to plead guilty. At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel claimed his client had agreed to plead guilty because of his understanding that his sentence would be calculated based on his possession of 170 pounds of marijuana, and it would be improper for the court to rely on a greater quantity of drugs at sentencing. Counsel argued, \u201cIt ain\u2019t fair. And that is my objection. It\u2019s not right. Because we did plea pursuant to that 170 pounds, not over 80 kilograms, and it\u2019s not right.\u201d Tr. Of Sent. Hr. at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Mr. Watkins presents no record evidence that a term of his oral plea agreement or a stipulation between the parties established that the marijuana seized weighed only 170 pounds. His plea agreement was not in writing. While Mr. Watkins may have relied on the trooper\u2019s testimony that the marijuana weighed \u201capproximately 170 pounds,\u201d the parties did not stipulate to this amount. In fact, when Mr. Watkins changed his plea to guilty, he waived his right to have the jury determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, facts used to enhance his sentence and consented to having the sentencing judge determine those facts, which indicates that he understood that the drug quantity would be determined by the judge, based on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Even if Mr. Watkins could establish that there had been a stipulation of drug quantity, as a matter of law the district court was not bound by that agreement. While \u201cthe district court should consider the stipulated facts carefully, \u2018the court is not bound by the stipulation, but may with the aid of the presentence report, determine the facts relevant to sentencing.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Rutter, </em>897 F.2d 1558, 1564 (10th Cir.1990) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6B1.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">In <em>Rutter, </em>the parties had stipulated as part of a plea agreement in a drug possession case that the base offense level was twenty-six. The trial court, however, found that the offense level should be increased two levels because of the amount of drugs the defendant had in his possession. The defendant argued he did not plead guilty to that amount of drugs, and he had stipulated to a particular offense level. We held that \u201cin a drug distribution case, quantities and types of drugs not specified in the count of conviction are to be included in determining the offense level if part of the same course of conduct\u201d resulting in the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 1561. Thus, even if the parties here had stipulated that the drugs weighed 170 pounds, the district court was permitted to rely on the evidence in determining the appropriate offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">II. Objection to the Obstruction of Justice Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">The sentencing judge also enhanced Mr. Watkins\u2019s base offense level by two points for \u201cobstruction of justice.\u201d The PSR stated that Mr. Watkins \u201cpurposely and willfully attempted to mislead\u201d a pretrial services officer who interviewed him for purposes of preparing a bail report. Mr. Watkins had told the officer that he had never been arrested for any crime, when in fact \u201crecords checks revealed the defendant had multiple previous arrests\u201d and served a nine year prison sentence for a rape conviction. PSR, If 14; Tr. Sent. Hr. at 25. Accordingly, the PSR recommended an enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Mr. Watkins objected to the enhancement, and now characterizes the statement in the PSR as an \u201cipse dixit assertion\u201d not supported by any evidence admitted at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Although the district court may rely on facts in the PSR, if the defendant objects to a particular fact in the report, \u201cthe government must prove that fact at a sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>tencing hearing by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Shinault, </em>147 F.3d 1266, 1278 (10th Cir.1998). \u201cCriminal Procedure Rule 32 requires the defendant to affirmatively point out any fact in the PSR that he contends is inaccurate. Absent an objection to the PSR, the district court \u2018may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact.\u2019 Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(A).\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>447 F.3d 1300, 1306 (10th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Avalos, </em>506 F.3d 972, 979-80 (10th Cir.2007) (noting that \u201ca defendant must make a showing that the information in the PSR is unreliable and articulate the reasons why the facts contained therein are untrue or inaccurate\u201d (quotation marks, alterations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Mr. Watkins objected to the PSR\u2019s recommendation of an enhancement based on his false statements to the pretrial services officer, but he did not do so on the ground that the PSR was factually incorrect. His objection stated: \u201cThe defendant objects to paragraph 14 of the report and the resulting enhancement with regard to the alleged obstruction of justice. Counsel believes that since counsel was not present during the interview, the enhancement for said conversation is inappropriate.\u201d In other words, he did not challenge the factual allegation that he lied to the officer, but instead made a legal argument that his sentence should not be enhanced on the basis of this incident because he was without counsel at the time of the interview. Accordingly, the district court was entitled to rely on the evidence of the PSR. <em>See United States v. Chee, </em>514 F.3d 1106, 1114-15 (10th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Overholt, </em>307 F.3d 1231, 1251-52 (10th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Kay, </em>961 F.2d 1505, 1507 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">As to the legal argument based on absence of counsel, the government presented a form signed by Mr. Watkins, acknowledging his right to counsel and his decision to speak with the officer without counsel present. In light of this waiver, Mr. Watkins cannot now complain that he acted without the advice of his attorney. Indeed, Mr. Watkins even admits in his brief that \u201cthere was support for the court\u2019s determination that Mr. Watkins waived his right to have a lawyer present when he spoke with a pretrial services officer.\u201d Accordingly, the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice was properly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Even if the government did establish that Mr. Watkins had provided false information to the pretrial services officer, Mr. Watkins argues that any enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 is unwarranted. This provision provides for a two-level offense increase if: \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The application note for this provision states that the enhancement would be appropriate for \u201cproviding materially false information to a probation officer in respect to a presentence or other investigation for the court.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 Application Note(4)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">Mr. Watkins argues that the information he provided was not materially false because no \u201cpretrial services officer would rely on a defendant/appellant\u2019s statement as to his criminal record when they have, at their fingertips, instant access to criminal records nation wide.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 13. While a pretrial services officer likely would conduct an independent search for a defendant\u2019s prior convictions, this does not make the false statement regarding those convictions immaterial. The application notes define \u201cmaterial\u201d as information that <em>\u201cif believed, </em>would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 Application Note (6) (em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>phasis added). Had the pretrial services officer not conducted his own investigation and instead believed that Mr. Watkins had no criminal history, the false statement would have affected Mr. Watkins\u2019s sentencing and possibly his suitability for bond. Thus, not surprisingly, this Court has held that statements made to pretrial services officers for purposes of obtaining pretrial release may warrant an obstruction of justice enhancement. <em>See United States v. Gilbert, </em>48 F.3d 1233 (Table), 1995 WL 94455 at *2 (10th Cir. Feb.28, 1995) (unpublished). Similarly, other courts have held that providing false information to pretrial services officers conducting a bail investigation for the court warranted an obstruction of justice enhancement. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ojo, </em>916 F.2d 388, 393 (7th Cir.1990). Accordingly, we uphold the decision of the district court to enhance Mr. Watkins\u2019s sentence by two levels for the obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Mr. Watkins\u2019s sentence of fifty-seven months is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b848-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
