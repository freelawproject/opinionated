Kim-brough appeals her 24-month sentence for thirteen counts of making, uttering, or producing a forged security of an organization, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a). After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">Kimbrough worked as a bookkeeper at Association Management Sources, Inc. (\u201cAMS\u201d), which managed ten private associations and about twenty-five bank accounts those associations operated. Over a two-year period, Kimbrough forged eighty-five unauthorized checks and embezzled $183,851.94 from AMS. The checks bore the stamped signature of AMS\u2019s owner, Susan Cabrera, even though the signature stamp was to be used only in emergencies. The unauthorized checks, ranging from $500 to $3,500, were deposited into Kimbrough\u2019s personal bank account. Further investigation by a certified public accountant revealed that Kimbrough had moved money between AMS\u2019s client accounts and AMS\u2019s main account to conceal her activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">Following her arrest, Kimbrough admitted to forging the cheeks and depositing them in her account. She also related that she deleted checks from the computer after they were printed and would reconcile AM S\u2019s records to cover the fraudulent checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">Kimbrough\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended, <em>inter alia, </em>a two-level increase in Kimbrough\u2019s offense level, pursuant . to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B 1.1(b)(9)(C), because the offense involved sophisticated means. Specifically, the PSI stated that, although Kimbrough\u2019s fraud scheme was not sophisticated in nature, Kimbrough \u201cused elaborate means to fraudulently conceal the offense.\u201d Kim-brough objected to the sophisticated means enhancement, arguing that her offense was a \u201cgarden variety\u201d embezzlement scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">At the sentencing hearing, Kimbrough testified that she would write a check to herself by entering an amount into a computer software program, QuiekBooks, print out the check, and then delete the entry. In order to hide the transaction from the bank statements, Kimbrough would make fictitious entries in QuiekBooks or write fictitious checks made payable to AMS from sources she fabricated. Kimbrough also two or three times transferred funds from one of AMS\u2019s client\u2019s accounts to AMS\u2019s primary account.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-13\">Cabrera, AMS\u2019s owner, also testified at the hearing. Cabrera explained that Kim-brough entered some of the transactions into different tax years in QuiekBooks, such that they could not be detected, and, to uncover the full extent of Kimbrough\u2019s fraud, Cabrera had to hire a forensic accountant, a tax accountant and a CPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-14\">The district court overruled Kim-brough\u2019s objection to the sophisticated means enhancement, concluding that the offense was not a \u201cgarden variety\u201d embezzlement. The district court explained that \u201c[wjhile each step in the defendant\u2019s crime was not sophisticated, the total scheme involved more than minimal planning, and it was sophisticated.\u201d The district court noted that even if it had sustained Kim-brough\u2019s objection, it would have imposed the same sentence as a variance from the guidelines \u201cto reflect the extended duration of the offense, the complexity and level of deceit involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b987-15\">With a total offense level of 15 and a criminal history category of I, Kim-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>brough\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 18 to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment. After considering the factors in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court imposed a 24-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">On appeal, Kimbrough argues that the district court erred in applying the sophisticated means enhancement because her offense did not involve any particularly complicated actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Section 2B 1.1(b)(9)(C) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level if the offense involved \u201csophisticated means.\u201d The commentary defines \u201csophisticated means\u201d as:</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense. For example, in a telemarketing scheme, locating the main office of the scheme in one jurisdiction but locating soliciting operations in another jurisdiction ordinarily indicates sophisticated means. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts also ordinarily indicates sophisticated means.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 8(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">We conclude that the district court did not err in applying the two-level sophisticated means enhancement. Kimbrough\u2019s offense involved repeated fraudulent conduct occurring over an extended period of time, and, to conceal her offense, she used her specialized knowledge of her company\u2019s bookkeeping operations, created fictitious entries in the accounting software and wrote checks to her company from sources she fabricated.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">We also reject Kimbrough\u2019s claim that the district court applied the wrong standard by stating that she engaged in more than minimal planning. Although the district court mentioned that the scheme involved more than minimal planning, the district court also found that Kimbrough\u2019s offense was not ordinary embezzlement and \u201cwas sophisticated.\u201d A review of the record as a whole indicates the district court was aware of and applied the applicable \u201csophisticated means\u201d standard found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B 1.1(b)(9)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b988-10\">. In addressing a \u00a7 2B 1.1(b)(9)(C) enhancement, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and the application of the guideline provision to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Humber, </em>255 F.3d 1308, 1311 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
