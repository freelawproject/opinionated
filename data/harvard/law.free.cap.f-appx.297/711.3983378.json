We deny the petition for review because Gonzalez-Ceballos\u2019s conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony. The facts of the case are known to the parties and we do not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b738-22\">Gonzalez-Ceballos argues that the BIA erred in concluding that his Nevada state court conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We \u201chave jurisdiction to consider the limited question of whether a crime is an aggravated felony.\u201d <em>See Valencia v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1046, 1048 (9th Cir.2006). The legal question whether an offense is an aggravated felony under the INA is reviewed de novo. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>Cazarez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 905, 909 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">We apply the modified categorical approach to determine whether GonzalezCeballos was convicted of each of the elements of the generically defined crime under the INA. <em>See Martinez-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 1022, 1025-26 (9th Cir.2005). We consider the charging document (\u201cAmended Information\u201d) and the Guilty Plea Memorandum. The Guilty Plea Memorandum signed by GonzalezCeballos specifies that the offense to which he was pleading guilty is \u201cmore fully alleged in the charges filed against [him].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Read together, the Amended Information and Guilty Plea Memorandum unequivocally establish that Gonzalez-Ceballos pleaded guilty to drug trafficking and not just possession. <em>See United States v. Vidal, </em>504 F.3d 1072, 1087 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (\u201cIn order to identify a conviction as the generic offense through the modified categorical approach, when the record of conviction comprises only the indictment and the judgment, the judgment must contain the critical phrase \u2018as charged in the Information.\u2019 \u201d (internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">A state drug offense \u201cis an aggravated felony for immigration purposes only if it would be punishable as a felony under federal drug laws or the crime contains a trafficking element.\u201d <em>See Cazarez-Gutierrez, </em>382 F.3d at 912. The facts contained in the Amended Information show that Gonzalez-Ceballos \u201cretrieved the methamphetamine from\u201d another defendant and \u201cexchanged the methamphetamine for money.\u201d These actions satisfy both alternatives. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(viii) (indicating a five year minimum prison term for distribution of five grams or more of methamphetamine); <em>Rendon v. Muka-sey, </em>520 F.3d 967, 974-75 (9th Cir.2008) (defining trafficking as \u201csome sort of commercial dealing\u201d in finding that a state level drug offense qualified as an aggravated felony (quoting <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 630, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006))). We lack jurisdiction to review Gonzalez-Ceballos\u2019s final order of removal because Gonzalez-Ceballos was convicted of an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">We also lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal by reason of conviction for an offense relating to controlled substances. <em>See Cazarez-Gutierrez, </em>382 F.3d at 918. Gonzalez-Ceballos\u2019s conviction for trafficking of methamphetamine qualifies as such a criminal offense. <em>See id. </em>Review is denied because we lack jurisdiction to consider any non-jurisdictional questions. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">Petition for Review DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b738-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
