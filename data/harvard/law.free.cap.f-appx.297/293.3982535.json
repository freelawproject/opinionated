The BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Iqbal had failed to present evidence that she would be a target for persecution or torture if she returned to Pakistan. In her petition, Iqbal argues that her credible testimony and the State Department\u2019s Country Report support her claims that she has a reasonable fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">The BIA\u2019s (and IJ\u2019s) finding that Iqbal\u2019s fears were not objectively reasonable is supported by the record; the record clearly does not compel a contrary conclusion. Iqbal failed to make any showing that she suffered past persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). Additionally, Iqbal has not shown that she faces a reasonable fear of future persecution if she returns to Pakistan. <em>See id. </em>Iqbal at no time participated in any political party or function or expressed any political view. The asserted 1999 injuries to her father and 2004 injuries to her brother \u2014 which are evidenced only by Iqbal\u2019s testimony as to what her mother (or brother) told her before Iqbal left Pakistan, not by any personal observation or knowledge on Iqbal\u2019s part \u2014 do not suffice of themselves to establish Iqbal\u2019s asylum claims. <em>See Arif v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 677, 681 n. 15 (5th Cir.2007); <em>AbdelMasieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 584 (5th Cir. 1996). And Iqbal failed to reasonably explain why no corroborating evidence \u2014 such as letters or affidavits \u2014 was procured from her mother or brother despite Iqbal having remained in contact with them since she left Pakistan. Moreover, the fact that Iqbal\u2019s mother remains in Pakistan and continues working for the political party without evidence of harm or threat diminishes the reasonableness of Iqbal\u2019s fears of persecution. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 193 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">Because Iqbal has not satisfied the asylum standard, she cannot meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 186 n. 2. Iqbal\u2019s claim under the Convention Against Torture is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>also without merit, as the record does not compel a finding that Iqbal will more likely than not be tortured if she is returned to Pakistan. <em>See Bah v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 348, 352 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Iqbal\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
