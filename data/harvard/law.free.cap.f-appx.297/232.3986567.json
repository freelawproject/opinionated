Callaway, Jr., was sentenced to thirty-three months imprisonment pursuant to his guilty plea to four counts of filing false federal income tax returns, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1) (2000). He appeals, claiming that the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement for abusing a position of trust under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 3B1.3 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-24\">This court reviews de' novo a district court\u2019s legal interpretation of whether a defendant abused a position of trust under \u00a7 3B1.3, and reviews its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Ebersole, </em>411 F.3d 517, 535-36 (4th Cir.2005). Section 3B1.3 provides for a two-level increase \u201c[i]f the defendant abused a position of public or private trust, or used a special skill, in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.\u201d An adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.3 is warranted \u201cif the district court determines that [the defendant] abused a position of trust and that abuse significantly contributed to the commission or concealment of the crime.\u201d <em>Ebersole, </em>411 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>F.8d at 536 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Callaway is correct that we require the question of whether a person occupies a position of trust to be addressed from the perspective of the victim. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>29 F.3d 175, 180 (4th Cir.1994). However, we have also held that there can be multiple victims of an offense. <em>See United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 203 (4th Cir.1999). Here, although the primary victim of Callaway\u2019s offenses was the United States, his former employer, for whom he provided accounting services, was also victimized by Calla-way\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Callaway\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
