For the reasons that follow, we will summarily vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-20\">Since January 2006, Liggon-Redding has filed three separate complaints against Appellees. The District Court dismissed her first complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (M.D.Pa.06-cv-00227). Liggon-Redding appealed and that appeal is currently pending before this Court. (C.A. No. 06-1764). On May 9, 2007, Lig-gon-Redding filed a second complaint against Appellees, citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-68, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1984 (\u201cRICO\u201d), as the basis for her complaint. (M.D.Pa.07-cv-00847). Without giving Liggon-Redding an opportunity to amend, the District Court dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Liggon-Redding did not appeal. On May 23, 2007, Liggon-Redding filed a third complaint, which again alleged RICO violations. The District Court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae &amp; (ii) without giving Lig-gon-Redding an opportunity to amend. Liggon-Redding appeals and has filed a motion for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-22\">We have held that when a complaint is dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, a plaintiff should be granted the opportunity to amend her complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. <em>Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 106 (3d Cir.2002). Here, the District Court dismissed Liggon-Redding\u2019s complaint because it failed to allege prior related predicate acts, an element necessary to plead a RICO civil action. <em>See Lum v. Bank of Am. </em>361 F.3d 217, 223 (3d Cir.2004). Although the District Court also dismissed the complaint as frivolous, we cannot conclude, at this early stage, that any amendment to Liggon-Redding\u2019s complaint would be futile. Accordingly, the District Court should have granted Liggon-Red-ding an opportunity to amend her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-23\">Because this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily vacate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the District Court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. Liggon-Red-ding\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
