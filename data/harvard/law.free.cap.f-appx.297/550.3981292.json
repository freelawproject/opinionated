His counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he seeks leave to withdraw and ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>gues the district court committed plain error in sentencing Hogans.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Hogans\u2019s written plea agreement contains a waiver of the right to appeal his sentence. We enforce the waiver, because Hogans knowingly and voluntarily entered into both the plea agreement and the appeal waiver, the arguments on appeal fall within the scope of the waiver, and no injustice would result from enforcing it. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-92 (8th Cir.2003) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues for appeal beyond the scope of the appeal waiver. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal. We also grant defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and deny Hogans\u2019s pending pro se motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\">. The Honorable Henry E.
