We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-23\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 asylum application because the record does not compel the conclusion that the harms petitioners suffered rise to the level of persecution or form the basis for a well-founded fear of future persecution, either independently or cumulatively. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir.1995). Petitioners failed to establish that Sergey was arrested and beaten on account of his religious beliefs rather than for refusing to serve in the military. <em>See Abedini v. INS, </em>971 F.2d 188, 191-92 (9th Cir.1992). The remaining events constitute discrimination and harassment, but not persecution. <em>See Halaim v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 1128, 1132 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016-18 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-24\">Having failed to establish their eligibility for asylum, petitioners necessarily have failed to demonstrate that they are entitled to withholding of removal. <em>See Prasad, </em>47 F.3d at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b697-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
