Evans, a Pennsylvania state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the District Court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.O. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). For the foregoing reasons, we will vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">Evans filed in the District Court a motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauper-is </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) and apparently submitted a complaint. He also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order/preliminary injunction, together with a supporting declaration, and motions for the appointment of counsel, service by a United States Marshal, and for \u201cextraordinary relief.\u201d These motions refer to and purport to summarize Evans\u2019s complaint. The complaint itself does not appear on the docket and is not contained in the record, apparently because, as discussed below, the District Court never ruled on Evans\u2019s motion to proceed IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-16\">Evans\u2019s motion for an injunction, however, asserts three claims. First, he claims that prison officials are using an otherwise-unspecified device to \u201ctorture and rape\u201d him by, <em>inter alia, </em>sexually arousing him and reading his mind. Second, Evans claims that certain federal governmental agencies and officials have wrongfully denied his requests under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d) for, <em>inter alia, </em>a report concerning the aforementioned device prepared by an Iraqi intelligence agent. Finally, Evans alleges that prison officials or employees have confiscated and censored his incoming and outgoing mail and have opened it outside of his presence. Among the forms of relief that Evans requested was an injunction requiring prison officials to \u201c[pjrovide plaintiff with all of his privileged mail from government officials/agencies unopened ..., unread, uncensored and unconfiscated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-17\">The District Court, without ruling on Evans\u2019s motion to proceed IFP or on any of his others, dismissed this case by order entered March 25, 2008. That order reads in its entirety:</p>\n<p id=\"b110-18\">AND NOW, this 25th Day of March, 2008, it is ORDERED that the Plaintiffs case is DISMISSED pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ]1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Plaintiffs claims lack an arguable basis in law or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>fact. The Clerk is directed to mark the case filed closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Evans filed a timely notice of appeal, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The statute relied on by the District Court requires dismissal of IFP complaints that are \u201cfrivolous or malicious.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9. A complaint is \u201cfrivolous\u201d if it \u201c \u2018lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 32, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992) (citation omitted). Ordinarily, we would exercise plenary review over that issue. <em>See Roman v. Jeffes, </em>904 F.2d 192, 194 (3d Cir.1990). In this case, however, our review is hampered by the procedural posture in which the District Court dismissed Evans\u2019s complaint. \u201cWhen a complaint is accompanied by a motion to proceed [IFP], rather than by payment of a filing fee, the complaint is not docketed, and it is therefore not filed, until the motion has been granted.\u201d <em>Oatess v. Sobolevitch, </em>914 F.2d 428, 429 n. 1 (3d Cir.1990). In this case, the District Court never ruled on Evans\u2019s IFP motion, so his complaint, which was not yet subject to dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), was never docketed in the District Court and is not part of the record on appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">In an appropriate case, we might be inclined to treat a similar order as a grant of IFP status <em>sub silentio </em>and to overlook this technical defect. Such a case might have been presented if Evans\u2019s filings referred only to the \u201cdevice\u201d described above. <em>See Denton, </em>504 U.S. at 32-33, 112 S.Ct. 1728 (explaining that complaint is factually frivolous where its allegations are \u201cfanciful,\u201d \u201cfantastic,\u201d \u201cdelusional,\u201d or \u201crise to the level of the irrational or wholly incredible\u201d). Evans\u2019s filings, however, also accuse prison officials of confiscating and censoring his outgoing and incoming mail. Evans claims, for example, that prison officials confiscated mail addressed to him by the Department of Homeland Security, and he has attached supporting documentation. Thus, although we express no opinion on the matter, it appeal's that his complaint may state a potentially-actionable claim. <em>See, e.g. Jones v. Brown, </em>461 F.3d 353, 358 (3d Cir.2006) (explaining that prisoners retain their \u201cFirst Amendment right to use of the mails\u201d); <em>Nasir v. Morgan, </em>350 F.3d 366, 369-71 (3d Cir.2003) (discussing framework for analyzing prisoners\u2019 First Amendment claims regarding mail restrictions). At the very least, Evans\u2019s claim in this regard may be such that the District Court should have afforded him leave to amend his complaint before dismissing it. <em>See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, </em>515 F.3d 224, 236 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">Accordingly, we will vacate the order of the District Court and remand. On remand, the District Court should rule expressly on Evans\u2019s IFP motion. If the District Court grants Evans leave to proceed IFP (as we have), then it should apply \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and, if it again decides that dismissal without leave to amend is warranted, should explain why. Evans\u2019s motion to proceed on the original record is granted. His motion for the appointment of counsel in this Court is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
