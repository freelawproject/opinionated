(collectively \u201cMarvell\u201d), appeal from a decision of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas denying a motion to intervene for the purpose of seeking a stay of proceedings or, in the alternative, the disqualification of the law firm of Townsend and Townsend and Crew LLP (\u201cTownsend\u201d), counsel for appellee Commonwealth Scientific &amp; Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO). <em>See Microsoft Corp. v. Commonwealth Scientific and Indus. Research Org., </em>2007 WL 4376104 (E.D.Tex. Dec.13, 2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b997-19\">CSIRO, a scientific research arm of the Australian government, holds U.S. Patent No. 5,487,069 (\u201cthe '069 patent\u201d), entitled \u2018Wireless LAN.\u201d The '069 patent teaches a transceiver design for the wireless transmission of data over a local area network <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>(\u201cLAN\u201d). CSIRO claims that the '069 patent defines the operating technology used by most LAN devices worldwide. Marvell supplies semi-conductor chips to manufacturers of LAN-related products, such as notebook computers.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Townsend represents CSIRO in its efforts to enforce the '069 patent. Town-send has filed infringement claims on behalf of CSIRO against a number of LAN component manufacturers, including customers of Maxwell.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Marvell claims to have indemnity agreements with at least three customers who are parties to the <em>Microsoft </em>and <em>Toshiba </em>actions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Townsend also represents CSIRO in negotiations over the licensing of the '069 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">In February of 1999, three years before CSIRO became a client, Townsend began representing Marvell in trademark prosecutions. In late 2005, Marvell began sending patent work to Townsend. During 2006, Townsend represented Maxwell in the prosecution of four patent applications for LAN-related inventions. Sometime in early 2005, Maxwell learned that Townsend also repx\u2019esented CSIRO. In June of 2005 and February of 2006, Maxwell asked Townsend to act as an intermediary in negotiating a license from CSIRO. Townsend advised Marvell on both occasions that a license was unnecessary because CSIRO had no intention of suing LAN component manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">On March 5, 2007, Maxwell made a third inquiry of Townsend about obtaining a license from CSIRO. After considerable back-and-forth, Townsend informed Marvell that it would need a written conflict waiver before undertaking a license negotiation. Maxwell agreed to waive any prospective conflict, but not past conflicts. On March 13, 2007, Maxwell informed Townsend of the existence of the indemnity agreements. Marvell accused Townsend of violating its ethical obligations and duty of loyalty to Marvell by its continued representation of CSIRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">On March 21, 2007, Marvell filed suit against Townsend in the California state court, seeking to enjoin Townsend from representing CSIRO in the <em>Microsoft </em>and <em>Toshiba </em>actions. In May of 2007, Marvell brought a declaratory judgment action against CSIRO in the Eastern District of Texas, Case No. 6:07-CV-204-LED, seeking a judgment of non-infringement. On June 13, 2007, the California court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to enter an order disqualifying a law firm from representing a party in a federal court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-11\">On July 3, 2007, Maxwell sought permission to intexwene in the <em>Microsoft </em>and <em>Toshiba </em>actions for the limited purpose of seeking a stay of the litigation involving its customers, or in the alternative, the disqualification of Townsend.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On December 13, 2007, Judge Davis denied Marvell\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>motion to intervene as moot after discussing the merits of Marvell\u2019s motion to stay and/or disqualify (both of which Judge Davis also denied).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1). Denying a motion to intervene is a final judgment subject to appellate review. <em>See Stringfellow v. Concerned Neighbors In Action, </em>480 U.S. 370, 377, 107 S.Ct. 1177, 94 L.Ed.2d 389 (1987) (\u201c[W]hen an order prevents a putative intervenor from becoming a party in <em>any </em>respect, the order is subject to immediate review.\u201d). We need not decide whether in general in considering an appeal from the denial of a motion to intervene, we may also consider the merits of the specific underlying reason for which intervention is sought, in this case the disqualification motion. This is an unusual situation in which a district court denied a motion to intervene after rejecting the underlying disqualification motion on its merits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that the district court did not err in rejecting the motion to disqualify, and thus did not err in denying intervention.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">As the parties recognize, a motion to disqualify counsel is governed by Fifth Circuit law. <em>Picker Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Varian Assocs., Inc., </em>869 F.2d 578, 580-81 (Fed.Cir.1989). In the Fifth Circuit, motions to disqualify counsel \u201care determined by applying standards developed under federal law,\u201d and \u201cby reference to the ethical rules announced by the national profession.\u201d <em>In re Dresser Indus., Inc., </em>972 F.2d 540, 544, 543 (5th Cir.1992).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In resolving conflict issues, the Fifth Circuit looks to the American Bar Association (ABA) Model Rules. <em>See Perillo v. Johnson, </em>205 F.3d 775, 801 (5th Cir.2000); <em>In re Asbestos Litig., </em>90 F.3d 963, 977 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Beets v. Scott, </em>65 F.3d 1258, 1269-70 (5th Cir.1995). ABA Model Rule 1.7(a) states that:</p>\n<p id=\"b999-13\">[ejxcept as provided in paragraph (b), a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest. A concurrent conflict of interest exists if:</p>\n<p id=\"b999-14\">(1) the representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client; or</p>\n<p id=\"b999-15\">(2) there is significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer\u2019s responsibilities to another client, a former client or third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-16\">In his analysis, Judge Davis concluded that Marvell\u2019s motion should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>governed by the more lenient disqualification standard that applies to former as opposed to concurrent client representation. In this regard, Judge Davis credited Townsend\u2019s claim that it only became aware of the potential conflict arising from its representation of CSIRO in March of 2007 when Marvell disclosed the existence of the indemnity agreements. Upon being informed of the agreements (and after being denied a waiver), Townsend terminated its representation of Marvell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">In deciding to treat CSIRO as a former client of Townsend\u2019s, Judge Davis relied principally on comment 5 to ABA Model Rule 1.7. Comment 5 recognizes the \u201cthrust upon\u201d exception to what is colloquially termed the \u201chot potato\u201d gambit \u2014 the stratagem by which a law firm creates a conflict to rid itself of one client so as to retain another (usually more lucrative) client.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Picker, </em>869 F.2d at 582. As Judge Davis explained, \u201c[t]he \u2018thrust upon\u2019 exception applies when [as here] unforeseeable developments cause two concurrent clients to become directly adverse.\u201d <em>Microsoft, </em>2007 WL 4876104, at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">Marvell objects vehemently to Judge Davis\u2019s finding that it created the conflict in March of 2007 by disclosing to Townsend the hitherto concealed indemnity agreements. Marvell maintains that the conflict arose in September of 2006 when Townsend filed counterclaims on behalf of CSIRO in the <em>Microsoft </em>action, and was exacerbated in December of 2006 when the <em>Toshiba </em>action was filed (thereby potentially exposing Marvell to liability under the agreements).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Marvell contends that Townsend should have known of the existence of the agreements because such agreements are an \u201cindustry standard.\u201d Therefore, Marvell argues, it was incumbent on Townsend to \u201cdiscover\u201d the conflict without Marvell\u2019s assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">The argument is unpersuasive. As Judge Davis observed,</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">Marvell takes the position that it had no reason to disclose its indemnity obligations as those agreements might be used against them in licensing negotiations with CSIRO. While Marvell is free to choose which facts it does and does not disclose to counsel, Marvell cannot subsequently assert those purposefully withheld facts as a means to disqualify. This is the exact scenario Comment 5 [to ABA Model Rule 1.7] contemplates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\"><em>Microsoft, </em>2007 WL 4376104, at *7. We agree with Judge Davis that the more lenient standard of ABA Model Rule 1.9 governing conflicts involving the representation of former clients applies to Marvell\u2019s motion to disqualify.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>In cases involving former representation, a party moving for disqualification must prove that the present and former matters are so \u201csubstantially related\u201d that confidential client information may be presumed to have been disclosed or that such information was actually disclosed by counsel. <em>Am. Airlines, </em>972 F.2d at 614-15. Under the \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d test, the movant must prove: \u201c(1) an actual attorney-client relationship between [it] and the attorney [it] seeks to disqualify and (2) a substantial relationship between the subject matter of the former and present representations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614. In applying the test, courts consider three relevant factors: \u201c(1) the factual similarities between the current and former representations, (2) the similarities between the legal questions posed, and (3) the nature and extent of the attorney\u2019s involvement with the former representation.\u201d <em>Power Mosfet Techs, L.L.C. v. Siemens AG, </em>2002 WL 32785219, at *2 (E.D.Tex. Sept.30, 2002). We agree with Judge Davis that Marvell failed to meet its burden of showing a substantial relationship between the prior work done on its behalf by Townsend and the LAN-related products figuring in the <em>Microsoft </em>and <em>Toshiba </em>actions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">With respect to the disclosure of confidential client information, Marvell raises several possibilities, only one of which merits discussion. In June of 2007, Townsend undertook to recruit attorney Andrew Pratt as an associate in its Washington, D.C. office. While employed as a junior lawyer at the firm of McGuire-Woods LLP, Pratt attended a meeting on February 1, 2007, at which Marvell's strategy in dealing with the CSIRO litigation was discussed. Marvell also claims that Pratt was copied on related emails and other documents. When Townsend learned of the' conflict involving Pratt, it asked Marvell for a waiver. When Marvell refused, Townsend rescinded its job offer to Pratt who has since been given only unrelated legal work by Townsend as a home-based independent contractor. Marvell does not contradict Townsend\u2019s affidavits that Pratt has no access to Townsend\u2019s files, computer network, or telephone system, or that he has no interaction with the lawyers assigned to the CSIRO team.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We agree with Judge Davis that Townsend fully discharged its ethical obligations to Marvell by the manner in which it dealt with Pratt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">Because we find that the district court properly denied Marvell\u2019s motion to intervene, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-12\">. In May of 2005, anticipating suit by CSIRO, Microsoft and Intel Corporation filed separate declaratory judgment actions against CSIRO in the Northern District of California. In December of 2006, the actions were transferred to Judge Leonard Davis in the Eastern District of Texas. <em>See </em>Case No. 6:06-CV-549-LED <em>(\u201cMicrosoft </em>action\u201d), and Case No. 6:06-CV-551-LED <em>(\u2018\u2018Intel </em>action\u201d). In December of 2006, CSIRO asserted patent infringement claims against Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc., and ten other computer parts manufacturers. <em>See </em>Case No. 6:06-CV-550-LED <em>(\u201cToshiba </em>action\u201d). Neither Microsoft nor Intel is named as a defendant in the <em>Toshiba </em>action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b998-6\">. Townsend has represented CSIRO since 2002 in litigation and licensing matters involving the '069 patent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b998-7\">. On January 23, 2005, Marvell signed an agreement to indemnify \"Customer A\" \"in certain patent infringement claims.\" In May of 2005, Marvell and Customer A signed a forbearance agreement tolling Customer A's indemnification claims. Four days later, Customer A intervened as a plaintiff in the <em>Microsoft </em>action. On September 4, 2006, Marvell signed an indemnity agreement with \"Customer B.\u201d Three weeks later, CSIRO filed an answer and counterclaims alleging infringement of the '069 patent by Microsoft and Intel. In October of 2006, Customer A made a second tender to Marvell under the indemnity agreement. On December 22, 2006, CSI-RO filed the <em>Toshiba </em>action. One month later, Customer B made a tender to Marvell under its indemnity agreement. There are no details in the record regarding \"Customer C,\" other than a notation in Judge Davis's opinion that the identify of Customer C (as well as Customer B, but not Customer A) was disclosed by Marvell to the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b998-13\">. No customer of Marvell joined the motion; one opposed it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b999-8\"><em>. </em>Marvell sought to intervene in the alternative as a matter of right, although its motion clearly fell under the permissive intervention prong of Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(b), and was treated as such by Judge Davis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b999-9\">. Marvell also sought, in the alternative, a stay pursuant to the \"customer-suit doctrine.\" Under this doctrine, \"litigation against or brought by the manufacturer of infringing goods takes precedence over a suit by the patent owner against customers of the manufacturer.\" <em>Katz v. Lear Siegler, Inc., </em>909 F.2d 1459, 1464 (Fed.Cir.1990). The district court rejected a stay on the ground that Marvell's justification \u2014 that a stay would obviate the need to disqualify Townsend \u2014 was spurious in light of Marvell's admission that a stay would not in fact negate the issue. As Judge Davis observed, \"partially staying the case without addressing the disqualification issue would ... only prolong the issue instead of efficiently disposing of it.\" We agree with the district court's reasoning in this regard and follow its example in focusing our analysis on the motion for disqualification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b999-18\">. Since the issue has not been raised by either party, we express no view as to whether the district court properly tied the intervention motion to the merits of the disqualification motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b999-19\">. The moving party bears the burden of proving that disqualification is warranted. <em>See In re Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>972 F.2d 605, 614 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">. Comment 5 to ABA Model Rule 1.7 states that \u201c[u]nforeseeable developments, such as changes in corporate and other organizational affiliations or the addition or realignment of parties in litigation, might create conflicts in the midst of a representation, as when a company sued by the lawyer on behalf of one client is bought by another client represented by the lawyer in an unrelated matter. Depending on the circumstances, the lawyer may have the option to withdraw from one of the representations in order to avoid the conflict. The lawyer must seek court approval where necessary and take steps to minimize harm to the clients. <em>See </em>Rule 1.16. The lawyer must continue to protect the confidences of the client from whose representation the lawyer has withdrawn. <em>See </em>Rule 1.9(c).\u2019'</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1000-14\">. Marvel knew as early as 2004 of the threat of litigation over the '069 patent. Marvell participated in joint meetings convened among potential defendants to develop a common defense strategy. CSIRO filed the first of its infringement actions against Buffalo Technology (USA), Inc., in the Eastern District of Texas in February of 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1000-15\">. <em>\"A </em>party seeking to disqualify opposing counsel on the ground of a former representation must establish that: (1) an actual attorney-client relationship existed between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>moving party and the opposing counsel; (2) the present litigation involves a matter that is 'substantially related\u2019 to the subject of the movant's prior representation; and (3) the interests of the opposing counsel\u2019s present client are materially adverse to the movant.\u201d ABA Model Rule 1.9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">. Specifically, Judge Davis noted that Marvell offered no evidence \u2014 only \"broad statements\u201d \u2014 that Townsend worked on matters related to Marvell\u2019s LAN products, and gave no explanation of how Townsend\u2019s work on Marvell\u2019s LAN patent applications in 2006 could possibly relate to products that were accused in litigation begun eighteen months earlier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">. \u201cTownsend employees have been instructed not to communicate with [Pratt] regarding his limited work for Marvell or any matters pertaining to CSIRO, and he has been instructed not to talk to anyone at Townsend about such work.\u201d J.A. 632 (Herhold Decl. 114).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
