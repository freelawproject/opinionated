We dismiss her petition to the extent it rests on asylum, and deny it to the extent it pertains to withholding of removal and CAT protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Purnamawati argues that she suffered past persecution, and that the IJ erred in failing to find that she established an individualized well-founded fear of future persecution. However, she does not challenge the IJ\u2019s determination (affirmed by the BIA) that her asylum application is time-barred. For this reason, we cannot reach the merits of her petition. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Although Purnamawati also asks us to overturn the BIA\u2019s decision with respect to withholding of removal and CAT, she offers no specific and distinct argument with respect to either. Accordingly, we decline to consider these claims. <em>See Laboa v. Calderon, </em>224 F.3d 972, 981 n. 6 (9th Cir. 2000) (noting that \u201cwe will not ordinarily consider matters on appeal that are not specifically and distinctly argued in appellant\u2019s opening brief.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b694-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-9\">. Purnamawati\u2019s asylum-based arguments are unavailing for withholding of removal and CAT relief, as the standards for each are different. To qualify for withholding, an alien must show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that, if removed, her life or freedom would be threatened on account of a protected ground. <em>Fedunyak v. Gonzales, 477 </em>F.3d 1126, 1130 (9th Cir.2007). Likewise, to qualify for CAT relief the applicant must show that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.17(a). Purnamawati cites no evidence in the record that would compel a conclusion contrary to the IJ\u2019s, that she failed to meet her burden of proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
