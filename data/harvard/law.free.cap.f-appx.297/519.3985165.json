Ramsey appeals, but his appointed counsel moves to withdraw because he cannot identify any nonfrivolous argument to pursue. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Ramsey responded to counsel\u2019s request to withdraw, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), and so we confine our review to the issues outlined in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief and Ramsey\u2019s response. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">In his <em>Anders ' </em>submission, counsel first examines whether the district court properly calculated the sentence under the guidelines. He considers an argument pressed by Ramsey \u2014 namely, that an amendment to the guidelines restated the rules for determining when multiple crimes are treated as one for criminal history purposes. The amendment states that two prior convictions are counted as one if the resulting \u201csentences were imposed on the 'same day.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2)(2007); U.S.S.G., Supp. to App. C, Amendment 709 (2007). Ramsey had been sentenced on January 6, 2006 for three different felonies occurring at different times: felon in possession of a firearm (December 2003); driving while license suspended or revoked ((March 2005); and possession of cocaine (November 2005). However, the amendment did not change \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2)\u2019s directive that offenses separated by an \u201cintervening arrest\u201d are always counted separately. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2)(2007); \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) cmt. n. 3 (2006); <em>see United States v. Ellis, </em>525 F.3d 960, 965 n. 1 (10th Cir.2008). The court therefore appropriately counted his sentences separately for the reasons it gave at sentencing, and any potential argument to the contrary would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-17\">Ramsey further challenges his sentence by noting that the criminal-history category anticipated in his plea agreement (Category V) differed from that recommended by the probation officer and ultimately adopted by the court (Category VI). According to the presentence investigation report, additional criminal history points were warranted to account for Ramsey\u2019s commission of the current offense while on parole. Under the plea agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>ment, Ramsey waived all appellate rights except for the right to appeal the validity of the plea or sentence. Plea Agreement at 1118(b). The plea agreement reflected Ramsey\u2019s acknowledgment that the guidelines calculations set forth in it were preliminary and non-binding. <em>Id. </em>at 119(e). Any argument based on the prospect of a different sentence would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Counsel and Ramsey next address potential arguments regarding the reasonableness of Ramsey\u2019s sentence. Ramsey argues that recent changes to the guidelines\u2019 drug quantity table do little to alleviate the wide disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(c)(6) (revised by Amendment 706). The district court acknowledged its discretion to account for the remaining differential in sentencing, see <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 576, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and pointed out that Ramsey got the benefit of the guidelines that reduced the penalties for crack by two offense levels. The court declined to depart below the recommended guidelines sentence, because it lacked confidence that a lower sentence would deter Ramsey from continuing criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Counsel also considers whether the court properly evaluated the sentence under the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Because Ramsey\u2019s sentence is within the guideline range, we presume it to be reasonable. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>505 F.3d 785, 791 (7th Cir.2007). At sentencing, the district court did evaluate the \u00a7 3553 factors that were called to its attention. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Tockes, </em>530 F.3d 628, 632 (7th Cir.2008). For example, the court specifically explained the disparity between Ramsey\u2019s sentence and that of his codefendants, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6), attributing the difference to cooperation with police and different criminal histories. The court also considered but rejected Ramsey\u2019s argument that the guidelines sentence overstated his criminal history. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1). The court found that the guidelines calculation fairly excluded a large number of Ramsey\u2019s previous convictions and may have in fact understated his criminal history. Those excluded convictions were either outside the applicable time frame or didn\u2019t meet length or offense criteria of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c). The court also recommended that the Bureau of Prisons assign Ramsey to a facility with a comprehensive substance abuse treatment program. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). Any potential argument that the court failed to give a meaningful review would lack merit, as the court fully addressed Ramsey\u2019s arguments at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">Ramsey also argues that he lacked access to a library or legal advisors during the course of his incarceration. We note that there is no constitutional right of access to a law library when a defendant is offered the assistance of counsel. <em>United States v. Byrd, </em>208 F.3d 592, 593 (7th Cir.2000). To the extent that Ramsey\u2019s response charges his counsel with ineffective assistance, this claim is better pursued in a collateral proceeding. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>394 F.3d 543, 557-58 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">We therefore GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS Ramsey\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
