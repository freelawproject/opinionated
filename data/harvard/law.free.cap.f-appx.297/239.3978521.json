R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-26\">The district court referred Kelley\u2019s complaint to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Kelley that failure to file timely objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Kelley failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-27\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned of the consequences of noncompliance. <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir. 1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Kelley has waived appellate review by failing to timely file specific objections after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing without prejudice Kelley\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">With regard to Kelley\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See Pacific Ins. Co. v. American Nat\u2019l Fire Ins. Co., </em>148 F.3d 396, 402 (4th Cir. 1998). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Kelley\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">We also deny Kelly\u2019s motion for a transcript at government expense. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-18\"> Although Kelley did not specify whether her post-judgment \"motion for reconsideration\u201d was filed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) or 60(b), because it was filed within the ten-day limit for Rule 59(e) motions, it is treated as such. <em>See Dove v. CODESCO, </em>569 F.2d 807, 809 (4th Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
