On appeal, Ryahim unsuccessfully requested preparation of a transcript at government expense, and he has provided no justification for reconsideration of that decision. We therefore cannot review most of the evidentiary matters about which Ryahim complains involving such things as admission or exclusion of evidence, judicial bias, or the jury\u2019s verdict, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(b)(1) (discussing appellant\u2019s duty to order transcript); <em>Schmid v.
