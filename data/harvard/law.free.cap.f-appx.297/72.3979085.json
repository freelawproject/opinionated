Sept. 10, 2007)(per curiam). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>We lack jurisdiction to review Lin\u2019s challenges to the BIA\u2019s \u201centirely discretionary\u201d determination not to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen his proceedings. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006). Therefore, we dismiss the petition for review to that extent. <em>See id. </em>However, we review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of Lin\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely and based on his failure to meet his \u201cheavy burden\u201d of showing that reopening was warranted, <em>see Matter of Coelho, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 464, 472 (BIA 1992). <em>Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In the absence of a statutory or regulatory mechanism permitting a motion to reopen for adjustment of status based on a marriage entered into after removal proceedings have commenced, the BIA has held that such a motion may be granted where: (1) the motion is timely filed; (2) the motion is not numerically barred; (3) the motion is not barred on procedural grounds, in particular for failure to depart during the voluntary departure period; (4) the motion presents clear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood that the applicant\u2019s marriage is bona fide; and (5) the DHS does not oppose the motion. <em>See Matter of Velarde-Pacheco, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 253, 256 (BIA 2002). Here, it is undisputed that Lin\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the BIA appears to have denied it on that basis alone. We recently held in <em>Melnitsenko v. Mukasey, </em>517 F.3d 42 (2d Cir.2008) that the BIA \u201cexceed[s] its allowable discretion\u201d by treating as dispositive the fifth <em>Velarde-Pacheco </em>factor, that is, in denying a motion to reopen based \u201csolely on the fact that the DHS opposed the motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51. We further emphasized that the BIA must \u201cprovide sufficient explanation for its decisions in order to provide this Court a meaningful opportunity to review those decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">However, we conclude here that the BIA properly denied Lin\u2019s motion to reopen based on its untimeliness. <em>See Matter of Velarde-Pacheco, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 256. Our holding in <em>Melnitsenko </em>was based on the problematic nature of the fifth <em>Velarde-Pacheco </em>factor. <em>See Melnitsenko, </em>517 F.3d at 50-52 (observing that if the fifth factor was dispositive, \u201cthe DHS, an adversarial party in the proceeding, [could] unilaterally block a motion to reopen for any or no reason\u201d and that this would be \u201ccontrary to the purpose of the [congressional] amendment identified by the BIA\u201d in <em>Matter of Velarde-Pacheco). </em>We have never expressed any such concerns about the timeliness factor of <em>Velarde-Pacheco, </em>and, thus, we do not find that the BIA abused its discretion in denying Lin\u2019s motion to reopen based on its untimeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part. Having completed our review, we dismiss Lin\u2019s motion for a stay as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-6\">. With limited exceptions, a party may file only one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Here, the IJ issued his final order of removal in April 1999 and Lin did not file the instant motion to reopen until October 2006. Accordingly, the BIA properly found that Lin\u2019s motion was untimely. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
