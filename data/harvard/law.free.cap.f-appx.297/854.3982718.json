Jeremiah alleged that Georgia state officials violated his rights under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (\u201cVCCR\u201d) when they arrested him in March 1998 because they failed to inform him of his right to contact Jamaican consular offices regarding his arrest. He further alleged that he was incarcerated based on an arbitrary and capricious conviction. The district court dismissed Jeremiah\u2019s complaint <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-22\">On appeal, Jeremiah argues that: (1) the district court wrongly applied 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A in dismissing his complaint; (2) the VCCR confers enforceable individual rights; (3) his \u00a7 1983 claim based on the VCCR is not time barred; and, (4) the district court erred by not providing him with an opportunity to amend his complaint before dismissing it. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-23\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b880-24\">We address the procedural issues before turning to the merits of Jeremiah\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-26\">Jeremiah has not raised any argument on appeal regarding his claim that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>incarcerated pursuant to an arbitrary and capricious conviction. Consequently, we deem any argument relating to this claim to be abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Jeremiah argues that the district court erroneously dismissed his complaint because he fully paid the filing fee and is thus not proceeding <em>in forma pauperis. </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. Regardless, however, \u201c[t]he [district] court shall review ... as soon as practicable after docketing, a complaint in a civil action in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity.\u201d \u00a7 1915A(a). Because Jeremiah is a prisoner suing Georgia state officers, the district court properly applied \u00a7 1915A in dismissing Jeremiah\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">Jeremiah argues that the district court erred by denying him leave to amend his complaint. We have held that \u201c[a] district court is not required to grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint sua sponte when the plaintiff, who is represented by counsel, never filed a motion to amend nor requested leave to amend before the district court.\u201d <em>Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., </em>314 F.3d 541, 542 (2002) (en banc), <em>overruling Bank v. Pitt, </em>928 F.2d 1108, 1112 (11th Cir.1991) (per cu-riam) (\u2018Where a more carefully drafted complaint might state a claim, a plaintiff must be given at least one chance to amend the complaint before the district court dismisses the action with prejudice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">We noted that <em>Wagner </em>\u201cdecide[d] and intimate[d] nothing about a party proceeding pro se.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542 n. 1. Accordingly, Jeremiah argues that <em>Bank </em>applies here and that the district court erred by not allowing him to amend his complaint. However, \u201ca district court may properly deny leave to amend ... when such amendment would be futile.\u201d <em>Hall v. United Ins. Co. of Am., </em>367 F.3d 1255, 1263 (11th Cir.2004). Since we find, for the reasons discussed below, that an amendment would have been futile, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">We now address the merits of Jeremiah\u2019s appeal. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of a claim as frivolous for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1348-49 (11th Cir.2001). In reviewing a prisoner\u2019s civil action, \u201cthe court shall identify cognizable claims or dismiss the complaint, or any portion of the complaint, if the complaint ... is frivolous....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). \u201cA claim is frivolous if it is without arguable merit either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Bilal, </em>251 F.3d at 1349. <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">Jeremiah argues that the district court erred by dismissing his claims as frivolous because \u201cconsular officers shall have the right to visit a national of the sending State who is in prison, custody or detention, to converse and correspond with him and to arrange for his legal representation.\u201d Vienna Convention on the Law of Consular Relations art. 36(1)(c), Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77, 596 U.N.T.S. 261. Jeremiah argues that, under the VCCR, Georgia state officials had the duty to inform him of his right to communicate with Jamaican consular officers regarding his arrest. Jeremiah urges this Court to follow <em>Jogi v. Voges, </em>where the Seventh Circuit held that Article 36 \u201cgrants private rights to ... aliens from countries that are parties to the Convention who are in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>United States.... \u201d 480 F.3d 822, 835 (7th Cir.2007). The <em>Jogi </em>court found that those rights are \u201c \u2018presumptively enforceable by \u00a7 1983.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, </em>536 U.S. 273, 284, 122 S.Ct. 2268, 2276, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">We have, however, concluded otherwise. <em>See, e.g., Gandara v. Bennett, </em>528 F.3d 823 (11th Cir.2008). In rejecting the <em>Jogi </em>court\u2019s reasoning, we noted that \u201cthe Vienna Convention does not expressly provide for private damage actions. Instead, the plain words of the Treaty provide that the notification right shall be exercised, not that failure to notify should be compensated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 828 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). To the extent that the VCCR confers legal rights and obligations, \u201cthe right to protect nationals belongs to <em>States </em>party to the Convention; no private right is unambiguously conferred on individual detainees such that they may pursue it through \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Here, Jeremiah\u2019s \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1350 claims are private damage actions based on an alleged violation of the VCCR. And his claims are based on rights that we do not recognize as enforceable. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Jeremiah\u2019s complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. Nor did the court err in denying leave to amend the complaint because an amendment would have been futile. Because Jeremiah\u2019s claims were properly dismissed as frivolous, we do not address whether Jeremiah\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim was time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">After carefully reviewing.the record and Jeremiah\u2019s brief, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
