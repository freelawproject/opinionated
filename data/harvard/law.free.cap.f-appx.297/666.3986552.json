Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we deny in part, and dismiss in part, the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-23\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Cosculluela is not eligible for withholding of removal because he failed to establish a clear probability of persecution if returned to the Philippines. <em>See Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 938 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-24\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Cosculluela is not eligible for CAT relief because he failed to establish it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to the Philippines. <em>See Arteaga v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 940, 948-49 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-25\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Coscul-luela\u2019s contention that he qualifies for an exception to the one year filing deadline for asylum applications based on the designation of the New People\u2019s Army as a Foreign Terrorist Organization because he failed to exhaust the issue before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-26\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary denial of voluntary de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>parture. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f). Coscul-luela\u2019s due process claim regarding the denial of voluntary departure is not color-able. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b692-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
