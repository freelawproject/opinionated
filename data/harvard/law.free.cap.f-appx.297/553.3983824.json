Griggs appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> grant of summary judgment to defendants in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action claiming he was disciplined, placed in administrative segregation (ad seg) and punitive isolation, and transferred to the Var-ner Supermax Unit (VSM) in retaliation for filing grievances and making complaints against defendants, and in violation of his due process rights. Griggs also appeals the rulings on various motions he filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-23\">We find that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>to defendants. <em>See Anderson v. Larson, </em>327 F.3d 762, 767 (8th Cir.2003) (de novo review). As to his due process claims, neither Griggs\u2019s two 30-day placements in punitive segregation, nor his placement in ad seg for less than 20 days constituted the type of \u201catypical and significant\u201d hardship that would trigger the protection of the Due Process Clause. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483-86, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995) (due process invoked only where defendants impose atypical and significant hardship on inmate in relation to ordinary incidents of prison life; no liberty interest protecting against 30-day assignment to segregated confinement); <em>Freitas v. Ault, </em>109 F.3d 1335, 1337-38 (8th Cir.1997) (10-day placement in ad seg \u2014 allowing for 1 hour per day out of cell \u2014 and 30 additional days of limited time out of cell, limited visitors, and no work or phone privileges, did not constitute atypical and significant hardship). Further, Griggs\u2019s transfer to VSM did not violate the Due Process Clause, as he received notice of the placement hearing and the reasons for his potential placement prior to the classification hearing; the classification committee stated in writing its reasons for the placement; Griggs had the opportunity to appeal the decision; and VSM policy indicates its inmates receive two 30-day reviews and 60-day reviews thereafter. <em>See Wilkinson v. Austin, </em>545 U.S. 209, 225-27, 125 S.Ct. 2384, 162 L.Ed.2d 174 (2005) (process for super-max placement adequate where inmate received notice of factual basis leading to supermax consideration, fair opportunity for rebuttal, multiple levels of review, opportunity for objections prior to final review, and short statement of reasons for placement).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">We also agree with the district court that Griggs\u2019s retaliation claims failed. First, Griggs\u2019s evidence was not sufficient to create a genuine issue as to whether he engaged in protected conduct that was the motivating factor for his placement in ad seg. <em>See Atkinson v. Bohn, </em>91 F.3d 1127, 1129 (8th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (retaliatory-transfer claim properly dismissed where allegations of retaliation are \u201cspeculative and conelusory\u201d); <em>Murphy v. Mo. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>769 F.2d 502, 503 n. 1 (8th Cir.1985) (per curiam) (inmate claiming retaliation is required to meet substantial burden of proving actual motivating factor for adverse action was as alleged). Second, Griggs did not show that the disciplinary charges filed against him were retaliatory, as there was evidence that he committed the rule violations and he was found guilty by an impartial decisionmaker. <em>See Hartsfield, v. Nichols, </em>511 F.3d 826, 829-31 (8th Cir. 2008) (defendant may successfully defend retaliatory-discipline claim by showing \u201csome evidence\u201d that inmate actually committed rule violation; report from correctional officer, even if disputed by inmate and supported by no other evidence, legally suffices as some evidence upon which to base prison disciplinary violation if violation is found by impartial decisionmaker). Third, Griggs did not show that impermissible retaliation was the actual motivating factor for his transfer to VSM, as he did not dispute the reasons given by the classification committee for his placement \u2014 that he was a Class TV inmate with a poor institutional file and numerous disciplinary violations. <em>See Cornell v. Woods, </em>69 F.3d 1383, 1387-88 (8th Cir.1995) (inmate must show that impermissible retaliation was actual motivating factor for transfer). Griggs\u2019s conspiracy claim also failed. <em>See Askew v. Millerd, </em>191 F.3d 953, 957 (8th Cir.1999) (elements of conspiracy claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">We conclude that the district court did not err in denying Griggs leave to amend the complaint. <em>See In re NVE Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>527 F.3d 749, 752 (8th Cir.2008) (denial of leave to amend complaint based on futility is reviewed de novo); <em>Buckley v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number><em>Barlow, </em>997 F.2d 494, 495 (8th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (finding no constitutional right was violated by failure to process grievances). Nor did the court abuse its discretion in denying some of Griggs\u2019s discovery requests, <em>see Executive Air Taxi Corp. v. City of Bismarck, </em>518 F.3d 562, 569 (8th Cir.2008) (standard of review); <em>Janis v. Biesheuvel, </em>428 F.3d 795, 801 (8th Cir.2005) (party seeking to stay resolution of summary judgment motion must show how further discovery will allow him to rebut movant\u2019s showing of absence of genuine issue of fact), in declining to appoint counsel, <em>see Stevens v. Redwing, </em>146 F.3d 538, 546 (8th Cir.1998) (standard of review; relevant factors), or in denying his motions to reconsider, <em>see Arnold v. Wood, </em>238 F.3d 992, 998 (8th Cir.2001) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-13\">. The Honorable William R.
