Valentine pleaded guilty to one count of possession of firearms after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) (2000). He reserved the right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress firearms seized from the trunk of his vehicle. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-23\">On appeal, Valentine argues that the district court erred in denying his suppression motion because the initial stop of his vehicle was unconstitutional and the officer lacked probable cause or any other legitimate basis to search the vehicle. The factual findings underlying a motion to suppress are reviewed for clear error, while the legal determinations are reviewed de novo. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, this court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>It is well established that, \u201c \u2018[i]f a car is readily mobile and probable cause exists to believe it contains contraband,\u2019 \u201d an officer may search the car without a warrant. <em>Maryland v. Dyson, </em>527 U.S. 465, 466, 119 S.Ct. 2013, 144 L.Ed.2d 442 (1999) (quoting <em>Pennsylvania v. Labron, </em>518 U.S. 938, 940, 116 S.Ct. 2485, 135 L.Ed.2d 1031 (1996)). The Supreme Court has defined the test for probable cause as \u201cwhether, given all the circumstances, ... there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). The Court has also held that \u201c[t]he principal components of a determination of ... probable cause will be the events which occurred leading up to the stop or search, and then the decision whether these historical facts, viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer, amount to ... probable cause.\u201d <em>Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 696, 116 S.Ct. 1657.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Our review of the officer\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing and the audio and video recording from the dashboard camera of the patrol car convinces us that the officer\u2019s search of Valentine\u2019s vehicle was supported by probable cause. The district court properly denied Valentine\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Valentine\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
