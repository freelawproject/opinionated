Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-16\">Petitioners\u2019 claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) failed to present evidence of changed country conditions in Mexico that are material to petitioners and their circumstances. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Because petitioners have failed to meet their burden of establishing a prima facie CAT claim to support reopening, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-17\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary denial in part of the petition for review is granted because the questions raised by this petition are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-18\">Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss this petition for review in part for lack of jurisdiction is granted. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 601 (9th Cir.2006) (concluding that the court lacks jurisdiction to review the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 denial of motion to reopen for failure to establish a prima facie case if a prior adverse discretionary decision was made by the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-19\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b616-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
