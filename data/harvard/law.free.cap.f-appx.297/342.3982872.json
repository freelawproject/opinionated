For the reasons set forth below, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-16\">Kathleen Bernardo was employed by American Airlines, Inc. (\u201cAmerican Airlines\u201d) as a Manager of Arport Services. As an employee, Bernardo participated in the American Airlines Inc., Long Term Disability Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d). The Plan is a welfare benefit plan under ERISA sponsored by American Airlines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From November 2002 until November 2003, Bernardo was placed on \u201cpaid Management Leave of Absence (Extended Management Sick Leave).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-17\">In August 2003, Bernardo was diagnosed with aplastic anemia by Dr. Lawrence Rice, who specializes in hematology. Bernardo was treated with cyclosporin A and prednisone. In February 2004, Bernardo sought long-term disability benefits under the Plan. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (\u201cMetLife\u201d), the Plan\u2019s third-party administrator, received Bernardo\u2019s complete claim for benefits in March 2004. Bernardo\u2019s claim for long-term disability benefits included a letter from Dr. Rice, Bernardo\u2019s treating physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>cian, stating that she was unable to work \u201cdue to severe pansytopena and side effects of medication, including profound fatigue, tremors, and nausea.\u201d Based on this information, MetLife determined that Bernardo became totally disabled on May 20, 2003,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and as such, MetLife approved long-term disability benefits for Bernardo effective November 19, 2003 through April 30, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Between March 26, 2004 and August 31, 2005, Bernardo provided three letters to MetLife from Dr. Rice explaining that Bernardo was in her second remission from aplastic anemia, having side effects from the cyclosporin A treatment, and had developed bilateral cataracts with significant visual impairment. Bernardo provided MetLife with additional medical records, and MetLife decided to extend her long-term disability benefits through August 31, 2005. However, MetLife also warned Bernardo that it would need additional medical information to substantiate her claim for any future long-term disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">MetLife re-evaluated Bernardo\u2019s claim. After reviewing the medical information provided by Bernardo and her physicians, as well as speaking with Bernardo\u2019s physicians directly, MetLife decided to deny Bernardo\u2019s long-term disability benefits past August 2005. MetLife denied Bernardo\u2019s benefits because the records \u201cdid not substantiate that she was totally disabled.\u201d MetLife relied on that portion of Dr. Rice\u2019s letter which stated that Bernardo was in her second remission from aplastic anemia and Dr. Minh Dong\u2019s report finding no disability from Bernardo\u2019s cataracts. MetLife notified Bernardo of this decision on September 2, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">In September 2005, Bernardo sought a first-level appeal from MetLife\u2019s decision to deny her benefits and included reports from Dr. Rice and Dr. Dong. However, MetLife upheld its decision to deny her long-term disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Bernardo' then filed a second-level appeal in January 2006 with the Plan\u2019s Pension Benefits Administration Committee (\u201cPBAC\u201d), which had granted Charlotte Teklitz, its Managing Director, the authority to decide all second-level appeals for the Plan regarding health and welfare benefits plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Her second appeal included letters from: Bernardo, Dr. Rice, and two from Dr. Lee Pollack, a neurologist. Dr. Rice\u2019s letter of January 13, 2006 stated that Bernardo had been under his care for over two years \u201cwith a'relapsing variant of aplastic anemia.\u201d His letter also stated that Bernardo was treated -with cyclosporin A and,</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">[n]otes in my chart reflect that Ms. Bernardo has complained of neurologic symptoms almost from her first visit with me. Symptoms have included tremors, parethesias, unsteadiness and imbalance, vertigo-like problems, dysu-ria, headaches and others.... She has been undergoing extensive evaluation by a neurologist who has found objective abnormalities of MRI scans, spinal fluids and other tests. ;</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">This appeal also included two letters dated November 16, 2005 and January 18, 2006 from the neurologist, Dr. Pollack. The November 16, 2005 letter simply stated \u201cTotally disabled due to cyclosporin A neu-rotoxicity.\u201d The January 18, 2006 letter stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>The patient [Bernardo] was placed on Cyclosporin A due to her aplastic anemia and thrombocytopenia, and she slowly began to develop progressive systemic and neurologic symptoms including headache, dizziness, near syncope, disorientation, as well as sweats and tremors. Other symptoms include episodic vertigo, which is at times disabling. ... Her neurological examination is abnormal.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Dr. Pollack\u2019s conclusions were:</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">[t]his patient is thought to have Cyclos-porin neurotoxicity, which has been well described in literature. She has hard evidence of central nervous system abnormalities .... Based on reasonable medical probability, she has a full neurological disability to Cyclosporin A neurotoxicity, which was required for this patient in order to preserve life, given the setting of life threatening aplastic anemia.... Whether or not this neurological disability will be permanent is uncertain: however, I expect that this patient will remain in this disabled condition at least for several years while the Cyclosporin A clears from her system. Subsequent to that, reassessment can be performed to determine if persistent disability is present or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The PBAC had two Network Medical Review(\u201cNMR\u201d) Elite Physicians, Dr. Nelson Chao and Dr. George Yanik, review Bernardo\u2019s claim for benefits. Dr. Yanik, a Board-Certified Ophthalmologist, reviewed Bernardo\u2019s medical information, including the letters from Drs. Rice and Pollack. He found that the cataracts were not disabling.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Dr. Chao is Board-Certified in Oncology and Internal Medicine and is a Professor of Medicine and Immunology at Duke University. Dr. Chao also reviewed the medical records along with information obtained from MetLife. He agreed with MetLife\u2019s determination that Bernardo was not totally disabled under American Airline\u2019s description of her job. Dr. Chao\u2019s report states:</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">The most recent medical records suggest that she in fact is doing quite well from a neurological standpoint and that she has no physical findings and there are no concerns regarding aplastic anemia. The neurological symptoms of cyc-losporine toxicity are not clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">... The detailed explanation citing clinical information is that she no longer has aplastic anemia.... She may have some side effects from cyclosporine. These do not appear to be overwhelming. If there are concerns regarding neurotox-icity a consult from a neurologist may be of some use although it is likely that the findings of neurotoxicity do not preclude her from working.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">Based on the reports from Dr. Yanik and Dr. Chao, the PBAC (through Ms. Teklitz) affirmed the Plan\u2019s decision to terminate Bernardo\u2019s long-term disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">Bernardo then filed suit against the Plan in the district court challenging the Plan\u2019s decision to terminate her long-term disability benefits as of August 31, 2005. The Plan filed a motion for summary judgment, and Bernardo filed a response which the district court treated as a cross motion for summary judgment. In November 2007, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Plan, and dismissed Bernardo\u2019s suit on the basis that,</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">[t]he plan\u2019s decision was not an abuse of discretion. The plan reviewed MetLife\u2019s findings, the medical records of Bernardo, and an independent study by two doctors, who found that Bernardo was not totally disabled as defined by the plan.... Substantial evidence exists, therefore, to support the plan\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>to end her benefits because Bernardo was not totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Bernardo appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings and evidence before the court show that no genuine issue exists as to any material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In this circuit, an ERISA plan administrator\u2019s factual decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Vercher v. Alexander &amp; Alexander Inc., </em>879 F.3d 222, 226 (5th Cir.2004). A plan administrator abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily or capriciously. <em>Meditrust Fin. Servs. Corp. v. Sterling Chems. Inc., </em>168 F.3d 211, 214 (5th Cir.1999). When reviewing to determine whether the administrator\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious, the court should affirm the decision if it is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215. A decision is arbitrary, and thus not supported by substantial evidence, if \u201cmade without a rational connection between the known facts and the decision or between the found facts and the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bellaire Gen. Hosp. v. Blue Cross Blue Shield </em>of Mich., 97 F.3d 822, 828-29 (5th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Bernardo argues that substantial evidence does not support the Plan\u2019s denial of benefits and the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">The Plan\u2019s decision to terminate Bernardo\u2019s long-term disability benefits effective August 31, 2005 is based on the Plan\u2019s view that \u201c[t]he information presented in support of [Bernardo\u2019s] claim no longer substantiates [her] inability to perform [her] occupational duties.\u201d The denial letter was based on progress notes from Bernardo\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Rice, and her ophthalmologist, Dr. Dong, as well as the reports of the NMR Elite Physicians, Dr. Chao and Dr. Yanik. With regard to Bernardo\u2019s aplastic anemia, the denial letter cites Dr. Rice\u2019s progress notes and Dr. Chao\u2019s report in support of the fact that Bernardo had been in her second remission from aplastic anemia for over six months. The denial letter also cites Dr. Dong\u2019s opinion and Dr. Yanik\u2019s report in support of the fact that Bernardo\u2019s current visual impairment was not disabling and did not preclude Bernardo from performing her duties as a Manager of Airport Services with American Airlines.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">Based on our review of the record, these conclusions do not reflect a rational connection between the known facts and the decision to deny benefits. Although the denial letter addresses Bernardo\u2019s aplastic anemia and cataracts, it does not mention her cyclosporin A neurotoxicity covered in Dr. Rice\u2019s and Dr. Pollack\u2019s reports. The reports of Bernardo\u2019s treating neurologist, Dr. Pollack, dated November 16, 2005 and January 18, 2006, are the primary direct evidence of Bernardo\u2019s cyclosporin A neu-rotoxicity. Dr. Pollack\u2019s note dated November 16, 2005 simply, but clearly, states: \u201cTotally disabled due to Cyclosporin A neurotoxicity.\u201d Dr. Pollack\u2019s two-page letter, dated January 18, 2006, detailed Bernardo\u2019s relevant medical history, her symptoms, a summary of diagnostic tests he performed on her and his reasons for finding her totally disabled from the reaction to cyclosporin.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">Dr. Rice\u2019s January 13, 2006 letter also documented Bernardo\u2019s neurological symptoms, which he thought \u201crepresented toxicity from cyclosporin.\u201d It is impossible to reconcile Dr. Chao\u2019s report with the reports of Dr. Rice and Dr. Pollack. Significantly, Dr. Chao does not purport to explain why the severe symptoms found by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Dr. Pollock and Dr. Rice were not disabling.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">This is not a situation in which the reviewing physicians reached a different medical conclusion from the medical evidence in a claimant\u2019s file or where other evidence of the claimant\u2019s condition contradicts the diagnosis of the treating physician, such as occurred in cases relied on by the Plan. <em>See Sweatman v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>39 F.3d 594 (5th Cir.1994) (insurer did not abuse its discretion in denying benefits based on its own investigation and the reports of its medical consultants, which differed from the diagnosis of the treating physician); <em>Vercher, </em>379 F.3d 222 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Unlike the cases the Plan relied upon in this case, an unexplained gap exists between Dr. Pollack\u2019s report finding disability and his explanation for this finding and the conclusory report of Dr. Chao, who found no disability. There is no evidence in the record that Dr. Chao considered the reports of Dr. Rice and Dr. Pollack with regard to Bernardo\u2019s cyclosporin A neuro-toxicity, except for Dr. Chao\u2019s speculation that Bernardo \u201cmay have some side effects from cyclosporin\u201d but these \u201cdo not appear to be overwhelming.\u201d The plan administrator and the reviewing physicians have presented no evidence that contradicts the treating physicians\u2019 conclusion that Bernardo \u201cis 100% disabled from work, and likely has been since the onset of Cyclos-porin A usage.\u201d Based on this record, the Plan abused its discretion in denying long-term disability benefits to Bernardo and the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Plan on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">For the reasons stated above, the summary judgment of the district court rejecting Bernardo\u2019s claim for long-term disability benefits is vacated. We remand this case to the district court to enter judgment in favor of Bernardo.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-12\">. The Plan defines \"disability\u201d in relevant part as follows: \"During the first 24 months for which [long-term disability] benefits are payable, you are considered totally disabled if you are not gainfully employed in any type of job for wage or profit or are unable to perform major and substantial duties of your own occupation because of sickness or accidental bodily injury. After 24 months for which benefits are payable, you are considered totally disabled if you are not gainfully employed in any type of job for any employer or are unable to engage in major and substantial duties of any occupation or employment for wage or profit for which you have become reasonably qualified by training, education or experience.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b370-6\">. MetLife, by letter dated March 26, 2004, notified Bernardo that the Plan had approved her claim for long-term disability benefits based on her becoming disabled on May 20, 2003 due to aplastic anemia. However, the effective date of these benefits was November 19, 2003 because American Airlines paid Bernardo salary continuation/sick pay through November 18, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
