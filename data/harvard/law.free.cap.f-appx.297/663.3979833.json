We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Reyes v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 592, 595 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen because petitioners failed to comply with the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel is not clear on the face of the administrative record. <em>See Reyes, </em>358 F.3d at 598-99 (petitioner did not substantially comply with <em>Lozada </em>where he did not show he gave former counsel notice of the ineffective assistance allegations or an opportunity to respond).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b690-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
