The district court denied Willis leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to px-oceed IFP, Willis is challenging that certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-23\">Our inquiry into Willis\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and thex-efore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted). We review a \u00a7 1915 dismissal as frivolous for an abuse of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>cretion. <em>See Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 291 (5th Cir.1997). A dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is reviewed under the same <em>de novo </em>standard as is a dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998). \u201cThe res judicata effect of a prior judgment is a question of law that this court reviews de novo.\u201d <em>Test Masters Educ. Servs., Inc. v. Singh, </em>428 F.3d 559, 571 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">RICO claims can be barred by res judi-cata if they are \u201cinconsistent with the crux\u201d of a bankruptcy court decision. <em>See Hendrick v. Avent, </em>891 F.2d 583, 586-87 (5th Cir.1990). The district court raised the issue of res judicata <em>sua sponte </em>and before service on the defendants. \u201cGenerally, res judicata is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded, not raised <em>sua sponte.\u201d Mowbray v. Cameron County, Tex., </em>274 F.3d 269, 281 (5th Cir.2001). Although there are exceptions to that rule, <em>see id., </em>we need not decide whether the district court properly applied res judicata, because Willis\u2019s RICO claims otherwise are subject to dismissal as frivolous and for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">RICO prohibits specified conduct that involves \u201c \u2018a pattern of racketeering activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., </em>547 U.S. 451, 453, 126 S.Ct. 1991, 164 L.Ed.2d 720 (2006) (quoting \u00a7 1962). \u201cAll RICO violations under ... \u00a7 1962 entail \u2018(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re MasterCard Int\u2019l Inc., </em>313 F.3d 257, 261 (5th Cir.2002) (emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>Crowe v. Henry, </em>43 F.3d 198, 204 (5th Cir.1995)). Even if we assume, as did the district court, that the facts Willis alleged satisfied those requirements, Willis must fulfill RICO\u2019s standing requirement. <em>See Price v. Pinnacle Brands, Inc., </em>138 F.3d 602, 606 (5th Cir.1998). Willis\u2019s allegations, if true, do not reflect that he was a \u201c \u2018person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation\u2019 of [RICO].\u201d <em>Anza, </em>547 U.S. at 453, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (quoting \u00a7 1964(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Willis has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal would be frivolous is incorrect. Accordingly, his request for IFP is DENIED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Willis has one previous strike. <em>See Willis v. Collins, </em>No. 93-7247, 1993 WL 481562 (5th Cir. Nov.1, 1993). Because he has accumulated three strikes, he is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
