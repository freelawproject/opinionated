The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposed a 46-month sentence. Blagg appeals, claiming sentencing error. Jurisdiction being proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, this court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Blagg contends that the district court based his sentence on disputed and unreliable hearsay about threats in the presentence investigation report. We review de novo the district court\u2019s construction and application of the Sentencing Guidelines, and review for clear error any factual findings regarding enhancements. <em>United States v. Wintermute, </em>443 F.3d 993, 1004 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">The district court explicitly stated that it did not find that Blagg made the threats. The court did not rely on hearsay statements in determining the sentence. <em>Cf. United States v. Fennell, </em>65 F.3d 812, 813-14 (10th Cir.1995) (reversing a sentence where \u201cthe district court\u2019s finding [for a sentence enhancement] was based upon hearsay evidence\u201d); <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>49 F.3d 423, 426 (8th Cir.1995) (finding error where the court \u201cmade some judgment as to the truth of the out of court allegations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">Blagg argues that the court made an adverse inference from his failure to testify at the sentencing hearing. This argument is unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-16\">Blagg challenges his sentence as unreasonable. He alleges that the court erred by not granting his request for departures based on an overstated criminal history under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, or for an overstated offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0. \u201cWe will generally not review a decision not to grant a downward departure unless the district court had an unconstitutional motive or erroneously thought that it was without authority to grant the departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>517 F.3d 1020, 1023 (8th Cir. 2008) <em>(citing United States v. Frokjer, </em>415 F.3d 865, 874-75 (8th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-17\">Blagg also requested a downward variance based upon 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Determining the Guidelines range to be 46 to 57 months, the court imposed a 46-month sentence on each count to run concurrently, followed by three years of supervised release and a special assessment of $200. Blagg asserts that the district court failed to give appropriate weight to his age, employment, diminished likelihood of recidivism, and personal characteristics. This court reviews sentencing decisions for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>512 F.3d 1004, 1006 (8th Cir.2008) <em>(citing Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). A sentence within the Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable on appeal. <em>Id. (citing Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). The district court listened to Blagg\u2019s argu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>merits and considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court did not abuse its discretion when sentencing Blagg. <em>See United, States v. Thomas, </em>454 F.3d 904, 905 (8th Cir.2006) (sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range affirmed where district court understood Guidelines were advisory and that it should fashion sentence by reference to \u00a7 3553(a) factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-12\">.
