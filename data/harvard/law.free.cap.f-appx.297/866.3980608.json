After review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b893-18\">Var\u00f3n and Alvarez are natives and citizens of Colombia. Var\u00f3n was admitted to the United States on or about 22 February 2001, as a nonimmigrant visitor for pleasure with authorization to remain until 20 February 2002.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the day he was scheduled to depart, Var\u00f3n filed an application seeking asylum and withholding of removal under the INA and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging persecution based on political opinion. Specifically, he contended that he was persecuted because he opposed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>use of force and violence by guerrilla groups in Colombia between 1996 and 2001 and feared being kidnapped or killed if he returned.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">While obtaining his engineering degree at the Universidad de Valle in Cali, Colombia, Var\u00f3n actively opposed the use of force and violence by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) and the Revolutionary Student Front (\u201cFER\u201d), the FARC\u2019s political allies inside the University.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to Var\u00f3n, those who were not openly leftist were considered to belong to the right wing. In 1996, Var\u00f3n organized meetings throughout the University and formed a student group to take a stand against the violence. It was Var-on\u2019s opposition to leftist tactics that brought him to the attention of the FER, who told him on several occasions \u201cto shut his mouth up\u201d or they would \u201csilence\u201d him. In a 26 May 1996 \u201cAnnouncement,\u201d the FER urged the university community \u201cto denounce those so-called \u2018students\u2019 like Didier Var\u00f3n,\u201d whose goal was to \u201csubjugate the ... fight\u201d against imperialism. That same year, the FER kidnapped Var\u00f3n and detained him in a classroom for an entire day, threatening him and accusing him of being a paramilitary. His kidnapping became a symbol for the students against violence and generated tension with the FER.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Following this incident, Var\u00f3n continued to hear rumors and read graffiti saying that he would be killed. He believed he was considered a paramilitary because he never accepted leftist ideas. One night in May of 1999, as he was leaving the University campus, an unidentified person threw a Molotov cocktail<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at him from one of the buildings. Although Var\u00f3n could not see who threw the bomb, he believed the assailant was a member of the guerrilla groups, who were \u201coffended\u201d by his organization of the student group against violence in 1996. Var\u00f3n suffered only minor injuries as a result of the incident, but was \u201cvery much afraid\u201d and decided to travel to the United States to live with relatives. He spent two and a half months in the United States before returning to Colombia in August 1999 to finish his education.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">After returning to Colombia, Var\u00f3n resumed participation in an ecological group, \u201cHalcones Turismo de Aventura,\u201d with which he had been affiliated since 1991 and whose mission was to restore and replant Colombia\u2019s tropical forests. In November 2000, while on an ecological outing in a FARC-controlled area, the group was stopped by heavily-armed FARC guerrillas who warned them to cease \u201cworking with the community\u201d and ordered them to pay a tax for entering the area. When Var\u00f3n and another member asked why they had to pay money when they were a non-profit ecological group, the FARC members became angry and responded that the group would be detained and subjected to a \u201cpolitical trial.\u201d At that point, the FARC kidnapped Var\u00f3n and the others and forced them to march through the forest for seven hours until they reached a remote camp, where the FARC confiscated their identification cards, threatened them at gun-point, and tied them to a tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>Approximately four hours later, a member of the FARC returned and told Var\u00f3n that the FARC knew he had opposed their activities at the University and were going to kill him because he was spying on then-activities in the mountains. He tried to explain that he was not part of the military forces or any paramilitary group and was only in the mountains to plant trees. The FARC released Var\u00f3n after thirty-six hours, but warned him that they would be continuing their investigation into his life and if they ever saw him again in the area he would be killed immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Var\u00f3n attempted to report the incident to his local police, but was told he would have to file the report where the detention occurred. Var\u00f3n indicated that he would never return to that area. About one week later, a member of the FER approached Var\u00f3n on the university campus, told him he was aware of what had happened in the mountains, and warned him that the more radical members of the group were going to kill him because they believed he was an \u201cinfiltrator of the paramilitary.\u201d Var\u00f3n did not return to the mountains or the university. He contacted his professors, had all of his course work sent to him by email and telephone, and went to live with Alvarez, who was his girlfriend at the time. He received his degree in January 2001, but did not attend the graduation ceremony.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Despite Varon\u2019s efforts to keep a low profile, a person who identified himself as a member of the FARC called his brother\u2019s house, where he had been living before, and stated that the FARC knew Var\u00f3n was a member of the paramilitary. After Alvarez\u2019s parents started receiving similar threatening phone calls, Var\u00f3n fled Colombia for the United States. He did not attempt to relocate to another part of Colombia because he believed that the guerrillas would be able to find him using the information from his identification card.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Also admitted into evidence were, <em>inter alia, </em>several news articles reporting on the growing number of attacks against students and academics as well as the general unrest at public universities in Colombia, and the State Department\u2019s 2001 and 2004 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Colombia. According the 2001 Country Report, the FARC was well-known for attacking civilians and committing massacres and summary executions. The report further noted that the FARC guerillas commonly targeted local elected officials, teachers, civic leaders, business owners, religious leaders, and other civilians, and were responsible for the majority of kidnappings for political reasons as well as for ransom payments, which were an integral source of revenue for the group. Both guerrilla and paramilitary groups maintained a presence at many universities, and the groups were reported to use both violent and nonviolent means in order to generate political support for then- respective campaigns. The 2004 Country Report contained similar information, noting additionally that while the total number of kidnappings had declined, the kidnappings for ransom and political reasons remained a serious problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">The IJ found that Var\u00f3n was credible, but concluded that the mistreatment he suffered did not amount to past persecution. The IJ also found that while Var\u00f3n had a subjectively genuine fear of persecution, the fact that he returned to Colombia following the Molotov cocktail incident, resumed his regular activities, and completed his education, undermined any objectively reasonable fear of persecution. Inasmuch as Var\u00f3n failed to carry his burden with respect to his asylum claim, the IJ found that he also failed to meet the higher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>burden for obtaining withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The BIA affirmed, finding that Varon\u2019s experiences, while disturbing, did not rise to the level of past persecution. The BIA concluded additionally that Var\u00f3n did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution because he was unable to show that the FARC or the FER was currently looking for him on account of his political opinion, or that they would single him out for persecution some four years after he had left Colombia. Var\u00f3n now seeks review of the BIA\u2019s decision denying relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">\u201cWe review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Because the BIA issued its own opinion and did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s findings, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). Findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, which requires us to affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir. 2005). Under this highly deferential standard, we view the record in the light most favorable to the BIA\u2019s decision and are bound by that decision unless a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>Accordingly, \u201ceven if the evidence could support multiple conclusions, we must affirm the agency\u2019s decision unless there is no reasonable basis for that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1) (2008). The Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien satisfies his burden of establishing that he is a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<p id=\"AAO\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The alien has the burden of proving with \u201ccredible, direct, and specific evidence in the record\u201d that he is a refugee. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. To establish eligibility for asylum, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, show that he was persecuted in the past, or has a well-founded fear that he will be persecuted in the future, on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b) (2008); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the alien establishes past persecution, it is presumed that his life or freedom would be threatened upon returning to that country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b); <em>see Tan v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>(llth Cir.2006). The government may rebut this presumption by showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the country\u2019s conditions have changed such that (1) the applicant\u2019s life or freedom no longer would be threatened upon removal, or (2) the alien could relocate within the county and it would be reasonable to expect him to do so. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">An alien who has not shown past persecution may still be entitled to asylum if he can demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground by presenting \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of\u2019 the statutorily listed factor. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations omitted); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2). To prevail, the applicant must demonstrate that his fear of persecution is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>See Al Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Persecution, both past and future, must be \u201con account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(42)(A). An applicant may establish persecution based on one of these five protected grounds by showing that the \u201cpersecution was, at least in part, motivated by a protected ground.\u201d <em>Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375; <em>see Rivera v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 815, 821 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cSo long as an applicant for asylum proves ... persecution on account of a protected ground, it matters not that his or her persecutors may have additional motives for their actions.\u201d). Although the persecution must be based upon the political opinion of the victim, not the political opinion of the persecutor, we have recognized that an applicant may establish past persecution based on an imputed political opinion that is either correctly or incorrectly attributed to him. <em>See Sanchez v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437-38 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam); <em>see also Al Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1289 (\u201cAn asylum applicant may prevail on a theory of imputed political opinion if he shows that the persecutor falsely attributed an opinion to him, and then persecuted him because of that mistaken belief about his views.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">To establish eligibility for withholding of removal under the INA, an applicant must establish that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). This requires the alien seeking withholding of removal to demonstrate that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be persecuted or tortured upon returning to his home country. <em>Fahim v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). Because \u201c[t]his standard is more stringent than the \u2018well-founded fear of future persecution\u2019 required for asylum,\u201d <em>Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375, an applicant who fails to establish eligibility for asylum likewise fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">On appeal, Var\u00f3n and Alvarez argue that the BIA erred in denying their applications for asylum and withholding of removal, alleging that the 1996 detention, the 1999 Molotov cocktail bombing, the November 2000 kidnapping, and the threatening phone calls in 2001, viewed cumulatively, establish past persecution. The government responds that Var\u00f3n failed to demonstrate that he was targeted on account of his political opinion and, further, that the incidents in Varon\u2019s claim were isolated and indiscriminate and did not rise to the level of persecution. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">We first note that while the 1996 detention and the 2001 telephone threats were on account of Varon\u2019s political opinion, it is less clear whether the 1999 Molotov cock<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>tail incident and the 2002 detention in the forest likewise were motivated by Varon\u2019s actual or imputed political opinion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With respect to the bombing, Var\u00f3n merely speculates that the bomb was thrown at him by a member of the FER and concedes that he was unable to identify who threw the bomb. Accordingly, the record does not compel the conclusion that the bombing was connected to his political activity. <em>See Silva v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1238 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that where petitioner testified she did not know who fired shots at her ear or why, the evidence did not compel the conclusion that the shooting was based on her political opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">As to the kidnapping in 2000, Varon\u2019s testimony strongly indicates that he and his group were stopped by the FARC not on account of any actual or imputed political opinion, but because they had invaded FARC-controlled territory and refused to pay the tax after being ordered to do so. The kidnapping thus appears to have been an isolated incident unrelated to Varon\u2019s 1996 political activities. Even assuming a nexus between Varon\u2019s political opinion and the incidents of mistreatment alleged, however, we do not find that the record compels a conclusion that these events, whether viewed separately or cumulatively, were severe and pervasive enough to constitute persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Although the INA does not expressly define \u201cpersecution\u201d for purposes of qualifying as a \u201crefugee,\u201d we have repeatedly stated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations and citation omitted); <em>see also Nelson v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir.2000) (holding that persecution \u201cmust rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering\u201d). In determining whether an alien has established past persecution, we must consider the cumulative impact of the persecutory incidents alleged. <em>See Ruiz v. United, States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>479 F.3d 762, 766 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">While it is an \u201cextreme concept,\u201d we have found persecution in a number of cases. For example, in <em>Ruiz, </em>we held that the record compelled a finding of past persecution where the petitioner received threatening phone calls, was beaten on two separate occasions, and was kidnapped for eighteen days by the FARC, during which time he also suffered severe beatings. <em>Id. </em>at 763-64, 766. Similarly, in <em>Mejia, </em>we found persecution where the petitioner was the target of attempted attacks over an eighteen month period, received multiple death threats, and was physically attacked twice, once when a large rock was thrown at him and once when members of the FARC broke his nose with the butt of a rifle. 498 F.3d at 1257-58; <em>see also De Santamaria v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1008-10 (11th Cir.2008) (finding persecution where alien received numerous death threats, was dragged by her hair out of her vehicle, and was later kidnapped and beaten); <em>Delgado v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 859-61 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (finding persecution based on cumulative effect of two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>beatings, continued threatening phone calls, and two instances of the alien\u2019s car being vandalized with political graffiti); <em>Niftaliev v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1211 (11th Cir.2007) (finding that the cumulative effect of numerous beatings, arrests, searches, and interrogations, culminating in a fifteen-day, food-deprived detention compelled a finding of past persecution).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Notwithstanding the foregoing, \u201c[n]ot all exceptional treatment is persecution.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000). For example, in <em>Zheng v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam), we held that the petitioner, who was dragged by his arms to a detention yard, detained for five days, forced to watch reeducation videos, to stand in the sun for two hours, and to sign a pledge not to practice his religion, failed to establish past persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1289-92. Because Zheng had presented no evidence that he was physically injured, we concluded that the \u201cfive-day detention during which he was not harmed [did] not <em>compel </em>the conclusion that he experienced past persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1290; <em>see also Djonda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a minor beating, even in conjunction with threats, did not compel a finding of persecution); <em>see also Tawm v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 740, 742-43 (8th Cir.2004) (holding that two beatings, which were four years apart, lasted only a few hours each, and did not result in serious injury, did not constitute persecution); <em>Dandan v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 567, 573-74 (7th Cir.2003) (finding no persecution where petitioner was detained, beaten, and deprived of food for three days); <em>Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339 (9th Cir.1995) (finding no persecution where petitioner was detained for several hours, hit in the stomach, and kicked from behind); <em>Mendez-Efrain v. INS, </em>813 F.2d 279, 282-83 (9th Cir.1987) (finding no persecution where petitioner was detained and interrogated for four days).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">In this case, Var\u00f3n suffered a one-day detention in 1996 and a thirty-six hour kidnapping in 2000, the cumulative duration of which was approximately half of the duration of the five-day kidnapping in <em>Zheng. </em>He suffered no physical harm as a result of either detention, and admitted that he received only \u201cminor injuries\u201d as a result of the Molotov cocktail incident. <em>Cf. Ruiz, </em>479 F.3d at 766 (finding persecution where petitioner presented medical records documenting the injuries he suffered during his kidnapping). We cannot say that these three isolated incidents, occurring over the course of several years and involving no more than minor injuries, constitute the kind of mistreatment that would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a decision contrary to that made by the BIA in this case. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">We also conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Var-\u00f3n does not have an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution because he has failed to present any evidence showing that he will be targeted if he returns to Colombia.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We note that although the evidence may not exclude the possibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>that Var\u00f3n was persecuted in the past or will be persecuted upon his return to Colombia on account of a protected ground, our inquiry is not whether the evidence presented <em>might </em>support a claim for relief, but rather, whether the record <em>compels </em>a reversal of the finding to the contrary. <em>See Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1237. Here, it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Var\u00f3n seeks review of the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal. Because the evidence does not compel a finding that Var\u00f3n suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion or any other protected ground, we DENY the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-10\">. In April 2002, the Department of Homeland Security (formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) issued Var\u00f3n and Alvarez Notices to Appear (\"NTA\u201d), charging them with removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), as immigrants who remained in the United States for a period of time longer than permitted. Var\u00f3n appeared before the IJ with counsel, admitted the factual allegations contained in the NTA, and conceded removability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b893-19\">. The petitioners do not raise any challenge in their brief to the BIA\u2019s denial of protection under the CAT and have thus abandoned this claim. <em>See Sepulveda v.

Because the IJ found Varan to be credible, we accept the facts set forth in his asylum application and testimony as true for purposes of evaluating his asylum claim. <em>See Niftaliev v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that where the IJ finds the petitioner to be credible, his testimony must be accepted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b894-11\">.

The BIA in this case made no finding regarding whether the mistreatment Var\u00f3n suffered was \u201con account of\" his political opinion, and instead denied relief after concluding that the mistreatment did not amount to persecution. Because we agree that there was no persecution, it is unnecessary to remand for a determination of whether the mistreatment was or was not politically motivated. <em>Cf. Mejia v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1258 (11th Cir.2007) (finding persecution and remanding for a determination of whether the persecution was on account of petitioner\u2019s political opinion in the first instance).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b899-6\">. While these cases all involved the infliction of substantial physical harm, we have rejected a rigid requirement of physical injury. <em>Sanchez-Jimenez v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1233 (11th Cir.2007). Instead, we have held that serious physical injury is not required for a finding of persecution \u201cwhere the petitioner demonstrates repeated threats combined with other forms of severe mistreatment.\u201d <em>De Santamaria, 525 </em>F.3d at 1009.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b899-12\">. Because Var\u00f3n cannot meet the \"well-founded fear\" standard for asylum, he cannot meet the more stringent standard for establishing eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Mazariegos v.
