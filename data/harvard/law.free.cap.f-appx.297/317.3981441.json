The defendants moved for summary judgment based on Carter\u2019s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. The defendants asserted that Carter had not proceeded to the second step of the prison administrative remedy proceedings. The district court denied summary judgment because there was a genuine issue of material fact whether Carter had proceeded to the second step of the prison administrative remedy proceedings based on the information contained in Carter\u2019s verified complaint. The defendants appeal the denial of the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">Federal appellate courts have jurisdiction over appeals only from (1) final orders, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; (2) orders that are deemed final due to a jurisprudential exception, such as the collateral order doctrine; (3) certain specific types of interlocutory appeals, such as those where injunctive relief is involved pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292; and (4) interlocutory orders that are properly certified for appeal by the district court pursuant to Fed.R.CivP. 54(b) or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). <em>See Dardar v. Lafourche Realty Co., </em>849 F.2d 955, 957 (5th Cir.1988). The collateral order doctrine establishes that certain nonfinal decisions of the district court are effectively final even if they do not dispose of the litigation. <em>Brinar v. Williamson, </em>245 F.3d 515, 517 (5th Cir. 2001). The doctrine directs that \u201can order is appealable, notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment, if it is conclusive, resolves important questions that are separate from the merits, and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nothing in either side\u2019s brief suggests such a situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">In our court\u2019s February 6, 2008, briefing notice, the parties were specifically requested to address \u201cwhether the orders denying the motions to dismiss and for summary judgment ... from which appeal is taken, is [sic] appealable at this stage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the litigation.\u201d In their brief to this court, the defendants cite only 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, dealing with final judgments, as the basis for jurisdiction. An order denying a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment is not a final order or judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The defendants have not demonstrated grounds for jurisdiction in this court. The appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
