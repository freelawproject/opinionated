Durr, M.D. (Dr. Durr) appeals the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) dismissing his individual right of action (IRA) appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Durr v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>104 M.S.P.R. 509 (2007). This court <em>vacates and remands </em>the Board\u2019s decision relating to Dr. Durr\u2019s disclosures regarding computer services. However, this court <em>affirms </em>the Board\u2019s decision relating to Dr. Durr\u2019s disclosures regarding misuse of research time and money.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">Dr. Durr was employed as the Chief of Nephrology at Bay Pines Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC) in Bay Pines, Florida. Patient records at VAMC are kept via computer. Dr. Durr needed access to these records to perform his job duties. Frequent problems with VAMC\u2019s computer system hampered Dr. Durr\u2019s job duties. Although Dr. Durr complained to the Veteran\u2019s Administration Information Resource Management Services (IRMS) about these technical issues, IRMS failed to adequately resolve these problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">On June 17, 2003, in an act of frustration, Dr. Durr placed the non-working computer in a trash can outside of his office. Dr. Durr intended for this symbolic act to call attention to his complaint. The next day, Dr. Durr left a voice mail message for IRMS disclosing this incident. Dr. Durr alleges that his voicemail included a statement to IRMS that the \u201ctotal lack of support was hampering patient care.\u201d On July 14, 2003, Dr. Durr held a meeting with hospital executives to discuss the symbolic act and concerns regarding the computer system. On July 25, 2003, the VAMC Chief of Medicine sent a proposed admonishment to Dr. Durr, charging him with misuse of government property, disrespectful conduct and failure to cooperate during an official investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">In August 2003, Dr. Durr filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC). This complaint alleges that Dr. Durr made two protected disclosures to hospital personnel under the Whistleblower Protection Act: 1) that the non-functioning computer system created a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety; and 2) that VAMC\u2019s misuse of research funds and failure to give investigators required research time constituted gross mismanagement. Dr. Durr argued that hospital authorities threatened him with the proposed admonishment in reprisal for his whistleblowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-15\">The OSC denied Dr. Durr\u2019s complaint on November 18, 2003. In January 2004, Dr. Durr appealed to the Board. On March 19, 2004, the Administrative Judge (AJ) dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction finding that the agency had rescinded the proposed admonishment. On July 18, 2005, the Board vacated the initial decision and remanded the appeal for further consideration of jurisdictional issues. On April 4, 2006, the AJ found that Dr. Durr failed to make a protected disclosure, and that thei*e was no jurisdiction. On appeal for the second time, the Board modified the AJ\u2019s findings on January 24, 2007. Although the Board agreed that appellant failed to make a non-frivolous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>allegation of gross mismanagement, the Board disagreed with the AJ\u2019s conclusion that appellant had not made a non-frivolous allegation of a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. Nevertheless, the Board decided that remand was not necessary because appellant failed to set forth enough detail explaining how the protected disclosure contributed to the agency\u2019s proposed admonishment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">This court must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it is \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c); <em>Forest v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>47 F.3d 409, 410 (Fed.Cir.1995). Whether the Board has jurisdiction is a question of law which this court reviews de novo. <em>See id. </em>This court reviews the Board\u2019s factual determinations for substantial evidence. <em>Bolton v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>154 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed.Cir.1998). Thus, although this court may freely review whether the Board properly possessed jurisdiction, it is bound by the AJ\u2019s factual determinations unless those findings are not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 1316.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">The Board has jurisdiction over Dr. Durr\u2019s IRA appeal if he first exhausts his administrative remedies before the OSC and makes non-frivolous allegations that (1) he engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8), and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency\u2019s decision to take or fail to take a personnel action as defined by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a). <em>See Yunus v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed.Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">A \u201cprotected disclosure\u201d is a disclosure which \u201can employee ... reasonably believes evidences (i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8)(a) (2008). The test for determining whether a whistleblower has a reasonable belief in the.disclosure is objective: Whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee would reasonably conclude that the actions of the government evidence wrongdoing as defined by the Whistleblower Protection Act. <em>See Giove v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>230 F.3d 1333, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2000). A party cannot establish jurisdiction with general assertions but must provide substantive details. <em>See Ellison v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>7 F.3d 1031, 1036 (Fed.Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">With regard to the second prong, a protected disclosure is a \u201ccontributing factor\u201d in an agency\u2019s personnel action if it satisfies the knowledge/timing test set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221(e)(1):</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">The employee may demonstrate that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">(A) the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure; and</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">(B) the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-13\">5 USC \u00a7 1221(e)(1) (2008). According to the legislative history, satisfaction of the \u201cknowledge/timing\u201d test establishes <em>prima facie </em>that the disclosure is a contributing factor to the personnel action. <em>See Kewley v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>153 F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-14\">Here, it is undisputed that Dr. Durr exhausted his remedies before the OSC. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>Thus, the jurisdictional analysis focuses on whether Dr. Durr made a non-frivolous allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">\n<em>A. Dr. Durr\u2019s Disclosure Regarding the Non-Functioning Computer System</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">The Board found that Dr. Durr made a non-frivolous allegation of a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety with respect to the non-functioning computer system. Nevertheless, the Board concluded that remand for further adjudication was not necessary. This court agrees with the Board\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Dr. Durr made a non-frivolous allegation. However, the Board\u2019s decision improperly focuses on Dr. Durr\u2019s September 10, 2003 letter to OSC, which was sent following the personnel action in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">On appeal, the Board concedes that Dr. Durr made nonfrivolous allegations of protected disclosures occurring prior to the personnel action, including his June 18, 2003 voice mail message to the IRMS. Notably, the Board now \u201cconfesses error in its decision\u201d and requests this court to \u201cremand[ ] the case.... \u201d In view of the Board\u2019s concession, this court grants the Board\u2019s request, vaeates-in-part the Board\u2019s decision, and remands for proceedings on the merits of Dr. Durr\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">\n<em>B. Dr. Durr\u2019s Disclosure Regarding tlie Misuse of Research, Funds and Failure to Provide Required Research Time</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">The Board found that Dr. Durr did not make a non-frivolous allegation of gross mismanagement with respect to the agency\u2019s decisions regarding research funding and time. On appeal, appellant argues that the VAMC misused research funds. Specifically, the agency failed to give Dr. Durr protected research time and funds in violation of agency directives that require \u201cMedical Center Directors ... [to] ensure that investigators are allocated appropriate time ... to conduct funded research.\u201d The Board rejected appellant\u2019s argument because Dr. Durr failed to identify a misuse of research funds and time.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">This court requires that \u201csubstantive details establishing jurisdiction ... be alleged in the complaint.\u201d <em>Ellison, </em>7 F.3d at 1036. Here, appellant failed to disclose sufficient information to support a reasonable inference of wrongdoing. The Board found that appellant failed to identify any funded research that Dr. Durr had not been provided time to conduct and how the money was otherwise used. The AJ concluded that \u201c[b]ecause the appellant has not been provided time to conduct research does not necessarily mean that there has been any \u2018funded research\u2019 that the appellant was eligible to conduct.\u201d Similarly, that appellant \u201cwas not granted ... [research] funds does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the funds were misused.\u201d Because Dr. Durr has failed to identify what funded research he was eligible to conduct or how funds were misused, he has not made a non-frivolous allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b995-13\">This court vacates and remands the Board\u2019s decision with respect to the disclosure of a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety regarding the non-functioning computer system. This court affirms the Board\u2019s decision with respect to the disclosure of gross mismanagement regarding misuse of research time and money.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-14\">VACATE AND REMAND-IN-PART, AFFIRM-IN-PART</p>\n<p id=\"b995-15\">\n<em>COSTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b995-16\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
