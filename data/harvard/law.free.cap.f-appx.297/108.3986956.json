For the following reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-21\">Wang, a citizen of China, arrived in the United States in July 2005. Soon thereafter, Wang was served with a Notice to Appear charging him with being present in the United States without having been admitted or paroled. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)(i) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) ]. In response, Wang applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), claiming that he had been persecuted in China on account of his Christian faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-23\">In his application, Wang stated that he became interested in Christianity in 2002, when a stranger at a bookstore took him aside and gave him a copy of the Bible. (A.R.000262.) Wang explained that, after reading the Bible, he began attending church to learn more about Christianity. <em>(Id. </em>at 000268.) He initially attended certain government-controlled churches, but soon discovered that the government forced the clergymen in them churches to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>distort the meaning of the Bible in order to promote an anti-Christian agenda. (Id.) As a result, Wang decided to join an underground Christian church (a \u201cfamily church\u201d) instead. (Id.)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Wang further stated that, in March 2005, while he was attending services at a family church, five policemen disrupted the gathering. <em>(Id.) </em>The police confiscated the group\u2019s Bibles and took everyone to the police station for interrogation. (Id.) Wang stated that, when he refused to answer certain questions, the police beat him and kicked him. (Id.) Wang spent the night at the station without food, water, or a blanket, and, the following day, was forced to stamp his fingerprint upon a document agreeing to give up his faith. (Id.) According to Wang, the police also ordered him to provide the names and addresses of members of the church who were absent on the day of the raid. <em>(Id.) </em>He initially refused, and was beaten again. (Id.) Although Wang\u2019s statement is not entirely clear on this point, it appears that he then agreed to provide the names and addresses of some members, but not others. <em>(Id. </em>at 000264) Wang stated that he was released later that evening and warned not to attend any more family churches. Wang stated that he feared returning to China because he \u201cfailed to do what the police told [him].\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">On June 12, 2006, Wang appeared for a removal hearing before Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) Margaret R. Reichenberg. At the hearing, Wang testified about his membership in the Christian church and described the events surrounding his arrest in March 2005. The IJ, however, found Wang\u2019s testimony incredible, and denied relief. IJ Reichenberg described Wang as a very poor witness and noted that he frequently hesitated and struggled to provide answers to the questions presented. The IJ also found that there were a number of inconsistencies within his testimony as well as between his testimony and the statement accompanying his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Upon review, the BIA found no clear error in the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, and, by order entered November 29, 2007, affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of Wang\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. The present petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">We have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s order of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). When, as in this case, the. BIA substantially relies on the findings of the IJ, we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ. <em>See Xie v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 239, 242 (3d Cir.2004). We review these findings, including any credibility determinations, under a substantial evidence standard. <em>See Cao v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>407 F.3d 146, 152 (3d Cir.2005). An adverse credibility finding must be upheld unless \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Berishaj v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 314, 322 (3d Cir.2004) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)). Because Wang filed his application for relief after the enactment of the REAL ID Act of 2005, the BIA\u2019s credibility determinations are governed by the Act. <em>See Chukwu v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>484 F.3d 185, 189 (3d Cir.2007). Under the REAL ID Act, an IJ may base her credibility determination on observations of the applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of the applicant\u2019s story, and on the consistency of the applicant\u2019s statements. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>Gabuniya v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 316, 322 n. 7 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Upon review, we are satisfied that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determinations. First, as the BIA and IJ explained, there were several discrepancies between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Wang\u2019s application and his testimony at the removal hearing. For instance, while Wang\u2019s application stated that he was beaten twice during his detention in March 2005 (A.R.00026B), when he recounted the incident at the hearing, he mentioned only one beating. (A.R.000149-156.) When confronted with this inconsistency, Wang changed his testimony and added that he was, in fact, beaten a second time. (A.R. 00157-159.) Similarly, whereas Wang\u2019s application stated that he attended government-controlled churches before joining his family church (A.R.000263), he testified at the hearing that the only church he attended was his family church, the Xin Xin church. (A.R.000119-120.)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The BIA also pointed to inconsistencies within Wang\u2019s testimony on the day of the hearing. For example, Wang initially testified that seven or eight other members of the church were arrested with him in the March 2005 raid (A.R.000114), but later stated that there were only six others. (A.R.000126.) In addition, although he first told the court that police had visited his home \u201cvery frequently, four or five, four\u2014three or four times\u201d after his arrest (A.R.000129), he later testified that they came only twice. (A.R.00134.) Wang also testified at the hearing that his mother was summoned to the police station on April 19, 2005, and stated that he was no longer in the country at that time. (A.R. 000137.) When the government pointed out to him that he did not leave China until May 2005, he changed his story and added, for the first time, that he had gone into hiding for a period prior to leaving the country. (A.R.000138.)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In light of these inconsistencies, and deferring to the IJ\u2019s findings about Wang\u2019s demeanor, we cannot conclude that \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled\u201d to disagree with the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determinations. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Thus, we agree that Wang failed to establish eligibility for asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Given that Wang\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT were based on the same evidence as his asylum claim, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the denial of these claims as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
