For the reasons that follow, we will vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>On April 2, 2004, Karpiel initiated the underlying lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. In short order, Karpiel filed a complaint, an amended complaint, a second amended complaint, and a document entitled \u201camended complaint with some attachments added.\u201d Appellees moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). The District Court denied their motion, holding that Karpiel had sufficiently pled that Appel-lees had refused to allow her to roll over, transfer or withdraw her funds held in them 401k plan and, therefore, had stated a claim for enforcement under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">As explained by the District Court, there then ensued a protracted period of discovery during which Karpiel had to be ordered to attend her deposition. Approximately two years after the District Court denied Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss, they moved for summary judgment, arguing that Karpiel failed to exhaust her administrative remedies under their employee benefit plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d). The Court permitted Karpiel until July 5, 2007 to file a response, but she did not do so. On July 9, 2007, the District Court entered an opinion and order granting Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment based on Ap-pellees\u2019 assertion that Karpiel failed to exhaust her administrative remedies, and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over what appears to be a state law unlawful termination claim. Karpiel timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment, viewing the underlying facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the summary judgment motion. <em>Pennsylvania Coal Ass\u2019n v. Babbitt, </em>63 F.3d 231, 235 (3d Cir.1995). We have held that \u201cit is inappropriate to grant summary judgment in favor of a moving party who bears the burden of proof at trial unless a reasonable juror would be compelled to find its way on the facts needed to rule in its favor on the law.\u201d <em>See El v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transp. Auth., </em>479 F.3d 232, 238 (3d Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">ERISA itself does not contain an exhaustion requirement, but it does require covered benefit plans to provide administrative remedies for persons whose claims for benefits have been denied. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133; <em>see also Metropolitan, Life Ins. Co. v. Price, </em>501 F.3d 271, 279 (3d Cir.2007) (describing the ERISA exhaustion requirement as \u201ca judicial innovation with an eye toward \u2018sound policy\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, courts have long held that an ERISA plan participant must exhaust the administrative remedies available under the plan before seeking relief in federal court unless the participant can demonstrate that resort to the plan remedies would be futile. <em>See Harrow v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>279 F.3d 244, 249-51 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Weldon v. Kraft, </em>896 F.2d 793, 800 (3d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Exhaustion is an affirmative defense and, accordingly, the burden is on Appellees to demonstrate that Karpiel failed to exhaust her administrative remedies under the plan. <em>See Price, </em>501 F.3d at 280 (exhaustion requirement in ERISA enforcement action is \u201ca nonjurisdictional affirmative defense\u201d); <em>Jakimas v. Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., </em>485 F.3d 770, 782 (3d Cir. 2007) (summary judgment properly denied where moving party failed to meet burden of proving affirmative defense). In their summary judgment brief, Appellees state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>that \u201cthere is no record evidence that Plaintiff took the appropriate steps to exhaust her administrative remedies, as those remedies would have been defined in the plan documents.\u201d (Ae. Br., at 2.) Ap-pellees seem to rely on 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1024(b)(4), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The administrator shall, upon written request of any participant or beneficiary, furnish a copy of the latest updated summary plan description, and the latest annual report, any terminal report, the bargaining agreement, trust agreement, contract, or other instruments under which the plan is established or operated.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Appellees maintain that, because there is no \u2022 evidence in the record that Karpiel submitted a \u201cwritten request\u201d as required by this section, she failed to exhaust her remedies. It is not clear, and Appellees do not cite any support for the proposition, that this section applies to a plan participant seeking to roll over, transfer or withdraw the funds held in her 401k account, as Karpiel alleges she seeks to do here.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Under our case law, the appropriate question is what remedies are required <em>under the plan. See Harrow, </em>279 F.3d at 249. Unfortunately, Appellees fail to provide the Court with any information regarding the exhaustion requirements of the Plan, nor does their bald assertion that Karpiel has failed to exhaust demonstrate that she has, in fact, failed to exhaust. <em>See El v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, </em>479 F.3d 232, 237 (3d Cir.2007) (\u201cBecause SEPTA sought summary judgment on its affirmative defense of business necessity, it would bear the burden of proof at trial and therefore must show that it has produced enough evidence to support the findings of fact necessary to win.\u201d). While the District Court noted that Karpiel failed to come forth with any evidence in response to Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment indicating that she attempted to pursue her remedies under the Plan prior to filing the instant lawsuit, the burden only shifts to her to do so once Appellees, as the moving party, have \u201csuccessfully point[ed] to evidence of all of the facts needed to decide the case on the law short of trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238. In addition, we note that the record contains at least two documents which call into question Appel-lees assertion. <em>(See </em>Supp. Appx., at 103-104.) Although we cannot say with certainty that these letters satisfy the requirements of the Plan, as we have not been apprised of what those requirements are, they do appear to be written requests for distribution forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Because Appellees have not met their burden of demonstrating that Karpiel failed to exhaust her administrative remedies under the Plan, we will vacate and remand the judgment of the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
