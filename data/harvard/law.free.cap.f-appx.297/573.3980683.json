Reviewing the record de novo and taking all facts alleged in the complaint as true, <em>see Carter v. Arkansas, </em>392 F.3d 965, 968 (8th Cir.2004) (standard of review for Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) dismissals); <em>Cooper v. Schriro, </em>189 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (standard of review for 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A dismissals), we conclude that the district court properly dismissed the complaint, because the various claims Knox alleged either rely on legal conclusions rather than supporting facts, or simply do not state an actionable wrong, <em>see Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 1969 <em>&amp; </em>nn. 3, 8, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); <em>Stone v. Harry, </em>364 F.3d 912, 914 (8th Cir.2004); <em>Martin v. Sargent, </em>780 F.2d 1334, 1337 (8th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-15\">Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal, but we modify it to be without prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-13\">.
