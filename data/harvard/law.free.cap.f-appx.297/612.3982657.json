We have juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>diction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Washington contends that the district court erred in applying an enhancement for brandishing a firearm pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii), because he did not personally brandish, or aid and abet the brandishing of a firearm, and because co-conspirator liability under <em>Pinkerton v. United States, </em>828 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946), is inapplicable to sentencing enhancements. However, co-conspirator liability extends to findings necessary to establish statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums for sentencing purposes, <em>see United States v. Banuelos, </em>322 F.3d 700, 704 (9th Cir.2003), and accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in applying the enhancement,.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Washington further contends that the district court incorrectly treated the Sentencing Guidelines as a locus from which to deviate, failed to evaluate the factors set forth by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 in light of the totality of the sentence, and failed to address \u00a7 3553 factors that related to him as an individual. In light of the record, we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 991 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc). We also conclude that the sentence imposed was reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>See id. </em>at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b638-27\"> The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
