The district court dismissed Idahosa\u2019s suit for failure to state a claim because Title VII does not apply to uniformed members of the military. <em>See Idahosa v. Blagojevich, </em>No. 05-1160 (C.D.Ill.2006) <em>(Idahosa I). </em>Rather than appeal the dismissal, Idahosa filed a new complaint in August 2006 raising many of the same issues but requesting declaratory and injunctive relief under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Administrative Procedures Act (APA). <em>See Idahosa v. Blagojevich, </em>No. 06-1084, 2007 WL 1455779 (C.D.Ill.2007) <em>(Idahosa </em>II). The district court dismissed the new action as nonjusticiable and barred by the doctrine of res judicata (claim preclusion). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Idahosa\u2019s brief on appeal reiterates many of the arguments he made to the district court. With regard to the court\u2019s application of claim preclusion, he argues that his claim is not precluded because it was not dismissed on the merits, but rather for failure to state a claim. Claim preclusion prevents parties from relitigating claims that could have been (or were) raised in an earlier lawsuit that resulted in a final judgment on the merits. <em>Cole v. Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Ill., </em>497 F.3d 770, 772 (7th Cir.2007). The doctrine applies where:\u201d(l) a final judgment on the merits was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) there is an identity of causes of action; and (3) there is an identity of parties or their privies.\u201d <em>In re Dollie\u2019s Playhouse, Inc., </em>481 F.3d 998,1001 (7th Cir.2007); <em>see Ross v. Bd. of Educ. of Twp. High Sch. Dist. 211, </em>486 F.3d 279, 283 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">All three criteria are met. First, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Idahosa\u2019s complaint in <em>Idahosa I </em>was a final judgment on the merits. That the district court did not reach the merits is of no consequence;\u201d dismissal for failure to state a claim is a decision on the merits.\u201d <em>Davis v. Lambert, </em>388 F.3d 1052,1058 (7th Cir.2004). Second, as the district court noted, Idahosa\u2019s claim in <em>Idahosa I </em>and <em>Idahosa II </em>arise from the \u201csame core of operative facts.\u201d <em>Highway J Citizens Group v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>456 F.3d 734, 741 (7th Cir.2006). In both cases Idahosa alleged that the IANG denied him wage increases, refused to investigate his charges of discrimination, and discharged him on the basis of his race, gender, and national origin. Merely changing legal theories, from Title VII in <em>Idahosa I </em>to the APA in <em>Idahosa II, </em>does not create a new claim. <em>See Cole, </em>497 F.3d at 773; <em>Brzostowski v. Laidlaw Waste Sys., Inc., </em>49 F.3d 337, 339 (7th Cir.1995). Finally, most of the named defendants in this case-including Governor Blagojevich, the IANG, Donald Rumsfeld, and the United States Air Force-were also named in <em>Idahosa I. </em>And those defendants added to this case, such as IANG officials Jeffery Yemm and Phillip Shelton, are in privity with those named in <em>Idahosa I. See Tartt v. Nw. Cmty. Hosp., </em>453 F.3d 817, 822-23 (7th Cir.2006); <em>Licari v. City of Chicago, </em>298 F.3d 664, 667 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Accordingly, Idahosa\u2019s claims are precluded and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
