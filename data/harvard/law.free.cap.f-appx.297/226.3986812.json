He appeals his sentence, asserting that it was unreasonable and claiming that the district court failed to provide a sufficient statement of reasons for the sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-16\">Flores-Anseneio did not contest the adequacy of the district court\u2019s explanation for his sentence below, thus we review for plain error his present claim on appeal. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). When reviewing a sentence for reasonableness, we first determine whether the district court committed any procedural error, such as failing to calculate the guideline range properly, consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or explain the sentence adequately, and then decide whether the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). While a district court must consider the various \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explain its sentence, it need not explicitly reference \u00a7 3553 or discuss every factor on the record, particularly when the court imposes a sentence within the guideline range. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006). Here, the district Court followed the necessary procedural steps. It is clear from the record that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors with respect to this defendant and that it considered Flores-Ansencio\u2019s arguments at sentencing. There was no need for further elaboration by the district court. <em>See United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The appeals court must also consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. A sentence within a properly calculated guideline range, as Flores-Anseneio\u2019s sentence was, may be accorded a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Flores-Ansencio does not contest the calculation of his guideline range, and the district court sentenced him within the properly-calculated range. As noted, the district court imposed the sentence after considering the arguments at the sentencing hearing, including Flores-Ansencio\u2019s request for leniency, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court expressly rejected his request for leniency, noting that Flores-Ansencio had failed to take advantage of the numerous opportunities for leniency previously received and that his previous deportation did not deter him from re-entering the country illegally. We conclude that his sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
