Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review factual findings for substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>evidence. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We review due process challenges to immigration decisions de novo. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004). We review an IJ\u2019s denial of a motion for a continuance for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Sandoval-Luna v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir. 2008). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Legas-pi\u2019s contention that the IJ erred in denying his asylum and withholding of removal claims because Legaspi failed to exhaust his challenge to the IJ\u2019s dispositive terrorist bar finding before the BIA. <em>See Barron, </em>358 F.3d at 677-78. Further, because he did not raise CAT before the BIA, this claim is also unexhausted. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">We conclude that the IJ did not abuse his discretion by refusing to grant the motion to continue. <em>See Sandoval-Luna, </em>526 F.3d at 1247. Further, Legaspi\u2019s due process claim fails because he has not established prejudice. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b664-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
