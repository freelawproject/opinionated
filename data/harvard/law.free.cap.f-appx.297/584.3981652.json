R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b611-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">This is a petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order denying petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen and reconsider removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">We review the BIA\u2019s ruling on a motion to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Perez v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">An alien who is subject to a final order of removal is limited to filing one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). A motion to reconsider must be filed within 30 days of the date of entry of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen and reconsider was filed almost two yeai*s after the final administrative decision, and therefore beyond the deadlines. Petitioner contends that the 90-day deadline for the motion to reopen does not apply because petitioner sought to reopen the proceedings on the basis of changed country conditions. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The BIA did not abuse its discretion, however, in denying the motion to reopen as untimely because petitioner did not demonstrate that the exception to the 90-day deadline applied. <em>See Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 988, 996-97 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-15\">We <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss in part this petition for review because this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen proceedings <em>sua sponte. See Ekimian v. I.N.S., </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159-60 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-16\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b611-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
