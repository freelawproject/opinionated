Where, as here, the BIA adopts the I J\u2019s decision and adds its own reasoning, we review both decisions together. <em>See Quomsieh v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 602, 605 (8th Cir.2007). After careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-20\">Although the decision to grant adjustment of status is an unreviewable discretionary act by the Attorney General, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), the nondiscretionary determinations underlying such a decision are subject to our review, <em>see Pinos-Gonzalez v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 436, 439 (8th Cir.2008). We agree with the IJ that Kidane did not establish that her failure to maintain continuous lawful status since entering the United States\u2014as is required for adjustment of status\u2014was due to a technical reason, because she did not show that she was physically unable to request an extension of her non-immigrant stay. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c)(2) (alien who has failed to maintain continuously lawful status since entry is ineligible for adjustment of status, unless failure was through no fault of her own or for \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.1(d)(2)(iii) (\u201ctechnical reasons\u201d include \u201ctechnical violation caused by the physical inability of the applicant to request an extension of non-immigrant stay from the [INS] either in person or by mail (as, for example, an individual who is hospitalized with an illness at the time non-immigrant stay expires)\u201d). We conclude that <em>Mart v. Beebe, </em>No. 99-1391, 2001 WL 13624 (D.Or. Jan.5, 2001), on which Kidane relies, is neither binding, <em>see United States v. Auginash, </em>266 F.3d 781, 784 (8th Cir.2001); <em>Matter of K-S-, </em>20 I &amp; N Dec. 715, 718-20 (BIA 1993), nor persuasive because, unlike the petitioners in <em>Mart, </em>Kidane took no action for two years after expiration of her non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>immigrant visa to preserve her legal status, <em>see Mart, </em>2001 WL 13624, at *5-*6.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the determination that Kidane\u2019s asylum application was barred as untimely filed, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Purwantono v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 822, 824 (8th Cir.2007), and we conclude the denials of withholding of removal and CAT relief are supported by substantial evidence in the record, <em>see Ezeagwu v. Mukasey, </em>537 F.3d 836, 839 (8th Cir.2008) (standard of review for withholding-of-removal claim); <em>Ming Ming Wijono v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 868, 874 (8th Cir.2006) (standard of review for CAT claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
