For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-28\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b345-29\">Plaintiff Derrick McGee was arrested in January 2005 and charged in Hudspeth County, Texas, with possession of a controlled substance. He was released on bond but, after failing to appear at a scheduled court hearing, his bond was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>voked and a warrant was issued. McGee was arrested in California and extradited to Hudspeth County on June 6, 2005. McGee alleges that, on that same day, all of the state\u2019s charges were dismissed and no additional charges were filed. Nonetheless, Sheriff Arvin West held McGee in Hudspeth County until June 9, 2005, when West transferred McGee to Sheriff Oscar Carrillo in Culberson County, Texas, pursuant to an Interlocal Agreement between the two counties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> McGee alleges that he was held in Culberson County jail until July 11, 2005, when he was transferred back to Hudspeth. The next day, he was released from Hudspeth County jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">On July 11, 2007, McGee filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint in the Western District of Texas against (i) West, individually and in his capacity as Sheriff of Hud-speth County; (ii) Hudspeth County; (iii) Carrillo, individually and in his capacity as Sheriff of Culberson County; and (iv) Cul-berson County. The complaint alleges that both West and Carrillo had illegally detained him for thirty-six days. McGee claimed that such detention constituted a \u201cviolation of his clearly established rights to be free of unreasonable seizure\u201d and a \u201cdeprivation of liberty without due process of law\u201d under the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Such conduct, he stated, was \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">On August 24, 2007, Carrillo filed a Rule 12(b) Motion to Dismiss alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that he was entitled to qualified immunity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 17, 2007, the district court denied Carrillo\u2019s motion. The district court held that Carrillo had failed to adduce any facts demonstrating that he had the lawful authority to hold McGee during the relevant time period. The court noted the limited discretion that a jailer has under Texas law to hold an individual in jail, and held that Carrillo had failed to demonstrate that he acted within that discretion in holding McGee after all charges were dropped. Citing numerous cases in this circuit and elsewhere, the court also held that McGee had successfully alleged a constitutional violation based on the right to be free from illegal detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">The denial of a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds is part of a</p>\n<p id=\"A8X\">\u201csmall class of district court decisions that, though short of final judgment, are immediately appealable because they finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\"><em>Atteberry v. Nocona Gen. Hasp., </em>430 F.3d 245, 251 (5th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Behrens v. Pelletier, </em>516 U.S. 299, 305, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted)). This court reviews de novo a court\u2019s refusal to dismiss a case on grounds of qualified immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 252 (citing <em>Wilkerson v. Stalder, </em>329 F.3d 431, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>434 (5th Cir.2003)). \u201cWhen reviewing a denial of qualified immunity on an interlocutory appeal, we are restricted to determinations of \u2018question[s] of law' and \u2018legal issues,\u2019 and we do not consider \u2018the correctness of the plaintiff\u2019s version of the facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 251-52 (quoting <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 528, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) (alteration in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The qualified immunity defense protects government officials from civil liability when they perform discretionary acts that are objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law. <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982); <em>Thompson v. Upshur County, </em>245 F.3d 447, 456 (5th Cir.2001). Qualified immunity does not protect government officials who disregard or ignore \u201csettled, indisputable law.\u201d <em>Wood v. Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 321, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">This court requires a government official invoking the qualified immunity defense to show both that he acted in good faith and that such action was within the scope of his discretionary authority. <em>Salas v. Carpenter, </em>980 F.2d 299, 306 (5th Cir.1992). With regard to the good faith requirement, the defendant must \u201cdemonstrate that he acted with a good faith belief that his actions were within his lawful authority, and that reasonable grounds existed for this belief based upon objective circumstances at the time he acted.\u201d <em>Douthit v. Jones, </em>619 F.2d 527, 534 (5th Cir.1980). A defendant cannot show good faith, in contrast, if he provides a \u201cmere statement\u201d that he believed in good faith that he acted lawfully. <em>Id. </em>at 536. For example, in <em>Douthit </em>this court ruled that a sheriff and deputy were not entitled to qualified immunity when they held a prisoner in jail beyond his sentence for failing to pay a fine. <em>Id. </em>at 535-37. In that case, the sheriff and deputy merely stated that they believed in good faith that their actions were lawful and failed to produce any meaningful documentation that might justify their belief. <em>Id. </em>It is the lack of such documentation on which this appeal founders.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">We set out Carrillo\u2019s argument that he successfully pleaded that he acted in good faith and within the scope of his discretionary authority. First, he argues that his sole discretionary act was housing McGee pursuant to the Interlocal Agreement, which was made under Texas Government Code \u00a7 791.011. Cai\u2019rillo further suggests that the Interlocal Agreement establishes Hudspeth County\u2019s legal authority over McGee, and thus \u201cat no time\u201d was McGee held under the authority of Culberson County or Sheriff Carrillo. Finally, he argues against McGee\u2019s claim that he had a \u201cministerial\u201d duty to release a prisoner by reasoning that cases such as <em>Douthit, </em>which confirmed prison officials\u2019 non-dele-gable duty to incarcerate only prisoners committed by a lawful authority, did not contemplate a situation where one county houses the prisoners of another. Thus, Carrillo argues, he acted in good faith pursuant to the Interlocal Agreement and acted in his discretion by accepting McGee to his jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">In the present case, the district court was correct in denying Carrillo\u2019s Motion to Dismiss because Carrillo has failed to demonstrate that he acted in good faith and within his discretion when he incarcerated McGee after the charges against McGee were dropped. The record as it currently stands lacks the Interlocal Agreement between Culberson and Hud-speth Counties, the original capias ordering McGee into custody, and any other relevant documentation that could guide a court as to whether or not Carrillo was acting in good faith in a matter committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>to his discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To ask for more is not to commit this case to trial. But it is to say that the case needs to move to the summary judgment stage, with its associated discovery, before the district court will be able to assess whether Carrillo acted in good faith in reliance on the capi-as under which McGee was held or on the terms of the Interlocal Agreement (which, according to according to Texas Government Code \u00a7 791.011(d)(2), must \u201cstate the purpose, terms, rights, and duties of the contracting parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">We agree with the district court that Carrillo \u201cmay ultimately demonstrate that he [acted] pursuant to what he believed was a lawful agreement and pursuant to lawful charges.\u201d Indeed, we are mindful that the qualified immunity defense \u201cprotects the public\u2019s interest in enforcement of the laws by ensuring that the threat of liability will not deter an executive official from exercising his discretion and performing his official duties.\u201d <em>Douthit, </em>619 F.2d at 534. Carrillo\u2019s argument about the desirability of granting qualified immunity to sheriffs who temporarily house prisoners from other counties is understandable. But it is premature. We are confined to the pleadings for the purposes of ruling on this appeal, and neither good faith nor discretion has been adequately pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the Order of the district court; costs shall be borne by Carrillo.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-6\">. Texas Government Code \u00a7 791.011(a) states that ''[a] local government may contract or agree with another local government ... to perform governmental functions and services in accordance with this chapter.\u201d Such functions and services include police protection and detention services, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 791.003(3)(A), and an interlocal agreement may authorize a local government to \"provide a governmental function or service that each party to the contract is authorized to perform individually,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 791.011(c)(2).
