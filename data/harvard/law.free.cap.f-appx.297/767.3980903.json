GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AmP\">Coby Warren\u2019s habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 seeks \u201cabsolute discharge\u201d from the sentence imposed on him by the New Mexico courts for the several domestic violence offenses to which he pled no contest under a plea agreement. Mr. Warren is a <em>pro se </em>litigant, and so we construe his pleadings and other papers generously. <em>Van Deelen v. Johnson, </em>497 F.3d 1151, 1153 n. 1 (10th Cir.2007). He appears to allege that the manner in which his plea agreement was accepted did not comport with New Mexico law or Fed. R. Crim.P. 11; that certain clerical errors contained on the state court\u2019s sentencing forms render his convictions void; and that the sentences accompanying his several convictions ought not to run consecutively. The district court referred Mr. Warren\u2019s petition to a magistrate judge, who recommended denial of the petition in all respects. R., vol. II, at 586. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report, and dismissed Mr. Warren\u2019s petition on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 635. Mr. Warren now seeks to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-16\">A state prisoner rpay not appeal a district court\u2019s final order in a habeas corpus proceeding without first obtaining a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) from this court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). This requirement is jurisdictional. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). A COA will issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To satisfy this standard, the applicant must demonstrate that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S. Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (citations omitted). Our inquiry under this standard does not require a \u201cfull consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>ation of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of [the petitioner\u2019s] claims,\u201d but, rather, \u201can overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029; <em>United States v. Springfield, </em>337 F.3d 1175, 1177 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Mr. Warren\u2019s application for a COA asks us to review \u201call claims in the original petition.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Application for COA at 6. He has also filed with this court a motion for injunctive relief that appears to largely duplicate his habeas petition; we will treat it as part of his application for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">We do not think reasonable jurists could debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s resolution of Mr. Warren\u2019s petition, nor do we think we could improve on the magistrate judge\u2019s thoughtful fourteen-page analysis adopted by the district court. R., vol. II, at 573-86, 635. To summarize, the district court concluded that Mr. Warren\u2019s claims predominantly allege violations of state law, and that this cannot be a proper basis for federal habeas relief. That is undoubtedly correct. <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (\u201c[Federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law.\u201d) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Jeffers, </em>497 U.S. 764, 780, 110 S.Ct. 3092, 111 L.Ed.2d 606 (1990)). The district court also rejected Mr. Warren\u2019s assertion that New Mexico\u2019s failure to adhere to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 when it accepted his plea agreement violated the Constitution, explaining that because Rule 11 does not govern state courts, it cannot be a basis on which to challenge a state conviction, R., vol. II, at 634; that, too, is undoubtedly correct, <em>Miles v. Dorsey, </em>61 F.3d 1459, 1467 (10th Cir.1995) (Rule 11 does not apply in state courts), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1062, 116 S.Ct. 743, 133 L.Ed.2d 692 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Finally, the remainder of Mr. Warren\u2019s allegations reflect attempts to argue that putative state-law infractions (such as uncorrected errors or omissions on the state court\u2019s judgment forms) constitute Fourteenth Amendment due process violations; the district court resolved these allegations by making factual findings that the troublesome omissions on the state court\u2019s forms clearly reflected clerical oversights, not an actual failure to \u2014 for example \u2014 take the defendant\u2019s plea. <em>See </em>R., vol. II, at 577-83. Because these findings are based on the magistrate judge\u2019s study of the state court\u2019s record, we have independently examined that record, <em>see Tyler v. Nelson, </em>163 F.3d 1222, 1226-27 (10th Cir.1999) and conclude that, on the record before us, no reasonable jurist could question that the magistrate judge got it right.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Accordingly, and for substantially the same reasons given by the district court, Mr. Warren\u2019s request for a COA must be denied. His motion for injunctive relief, to the extent it is not part of his application for a COA, is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b794-13\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
