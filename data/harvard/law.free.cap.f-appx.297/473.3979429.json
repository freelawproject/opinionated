The district court enhanced Lobbins\u2019s United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cthe Guidelines\u201d) range after finding by a preponderance of the evidence that he used the firearm in connection with an unlawful restraint. It then sentenced him to a 120-month prison term and three years of supervised release. Lobbins argues on appeal that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury when it found that he unlawfully restrained his victim. Because the Sixth Circuit has repeatedly rejected this argument, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">On May 16, 2007, a jury convicted Lob-bins of being a felon in possession of a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). On July 2, the United States Probation Office completed a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cthe PSR\u201d) calculating Lobbins\u2019s base offense level at 20. The office adjusted the level to 82 pursuant to the cross-reference provision of \u00a7 2K2.1(e)(l)(A) of the Guidelines because Lobbins used the firearm in connection with an unlawful restraint. It then recommended enhancing to level 38 because he used a dangerous weapon to cause serious bodily injury to a vulnerable victim. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2A4.1(b)(2)(B), 2A4.1(b)(3), 3Al.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">On August 21, 2007, the district court held a sentencing hearing where it adopted the PSR\u2019s recommendations. The court concluded by a preponderance of the evidence that Lobbins used the firearm in connection with an unlawful restraint. In conjunction with the other enhancements, this resulted in a Guidelines range of 262 to 327 months. The court sentenced Lob-bins to 120 months in prison and three years of supervised release. He then appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">We review constitutional challenges to a defendant\u2019s sentence de novo. <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>321 F.3d 582, 601 (6th Cir.2003). Lobbins contends that the Sixth Amendment prohibits a district court from applying a sentencing cross-reference based on a preponderance of the evidence standard. He argues that only a jury may make that determination. To be sure, a fact that increases a sentence beyond the statutory maximum must be determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>United States v. Crowell, </em>493 F.3d 744, 749 (6th Cir.2007). But Lobbins\u2019s sentence is not beyond the maximum, and Sixth Circuit caselaw unambiguously permits the court to make sentencing-related findings of fact by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">This circuit has repeatedly held that no Sixth Amendment violation occurs when a district court applies a cross-reference to a crime not charged in the indictment based upon the preponderance-of-the-evidenee standard. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brika, </em>487 F.3d 450, 454-57 (6th Cir.2007) (applying kidnapping cross-reference to a charge of using a telephone to extort money in exchange for the release of a kidnapped person); <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>261 F. App\u2019x 849, 852 (6th Cir.2008) (applying a cross-reference for attempted murder to a defendant charged as a felon in possession of a firearm). Sixth Circuit authority is contrary to Lobbins\u2019s assertion that judicial factfinding at sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>by a preponderance of the evidence is unconstitutional, and so we reject his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Having rejected Lobbins\u2019s Sixth Amendment argument, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
