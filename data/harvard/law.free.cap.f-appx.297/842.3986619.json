On March 11, 2008, appellant moved the district court to reduce his sentences pursuant to the authority granted the district court by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582. The motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which retroactively reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. The district court denied his motion on the ground that, because appellant was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum sentences, Amendment 706 could provide him no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">Section 3582(c)(2) states that</p>\n<p id=\"adt-dedup-0\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment ... if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) (Supp. Mar. 3, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">Amendment 706 allows a defendant to seek a reduction in his sentence if that sentence was based on the \u00a7 2D 1.1 offense level for crack cocaine offenses. However, a defendant whose original sentence was based on something other than \u00a7 2D 1.1 is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction, since the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guidelines range. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326-28 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). This occurs, for example, where the defendant was sentenced to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See Moore, </em>at 1327-27 (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n. 1(A)) (noting that the operation of another guideline or statutory provision, such as \u201ca statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment,\u201d would prevent the crack cocaine amendment from having the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range)).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>Because appellant was subject to statutory mandatory minimum sentences of 240 months, the court was precluded from granting him \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
