R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-23\">Jeffrey T. Martin (\u201cMartin\u201d), acting <em>pro se, </em>appeals the United States Tax Court\u2019s dismissal of his petition. The Tax Court dismissed the petition for failure to conform to Tax Ct. R. 34(b)(4), (5) and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-24\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b762-25\">In 2007, the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) notified Martin by letter that he had a tax deficiency of $7203 for the 2000 tax year and was subject to penalties totaling $1066.85 under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6651(a)(1), (2). Martin filed a petition in the Tax Court to contest this determination. Martin asserted that he was neither involved in interstate commerce nor an employee of the federal government, and that the IRS failed to provide a sufficient legal basis for taxing him. Although Martin did not challenge or address the specific calculations of his tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>deficiency, Martin requested the Tax Court reduce his deficiency to zero dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The Commissioner filed a motion to dismiss Martin\u2019s petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. This motion noted that the petition did not allege any facts regarding the tax deficiency at issue for the 2000 tax year. Considering this motion, the Tax Court ordered Martin to file an amended petition that contained specific challenges to the deficiency calculations and to allege the necessary, related facts. The Tax Court also set a hearing for the motion to dismiss to be held in February 2008 in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Martin filed an amended petition. The amended petition did not directly challenge the deficiency calculation or allege any errors or facts related to those calculations. Instead, the amended petition incorporated the original petition by reference, asserted that the Commissioner bears the burden of proof at trial, and requested his tax liability be reduced to zero dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Additionally, Martin filed a response brief opposing the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss. Martin argued that: (1) opposing counsel lacked standing because counsel did not prove that he took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States; and (2) the Commissioner has the burden of proof. Martin did not appear at the hearing regarding the motion to dismiss. The Tax Court granted the motion to dismiss and found that Martin owed a tax deficiency in the amount of $7203 and was subject to additional'amounts under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 6651(a)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">On appeal, Martin argues that the Commissioner and the Tax Court refused to identify the legal basis for his tax deficiency. Martin also contends that the Commissioner failed to establish that the \u201cgains of his own labor were received from a federal venue.\u201d Appt. Br. at 6. Martin challenges the Tax Court\u2019s decision to conduct the hearing regarding the motion to dismiss in Washington, D.C. Lastly, Martin accuses the Tax Court, and possibly this court, of treason.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">The Commissioner responds that the Tax Court correctly dismissed Martin\u2019s petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The Commissioner asserts that the petition did not satisfy the requirements of Tax Ct. R. 34(b), noting \u201c[ijnstead of raising a justiciable claim of error in the Commissioner\u2019s determination, [Martin] challenged the Commissioner\u2019s authority to collect income taxes from him at all.\u201d Appe. Br. at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>the Tax Court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>Fox v. Comm\u2019r, </em>969 F.2d 951, 952 (10th Cir.1992). Accordingly, we apply the same standard as a district court would in the first instance. <em>Id. </em>(citing 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a)). Because Martin proceeds <em>pro se, </em>we construe his pleadings liberally. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-14\">In response to Martin\u2019s contentions, we begin with the rules of the Tax Court. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453 (stating that \u201cthe proceedings of the Tax Court ... shall be conducted in accordance with such rules of practice and procedure ... as the Tax Court may prescribe.... \u201d). Rule 34(b) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b763-15\">The petition in a deficiency or liability action shall contain [ ]: ...</p>\n<p id=\"b763-16\">(4) Clear and concise assignments of each and every error which the petitioner alleges to have been committed by the Commissioner in the determination of the deficiency or liability. The assignments of error shall include issues in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>respect of which the burden of proof is on the Commissioner. Any issue not raised in the assignments of error shall be deemed to be conceded. Each assignment of error shall be separately lettered.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">(5) Clear and concise lettered statements of the facts on which the petitioner bases the assignments of error, except with respect to those assignments of error as to which the burden of proof is on the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">We agree with the Tax Court\u2019s finding that Martin\u2019s petitions do not satisfy the requirements of Rule 34(b)(4) and (5). Martin does not identify any errors related to the determination of his tax deficiency in his petition, the amended petition, or his present filings. The statement, \u201cThe assignments of error shall include issues in respect of which the burden of proof is on the Commissioner,\u201d directly refutes Martin\u2019s repeated argument that he need not identify specific errors because the burden of proof is on the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Instead of providing specific arguments to contest his tax deficiency, Martin challenges the Commissioner\u2019s ability to impose any tax on him because he is a citizen \u201cof the several states,\u201d but not a \u201cfederal U.S. citizen.\u201d Appt. Br. at 6. This argument is frivolous. \u201cThe federal government\u2019s taxation power is not limited to the District of Columbia or other federal enclaves.\u201d <em>Gallegos v. Comm\u2019r, </em>150 Fed. Appx. 846, 847 (10th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Collins, </em>920 F.2d 619, 629 (10th Cir.1990), for the statement, \u201cFor seventy-five years, the Supreme Court has recognized that the sixteenth amendment authorizes a direct nonapportioned [income] tax upon United States citizens throughout the nation, not just in federal enclaves, ..., efforts to argue otherwise have been sanctioned as frivolous.\u201d). Martin\u2019s remaining arguments \u2014 regarding the location of the hearing and accusations of treason \u2014 are also frivolous and do not merit further discussion. <em>E.g. Malan v. Comm\u2019r, </em>261 Fed.Appx. 117, 119 (10th Cir. 2008) (characterizing an argument that \u201cthe Tax Court failed to honor [petitioner\u2019s] designation of the place of trial\u201d as lacking merit \u201cand/or\u201d frivolous).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">By not identifying how the Commissioner erred in the determination of his tax deficiency, Martin\u2019s petition failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b762-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
