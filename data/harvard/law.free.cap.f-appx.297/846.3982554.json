Belle argues that notice should have been sent to a Pennsylvania address, which was known to the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> through its use in his other immigration matters, instead of the Georgia address he listed in his application for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-18\">In this case, the BIA did not expressly adopt the decision of the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d). Therefore, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cIn this area, the BIA\u2019s discretion is quite broad.\u201d <em>Gbaya v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>342 F.3d 1219, 1220 (11th Cir. 2003) (internal quotations omitted). Our review here \u201cis limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Ali, </em>443 F.3d at 808 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-19\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1), \u201cwritten notice ... shall be given in person to an alien (or, if personal service is not practicable, through service by mail to the alien or to the alien\u2019s counsel of record, if any)....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1). The written notice must contain, among other things, a statement requiring the alien to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>provide a written record of an address and telephone number and any change in the address and telephone number to the Attorney General at which he may be contacted regarding the removal proceedings, the time and place at which the proceedings will be held, and the consequences of failing to appear. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229(a)(l)(F)(i)-(iii), (G)(i)-(ii). Any change or postponement in the time and place of the proceedings must also be by written notice. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">An alien has an affirmative duty to provide DHS with written notification of a change in address within ten days of the change. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(a). The regulations require the change of address to be reported on a Form AR-11. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 265.1. The regulations also require the alien to provide written notice of a change of address on Form EOIR-33 to the Immigration Court where the charging document has been filed. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.15(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">A removable alien, who has been provided sufficient written notice of the proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 1229(a)(1) or (2), and who does not attend a proceeding under this section, shall be ordered removed <em>in absentia. </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A). Written notice \u201cshall be considered sufficient for purposes of this subparagraph if provided at the most recent address provided under section 1229(a)(1)(F) of this title.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, no notice is required if the alien failed to provide an address as required under section 1229(a)(1)(F). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229a(b)(B). \u201cService by mail ... shall be sufficient if there is proof of attempted delivery to the last address provided by the alien in accordance with subsection <em>(a)(1)(F)....\u201dId. </em>\u00a7 1229(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">An <em>in absentia </em>order may be rescinded upon: (1) \u201ca motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances,\u201d or (2) \u201ca motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of this title or the alien demonstrates that the alien was in Federal or State custody and the failure to appear was through no fault of the alien.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). A motion to reopen must \u201cbe supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">In <em>Dominguez v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>284 F.3d 1258, 1260-61 (11th Cir.2002), we held that \u201c[t]he statute clearly provides that notice to the alien at the most recent address provided by the alien is sufficient notice, and that there can be an <em>in absentia </em>removal after such notice.\u201d We concluded that \u201c[flailing to provide the [DHS] with a change of address will preclude the alien from claiming that the [DHS] did not provide him or her with notice of a hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(noting that the alien had provided no proof that a handwritten notation of her alleged current address was made part of her file).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\"><em>In re G-Y-R-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 181, 182 (BIA 2001), the alien undisputedly did not receive the notice to appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) because it was returned by the postal service. When the alien failed to appear, the IJ terminated the proceedings without prejudice. <em>Id. </em>On the Government\u2019s appeal, the BIA concluded that notice sent to an address provided by the alien six years prior to the date of the NTA to appear did not satisfy the statutory notice requirements and reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">If the alien actually receive[d] or <em>can be charged until receiving </em>[the NTA], then the address used by the Service qualifies as a section [1229(a)(1)(F) ] address, and in absentia proceedings are ... authorized. If, however, we know that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>alien did not receive the [NTA] and the notice of hearing it contains, then the alien cannot be on notice of either removal proceedings or the address obligations particular to removal proceedings. In that instance, the address used by the Service cannot qualify as a section [1229(a)(1)(F) ] address, and the entry of an in absentia order is precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 189-90 (emphasis added) (involving time period when use of certified mail was required).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1805(a), 1229, Belle\u2019s last known address for purposes of the removal proceedings was his Georgia address. Because service by mailing the notice to appear and notice of hearing to this last known address was a statutorily authorized method of service and reasonably calculated to ensure proper notice, and because Belle failed to appear at the scheduled hearing, the IJ was authorized to proceed <em>in absentia </em>and order his removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A). Since the notice to appear was mailed to his last known address and he failed to provide the DHS or the Immigration Court with a change of address, Belle was precluded from claiming that officials did not provide him with notice of a hearing. Thus, Belle could not demonstrate that he did not receive notice in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a). Therefore, BIA did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Belle\u2019s appeal in accordance with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Belle\u2019s petition for review is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-14\">. Some of the actions in this case were taken by the Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service before it was abolished and replaced by DHS.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
