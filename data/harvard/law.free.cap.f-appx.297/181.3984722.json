Background</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Appellant Mary Schrodi filed this appeal from the District Court\u2019s May 25, 2007 Pretrial Order, No. 7222, denying Appellant\u2019s claims for benefits under the terms of the Diet Drug Nationwide Class Action Settlement Agreement (\u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">In July 2000, Appellant filed a claim with the AHP Settlement Trust (\u201cTrust\u201d), pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Settlement Agreement, for so called Matrix Al, Level II and Level III benefits. Her claim included the statement of an attesting physician diagnosing Appellant with moderate mitral regurgitation based on her echocardiogram, as required for Level II benefits. The attesting physician also reported that Appellant had surgery to repair or replace her aortic valve after having used one of the drugs at issue in this case, serving as the basis of her claim for Level III benefits. Upon review, the Trust\u2019s auditing cardiologist \u2018concluded that there was no reasonable medical basis (the standard set out in the Settlement Agreement) for the attesting physician\u2019s finding that Appellant suffered from a moderate mitral regurgitation, finding instead that she only had a mild mitral regurgitation, which is insufficient for Level II benefits. On that basis, the Trust denied Appellant\u2019s claims. Appellant disputed the audit\u2019s adverse finding, and the Trust applied to the District Court for an Order to Show Cause why Appellant\u2019s claim should be paid. The District Court issued the Order and referred the case to a Special Master for further proceedings. The parties submitted statements of the case to the Special Master, and the Special Master appointed a technical advisor to prepare a report for the District Court\u2019s review. Like the auditing cardiologist, the technical advisor concluded that there was no reasonable medical basis for finding that Appellant had moderate mitral regurgitation. Both the parties\u2019 statements and supporting documentation as well as the technical advisor\u2019s report were submitted to the District Court for review in making its decision on the Order to Show Cause. After a thorough review of the record before it, the District Court denied both the Level II and Level III claims, affirming the finding of the Trust with respect to the Level II claim and noting that Appellant\u2019s own attesting physician reported that Appellant did not have even mild aortic regurgitation, an additional element required for Level III benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">On appeal, Appellant asserts that (1) the method of interpretation of Appellant\u2019s echocardiogram used by the District Court is medically unsound and (2) the District Court\u2019s use of that method was based on an incorrect interpretation of the Settlement Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because Appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>grounds for appeal are based alternatively on issues of fact and interpretation of the Settlement Agreement, our review is under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See In re Cendant Prides Litig., </em>233 F.3d 188, 193 (3d Cir.2000) (both issues of fact and interpretation of settlement agreements are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">With respect to both of Appellant\u2019s arguments, this Court finds that Appellant has failed to show clear error in the District Court\u2019s interpretation or factual findings. The District Court performed a careful and thorough review of the robust record before it, including both parties\u2019 statements and the opinions of the auditing cardiologist, the technical advisor and Appellant\u2019s own attesting physician. This Court thus adopts the District Court\u2019s findings as its own.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">For the reasons stated above, Appellant\u2019s appeal is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ASQ\">. The Court will neither repeat the history of the Settlement Agreement in this MDL, as it has been outlined in prior opinions of this Court, <em>see, e.g., In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>431 F.3d 141 (3d Cir.2005); <em>In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>282 F.3d 220 (3d Cir.2002), nor summarize the relevant provisions of that agreement, which have been summarized aptly in the District Court's Pretrial Order that is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-10\">. In further support of the District Court\u2019s findings, see this Court\u2019s recent decision in a related proceeding, <em>In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>543 F.3d 179, 187-88 (3d Cir. 2008) (agreeing with the District Court that measurement of regurgitant jet in only a single frame of an echocardiogram did not provide a reasonable medical basis for recovering Matrix benefits under the Settlement Agreement).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
