Community State Bank v. Strong, </em>485 F.3d 597, 604 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court correctly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. We agree with the district court\u2019s finding that, to the extent the complaint sought review of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) decision to deny adjustment of status or the underlying discretionary or factual determinations, review was barred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). We also agree with the district court\u2019s finding that any genuine constitutional or legal challenge to the denial of Zheng\u2019s application for adjustment of status, including his claim of denial of due process, is reviewable \u201conly upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals....\u201d R.E.E., p. 12, citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-10\">. The defendants also make a compelling argument that Zheng's appeal is moot because Zheng\u2019s complaint no longer presents a live controversy for which any court can give meaningful relief. Validation of his labor certification renders Zheng ineligible for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident. Even if we assume the defendants are correct, it makes no difference here because the district court's decision that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction is clearly correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
