The district court concluded that there was insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that State Farm detrimentally relied on material misrepresentations of Arild and Jennifer Leavenworth (\u201cthe Leavenworths\u201d). For the reasons set forth below, we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-24\">\u201cIn order to use any representation by or on behalf of the insured in defense of a claim under the policy, the insurer must show that the representations are material and that the insurer relied on them.\u201d Or. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 742.208(3). In the insurance context, reliance \u201crequires some evidence of detrimental action or change in position\u201d by the insurer, such as offering coverage, calculating risk, or incurring additional investigation expenses. <em>Eslamizar v. Am. States Ins. Co., </em>134 Or.App. 138, 894 P.2d 1195, 1199 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-25\">In the instant case, State Farm failed to prove reliance because it never changed its position or took detrimental action based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>on the Leavenworths\u2019 statements. Rather, the evidence indicates that State Farm repeatedly acted independently of, or in opposition to, the Leavenworths\u2019 factual assertions. Indeed, State Farm did not even obtain the alleged misleading statements from the Leavenworths until <em>after </em>it had begun an advanced investigation for arson. Whatever expenses State Farm might have incurred in this case came about in spite of the Leavenworths\u2019 statements, not in detrimental reliance upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b628-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
