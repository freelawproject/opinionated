Horn, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>(\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Zheng Rong-Gui, </em>No. A98 713 526 (B.I.A. Feb. 29, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 713 526 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 15, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see In re J-Y-C-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 260, 265 (B.I.A.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">As an initial matter, because Rong-Gui failed to raise before this Court any challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of his CAT claim, we deem any such arguments waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). As to Rong-Gui\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims, we find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ properly noted Rong-Gui\u2019s inconsistent testimony with regard to the year he began distributing Falun Gong leaflets and the year that Chinese authorities sought to arrest him. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Moreover, the IJ found that Rong-Gui\u2019s demeanor during his testimony indicated that he was not telling the truth. In particular, the IJ noted that Rong-Gui hesitated when asked to explain the inconsistencies in his testimony. We accord particular deference to an IJ\u2019s observations of an applicant\u2019s demeanor. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-74 (2d Cir.2004), <em>ovemiled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). Taken as a whole, under the REAL ID Act, these findings were sufficient to support the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Rong-Gui was not credible. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin v. Muka-sey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Because the only evidence of a threat to Rong-Gui\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claims for asylum and withholding of removal when both claims were based on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
