O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Robert Mark Stephens, a state inmate appearing <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis </em>(ifp),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas corpus petition filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because he has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we deny a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Stephens, wearing a hat with ham sewn into it, approached Vernon Coleman in a parking lot with a loaded firearm as Coleman was retrieving items from his vehicle. After taking Coleman\u2019s keys and wallet, Stephens ordered Coleman to open the vehicle\u2019s trunk and get inside. Coleman opened the trunk and ran. Stephens got into Coleman\u2019s vehicle and drove approximately one block down the road to a gas station. Coleman\u2019s neighbors called the police. Using a surveillance helicopter, the police located Stephens in Coleman\u2019s vehicle at the gas station. Two officers apprehended Stephens, finding Coleman\u2019s wallet and a loaded .38 caliber revolver in his pockets. They also recovered a hat with fake hair sewn into it (which one of the officers saw Stephens remove from his head and throw to the ground) near Coleman\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">Stephens was charged in Oklahoma state court with first degree robbery (Count I) and attempted kidnapping (Count II). The jury found Stephens guilty of both counts and recommended punishment of 15 years imprisonment on Count I and 1 year imprisonment on Count II. The court imposed the sentences recommended by the jury, directing they run consecutively. Stephens\u2019 subsequent pro se motion for new trial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">On direct appeal, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA) modified Stephens\u2019 sentences to run concurrently but otherwise denied relief. Stephens filed a petition and amended petition for post-conviction relief; both were denied. The OCCA denied his subsequent appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-15\">Stephens filed a \u00a7 2254 petition with the district court claiming: (1) the denial of due process based on his absence from a hearing at which the court determined he had regained competency; (2) ineffective assistance of trial counsel and (3) ineffective assistance of appellate counsel based upon counsel\u2019s failure to raise on direct appeal the denial of due process and the ineffectiveness of trial counsel claims. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>State responded, arguing Stephens\u2019 claims were either (1) not entitled to habeas review because they were determined by the state court to be procedurally barred on independent and adequate state grounds or (2) without merit because the state court\u2019s adjudication of them was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. In a detailed thirty-page order, the district court agreed with the State and denied Stephens\u2019 petition. It subsequently denied Stephens\u2019 request for a COA but granted him leave to proceed <em>ifp </em>on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">A COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to our review of a petition for a writ of habe-as corpus. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). We will issue a COA \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make such a showing, an applicant must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted). \u201cWhen the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying constitutional claim, a COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhere a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of the case, a reasonable jurist could not conclude either that the district court erred in dismissing the petition or that the petitioner should be allowed to proceed further.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">We have thoroughly reviewed the entire record, including the three volumes of trial transcripts, Stephens\u2019 numerous state court pleadings, the state trial courts\u2019 decisions and the district court\u2019s painstaking analysis of each of Stephens\u2019 claims. We have also reviewed Stephens\u2019 opening and supplemental briefs. We agree with the district court that Stephens is not entitled to habeas relief as his claims are either procedurally barred or he failed to show the OCCA\u2019s adjudication of them \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Two claims, however, warrant further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">First, Stephens contends he is actually innocent. To support this claim, he refers to the statement of an eyewitness taken by the police on the day of the incident. While \u201ca colorable claim of factual innocence\u201d excuses a petitioner\u2019s procedural default allowing consideration of his defaulted claims, the statement fails to carry the day. <em>See Demarest v. Price, </em>130 F.3d 922, 941-42 (10th Cir.1997) (citations and quotations omitted). Factual innocence means</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Factual innocence requires a stronger showing than that necessary to establish prejudice. The habeas court must make its determination concerning the petitioner\u2019s innocence in light of all the evidence, including that alleged to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>been illegally admitted (but with due regard to any unreliability of it) and evidence tenably claimed to have been wrongly excluded or to have become available only after the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 942 (citations and quotations omitted). In his statement, the eyewitness alleges he heard Coleman yell \u201c[h]e\u2019s stealing my car,\u201d saw Stephens start to drive off in Coleman\u2019s vehicle and then ran after the vehicle. (R. Appellant\u2019s App. of Exhibits at Ex. 4.) The witness stated he observed Stephens leave Coleman\u2019s vehicle in the parking lot and flee in another vehicle. Contrary to Stephens\u2019 claim, this statement is not exculpatory. It merely contradicts testimony by state witnesses that Stephens fled the parking lot in Coleman\u2019s vehicle and was later apprehended at a gas station. It does not, as Stephens alleged in the district court, show he did not take Coleman\u2019s vehicle at gun point.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Second, Stephens claims he proceeded to trial without his competency medications. Initially, Stephens was declared incompetent and sent to Eastern State Hospital. While there, Stephens was prescribed several medications. Six months after his admittance, a hospital doctor reported to the court that Stephens had regained competence. In the hospital discharge report, the doctor stated Stephens was to continue taking his prescribed medications.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record reveals that once returned to jail, the jail ceased providing Stephens several of his medications. Contrary to Stephens\u2019 claim, he continued to receive his antipsychotic medication. Stephens\u2019 claim that he proceeded to trial without his competency medication is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">We DENY a COA and DISMISS this nascent appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-10\">. We liberally construe Stephens\u2019 <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>See Green v. Dorrell, </em>969 F.2d 915, 917 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b746-11\">. Because Stephens did not expressly request a COA, we deem his notice of appeal a request for a COA. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(2). We directed the parties to file briefs addressing whether Stephens\u2019 notice of appeal was timely as it was file-stamped one day after the appeal deadline. After briefing, we are satisfied the notice of appeal was timely under the prison mailbox rule. <em>See Price v. Philpot, </em>420 F.3d 1158, 1163-64 (10th Cir.2005) (under the prison mailbox rule, \"a pro se prisoner\u2019s notice of appeal will be considered timely if given to prison officials for mailing prior to the filing deadline, regardless of when the court itself receives the documents\u201d); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1) (incorporating the prison mailbox rule for an inmate\u2019s \"notice of appeal in either a civil or a criminal case\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b748-6\">. At the hospital, Stephens was prescribed Zyprexa, Celebrex, Flexeril, Topamax, Colace and Anusol Suppositories; the jail prescribed Zyprexa, Colace, Metamucil and Motrin. Under Rule 201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, we take judicial notice that Zyprexa helps manage symptoms of schizophrenia, the manic phase of bipolar disorder and other psychotic disorders; Celebrex treats acute pain and arthritis; Flexeril is a muscle relaxant prescribed to relieve muscle spasms; To-pamax is an anti-epileptic drug also used to treat migraines; Anusol treats hemorrhoids; Colace and Metamucil treat constipation; and Motrin treats fever and pain including pain caused by arthritis and migraines. <em>See http:// www.pdrhealth.com/home/home.aspx.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
