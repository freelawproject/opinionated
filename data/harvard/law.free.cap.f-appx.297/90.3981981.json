On August 21, 2003, Brown was confined to his grandmother\u2019s house for his house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>arrest, and the Philadelphia Adult Probation and Parole Department (\u201cPAPPD\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> attached an electronic monitoring device to his person. On August 26, 2003, the electronic monitoring device sent a signal to PAPPD that Brown had left the area of his house arrest. The following day, PAPPD contacted Jim Telese, Brown\u2019s Probation Officer, regarding the signal. On August 29, 2007, Officer Telese sent officers from the Warrant Unit to Brown\u2019s residence, but they were unable to find Brown. At that time, Brown\u2019s grandmother informed the Warrant Unit that Brown \u201cwas going on the run.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">On September 2, 2003, Officer Telese initiated the \u201cWanted Card\u201d process for Brown, which meant that Brown\u2019s information and wanted status were entered into the Philadelphia Crime Information Center and the National Crime Information Center computer systems. Neither PAPPD nor Officer Telese alerted the Philadelphia Police Department (\u201cthe Police Department\u201d) of Brown\u2019s escape. On September 23, 2003, Brown raped and murdered fifteen-year-old Patricia Stall-worth and her mother, Patricia Henry, and murdered James Cofer. The Police Department arrested Brown on October 7, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">On September 9, 2007, 2007 WL 2670140, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granted Summary Judgment for the defendants PAPPD, BI, Inc., and the City of Philadelphia (\u201cthe City\u201d). The executors of the decedents\u2019 estates appealed the order as to all of the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The only issue that the executors argue on appeal, however, is whether the District Court erred in granting Summary Judgment for the City on the executors\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim. Accordingly, this is the only issue before this Court. We exercise plenary review of the District Court\u2019s grant of Summary Judgment. <em>Bushman v. Halm, </em>798 F.2d 651, 656 (3d Cir.1986). Because we find that this case is controlled by <em>Bright v. Westmoreland County, </em>443 F.3d 276 (3d Cir.2006), we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">The executors argue that the City violated their substantive Due Process Clause rights by failing to apprehend Brown before he committed these reprehensible crimes. The Supreme Court has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not \u201cimpose an affirmative obligation on the State\u201d to protect \u201cthe life, liberty, and property [interests] of its citizens against invasion by private actors.\u201d <em>DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't. of Soc. Serv., </em>489 U.S. 189, 195, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989). Interpreting <em>DeShaney, </em>this Court has held that states cannot violate the Due Process Clause \u201cby failing to more expeditiously seek someone\u2019s detention ... or by taking note of a probation violation without taking steps to promptly secure the revocation of the probationer\u2019s probation.\u201d <em>Bright, </em>443 F.3d at 283-84. The facts of the present case are indistinguishable from our holding in <em>Bright. </em>Brown, who was undeniably a private actor, was the one who took the decedents\u2019 lives. Setting aside the fact that PAPPD never notified the Police Department of Brown\u2019s escape, the City\u2019s delay in apprehending Brown did not give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>rise to a substantive Due Process Clause violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">For the reasons articulated above, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-7\">. PAPPD is an arm of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and not the City of Philadelphia. <em>See Benn v. First Judicial Dist., </em>426 F.3d 233, 235, 240 (3d Cir.2005). The Eleventh Amendment would have barred any claims on appeal against the PAPPD.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b117-11\">. The District Court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1367(a). We exercise appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
