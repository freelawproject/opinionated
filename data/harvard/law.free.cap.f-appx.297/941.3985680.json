Williams named as defendants the following entity and employees: (1) the Miami-Dade Police Department (\u201cMDPD\u201d); (2) Detective Carl Baaske; (3) Detective Marcus Carey; and (4) Officer James McIntosh. On appeal, Williams argues that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated because Baaske initiated an illegal stop, search, and seizure. He also challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of the MDPD as a party to his \u00a7 1983 suit; grant of summary judgment on his false arrest claim; and, grant of summary judgment on his malicious prosecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-14\">A district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim is reviewed <em>\u201cde novo, </em>viewing the allegations in the complaint as true.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Shop v. City of Atlanta, </em>485 F.3d 1130, 1136 (11th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(C). \u201cIn making this determination, we view the evidence and all factual inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-movant.\u201d <em>Skop, </em>485 F.3d at 1136 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-15\">\u201cIn order to prevail on a civil rights action under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must show that he or she was deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-16\">\u201c[Qjualified immunity offers complete protection for government officials sued in their individual capacities as long as them conduct violates no clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Bashir v. Rockdale County, </em>445 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). \u201cIf the official was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority ... the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that the official is not entitled to qualified immunity.\u201d Sk<em>op, </em>485 F.3d at 1136-37. \u201cTo overcome qualified immunity, the plaintiff must satisfy a two prong test; he must show that: (1) the defendant violated a constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>tional right, and (2) this right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.\u201d <em>Holloman v. Harland, </em>370 F.3d 1252, 1264 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c[T]he two inquiries must be conducted in the proper order.\u201d <em>Skop, </em>485 F.3d at 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">The Fourth Amendment provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">U.S. Const, amend. IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">I. Fourth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">On appeal, Williams does not address the issue of whether the magistrate judge<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> failed to read his complaint as alleging a claim of unreasonable stop, search, and seizure. However, he does assert, as he has at every stage in the proceedings, that defendant Baaske fabricated probable cause. Moreover, beginning with his response to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, Williams has asserted that this fabrication violated his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\"><em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">A traffic stop is a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 653, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1396, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979). \u201c[A]n officer may conduct a brief, warrant-less, investigatory stop of an individual when the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot, without violating the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunter, </em>291 F.3d 1302, 1307 (11th Cir.2002). The officer conducting such a stop must have \u201ca particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417-18, 101 S.Ct. 690, 695, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981). The officer must have \u201csome minimal level of objective justification\u201d taken from the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7-8, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989); <em>United States v. Powell, </em>222 F.3d 913, 917 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-13\">Qualified immunity does not apply where a government official, sued in his individual capacity, engages in conduct that violates clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. <em>Bashir, </em>445 F.3d at 1327. \u201c[Falsifying facts to establish probable cause is patently unconstitutional. ...\u201d <em>Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1232 (11th Cir.2004); see <em>also Whiting v. Traylor, </em>85 F.3d 581, 585 n. 5 (11th Cir.1996) (\u201cKnowingly making false statements to obtain an arrest warrant can lead to a Fourth Amendment violation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-14\">Williams alleges that Baaske provided false information to Carey and McIntosh. In his complaint, Williams alleges that Baaske could not have observed him purchasing drugs because police reports demonstrate that Baaske was at five different locations during the one-hour time frame in which he claimed he was \u201ceye-balling\u201d the 98th Street and 21 st Avenue residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>Baaske has been forced to resign from the MDPD because he has filed false police reports and fraudulent documents and carried out other official misconduct. Baaske refused to comply when he was subpoenaed to appear at William\u2019s motion to suppress hearing. At his motion to suppress hearing, Williams argued, as he does here, that Baaske could not have observed him and that he was stopped on the basis of false information. The state suppressed the evidence and dismissed the charges against Williams on August 20, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">In his reply to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Williams asserted that his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated. He argued that the defendants\u2019 acts of stopping, detaining, searching, and arresting him were illegal and lacked probable cause. Additionally, Williams objected to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation on Fourth Amendment grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">A liberal construction of all of Williams\u2019s pleadings, including his initial brief to this Court, demonstrates that he raised an unreasonable stop, search, and seizure claim. Genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether defendant Baaske had a reasonable, articulable suspicion to order the stop, search, and seizure of Williams. Therefore, the magistrate judge and district court erred in failing to construe his complaint as raising a Fourth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">II. Dismissal of MDPD</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">On appeal, Williams argues that the MDPD knew that defendants Baaske, Carey, and McIntosh had a propensity for malicious conduct, yet kept them employed, and the dismissal of the MDPD as a party was error because the MDPD conducted a \u201cmock\u201d interview in which defendants Carey and McIntosh were permitted to intimidate Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">\u201c[Pjoliee departments are not usually considered legal entities subject to suit, but capacity to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of the state in which the district court is held.\u201d <em>Dean v. Barber, </em>951 F.2d 1210, 1214 (11th Cir.1992) (internal citations and quotations omitted) (dismissing as a defendant to a \u00a7 1983 suit a county sheriffs department in Alabama). Under Florida law, police departments are not legal entities amenable to suit. <em>Masson v. Miami-Dade County, </em>738 So.2d 431, 432 (Fla.App.3d 1999) (noting that the MDPD lacks the capacity to be sued under the Miami-Dade County Code \u00a7 2-91); <em>Fla. City Police Dep\u2019t v. Corcoran, </em>661 So.2d 409, 410 (Fla.App.3d 1995). Because the MDPD does not have the capacity to be sued under Florida law, the district court did not err in dismissing it as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">III. False Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">On appeal, Williams argues that the defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity on his false arrest claim because he was arrested without actual or arguable probable cause because the defendants fabricated the evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">\u201cA warrantless arrest without probable cause violates the Constitution and provides a basis for a section 1983 claim.\u201d <em>Kingsland, </em>382 F.3d at 1226. \u201cThe existence of probable cause at the time of the arrest, however, constitutes an absolute bar to a section 1983 action for false arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018When an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the arresting officer to search the person arrested.... \u201d <em>Holmes v. Kucynda, </em>321 F.3d 1069, 1082 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">Florida and federal law have the same standard for determining whether probable cause exists. <em>Rankin v. Evans, </em>133 F.3d 1425, 1435 (11th Cir.1998). Probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>cause to arrest exists when an arrest is objectively reasonable based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cThis standard is met when the facts and circumstances within- the officer\u2019s knowledge, of which he or she has reasonably trustworthy information, would cause a prudent person to believe, under the circumstances shown, that the suspect has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d <em>Kingsland, </em>382 F.3d at 1226 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">\u201c[Officers who make an arrest without probable cause are entitled to qualified immunity if there was arguable probable cause for the arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1232. Arguable probable cause exists if \u201creasonable officers in the same circumstances and possessing the same knowledge as the Defendants could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest Plaintiff....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). Qualified immunity does not apply, however, where a government official engages in conduct that violates clearly established constitutional rights. <em>Bashir, </em>445 F.3d at 1327. As we have already noted, \u201cfalsifying facts to establish probable cause is patently unconstitutional .... \u201d <em>Kingsland, </em>382 F.3d at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Florida\u2019s \u201cfellow officer rule\u201d states that, when an arresting officer was absent for a significant portion of events giving rise to probable cause, the arresting officer may rely upon his fellow officer\u2019s judgment about probable cause. Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 901.18; <em>see, e.g., Voorhees v. State, </em>699 So.2d 602, 609 (Fla.1997) (per curiam) (explaining that the fellow officer rule \u201callows an arresting officer to assume probable cause to arrest a suspect from information supplied by other officers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Regardless of whether Baaske falsified evidence against Williams, there is no evidence that Carey and McIntosh knew that Baaske\u2019s representations might be false. Thus, under Florida\u2019s \u201cfellow officer rule,\u201d Carey and McIntosh were justified in relying on the information provided by Baaske. As such, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to McIntosh and Carey on Williams\u2019s false arrest claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">IV. Malicious Prosecution</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">In order \u201c[t]o establish a federal malicious prosecution claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must prove (1) the elements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution, and (2) a violation of [his] Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures.\u201d <em>Kingsland, </em>382 F.3d at 1234. The common law tort of malicious prosecution includes the following six elements under Florida law:</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">(1) an original judicial proceeding against the present plaintiff was commenced or continued; (2) the present defendant was the legal cause of the original proceeding; (3) the termination of the original proceeding constituted a bona fide termination of that proceeding in favor of the present plaintiff; (4) there was an absence of probable cause for the original proceeding; (5) there was malice on the part of the present defendant; and (6) the plaintiff suffered damages as a result of the original proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">\u201cIn the case of a warrantless arrest, the judicial proceeding does not begin until the party is arraigned or indicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1235. The existence of probable cause is measured, therefore, at the time the original judicial proceeding is commenced, and not at the time of arrest. <em>Id. </em>Defendants to a malicious prosecution claim under \u00a7 1983 are entitled to qualified immunity if the plaintiff is unable to show that they acted -without probable cause. <em>Wood v. Kesler, </em>323 F.3d 872, 882-83 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining in relation to a malicious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>prosecution claim that, where actual probable cause existed, there is no Fourth Amendment violation, and qualified immunity applies).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">\u201cIt is well settled that in an action to recover damages for malicious prosecution where ... the evidence is in dispute, the existence or non-existence of malice and want of probable cause are questions of fact for the jury.\u201d <em>Kingsland, </em>382 F.3d at 1235 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, where the legitimacy of the evidence is challenged, \u201cthe fourth and fifth elements for the common law tort of malicious prosecution are rightly reserved for the jury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">On appeal, Williams supports his malicious prosecution claim by arguing the following: (1) that Baaske was the legal cause of the original proceeding; (2) that where evidence is in dispute, the existence of probable cause and malice are questions for the jury; and, (3) that the district court erred in finding that the defendants were immune from the consequences of their actions leading up to his arrest, prosecution, and imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">a. Baaske and the Drug-purchase Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">i. Legal Cause of the Original Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">The district court held that Baaske was not the legal cause of the original proceedings, and that therefore, Williams had not satisfied the second element of a common law malicious prosecution claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">Although we have held that defendant police officers were not the legal cause of the original proceeding where there was no evidence that they had anything to do with the decision to prosecute or that they had \u201cimproperly influenced\u201d that decision, such is not the case here. <em>Eubanks v. Gerwen, </em>40 F.3d 1157, 1160-61 (11th Cir.1994). In <em>Barts v. Joyner, </em>865 F.2d 1187, 1195 (11th Cir.1989), we explained that, in the context of a false arrest, \u201c[t]he intervening acts of the prosecutor, grand jury, judge and jury\u2014assuming that these court officials acted without malice that caused them to abuse their powers\u2014each break the chain of causation unless plaintiff can show that these intervening acts were the result of deception or undue pressure by the defendant policemen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">Williams alleges that Baaske fabricated the evidence that was the basis of the prosecution against him. Additionally, Williams has provided evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his arrest was the \u201cresult of deception ... by the defendant....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, it is apparent from the record of Baaske\u2019s deposition, taken in the underlying criminal case, that the State Attorney was relying on information provided by Baaske in his prosecution of Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">We recently held in <em>Eloy v. Guillot, </em>289 Fed.Appx. 339, 340-42 (11th Cir.2008) that a plaintiff established a \u00a7 1983 claim where the police officer responsible for his arrest allegedly fabricated evidence against him. Williams\u2019s malicious prosecution claim against Baaske is based upon Baaske\u2019s alleged act of fabricating evidence, which resulted in the prosecutor being presented with false and misleading evidence. Therefore, Williams satisfied the common law element that Baaske was the legal cause of the original prosecution. The district court erred by holding that Williams had not satisfied the second element of a malicious prosecution claim in his claim against Baaske.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">ii. Probable Cause for the Drug-purchase Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">Where challenges to the legitimacy of the relevant evidence exist, the question of whether there was an absence of probable cause is a question rightly reserved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>the jury. <em>Kingsland, </em>382 F.3d at 1235. Genuine issues of material fact exist as to the legitimacy of the relevant evidence regarding Baaske\u2019s alleged observation of Williams that was the basis of Williams\u2019s prosecution on the purchase charges. The district court erred in granting summary judgment on the issue of probable cause in Williams malicious prosecution claim against Baaske.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">b. McIntosh and Carey and the Kilogram of Cocaine and Drug-purchase Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">In contrast, McIntosh and Carey had probable cause for their support of the charges against Williams arising out of Baaske\u2019s representations. McIntosh and Carey are entitled to qualified immunity for claims arising out of Williams\u2019 possession of a kilogram of cocaine and claims arising out of Williams\u2019 alleged drug purchase. There is no evidence that either McIntosh or Carey had reason to doubt the validity of Baaske\u2019s representations, either when they arrested Williams or at the initiation of Williams\u2019 prosecution. It is undisputed that a kilogram of cocaine was actually discovered in the car. Similarly, it is undisputed that McIntosh and Carey received information from Baaske conveying Williams\u2019 description and informing them that he had purchased unspecified drugs. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that McIntosh and Carey are entitled to qualified immunity with regards to Williams\u2019 prosecution for possession of a kilogram of cocaine and drug purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">c. McIntosh and Carey and the Baggies of Marijuana and Cocaine</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">However, the district court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of McIntosh and Carey on charges arising out of Williams\u2019 alleged possession of four baggies of marijuana and one baggie of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.CivP. 56(c). \u201cIn making this determination, we \u2018view the evidence and all factual inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-movant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Skop, </em>485 F.3d at 1136 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">The district court incorrectly found that Williams failed to allege in his complaint that he did not have baggies of drugs on him. The district court also erred when it accepted the defendants\u2019 statements that they found drugs on Williams. The district court erred by rejecting Williams\u2019 sworn statements. When the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to Williams, there are genuine issues of material facts as to whether he possessed the baggies of drugs. Consequently, there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether McIntosh and Carey had probable cause to support the prosecution of Williams for their possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">Williams\u2019s dispute as to possession raises a challenge to the legitimacy of McIntosh and Carey\u2019s probable cause to support the prosecution. The district court therefore erred in granting summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-11\">d. Malice</p>\n<p id=\"b974-12\">Genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Baaske, Carey, and McIntosh had probable cause relating to the prosecution of Williams for the purchase and possession of marijuana and cocaine. There is a dispute in the record regarding the legitimacy of the evidence that formed the basis of the prosecution. Therefore, there is also an issue of material fact regarding whether they acted with malice. Like the issue of probable cause, the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>of malice is properly reserved for the jury. <em>Kingsland, </em>382 F.3d at 1235.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">e. Fourth Amendment Seizure</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">\u201cTo establish a federal malicious prosecution claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must prove (1) the elements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution, and (2) a violation of [his] Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1234. Williams was arrested on May 9, 2002, and incarcerated until May 28, 2002, at which time he was released on $100,000 bond. The record shows that his bond was revoked at some point, and the criminal case against him was dismissed on August 20, 2004. Williams therefore satisfied the second prong of a malicious prosecution claim by suffering a Fourth Amendment seizure. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern reversible error in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">The district court failed to liberally construe Williams\u2019s complaint as alleging against defendant Baaske a violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. We reverse as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">Next, the district court properly dismissed the MDPD as a party to Williams\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action because the MDPD is not a legal entity subject to suit. We affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">With regards to the false arrest claim, McIntosh and Carey justifiably relied on information from a fellow officer in arresting Williams, thereby acting with arguable probable cause; thus, they maintain qualified immunity from Williams\u2019 false arrest claim. We affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">With regards to the malicious prosecution claim: (1) the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the malicious prosecution claim as it relates to Baaske and the drug-purchase charges, and McIntosh and Carey and the baggies of marijuana and cocaine possession charges; but (2) the district court did not err with regard to McIntosh and Carey as they relate to both the kilogram of cocaine possession and trafficking charges, and all of the drug-purchase charges. We affirm in part, but reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b970-11\">. Williams\u2019s instant case was assigned to a magistrate judge, who prepared a preliminary report after screening Williams's action for frivolity, maliciousness, and failure to state a claim, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i),(ii). The magistrate's reports and recommendations were adopted and entered by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
