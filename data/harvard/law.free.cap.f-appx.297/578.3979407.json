Donnell\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erred in calculating Donnell\u2019s advisory Sentencing Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Donnell\u2019s written plea agreement contains a broad waiver of the right to appeal his sentence. We enforce the waiver, because Donnell knowingly and voluntarily entered into both the plea agreement and the appeal waiver, the argument on appeal falls within the scope of the waiver, and no injustice would result from enforcing it. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-92 (8th Cir.2003) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues for appeal beyond the scope of the appeal waiver. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal. We also grant defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw on condition that counsel inform appellant about the procedures for filing petitions for rehearing and for certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\">.
