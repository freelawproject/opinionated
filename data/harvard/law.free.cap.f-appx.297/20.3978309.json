Schoppert, which denied her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yuehua Lin, </em>No. A98 595 367 (B.I.A. Mar. 10, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 595 367 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City June 26, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-23\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir.2008). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>We \u201cdefer to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. Particular deference is given to the trier of fact\u2019s assessment of demeanor. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n.1 (2d Cir.2005). For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Here, we find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The IJ properly relied on omissions and discrepancies found in the record. For example, Lin omitted from her asylum application her purported detention for refusing to vote for a particular candidate in a village election. Moreover, at her merits hearing, Lin first testified that she had never been detained or harmed in China, but later changed her testimony claiming that she had been detained for one week and slapped while in detention. Although Lin offered explanations for her omission and inconsistent testimony, no reasonable fact-finder would have been compelled to accept them. <em>See Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 81. Additionally, because the IJ was in the best position to discern the impression conveyed by Lin, we will afford the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding particular deference. <em>See id. </em>at 81 n. 1. Accordingly, the agency properly denied Lin\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal to the extent those claims were based on her purported detention. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b), 208.16(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">We further find that the agency reasonably denied Lin\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal based on her mother\u2019s forced sterilization and on Lin\u2019s fear of persecution under the family planning policy. Indeed, the agency reasonably concluded that Lin was not eligible for relief based on the forced sterilization of her mother. <em>See Tao Jiang v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 137, 140-41 (2d Cir.2007) (citing <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 308-09 (2d Cir. 2007)); <em>see also Shao Yan Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>417 F.3d 303, 305 (2d Cir.2005). Moreover, in light of the fact that Lin has no children, the agency properly found that her fear of persecution on account of the family planning policy was speculative. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">As Lin was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim based on the family planning policy, she was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Additionally, contrary to Lin\u2019s argument, the agency reasonably found that punishment by the Chinese government for illegal departure does not constitute persecution in the absence of evidence that authorities are motivated by anything other than law enforcement. <em>See Matter of Sibrun, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 354, 359 (BIA 1983); <em>see also Saleh v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>962 F.2d 234, 239 (2d Cir.1992) (recognizing that \u201cpunishment for violation of a generally applicable criminal law is not persecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">As to Lin\u2019s claim for relief under CAT, we have held that an applicant cannot demonstrate that she is more likely than not to be tortured \u201cbased solely on the fact that she is part of the large class of persons who have left China illegally\u201d- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>and on generalized evidence indicating that torture occurs in Chinese prisons. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-60 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Pierre v. Gonzales, </em>502 F.3d 109, 118-19 (2d Cir.2007). As Lin provided no basis for the IJ to conclude that she, or someone in her \u201cparticular alleged circumstances,\u201d faces a risk of torture, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Lin\u2019s application for CAT relief. <em>See Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143-44 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
