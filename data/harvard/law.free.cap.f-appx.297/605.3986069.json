We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1178 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-21\">The agency denied Enoch\u2019s asylum application claim as time-barred. Enoch does not challenge this finding in his opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-22\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2003). Even if the disfavored group analysis set forth in <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir. 2004) applies to Indonesian Christians, and in the context of withholding of removal, Enoch has not established a clear probability of future persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1184-85. Further, Enoch failed to establish a pattern or practice of persecution of Chris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>tians in Indonesia. <em>See Lolong, </em>484 F.3d at 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s determination that Enoch is not entitled to CAT relief because he failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b632-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
