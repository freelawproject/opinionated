Diaz-Diaz appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denial as successive of his second 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition regarding a sentence of 210 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release for conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 and \u00a7 846. He also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of equitable tolling. The district court granted a certificate of appealability on the grounds that Diaz-Diaz\u2019s initial motion was procedural and that there was a possible constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-18\">Diaz-Diaz\u2019s conviction became final on January 9, 2006, when the Supreme Court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari. Under the \u00a7 2255 statute of limitations, Diaz-Diaz had until January 9, 2007 to file his \u00a7 2255 petition, one year after his conviction became final. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1). However, Diaz-Diaz did not file until February 9, 2007, when he requested equitable tolling. The district court denied both the equitable tolling claim and Diaz-Diaz\u2019s initial \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely. Such a denial is usually considered to be made on the merits. <em>Villanueva v. United States, </em>346 F.3d 55, 61 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Harvey v. Horan, </em>278 F.3d 370, 380 (4th Cir.2002). Diaz-Diaz\u2019s second \u00a7 2255 petition, filed on October 15, 2007, could be considered successive and require a certificate of appealability from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-21\">Solely for the purposes of this appeal, we grant the certificate of appealability sua sponte. We deny relief on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-22\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s denial of both a \u00a7 2255 motion and equitable tolling. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>436 F.3d 851, 854-55, 858 (8th Cir.2006). This court also reviews the underlying fact-findings for clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Diaz-Diaz claims that he is entitled to equitable tolling because the government lulled him into inaction by offering a potential sentence reduction in exchange for his testimony in another case pending in Nebraska. Diaz-Diaz also argues that although he pursued his rights diligently, he was prevented from timely filing because the government transferred him from the Federal Correctional Institution in Fort Dix to Nebraska without his legal papers, and he remained there without his legal papers for nine months and five days so that he could serve as a possible witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In order to justify the grant of equitable tolling, however, Diaz-Diaz must show that some government action prevented him from timely filing the petition and that he pursued his rights diligently. <em>Hernandez, </em>436 F.3d at 858; <em>Riddle v. Kemna, </em>523 F.3d 850, 857 (8th Cir.2008). The record shows otherwise. As early as May 2005, Diaz-Diaz requested copies of pleadings and transcripts. He unfortunately did not receive the materials, but made no further attempts until January 5, 2007, shortly before the statute of limitations expired on January 9, 2007. Diaz-Diaz\u2019s delay of many months before following up on his request for legal materials cuts against his claim for equitable tolling. Thus, Diaz-Diaz failed to establish \u201cdiligent pursuit\u201d of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Accordingly, we deny Diaz-Diaz relief and affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-16\">.
