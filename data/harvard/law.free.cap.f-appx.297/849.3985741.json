Heath originally was held responsible for 240 kilograms of crack cocaine, resulting in the maximum drug offense level of 38, with a guideline range of 292 to 365 months\u2019 imprisonment. He was sentenced to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment, and he subsequently filed the instant \u00a7 3582 motion, asserting that he was eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706, as his conviction was for a crack cocaine offense. On appeal, Heath contends that the district court, in denying him \u00a7 3582 relief, improperly relied on the amount of crack cocaine that was attributed to him at sentencing, which he had challenged. Further, he argues that, during his \u00a7 3582 proceedings, he was entitled to file a motion to suppress certain evidence that was introduced at his criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). However, where the issue presented involves a legal interpretation, review is <em>de novo. United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1178 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">Although a district court generally cannot modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, an exception lies in \u00a7 3582(c)(2), where:</p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)] to the extent that they are applicable, <em>if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-15\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>mission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Amendment 706, which reduced the offense levels in crack cocaine cases calculated pursuant to \u00a7 2D 1.1(c) by two levels, became effective November 1, 2007. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 706 (2007). The Amendment was made retroactive as of March 3, 2007, by incorporation into U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result of the amendment, base offense level 38 now applies to an offense involving 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine, whereas base offense level 36 applies to an offense involving at least 1.5, but fewer than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1), (2). Although the retroactive effect of Amendment 706 allows a defendant whose guideline imprisonment range was determined in accordance with the offense level calculations under \u00a7 2D 1.1 to seek a reduction in his sentence, a defendant who was sentenced on the basis of 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine is not eligible for a sentence reduction because the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">In making the determination of whether to apply a retroactive amendment to an eligible defendant, the district court must: (1) substitute the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range; and (2) consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determine whether or not to reduce the defendant\u2019s original sentence. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). If a defendant is not eligible because an amendment is not applicable, however, the district court is not required to engage in this two-step analysis. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(a)) (\u201c[eligibility for consideration under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is triggered only by an amendment listed in subsection (c) that lowers the applicable guideline 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement do not constitute a full resentencing of the defendant.\u201d) U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3). Accordingly, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not \u201cgrant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000). Specifically, a district court should leave intact its previous factual decisions from the sentencing hearing when deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1563 (11th Cir.1997). In Cothran, we held that the district court correctly declined to reexamine the number of marijuana plants involved in the drug offense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">Because Heath ultimately was held responsible for 240 kilograms of crack cocaine, the amendment, which increased the threshold amount from 1.5 to 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine for offense level 38 to apply, did not change his guideline range, and thus, a sentence reduction was not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Furthermore, to the extent that Heath challenges the original sentencing court\u2019s determination of the amount of crack cocaine attributable to him, the district court was not required to re-examine that determination in considering his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Cothran, </em>106 F.3d at 1563. Finally, the district court was not required to consider Heath\u2019s extraneous sentencing issues because he was not eligible for a sentence reduction. Accordingly, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>did not err in denying Heath\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-7\">.
