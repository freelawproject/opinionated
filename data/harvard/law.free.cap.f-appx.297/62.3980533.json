We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, proceedings below, and the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">Washington claims that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. He contends that he should have been permitted to withdraw his plea because the government breached the plea agreement by, in its sentencing memorandum submitted in support of sentencing: (1) making various statements related to his criminal history and role in the instant offense, and (2) reciting a restitution amount that was slightly above that agreed upon in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">We find no error. The plea agreement specifically stated that the parties could \u201cpresent to ... the Court any facts relevant to sentencing\u201d and could \u201cmake any arguments regarding where within the Stipulated Guidelines Range (or any other range as the Court may determine) the defendant should be sentenced.\u201d The government\u2019s sentencing memorandum conformed to this agreement, and further requested that Washington be sentenced within the parties\u2019 stipulated Guidelines\u2019 range, both as to the term of imprisonment and the restitution amount. -See <em>United States v. Amico, </em>416 F.3d 163, 165 (2d Cir.2005). And, the district court imposed a sentence within that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-15\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
