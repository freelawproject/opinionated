Taylor maintains her sentence was greater than necessary to comply with the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). She argues the district court did not consider that her offenses were non-violent or that she cared for her three young children as best she could during her probation. She alleges it is unclear if the district court considered whether a lower sentence would have adequately protected society. She contends that considering her mental health and substance abuse problems, the district court should have sentenced her below the low end of the advisory sentencing range. Likewise, she asserts the district court did not consider the need to provide Taylor with educational training and medical care, even though she had physical ailments and had tried to secure funds to attend school. Additionally, she asserts the dramatic departure from the advisory sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>range does not promote respect for the law. She argues the district court also failed to state its reasons for imposing the sentence adequately because it only stated it found the guideline sentencing range inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">We review the sentence imposed upon revocation of probation for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006) (discussing revocation of supervised release); <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1348 (11th Cir.2007) (holding probation revocation proceedings are conceptually the same as supervised release proceedings) (quotation omitted). Similarly, we review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to exceed the Guidelines\u2019 recommended range of imprisonment for violations of probation. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 798 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cChapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines governs violations of probation and contains policy statements, one of which provides recommended ranges of imprisonment applicable upon revocation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">We review a final sentence for reasonableness according to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a). When reviewing a sentence, we must first determine that the \u201cdistrict court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The policy statements in Chapter 7 of the Guidelines are also advisory. <em>Silva, </em>443 F.3d at 799. If we conclude that the district court made no procedural errors, we \u201cshould then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>522 U.S. at -, 128 S. Ct at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors a court must consider in determining a sentence include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide , just punishment for the offense, (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (5) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; (7) and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7). The weight accorded to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is left to the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">There is a \u201crange of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court need not state on the record that it has explicitly considered each factor and need not discuss each factor. <em>Id. </em>at 786. Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d Id. </em>Similarly, when exceeding the recommended sentence for probation revocation the district court \u201cmust normally indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>that it considered the Chapter 7 policy statements.\u201d <em>Silva, </em>443 F.3d at 799 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">When a sentencing court fails to explicitly mention the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we look to the record to see if the district court did, in fact, consider factors relevant to \u00a7 3553(a) when imposing the sentence. <em>United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 427, 169 L.Ed.2d 299 (2007). \u201c[I]t is sufficient that there be \u2018some indication\u2019 that \u2018the district court was aware of and considered\u2019 the Guidelines, which requires the court to consider \u2018the sentencing range established\u2019 under the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1348-49 (addressing revocation of supervised release) (quotation and citation omitted). The district court must explain the appropriateness of an unusually lenient or harsh sentence with sufficient justification. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 594. In holding a particular sentence above the Guideline range to be reasonable, we noted it was \u201cappreciably below the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">After revoking probation, a district court is not bound by the original guideline range. <em>United States v. Cook, </em>291 F.3d 1297, 1300 (11th Cir.2002). The statutory maximum sentence in a probation revocation case is the same as for the offense for which the probationer is on probation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565. The district court could have sentenced Taylor to five years\u2019 imprisonment for the original offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287. According to the Guidelines, Taylor had a recommended sentence of 3 to 9 months\u2019 imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). The Guidelines note, however, that \u201c[wjhere the original sentence was the result of a downward departure,\u201d like in Taylor\u2019s case, \u201can upward departure may be warranted\u201d when sentencing for probation revocation. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4 App. n. 4. A court may also consider rehabilitation and treatment when sentencing a defendant to an above Guidelines sentence. <em>Cook, </em>291 F.3d at 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-11\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Taylor to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court did not commit procedural error in determining the sentence. It correctly calculated the Guidelines range of 3 to 9 months\u2019 imprisonment and also acknowledged the advisory nature of the Guidelines. Although the district court did not explicitly reference the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the record shows it considered the factors in making its decision. The court acknowledged Taylor\u2019s background and the tough times she went through. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). It did not believe she would comply with the requirements of probation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (B), (C). It also considered her alcohol problems and depression, and recommended the Bureau of Prisons place her in the 500-hour residential drug abuse treatment program. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). The court acknowledged it could have left Taylor on probation, but did not do so because it was not helpful to her, her children, nor would it help her return to society as \u201can appropriate conforming adult.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(3). Thus the court explained why it considered the Guidelines range inadequate. Moreover, the Guideline application note suggested an upward departure could be warranted in a case such as Taylor\u2019s, because she had previously received a reduction for substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-12\">The district court\u2019s sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment was not substantively unreasonable. Taylor admitted to 13 violations of her probation conditions. According to her probation officer, Taylor \u201crefused to follow instructions, was not readily available for supervision, and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>not cooperate with the probation office in any of its efforts to help her complete probation.\u201d Given the number of violations and Taylor\u2019s lack of compliance with the probation office, it was not unreasonable for the district court to sentence her to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was less than the statutory maximum of 5 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Based upon the foregoing and our review of the record and the briefs, we affirm Taylor\u2019s sentence as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">AFFIRMED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
