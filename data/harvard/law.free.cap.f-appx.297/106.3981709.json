Count one of the indictment charged that the defendants had conspired in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 to distribute and to possess with the intent to distribute multiple controlled substances. Count two alleged that the defendants had aided and abetted each other in distributing and possessing with the intent to distribute in excess of five grams of cocaine base, cocaine, and heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 2. In September of 2006, Maldonado pleaded guilty to count two of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">On May 3, 2007, during the sentencing hearing, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania calculated Maldonado\u2019s offense level at 27 and his criminal history category as II, thereby yielding an advisory guideline range of 78 to 87 months. Maldonado urged the District Court to sentence him below both the advisory guideline range and the statutory minimum of sixty months because of the fact that he had already served twenty one months of a state sentence of two to four years of imprisonment for related controlled substance offenses, and had additional time to serve on that sentence. He asserted that the District Court had the authority to depart under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">The District Judge was receptive to the idea, departing from the 78 month lower parameter of the advisory guideline range to the 60 month mandatory minimum sentence. The District Judge declared that if he had the discretion, he would depart further and impose \u201ca sentence of 42 months ... as opposed to 60 months, which I believe would serve the goals of sentencing....\u201d Because the District Judge did not believe he had the authority to sentence below the mandatory minimum, he sentenced Maldonado to 60 months of imprisonment, concurrent with his undischarged state sentence. The Court expressed its belief that Maldonado \u201cshould but cannot receive credit for the time served on that State sentence\u201d in light of the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">This timely appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Maldonado asserts that the District Judge erred at sentencing by concluding that he did not have the authority to impose a sentence that was below the statutory mandatory minimum in order to give Maldonado credit for the time served on his related undischarged state sentence. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s interpretation of a criminal statute and a sentencing guideline. <em>United States v. Soto, </em>539 F.3d 191, 194 (3d Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Hawes, </em>523 F.3d 245, 249 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">We are sympathetic to Maldonado\u2019s predicament, but we find no error in the District Court\u2019s application of the Federal Crimes Code and the Sentencing Guidelines. Guideline \u00a7 5G1.3 provides instructions for imposing a sentence on a defendant who is subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment. Paragraph (c) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">(c) (Policy Statement) In any other case involving an undischarged term of imprisonment, the sentence for the instant offense may be imposed to run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the prior undischarged term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>imprisonment to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"AbS\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c) (2006). Application note 3(E) explains that:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Unlike subsection (b), subsection (c) does not authorize an adjustment of the sentence for the instant offense for a period of imprisonment already served on the undischarged term of imprisonment. However, in an extraordinary case involving an undischarged term of imprisonment under subsection (c), it may be appropriate for the court to downwardly depart. This may occur, for example, in a ease in which the defendant has served a very substantial period of imprisonment on an undischarged term of imprisonment that resulted from conduct only partially within the relevant conduct for the instant offense. In such a case, a downward departure may be warranted to ensure that the combined punishment is not increased unduly by the fortuity and timing of separate prosecutions and sentencings. Nevertheless, it is intended that a departure pursuant to this application note result in a sentence that ensures a reasonable incremental punishment for the instant offense of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, Application Note 3(E) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Neither \u00a7 5G1.3(c) nor application note 3(E) provides that a district court may impose a sentence below a statutory mandatory minimum in order to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the instant offense when there is an undischarged sentence. In fact, application note 3(E) specifically instructs that \u00a7 5G1.3 does not authorize a court to adjust the \u201csentence for the instant offense for a period of imprisonment already served on the undischarged term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The only authority that we are aware of that would permit the imposition of a sentence below the mandatory statutory minimum is in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). That provision, however, requires a motion by the government citing the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed a criminal offense. <em>See Melendez v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 120, 125-26, 116 S.Ct. 2057, 135 L.Ed.2d 427 (2008). Our review of the records fails to reveal that any such motion was made in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">In his reply brief, Maldonado seeks a remand to determine whether sentencing should have been governed by \u00a7 5G1.3(b) or (c). Inasmuch as this argument was not raised in his opening brief, it is waived. <em>Laborers\u2019 Int'l Union v. Foster Wheeler Corp., </em>26 F.3d 375, 398 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\">. The District Court exercised jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. Appellate jurisdiction exists under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\">. Judge Cowen votes to affirm the judgment of the District Court without prejudice to the right of Maldonado to file a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
