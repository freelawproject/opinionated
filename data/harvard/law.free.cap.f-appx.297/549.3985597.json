Washington, then incarcerated at Oak Park Heights Correctional Facility in Minnesota, claimed that (1) he suffered a delay in seeing a physician for chest pain, because nursing staff misdiag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>nosed his pain as being caused by excessive exercise, and (2) at times he was denied \u201ccomfort\u201d medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">After de novo review of the record, <em>see Popoalii v. Corr. Med. Servs., </em>512 F.3d 488, 499 (8th Cir.2008), we agree with the district court that Washington\u2019s delayed-medical-treatment claim failed, because Washington presented no evidence that any delay in seeing a physician worsened his condition; rather, defendants\u2019 evidence showed that a physician ultimately diagnosed Washington with a benign heart murmur that caused no dysfunction. <em>See Laughlin v. Schriro, </em>430 F.3d 927, 929 (8th Cir.2005) (objective seriousness of treatment delay must be measured by reference to effect of delay as shown by verifying medical evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">As to Washington\u2019s claim that he was denied \u201ccomfort\u201d medication, the district court properly dismissed this claim, without discussing its merits, for lack of administrative exhaustion. <em>See Johnson v. Jones, </em>340 F.3d 624, 627 (8th Cir.2003) (if exhaustion is not completed at time of filing, dismissal is mandatory).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Accordingly, we affirm, but we modify the dismissal of the medication claim to be without prejudice, see <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 219-24, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-8\">. The Honorable Michael J. Davis, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable Jeanne J. Graham, United States Magistrate Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
