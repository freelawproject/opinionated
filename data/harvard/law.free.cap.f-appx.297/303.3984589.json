Ochoa argues that the district court abused its discretion by not granting her a minor role adjustment because her role in the offense was that of merely driving her vehicle across the border. She also argues that the district court should have determined her role solely with respect to \u201cthis particular narcotics transportation,\u201d not her overall relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-18\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 208 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. de</em>nied, - U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2452, 171 L.Ed.2d 248 (2008). \u201cThere is no clear error if the district court\u2019s finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Harms, </em>442 F.3d 367, 378 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2875, 167 L.Ed.2d 1152 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-20\">\u201cThe determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is to be made on the basis of all conduct within the scope of \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) ... and not solely on the basis of elements and acts cited in the count of conviction.\u201d Ch. 3, Pt. D, intro, comment. Moreover, although a reduction for being a minor participant is available for a defendant who performed a limited function in a concerted criminal activity but was held accountable only for the conduct in which he was personally involved, the defendant must have been \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 <em>&amp; </em>n. 9 (5th Cir.2005) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A))).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-21\">Ochoa was the driver, sole occupant and owner of the vehicle in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>cocaine was present in a false compartment in the gas tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The defendant bears the burden of proving entitlement to a minor role adjustment. <em>United States v. De Jesus-Batres, </em>410 F.3d 154, 163 (5th Cir.2005). <em>See also United States v. Atanda, </em>60 F.3d 196, 198-99 (5th Cir.1995). One may be courier in a drug offense without being substantially less culpable than the average participant. <em>United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The record does not support Ochoa\u2019s argument that the district court denied her the minor role adjustment based on an erroneous assessment of her participation in a larger unidentified conspiracy. Rather, the district court merely failed to accept Ochoa\u2019s self-serving unsworn claim that she was only a one-time courier. Further, because Ochoa, although she made an unsworn statement, did not present any evidence rebutting the facts contained in the PSR, the district court was free to adopt them. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>226 F.3d 346, 360 (5th Cir.2000) (district court may adopt facts contained in the PSR if they have an adequate eviden-tiary basis and the defendant does not present rebuttal evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Ochoa also argues that the district court erred when it failed to grant her a downward departure for a serious medical condition. This court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of a downward departure unless the district court mistakenly believed that it lacked the authority to depart under the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Sam, </em>467 F.3d 857, 861 (5th Cir.2006). The record does not indicate that the district court believed that it lacked the authority to depart. Ae-cordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction to review this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
