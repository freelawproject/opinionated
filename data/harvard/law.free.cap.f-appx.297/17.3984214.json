Coleman, </em>No. 01CV00221, 2006 WL 2790403, at *18, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69551, at *55 (D.Conn. Sept. 27, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-21\">Cournoyer contends that the decision of the District Court to grant the defendant police officers\u2019 motion for summary judgment was erroneous because of the omission of certain \u201cmaterial facts\u201d from the affidavits submitted by defendants in support of the search and arrest warrants at issue in this litigation. Appellant\u2019s Br. 16. Specifically, Cournoyer contends that the affidavits should have included the following facts: (1) the victim was unable to identify Cournoyer from a photographic array; (2) the photograph of Cournoyer selected from the array by the victim\u2019s brother was taken on the same day that the victim\u2019s brother saw Cournoyer at the police station;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (3) Cournoyer told defendants that he, unlike the assailant described by the victim\u2019s brother, never had long hair or a goatee; (4) Oxford, Massachusetts, the terminus of a high-speed chase involving the victim\u2019s brother, is fifty-seven miles from Mohegan Sun;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (5) sunset on the night of the chase was 5:38 p.m.; (6) the victim stated that he was in his assailant\u2019s car before dark; (7) the victim had an extensive criminal record and initially lied about the events giving rise to his injuries; (8) the victim\u2019s brother said that the car chase began around 5:45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>p.m., after he was unable to find the victim; and (9) the victim\u2019s brother said that he left Webster, Massachusetts at 4:00 p.m. and that a trip to Thompson, Connecticut would take no more than twenty minutes. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10. Had the affidavits contained these facts, Cournoyer argues, no judge would have issued the warrants at issue in this litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">We disagree. A plaintiff challenging the sufficiency of an affidavit in support of a search or arrest warrant \u201cmust show that the affiant knowingly and deliberately, or with a reckless disregard of the truth, made false statements or material omissions in his application for a warrant, and that such statements or omissions were necessary to the finding of probable cause.\u201d <em>Velardi v. Walsh, </em>40 F.3d 569, 573 (2d Cir.1994). Cournoyer has not made this showing because the omissions that he references were not \u201cnecessary to the finding of probable cause.\u201d As the District Court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">While Christopher [Cournoyer] presented documentation supporting his contention that he was at the Mohegan Sun Casino until 6:09 p.m., accepting that contention does not resolve the question of whether Christopher was involved in the shooting, which was reported at 7:40 p.m. The prosecution\u2019s case would have been weakened by inconsistencies in [the victim\u2019s brother] Joseph and [the victim] Ronald\u2019s statements, Ronald\u2019s inability to identify Christopher, and the fact that Joseph\u2019s identification of Christopher may have been tainted, but that is immaterial to a determination of probable cause. Considering all of the information obtained by police, [defendants] Coleman and Shaw had adequate evidence to support a finding of probable cause for the issuance of search warrants for Christopher\u2019s residences and business. <em>Cournoyer, </em>2006 WL 2790403, at *15-16, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69551, at *45-46. Upon our review of the affidavits and the omitted information, we reach the same conclusion as the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Were we to assume that the information omitted from the affidavits precluded a finding of probable cause, we would nevertheless conclude that qualified immunity defeats Cournoyer\u2019s claims. \u201cUnder th[e] [corrected affidavits] doctrine, we look to the hypothetical contents of a \u2018corrected\u2019 application to determine whether a proper warrant application, based on existing facts known to the applicant, would still have been sufficient to support arguable probable cause to make the arrest as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Escalera v. Lunn, </em>361 F.3d 737, 743-44 (2d Cir.2004). \u201cThe issue under the corrected affidavit analysis is whether, if [defendants] had included all [they] learned from [their] investigation, the application would have supported a reasonable officer\u2019s or magistrate\u2019s belief that probable cause existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744-45 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). We agree with the District Court that, in light of the additional <em>incul-patory </em>evidence omitted from the affidavits, there would have been a sufficient basis to support a reasonable magistrate\u2019s belief that probable cause existed, even if the information referenced by Cournoyer had been included in the affidavits. Among the inculpatory information omitted from the affidavits were: (1) the sworn statement of Cournoyer\u2019s wife that Cournoyer told her that he had done \u201cmore\u201d than \u201cbeat[] somebody up,\u201d had used a rental car, was hiding from the police, and was planning to flee the country using a fake passport, <em>Cournoyer, </em>2006 WL 2790403, at *6, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69551, at *17, and (2) the false statements made by Cournoyer regarding his use of a rental car that was involved in a high-speed chase, which he appears to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>have justified on the theory that \u201c[a] lie is not a lie until you swear to it,\u201d <em>id. </em>at *5, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69551, at *15. We conclude, as did the District Court, that because the information available to defendants at the time the affidavits were drafted was sufficient to support arguable probable cause, defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Cournoyer also challenges the District Court\u2019s discretionary decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claims, arguing that he will not be able to litigate them in state court pursuant to <em>Virgo v. Lyons, </em>209 Conn. 497, 551 A.2d 1243 (1988). In <em>Virgo, </em>\u201cthe Connecticut Supreme Court ... held that an award of damages in a \u00a7 1983 action collaterally estops the plaintiff from recovering damages in a subsequent state court lawsuit.\u201d <em>Miller v. Lovett, </em>879 F.2d 1066, 1072 (2d Cir.1989). Because Cournoyer has not recovered any damages in this \u00a7 1983 action, the rule announced in <em>Virgo </em>will not bar the litigation of Cournoyer\u2019s state claims in state court. As the Connecticut Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[w]hen state law claims are pleaded, and dismissed without reaching their substantive merits, if the dismissal is based on a discretionary refusal to decide them, it does not bar a subsequent suit on the same claims, either in the state court or in another suit in the federal court.\u201d <em>DeLau-rentis v. New Haven, </em>220 Conn. 225, 597 A.2d 807, 815 (1991) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we see no abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Cournoyer\u2019s state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b43-18\">. The relevant affidavits disclosed, however, that the victim\u2019s brother saw Cournoyer at the police station prior to identifying him from the photographic array. <em>See Cournoyer, </em>2006 WL 2790403, at 9-10, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69551, at *29-30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b43-22\">. The relevant affidavits indicated that Cour-noyer \"ate at one of the restaurants at [6:09 p.m.], at the Mohegan Sun Casino.\u201d <em>Cour-noyer, </em>2006 WL 2790403, at 9, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69551, at *28.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
