Davila argues that although his was a within-Guidelines sentence, it should not be presumed reasonable because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is flawed under <em>Kimbrough v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>wherein the Supreme Court recognized that certain Guidelines do not take account of empirical data and national experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-22\">Following <em>United States v. Booker,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we review a district court\u2019s sentencing decisions for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, we consider whether the sentence imposed is procedurally sound. <em>Id. </em>at 597. Thereafter, we consider whether the sentence is substantively reasonable, using an abuse-of-discretion standard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On this circuit as on a number of others, a sentence imposed within a properly calculated Guideline range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-23\">Here the challenge is to the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness, and to our law on the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness for Guidelines sentences. Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Kimbrough v. United </em>States,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and <em>Rita,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Davila <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>argues that the within-Guidelines sentence imposed in his case should not be accorded a presumption of reasonableness. Davila contends that the justification for applying a presumption of reasonableness in his case is undercut because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b), the Guideline used to calculate his advisory Sentencing Guidelines range, was not promulgated according to usual Sentencing Commission procedures and did not take into account \u201cempirical data and national experience.\u201d He portrays the <em>Kimbrough </em>decision as having \u201csuggested\u201d that the appellate presumption should not be applied to Guidelines that did not take account of this data and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Although some language in <em>Kimbrough </em>could be read to support appellant\u2019s argument, it is far from directly on point, and we conclude that the square holding of <em>Rita </em>in favor of our presumption sufficiently supports that presumption even in light of <em>Kimbrough. </em>After all, <em>Kimbrough </em>arose under significantly different procedural conditions. The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ..'. outside the guidelines range is per se <em>unreasonable </em>when it is based on a <em>disagreement </em>with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Speaking to the crack cocaine Guidelines, the Court simply ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Court did not modify its recent ruling on the applicability of a presumption of reasonableness for Guidelines sentences. The appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is also supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which involved a similar challenge to \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The presumption is therefore applicable in this case, and appellant has not rebutted it. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b413-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
