In her appeal, Patel argues that the BIA should have reopened her case to allow her to adjust her status because she was approved for a labor certification visa that was immediately available. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history of the case, and the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-20\">The Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir. 2005). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-21\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Patel\u2019s motion as untimely. As Patel concedes, she filed her motion to reopen after the ninety-day limitations period had elapsed. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA properly found that her labor certification did not establish that she qualified for any of the excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>tions to the ninety-day bar.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3). To the extent that Patel challenges the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen the proceedings <em>sua sponte, see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), that argument is beyond our review because the BIA\u2019s decision whether to exercise its authority to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen a case is entirely discretionary. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">We have reviewed all of Petitioner\u2019s arguments and find them without merit. The petition for review is, therefore, DENIED, and the motion for stay of removal DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-15\">. We note in passing that the ninety-day limitations period can be subject to equitable tolling if a petitioner can establish ineffective assistance of counsel and due diligence. <em>Ia-vorski v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 124, 135 (2d Cir.2000) (explaining that \u201can alien must demonstrate not only that the alien\u2019s constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll\u201d). In our recent decision in <em>Rajah v. Mukasey, </em>544 F.3d 449, 455-56 (2d Cir.2008), we suggested that the Department of Homeland Security should establish standards as to when a case should be continued based on a pending labor visa application. We take no position as to whether Petitioner's counsel sufficiently requested that this case be continued based on the pending labor visa application and whether, if counsel did not and assuming that all the <em>Lozada </em>requirements were met, <em>see Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), the ninety-day limitations period should be tolled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
