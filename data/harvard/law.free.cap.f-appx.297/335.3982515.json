Pham moved to reopen his case and argued that he was eligible for relief under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c). The immigration judge denied both Pham\u2019s motion to reopen and his subsequent motion for reconsideration, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the immigration judge. Pham now petitions this court for review. Pham will receive relief only if he shows that the BIA abused its discretion when it affirmed the denial of his motion. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-23\">Pham argues that the BIA\u2019s application of former \u00a7 1182(c) is contrary to <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 295, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), and violative of his equal protection rights. These arguments are unavailing. <em>See Brieva-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 356, 359 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Vo v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 363, 366-70 (5th Cir.2007). Pham\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
