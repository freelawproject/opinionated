We DENY a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-24\">In 1999, Mr. Torres was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison plus two years of parole following his conviction in New Mexico state court for second-degree murder and several lesser charges. In 2006, Mr. Torres filed a post-judgment motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>alleging that the trial judge had erred in imposing two years, rather than one year, of parole. After reviewing the matter, the state court entered an amended judgment and sentence, sentencing Mr. Torres to twenty-six years\u2019 imprisonment followed by one year of parole. Mr. Torres appealed this decision to the New Mexico Supreme Court, which denied a writ of cer-tiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Mr. Torres then filed this \u00a7 2254 habeas petition in federal district court, urging that the amended judgment and sentence erroneously increased his sentence by one year in violation both of his right to due process and the Double Jeopardy Clause. The magistrate judge recommended denial of Mr. Torres\u2019s petition, and the district court subsequently adopted the recommendation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">A petitioner may not appeal the denial of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 unless a COA has been granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). We will issue a COA \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). This standard requires Mr. Torres to \u201cdemonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). We conclude that Mr. Torres has failed to meet this standard as to both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">First, as the magistrate judge observed, although a state court\u2019s arbitrary disregard of state sentencing law and imposition of an unauthorized sentence may violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights, <em>see Hicks v. Oklahoma, </em>447 U.S. 343, 346, 100 S.Ct. 2227, 65 L.Ed.2d 175 (1980), correcting an error that is plainly arithmetic does not constitute such arbitrary disregard. Indeed, New Mexico law specifically authorizes this procedure by providing that \u201c[clerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors in the record arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time and after such notice, if any, as the court orders.\u201d N.M.R.A., Rule 5-113(B). It is clear from the record that the twenty-six-year sentence was imposed after the state court corrected a mathematical error in the original twenty-five-year sentence. Thus, the increased sentence does not violate Mr. Torres\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">Second, we agree that the state court did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when it corrected the arithmetic error in Mr. Torres\u2019s sentence. Among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>other things, the Double Jeopardy Clause \u201cprevents a court from increasing a defendant\u2019s sentence once he has a legitimate expectation of finality in his original sentence.\u201d <em>Ward v. Williams, </em>240 F.3d 1238, 1242 (10th Cir.2001) (quotations omitted). We have previously affirmed that:</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">[A]ny expectation of finality in a sentence is wholly absent where ... the defendant requests that his prior sentence be nullified. The defendant has, by his own hand, defeated his expectation of finality and the Double Jeopardy Clause, which guards against Government oppression, does not relieve a defendant from the consequences of his voluntary choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\"><em>United States v. Welch, </em>928 F.2d 915, 917 (10th Cir.1991) (quotations omitted). In this case, Mr. Torres\u2019s voluntary petition for an amended sentence defeated his expectation of finality in his original sentence. Therefore, the state court did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause by making the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">After carefully reviewing Mr. Torres\u2019s brief, the magistrate judge\u2019s comprehensive and well-reasoned recommendation, the district court\u2019s disposition, and the record on appeal, we conclude that Mr. Torres has not met the standard for obtaining a COA. Accordingly, we DENY Mr. Torres\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-6\">. Mr. Torres asserts that the district court should have held a hearing on his petition. To the extent Mr. Torres takes issue with the district court's adoption of the magistrate's recommended disposition, we note that the district court carefully reviewed Mr. Torres\u2019s objections to the findings and recommendation de novo before dismissing his case, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b), and that federal law authorizes district courts to designate magistrate judges to submit recommendations for disposition in this type of matter. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 636(b)(1)(B). To the extent Mr. Torres contends he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge properly noted that all of the issues can be resolved on the record, which renders an evidentiary hearing unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b744-12\">.
