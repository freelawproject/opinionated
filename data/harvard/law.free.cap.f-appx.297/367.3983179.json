He was sentenced at the bottom of his advisory sentencing guideline range. He contends, in light of his personal circumstances and the circumstances surrounding his offense, that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we, review a sentence for reasonableness in light of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, we consider whether the sentence is procedurally sound, <em>id. </em>at 597, then we decide whether it is substantively reasonable, using an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>A sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462, Gaona argues that his sentence should not be accorded the presumption. He contends that the justification for applying the presumption is undercut because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b), used to calculate his advisory guideline range, was not promulgated according to usual Sentencing Commission procedures and did not take into account \u201cempirical data and national experience.\u201d He portrays <em>Kimbrough </em>as having \u201csuggested\u201d th\u00e1t the appellate presumption should not be applied to guidelines that do not take account such data and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-16\"><em>Kimbrough </em>makes no such suggestion; it considered the question whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 564. Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine guidelines, the Court merely ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the craek/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. The Court said nothing of the applicability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by <em>United, States v. Campos-</em>Maldonado, 531. F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008), which involved a similar challenge to \u00a7 2L1.2. The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Gaona\u2019s arguments regarding coming to the United States as an infant, having no family in Mexico, and reentering to see his family \u2014 essentially a cultural assimilation argument \u2014 was considered and rejected by the district court as a basis for a non-guideline sentence. This does not make Gaona\u2019s sentence unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008) (finding sentence reasonable in the face of similar arguments of cultural assimilation), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jul. 2, 2008) (No. 08-5226).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The presumption of reasonableness applies here, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence within the advisory guideline range. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
