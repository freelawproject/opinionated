California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Gareia-Viscarra\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating there are no grounds for relief, along with a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. Garcia-Viscarra has filed pro se briefs. The government has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, as well as an answering brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-24\">Garcia-Viscarra conditionally waived the right to appeal his sentence, with the exception of the district court\u2019s determination of his criminal history category and certain conditions of supervised release. Our examination of the briefs and our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80-81, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), indicate that the appeal waiver is operative. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal in part. <em>See United States v.
