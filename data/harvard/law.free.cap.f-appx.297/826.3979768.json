United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 1621-22, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). We previously vacated the district court\u2019s order and remanded for it to consider, in the first instance, whether Scott was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to inadmissable hearsay testimony implicating Scott in the murder for which he was convicted. On remand, the district court concluded Scott failed to meet his burden in demonstrating he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s deficient performance. On appeal, Scott asserts that counsel\u2019s failure to object to, or request a limiting instruction for, the inadmissable testimony was highly prejudicial under the second prong of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-16\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition <em>de novo. McNair v. Campbell, </em>416 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir. 2005). Factual findings are reviewed for clear error, while mixed questions of law and fact, including claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, are reviewed <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-17\">In our review of this appeal, we realized that substantial portions of the state trial court record were missing. The State has now supplemented the record to include the transcript of the entire trial in state court. The district court, however, has not had the opportunity to review the full record. Thus, we remand this case to give the district court the opportunity to review the full record in the first instance. In its review of the full record and application of the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland, </em>the district court should determine \u201cwhether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2068-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-18\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b852-14\">. In its opinion, the district court only excised the evidence presented by the inadmissable statements and found the remaining evidence was sufficient to sustain Scott\u2019s conviction and did not conduct the step of determining what effect the inadmissable statements had on the jury's verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
