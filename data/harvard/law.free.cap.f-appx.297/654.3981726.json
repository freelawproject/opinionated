Osama Elmatboly appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to defendants Arizona State University (ASU) and Professors Ravi Gorur and Gerald Heydt in their individual and official capacities. Though he asserted a variety of claims before the district court, Elmatboly appeals only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>dismissal of his \u00a7 1981 claim. The district court dismissed Elmatboly\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claim as barred by the statute of limitations and precluded by the Eleventh Amendment. We reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">As the defendants have acknowledged, the district court erred in holding Elmatboly\u2019s claim time-barred. The district court held that the limitations period applicable to Elmatboly\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claim was two years. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658, however, \u201ca civil action arising under an Act of Congress\u201d enacted after the date of \u00a7 1658\u2019s enactment has a four year statute of limitations. Section 1658 was enacted December 1,1990, Pub.L. No. 101-650,104 Stat. 5114, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991 was enacted on November 21, 1991. Pub.L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071. The relevant question is thus whether Elmatboly\u2019s claim is of a type cognizable under \u00a7 1981 as originally enacted (in which case it would not arise under an Act of Congress passed after \u00a7 1658 was enacted) or whether it was only made possible by the 1991 amendments (in which case it would fall within the ambit of \u00a7 1658). Elmatboly\u2019s claim in essence consists of an allegation that he was wrongfully discharged, and the Supreme Court has held that such claims were only made possible by the 1991 amendments. <em>Jones v. R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co., </em>541 U.S. 369, 374, 124 S.Ct. 1836, 158 L.Ed.2d 645 (2004). Therefore, the limitations period applicable to Elmatboly\u2019s action is four years. Because Elmatboly\u2019s claim was filed within four years of its accrual, it is not time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Though Elmatboly\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claim is not time-barred, we recently squarely held that \u00a7 1981 does not provide a cause of action against arms of the state. <em>Pittman v. Or. Employment Dep\u2019t., </em>509 F.3d 1065, 1070 (9th Cir.2007). We have also made clear that ASU itself and the Arizona Board of Regents, which operates ASU, are arms of the state of Arizona. <em>Rutledge v. Ariz. Bd. of Regents, </em>660 F.2d 1345, 1349 (9th Cir.1981). Furthermore, a suit against a state official acting in his or her official capacity is considered a suit against that official\u2019s office and is thus \u201cno different from a suit against the State itself.\u201d <em>Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t. of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58; 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). Thus, \u00a7 1981 may not be used as the basis for a suit against either ASU or the two individual defendants acting in their official capacities. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to these defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">By contrast, Elmatboly\u2019s suit against Professors Gorur and Heydt in their individual capacities is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The district court, believing Elmatboly\u2019s claim was time-barred, did not address whether the two individual defendants were entitled to summary judgment on the merits. We therefore remand to the district court for further proceedings. Each party shall bear its own costs and fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">REVERSED in part, AFFIRMED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b680-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
