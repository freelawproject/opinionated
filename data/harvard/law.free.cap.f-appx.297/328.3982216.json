Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141-42 (5th Cir.1994). The Government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35 motion is reviewable only if it is based on an unconstitutional motive, which Tatum does not allege. <em>See United States v. Sneed, </em>63 F.3d 381, 389 n. 6 (5th Cir.1995). Tatum\u2019s motion is thus unauthorized and without jurisdiction. Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
