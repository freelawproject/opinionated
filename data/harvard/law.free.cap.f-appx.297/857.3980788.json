White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006). On remand, the district court applied the <em>Burlington Northern </em>standard and, once again, entered summary judgment against Eugene Cavicchi and in favor of his former employer, the Department of Homeland Security, formerly the United States Customs Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-21\">After studying the briefs, considering the pertinent parts of the record, and listening carefully to oral argument, we conclude that the district court did not err in its application of the <em>Burlington Northern </em>standard. As for Cavicchi\u2019s complaints about the way the lawsuit was handled in the district court on remand, there was no abuse of discretion in regard to any of the procedural rulings or matters he has raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
