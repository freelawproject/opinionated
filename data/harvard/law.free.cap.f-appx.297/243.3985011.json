A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the magistrate judge is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the magistrate judge is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Hunter has not made the requisite showing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-16\"> This case was decided by the magistrate judge upon consent of the parties under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) (2000) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 73.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
