Sept. 14, 2007), <em>aff'g </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>No. A78 438 543 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Mar. 21, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">When the BIA issues a decision on remand from this Court, adopting the IJ\u2019s decision in part and supplementing that decision, we review the underlying IJ decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Belortaja v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 619, 622-623 (2d Cir.2007). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de 'novo </em>questions of law including \u201cwhat evidence will suffice to carry any asylum applicant\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d <em>Islami v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 396 (2d Cir.2005) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">We conclude that the agency\u2019s denial of relief in this case was supported by the record. The agency did not err in concluding that the harm to which Lin testified did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006). While Lin properly argues that harm alleged need not be physical to constitute persecution, her reliance on <em>Beskovic v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 223, 226 (2d Cir.2006) is misplaced. In <em>Beskovic, </em>we found that a minor beating may rise to the level of persecution where it occurs in the context of a detention on the basis of a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>However, we also noted our prior precedent, <em>Ai Feng Yuan, </em>in which we found that a petitioner who was detained twice but not beaten or mistreated in detention had not established past persecution. <em>See Beskovic, </em>467 F.3d at 226 n. 3 (citing <em>Ai Feng Yuan v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 192, 198 (2d Cir.2005) <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Lin testified that she was detained for less than a day before being set free by a \u201cvery nice old man\u201d who was guarding her. As she did not testify to any mistreatment in detention, Lin\u2019s experience is similar to that of the petitioner in <em>Ai Feng Yuan. </em>In Lin\u2019s case, the agency considered the record, including the absence of any physical abuse, and determined that the alleged harm did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>Cf. Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 79 (2d Cir.2005) (remanding where the agency failed to consider \u201csignificant portions of the Poradisovas\u2019 testimony\u201d in assessing past persecution). We have found that where the immigration court determines \u201con the basis of the whole record\u201d that mistreatment did not rise to the level of persecution, we will not \u201cquarrel with the decision; for we recognize that the difference between harassment and persecution is necessarily one of degree that must be decided on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Ivanishvili, </em>433 F.3d at 341. Thus, we find no error in the agency\u2019s determination that Lin failed to establish past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The agency also properly determined that Lin did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution based on either her alleged \u201cresistance\u201d to China\u2019s population control program or on the birth of her two children. To establish asylum eligibility based on a fear of future persecution, an applicant must show that she subjectively fears persecution and that this fear is ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>jectively reasonable. <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). On remand from this Court, Lin presented no additional evidence to support her claims. Accordingly, she did not establish that any fear based on her resistance was objectively reasonable. Similarly, she presented no evidence regarding her claimed fear on the basis of her two children. In the absence of any such evidence, her claim was \u201cspeculative at best.\u201d <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005). To the extent Lin attempts to rely on evidence that is not part of the administrative record, we decline to consider such evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A); <em>see also Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 269 (2d Cir.2007). Accordingly, the agency\u2019s denial of Lin\u2019s application for asylum was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Finally, because Lin has failed to sufficiently challenge the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and relief under the CAT before this Court, we deem any such arguments waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
