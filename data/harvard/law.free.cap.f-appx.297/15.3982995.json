After carefully reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the order of removal essentially for the reasons given by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). We add only the following comments:</p>\n<p id=\"b41-27\">1. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Criminal Records. </em>As for the Apostille, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1287.6 is not the exclusive method for authenticating a document. <em>See Yongo v. INS, </em>355 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.2004). Rather, authentication is a \u201cflexible\u201d doctrine and \u201crequires nothing more than proof that a document or thing is what it purports to be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. Here, since there is no question that the documents certified by the Apostille are anything other than copies of petitioner\u2019s Aruban criminal record, it is plain that this record was admissible for the purposes of establishing petitioner\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-28\">Petitioner next claims that there were translation errors in this record. However, in determining whether a particular offense qualifies as a crime of moral turpi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>tude, \u201c[t]he focus ... is on the inherent nature of the crime of conviction, <em>as opposed to the particular circumstances of the actual crime committed.\u201d Nguyen v. Reno, 211 </em>F.3d 692, 695 (1st Cir.2000) (emphasis added). Thus, it is the definition contained in the applicable criminal statute that is the controlling factor. <em>Maghsoudi v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Here, it is plain that at least one of petitioner\u2019s convictions, the one under Art. 315, qualifies as a crime of moral turpitude. That is, a conviction under this article requires both that the defendant intended to cause, and actually did cause, serious physical harm. <em>See Nguyen, 211 </em>F.3d at 695 (it is a crime of moral turpitude \u201cto cause <em>serious injury intentionally </em>to another person\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted; emphasis added). Thus, petitioner was properly treated as an arriving alien under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) and properly found inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">2. <em>The Second Charge. </em>Petitioner next argues that the BIA could not remove him on the basis of having been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude without <em>first </em>having determined that he had fraudulently concealed this conviction in order to obtain his adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident. The problem for petitioner is that neither of the pertinent statutes, \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) and \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), contain any language to this effect, and the statute that petitioner cites in support of this argument, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C), simply was not applied to him in the instant proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">3. <em>Due Process Violations. </em>Although petitioner claims that the immigration proceedings were plagued by due process violations, he has not even attempted to show how such violations prejudiced <em>him </em>\u2014 ie., how, in the absence of the claimed errors, the result of the removal proceeding would have been different. <em>See Ibe v. Gonzales, </em>415 F.3d 142, 144 (1st Cir.2005) (holding that prejudice is \u201can essential requirement of a due process claim\u201d in the immigration context). These claims therefore are mer-itless. Finally, we do not consider petitioner\u2019s challenge to the conditions of his detention pending the completion of the removal proceedings because a petition for review, filed under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, is not the proper vehicle for such a challenge. <em>See Ochieng v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 1110, 1115 (10th Cir.2008) (holding that a court of appeals, in a proceeding under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, is not the \u201cappropriate forum\u201d in which to bring, the first instance, a challenge to detention).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The petition for review therefore is <em>denied.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
