Therefore, even assuming we lack authority \u201cto accept an appeal from the denial of a motion to remand when a class action has been removed to federal court on the basis of traditional diversity jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Saab v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., </em>469 F.3d 758, 759 (8th Cir.2006), rather than pursuant to CAFA, we have jurisdiction over Hertz\u2019s timely appeal from the district court\u2019s order remanding this class action to state court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">The district court correctly applied the \u201cplace of operations\u201d test to determine Hertz\u2019s principal place of business. <em>Tosco Corp. v. Communities for a Better Env\u2019t., </em>236 F.3d 495 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Industrial Tectonics v. Aero Alloy, </em>912 F.2d 1090 (9th Cir.1990). Taking the facts as set forth in the Declaration of Krista Memmelaar, Hertz\u2019s relevant business activities are \u201csignificantly larger\u201d in California than in the next largest state, Florida. Although the difference between the amount of Hertz\u2019s business activity in California and the amount of its activity in Florida is not as large as the difference deemed to be significant in <em>Tosco, </em>California nevertheless \u201ccontains a substantial predominance\u201d of Hertz\u2019s operations. <em>Tosco Corp., </em>236 F.3d at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-14\">Neither <em>Tosco </em>nor <em>Industrial Tectonics </em>supports Hertz\u2019s argument that we must consider the comparative population of states in which a corporation operates to determine whether activities are significantly larger in one state than another. <em>Id,; Industrial Tectonics, </em>912 F.2d at 1092. Nor do policy concerns mandate the application of a per capita calculation. With its extensive California contacts and business activities, Hertz is not in jeopardy of being mistreated in California courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-15\">Because California is Hertz\u2019s principal place of business under the \u201cplace of operations\u201d test, we do not apply the nerve center test. <em>Tosco, </em>236 F.3d at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b717-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
