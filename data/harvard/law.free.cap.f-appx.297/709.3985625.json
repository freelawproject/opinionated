Because of legal errors committed by the IJ, we grant in part, deny in part, and remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-22\">Absent past persecution, an applicant is still eligible for asylum if he can demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b). Fonseca Rojo satisfied the subjective prong by credibly testifying that he fears for his life if he is forced to return to Chile. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>356 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2004) (en banc). Fonseca Rojo\u2019s return trip to Chile does not by itself constitute substantial evidence that he lacked a subjective fear. <em>See Boer-Sedano v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1082, 1091 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cWe have never held that the existence of return trips standing alone\u201d can negate a petitioner\u2019s well-founded fear).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>The objective prong requires \u201ccredible, direct, and specific evidence\u201d supporting a \u201creasonable fear of persecution.\u201d <em>See Karouni v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1163, 1170 (9th Cir.2005) (internal quotations omitted). The IJ denied Fonseca Rojo\u2019s claim because of insufficient evidence that he <em>\u201cwould be </em>persecuted\u201d if returned to Chile. The reasonable fear standard, however, \u201cdoes not require certainty of persecution or even a probability of persecution.\u201d <em>Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184 (9th Cir.2003). On the contrary, \u201ceven a ten percent chance of persecution\u201d suffices. <em>Karouni, </em>399 F.3d at 1178 (internal quotations omitted). Because the IJ based his asylum determination on the incorrect legal standard, we grant the petition and remand for further consideration. <em>See Vukmirovic v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 1247, 1251 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201c[W]e must grant a petition for review and, in an appropriate case, remand a case for further consideration when the denial of asylum was based on an error of law.\u201d); <em>Kotasz v. INS, </em>31 F.3d 847, 851 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201c[The substantial evidence standard] does not ... preclude a court from vacating the BIA\u2019s asylum determination and remanding a case for further consideration where the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum was based upon an error of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Because the IJ\u2019s denial of Fonseca Rojo\u2019s withholding of removal claim was predicated upon his asylum determination, we also grant this part of the petition and remand for a determination of Fonseca Rojo\u2019s eligibility for withholding of removal in the first instance. <em>See Karouni, </em>399 F.3d at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Finally, because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that there is not a clear probability Fonseca Rojo would be tortured if returned to Chile, we deny this part of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">GRANTED in part, DENIED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b736-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
