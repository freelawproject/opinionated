The sentence is within a properly calculated advisory guidelines range that reflects a four-level enhancement based on a prior felony conviction. Ramirez-Gonzalez contends that, in light of his personal circumstances and the circumstances surrounding his offense, his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-19\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a sentence for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, \u2014 </em>U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, we consider whether the sentence is procedurally sound. <em>Id. </em>at 597. Thereafter, we decide whether it is substantively reasonable, using an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>A sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-22\">Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United </em>States,U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462, Ramirez-Gonzalez argues that his within-guidelines sentence should not be accorded a presumption of reasonableness. He contends that the justification for applying that presumption is undercut because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b), used to calculate his guideline range, was not promulgated according to usual Sentencing Commission procedures and did not take into account \u201cempirical data and national experience.\u201d Ramirez-Gonzalez portrays <em>Kimbrough </em>as having \u201csuggested\u201d that the appellate presumption should not be applied to guidelines that do not take account of that data and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-25\">Our reading of <em>Kimbrough </em>does not reveal any such suggestion. The question presented there was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>agreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 564. Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine guidelines, the Court merely ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. The Court said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir. 2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008), which involves a similar challenge to \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The appellate presumption is therefore applicable here. After reviewing for procedural errors and considering the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, we conclude that Ramirez-Gonzalez\u2019s appellate arguments fail to rebut that presumption of reasonableness, so the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
