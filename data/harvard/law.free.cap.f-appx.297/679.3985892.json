We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-15\">Plaintiffs have waived the defamation and \u201cdefamation plus\u201d claims by failing to assert them in the opening brief. <em>See Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that arguments not raised by a party in its opening brief are deemed waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-16\">The Nevada System of Higher Education is immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. <em>Disabled Rights Action Comm. v. Las Vegas Events, Inc., </em>375 F.3d 861, 883 n. 17 (9th Cir.2004). The claims against Defendants Thawley, Frederick, and Lilley in their individual capacities, however, are not barred. <em>Cerrato v. S.F. Cmty. Coll. Dist., </em>26 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-17\">Plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment claim fails because Plaintiffs were neither engaged in constitutionally protected activity, nor did Plaintiffs provide evidence that Defendants\u2019 alleged actions chilled the exercise of protected speech. <em>See Mendocino Envtl. Ctr. v. Mendocino County, </em>192 F.3d 1283, 1300 (9th Cir.1999) (stating elements). There is no evidence in the record that Plaintiffs ever attempted to, or ever wanted to, speak to the press, nor is there evidence that Defendants did any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>thing more than state a preference that any press inquiries be referred to them.</p>\n<p id=\"ASG\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b706-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
