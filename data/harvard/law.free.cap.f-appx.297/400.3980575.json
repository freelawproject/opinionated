Landis sued Fairfield County Sheriffs Deputies Greg Storts (\u201cDeputy Storts\u201d) and Jamey Allen (\u201cDeputy Allen\u201d) and Sergeant Marian DeVault (collectively \u201cDefendants\u201d) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging federal and state law claims arising out of his arrest on July 17, 2004. On October 7, 2007, 2007 WL 2902940, the district court entered an opinion and order granting in part and denying in part Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. In pertinent part, the district court denied Defendants\u2019 request for qualified immunity on Plaintiffs Fourth Amendment claim of excessive force in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Defendants appeal the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity. Plaintiff moves this court to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. For the reasons that follow, Defendants\u2019 interlocutory appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">In the early morning hours of July 17, 2004, Deputies Storts and Allen responded to a domestic disturbance call at a local residence. On arrival, they observed Plaintiffs son, Steven M. Landis, standing outside and spoke with him. The son stated that he and Plaintiff had been drinking and had since gotten into an argument about whether the son was sober enough to leave by car.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">Shortly after the Deputies\u2019 arrival, Plaintiff came outside. Deputy Storts told Plaintiff that, if the son was not drunk, he was legally entitled to leave because he was an adult. Deputy Allen then administered a sobriety test, found the son was sober enough to drive, and permitted him to leave. Around this time, Plaintiffs wife, Norma Rooker-Landis (\u201cRooker\u201d), also arrived on the scene and began speaking to the Deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-16\">After the son left, Plaintiff went back inside the residence while Rooker remained outside, speaking to the Deputies. Some time later, Plaintiff stepped out on his porch to yell (at times obscenely) at the Deputies to get off his property and to tell Rooker not to talk to them anymore. He then returned inside. This process repeated itself several times and, eventually, Deputy Storts warned Plaintiff that, if he stepped outside again, he would be placed under arrest. Undeterred, Plaintiff persisted in coming outside and was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-17\">The central facts surrounding the arrest itself are as follows. Deputy Storts arrested Plaintiff on the porch. He struggled to put Plaintiff in handcuffs, and called for the momentary assistance of Deputy Allen (who, until then, was talking to Rooker). Once handcuffed, Deputy Storts escorted Plaintiff to a nearby police cruiser for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>pat down and Deputy Allen returned to Rooker to explain the situation. During the pat down, Deputy Storts discovered that one of Plaintiffs hands had come free from the handcuffs. As Deputy Storts attempted to put the hand back in the cuffs, the two men went to the ground on Plaintiffs gravel driveway. On the ground, Plaintiff lay on his stomach and Storts sat atop him, pinning him with his knee, and continued trying to put the errant hand back in the handcuffs. Once Deputy Allen noticed what was happening, he stopped talking to Rooker and went over to assist, helping Deputy Storts to secure Plaintiffs errant hand and recuff it. When securely handcuffed, Plaintiff was brought to his knees and dirt and scratches were observed on his face. The Deputies called paramedics to the scene. The paramedics identified abrasions and gravel in Plaintiffs face, but he refused treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">There were five witnesses to the arrest: Plaintiff, Deputy Storts, Deputy Allen, Rooker, and Shawn Nutter, a friend of Deputy Allen\u2019s brother who was on a police ride-along and watched from the police cruiser. Their depictions of the encounter vary.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Plaintiff testified that, as he was being handcuffed on the porch, he turned around to ask what the charges were. Steven E. Landis Depo., J.A. at 114. When told he was under arrest for obstruction of justice, he replied \u201cbullshit\u201d and was shoved through his screen door by Deputy Storts, knocking him out. <em>Id. </em>at 114-15. He regained consciousness to find himself being choked by Deputy Storts while bent over the back of the police cruiser, at which point both his hands were in handcuffs. <em>Id. </em>at 115. He then lost consciousness a second time, only to regain consciousness once on the ground of his gravel driveway. <em>Id. </em>When he came to, his right hand was free and Deputy Storts was on top of him, smashing his face into the gravel. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff then outstretched his arms in submission and twice exclaimed to Rooker that he was not resisting. <em>Id. </em>Deputy Storts then smashed his head into the gravel a final time and warned him to keep quiet or he would \u201cbreak [his] neck.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Deputy Storts testified to the same sequence of events (that is, from the porch to the cruiser to the ground), but insisted that Plaintiff had resisted arrest throughout the encounter. Greg Storts Depo., J.A. at 550-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Although Deputy Allen twice offered assistance to Storts \u2014 first helping to handcuff Plaintiff on the porch and later to grab Plaintiffs errant hand on the ground \u2014 he had his back turned for most of the encounter because he was talking to Rooker. Jamey Allen Depo., J.A. at 479-80. In turn, he \u201c[d]id not see any resisting arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480. Deputy Allen did, however, overhear Plaintiff yell \u201cuh\u201d or \u201cooh\u201d as if someone was \u201cfalling down\u201d and Deputy Storts say \u201cHow did you get out of those handcuffs?\u201d just before the two men fell to the gravel driveway. <em>Id. </em>at 480-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Rooker testified that, in arresting Plaintiff on the porch, Deputy Storts grabbed Plaintiff by his face and \u201cwhipped him around to put the cuffs on him.\u201d Norma <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Landis-Rooker Depo., J.A. at 323-24. After Plaintiff denounced the charge of obstruction as \u201cbullshit,\u201d Deputy Storts \u201cran [Plaintiffs] face into the door and got his hands back to cuff him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324. Thereafter, Plaintiff \u201cwent still\u201d and looked \u201climp,\u201d like a \u201crag doll,\u201d as Deputy Storts took him to the cruiser. <em>Id. </em>When Deputy Storts noticed a cuff had come off at the cruiser, \u201che flipped [Plaintiff] over, took him down to the ground and [Plaintiff] was laying with his arms out superman style.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327. At that point Plaintiff told Rooker, \u201clook, I\u2019m not resisting, they say I\u2019m resisting but I\u2019m not resisting and you\u2019re my witness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Nutter, present for the ride-along, testified that Plaintiff was \u201cthrowing his shoulders around\u201d and yelling as Storts attempted to handcuff him on the porch, but did not recall the incident at the cruiser. Shawn Nutter Depo. J.A. at 927, 929. Nutter stated that the confrontation \u201csomehow\u201d got to the gravel, where Plaintiff and Storts continued \u201cscuffling\u201d and, in Nutter\u2019s opinion, Plaintiff continued resisting. <em>Id. </em>at 929, 931. Although Nutter never saw Plaintiffs \u201cface actually pushed down in the gravel,\u201d he conceded that when the paramedics arrived Plaintiff had bruises, dirt, and some scratches on his face. <em>Id. </em>at 922, 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">On these facts, the district court ruled that Defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs excessive force claim. It reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">[G]enuine issues of material fact exist as to what transpired during Plaintiffs arrest. Plaintiff claims that he was being choked, that he was gasping for air, and that his face was beaten into the gravel driveway. In contrast, Deputy Storts testified that he had difficulty trying to re-cuff Plaintiffs loose hand and ended up in a scuffle on the driveway. According to Deputy Allen, who helped to re-cuff Plaintiff, Deputy Storts used about fifty percent of his body weight on Plaintiff while on the driveway and it took both of them to recuff the Plaintiff. In short, the testimony reveals two very different versions of the arrest. Such issues must be resolved by a jury. If a jury credits Plaintiffs testimony that he was incapacitated yet choked and beaten into the gravel driveway, the jury could conclude that the Deputies acted unreasonably and violated Plaintiffs Fourth Amendment rights during the arrest on the evening in question. On the other hand, if a jury credits the Defendants\u2019 testimony, then Plaintiffs Fourth Amendment claim fails. Since there are genuine issues of material fact regarding the Plaintiffs arrest, the Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs excessive force claim and summary judgment is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Op. and Order, J.A. at 1127-28 (internal citations omitted). The court conceded that Plaintiffs claim to have gone in and out of consciousness might \u201cundercut [his] version of events,\u201d but held that \u201cthis remains for the jury to decide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1128 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">Appellate jurisdiction is limited to \u201cfinal decisions\u201d of the district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. An interlocutory appeal of a district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity is thus properly before this panel only \u201cto the extent that it turns on a question of law.\u201d <em>Estate of Carter v. City of Detroit, </em>408 F.3d 305, 309 (6th Cir.2005); <em>see also Johnson v. Jones, </em>515 U.S. 304, 319-20, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995) (\u201c[A] defendant, entitled to invoke a qualified immunity defense, may not appeal a district court\u2019s summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a \u2018genuine\u2019 issue of fact for trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Given this standard, a defendant challenging a denial of qualified immunity on interlocutory appeal \u201cmust be willing to concede the facts as alleged by the plaintiff and discuss only the legal issues raised by the case.\u201d <em>LeMarbe v. Wisneski, </em>266 F.3d 429, 435 (6th Cir.2001). If a defendant is not willing to do so, there is no jurisdiction. <em>McKenna v. City of Royal Oak, </em>469 F.3d 559, 561 (6th Cir.2006); <em>see also Sheets v. Mullins, </em>287 F.3d 581, 585 (6th Cir.2002) (\u201c[I]t is well established that, for appellate jurisdiction to lie over an interlocutory appeal, a defendant seeking qualified immunity must be willing to concede to the facts as alleged by the plaintiff and discuss only the legal issues raised by the case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The Supreme Court created an exception to this standard where a district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity turns on a disputed issue of material fact and one side\u2019s version of those facts is \u201cblatantly contradicted\u201d and \u201cso utterly discredited by the record that no reasonable jury could believe it.\u201d <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 1776, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007). However, <em>Scott\u2019s </em>exception applies only to the \u201crare\u201d case at the \u201couter limit\u201d where a district court makes a \u201cblatan[t] and demonstrable] error.\u201d <em>Wysong v. City of Heath, </em>260 Fed.Appx. 848, 853 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting in part <em>Blaylock v. City of Philadelphia, </em>504 F.3d 405, 414 (3d Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In challenging the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment, Defendants implicitly<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ask this panel to reconsider the district court\u2019s determination that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether excessive force was used during Plaintiffs arrest. As noted above, review of this factual determination is permissible only in the \u201crare\u201d event of a blatant and demonstrable error in interpreting the facts by the district court. <em>Wysong, </em>260 Fed.Appx. at 853. Absent such error, this court may not revisit the factual basis behind a denial of summary judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">The district court concluded that, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there was a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of resistance and excessive force. Op. and Order, J.A. at 1127-28. Defendants argue that this was in error because there was insufficient evidence to support Plaintiffs claim that he was not resisting arrest \u2014 an interpretation of the facts expressly at odds with the District Court\u2019s statement of the factual dispute. <em>Id. </em>at 1128. Because Defendants do not concede the facts alleged by Plaintiff, the instant appeal is permissible only if the district court committed blatant and demonstrable error in by deferring to Plaintiffs account below. The answer to this question can be found by reference to those cases in which courts <em>did </em>find distinct courts guilty of such error.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">In <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>the plaintiff sued a police officer for excessive force during a high-speed car chase based on his use of a Precision Intervention Technique (PIT), which causes the fleeing vehicle to spin out of control. 127 S.Ct. at 1773. The officer moved for summary judgment, asserting qualified immunity because the plaintiffs attempted high-speed escape placed pedestrians and other motorists in grave danger. The plaintiff responded that \u201cthere was little, if any, actual threat to pedestrians or other motorists, as the roads were mostly empty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1775. Viewing the facts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the district court denied qualified immunity due to the dispute over a genuine issue of material fact, <em>i.e., </em>the degree of threat to public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Although on summary judgment courts must draw reasonable inferences \u201cin the light most favorable to the [nonmoving] party,\u201d <em>United States v. Diebold, Inc., </em>369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962) (per curiam), there was \u201can added wrinkle in this case\u201d \u2014 the existence of video from the police cruiser\u2019s dashboard camera which recorded the chase. <em>Scott, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1775. The video depicted \u201ca Hollywood-style car chase of the most frightening sort,\u201d and showed the plaintiff \u201cswerve around more than a dozen other cars\u201d and \u201cforce cars traveling in both directions to their respective shoulders to avoid being hit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1775-76. The Supreme Court reversed the denial of qualified immunity, holding that courts need not defer to the plaintiff\u2019s version of events if \u201cblatantly contradicted\u201d and \u201cutterly discredited by the record\u201d such that \u201cno reasonable jury could believe it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1776.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The Sixth Circuit has twice relied on <em>Scott </em>to overturn denials of qualified immunity in excessive force cases. <em>See Wysong, </em>260 Fed.Appx. 848; <em>Marvin v. City of Taylor, </em>509 F.3d 234 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">In <em>Wysong, </em>the plaintiff, a diabetic, admitted that he had no memory of his arrest due to a blackout caused by low blood sugar. <em>Wysong, </em>260 Fed.Appx. at 849, 853. Despite that admission, the district court denied qualified immunity based on the plaintiff\u2019s otherwise unsupported claim that he was not resisting arrest. On appeal, this court found that because the plaintiff \u201chad <em>no conscious memory </em>of what happened and <em>could not ajfirm or deny any of his actions </em>\u201d during the arrest and \u201cpresented no other witnesses or physical evidence to confirm his story,\u201d there were no <em>facts </em>in dispute and the denial of qualified immunity was thus inappropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 850-51 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">In <em>Marvin, </em>the plaintiffs account of his arrest was contradicted by video of the incident from the police cruiser and inside the jail. <em>Marvin, </em>509 F.3d at 245-51. Ruling on qualified immunity before <em>Scott, </em>the district court denied qualified immunity despite the discrepancy. During the appeal, the Supreme Court decided <em>Scott </em>and, accordingly, this court reversed the district court\u2019s decision because the video made it impossible to credit the plaintiff\u2019s verison of the events. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">The present case does not fit the mold of <em>Scott, Wysong, </em>or <em>Marvin. </em>Unlike <em>Scott </em>and <em>Marvin, </em>there is no <em>irrefutable </em>evidence (such as video) establishing that Plaintiff resisted arrest at the cruiser and on the ground. And unlike <em>Wysong, </em>Plaintiff was not unconscious throughout his arrest. Rather, he remained conscious through much of it and testified only as to what he actually remembered. <em>See </em>Steven E. Landis Depo., J.A. at 114-19. In particular, he <em>specifically </em>recalled being choked against the cruiser and, once on the ground, having his face smashed into the gravel \u2014 all while not resisting. <em>Id. </em>Although Plaintiffs testimony is disputed by that of the arresting officer (Deputy Storts) and, to a lesser extent, by that of an onlooker (Nutter), it cannot be described as \u201cblatantly contradicted\u201d and \u201cutterly discredited\u201d so that \u201cno reasonable jury could believe it.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1776. Moreover, Plaintiff, also unlike Wysong, has the benefit of an additional onlooker (Rooker) whose testimony contradicts the arresting officer\u2019s account and corroborates portions of Plaintiffs version of events. Therefore, the district court made no blatant and demonstrable error in finding a disputed issue of material fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>and this court is without jurisdiction to hear the instant appeal. <em>See Wysong, </em>260 Fed.Appx. at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs motion to dismiss Defendants\u2019 interlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction is granted and Defendants\u2019 appeal is hereby dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-13\">. The district court also ruled that Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiff's claim that he was arrested without probable cause, and that his \u00a7 1983 claim for violation of his First Amendment right to free speech and state law claims for false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and spoliation were all without merit. Op. and Order, J.A. at 1127\u2014 29. None of those issues are before the panel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\">. Plaintiff described the encounter a second time (in less detail) to clarify his state of consciousness during the incident. <em>See </em>Steven E. Landis Depo., J.A. at 116-19. This account goes as follows. Plaintiff was arrested by Deputy Storts on the porch, pushed through the door, and lost consciousness; regained consciousness at the cruiser while being choked and lost consciousness; regained consciousness on the ground and found himself pinned under Deputy Storts and having his face pushed into gravel, extended his arms and told Rooker he wasn\u2019t resisting, and, finally, had his face pushed into the gravel as Deputy Storts warned that he would \u201cbreak [his] neck.\" <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\">. That is, the legal arguments that Defendants make rely on factual interpretations at odds with those made by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b430-13\">. To be sure, reviewing to determine the existence (or not) of a blatant and demonstrable error requires some measure of considering the facts before the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
