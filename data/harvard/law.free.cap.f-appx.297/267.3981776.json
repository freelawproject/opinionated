He received a 16-level sentence enhancement pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2 (b)(1)(A) based on his previous deportation after conviction of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months. The defendant appeals this enhancement. He argues that the sentencing court erred in finding that his prior conviction qualified as \u00a1 a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2 and an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). He also argues that the sentencing court\u2019s use of a prior conviction to enhance his sentence violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. We reject these arguments and affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">On March 15, 2006, the defendant pleaded guilty to the charge of illegal reentry into the United States by a convicted felon in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). At the sentencing hearing, the court found an offense level of 21 based on the presentence report which calculated a base offense level of eight, a 16-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2 (b)(1)(A) for previous deportation after conviction of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense,\u201d and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The defendant objected to the 16-level enhancement on the ground that his 1996 conviction under California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11352(a) did not constitute a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d Specifically, the defendant argued that because he pleaded no contest to \u00a7 11352(a), which covers some conduct that is a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d and some conduct that is not a \u201cdrug trafficking offense,\u201d he was not necessarily convicted of committing a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d The defendant also objected to the documents proffered by the government to narrow the charge. The district court agreed that the statute was too broad to categorically qualify as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense,\u201d but held that the plea colloquy and other judicially noticeable documents established that the defendant had pleaded no contest to the sale of cocaine base which was indisputably a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d The court found that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category was II and the corresponding Guidelines\u2019 range for an offense level of 21 was 41 to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court sentenced the defendant to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment. Quintero now appeals this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">Quintero claims that the sentencing court erred in enhancing his sentence pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>suant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 based on a determination that his 1996 conviction for violating \u00a7 11352(a) was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d We review the sentencing court\u2019s determination <em>de novo </em>because it is a question of law. <em>See United States v. Chacon, </em>533 F.3d 250, 253 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">According to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), a 16-level enhancement is warranted for illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 if the defendant was previously deported after \u201ca conviction for a felony that is (i) a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 (b)(1)(A). Application Note l(B)(iv) defines \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d as \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance)\u201d or possession with intent to do the same. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The parties argue extensively over whether \u00a7 11352(a) is a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d on its face and whether the extended list of verbs in \u00a7 11352(a) fit within the definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 Application Note l(B)(iv). We see no need to explore this question because the plea colloquy so clearly establishes that the defendant\u2019s 1996 conviction was for selling cocaine base which unquestionably constitutes a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The sentencing court did not err in relying on the plea colloquy. <em>Shepard v. United States </em>permits courts to look to elements \u201cnecessarily admitted\u201d by the defendant in a prior guilty plea to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies for a sentence enhancement. 544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). Specifically, courts are permitted to examine the \u201cstatutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to -which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The plea colloquy makes clear that the defendant\u2019s 1996 conviction under \u00a7 11352(a) was for the sale of cocaine base. On January 12, 1996, the defendant pleaded no contest to one count of violating \u00a7 11352(a) and was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment. There are two clear instances in the plea colloquy where the defendant admitted that he was pleading no contest to the sale of cocaine base. First, the court began the plea hearing by stating: \u201cCharged with selling cocaine base on July 12, 1995 in violation of \u00a7 11352(a) of the Health and Safety Code. Do you understand that charge, Sir?\u201d The defendant responded \u201cYes.\u201d Second, the court later asked: \u201cHow do you plead to the charge that you violated Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11352(a), sale of cocaine base?\u201d The defendant responded \u201cNo contest.\u201d These statements establish that the defendant pleaded no contest to the sale of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">The defendant argues that the sentencing court was not permitted to consider the plea colloquy because the defendant did not confirm the factual basis for the plea as required by <em>Shepard, </em>and therefore the facts were not \u201cnecessarily admitted\u201d by the defendant. <em>See Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254 (permitting courts to look to plea colloquies \u201cin which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant\u201d). We find no merit in this argument. As discussed above, the defendant <em>directly </em>admitted that he was pleading no contest to the \u201csale of cocaine base\u201d and \u201cselling cocaine base.\u201d Furthermore, during the plea colloquy defendant\u2019s counsel stipulated to a factual basis after the defendant made these statements. Therefore, the sentencing court did not err in relying on the plea colloquy to determine that the defendant\u2019s 1996 conviction was for the sale of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The sale of cocaine base undeniably qualifies as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 because it is the \u201cdistribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(iv). Therefore, the sentencing court was correct to conclude that the defendant\u2019s 1996 conviction was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d and did not err in applying a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">We need not consider the defendant\u2019s arguments with respect to the admissibility of the other documents. Any possible resulting errors would be harmless in light of the fact that the plea colloquy unequivocally establishes that the defendant\u2019s 1996 conviction was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The defendant also claims that the sentencing court\u2019s use of his prior conviction to enhance his sentence violates his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. The defendant makes this argument merely to preserve it for appeal because, as the defendant properly concedes, current Supreme Court doctrine forecloses his argument. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (holding that the Constitution does not require that prior convictions be alleged in an indictment for a guilty plea or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt in order to be the basis of a sentence enhancement); <em>see also Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) <em>(\u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d) (emphasis added). Despite some questioning of the continued vitality of the prior conviction exception, <em>see Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 27-28, 125 S.Ct. 1254 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment), <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is still good law and this court is bound to follow it. <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349 (4th Cir.2005). Therefore, we reject the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-8\"> The defendant also claims, apparently for the first time on appeal, that the district court erred in applying a statutory sentencing enhancement pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) based on a determination that his 1996 conviction was an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d For the reasons stated above, the district court did not err in relying on the plea colloquy to determine that the defendant\u2019s 1996 conviction was for the sale of cocaine base. The sale of cocaine base is unquestionably an \"aggravated felony\u201d which is defined to include \"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a)(43)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
