Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly,.respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition for review is granted in part. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">As to the minor petitioner (A096-346435), in their appeal to the BIA, petitioners did not challenge the immigration judge\u2019s finding that the minor is ineligible for cancellation of removal because the minor failed to establish ten years of continuous physical presence in the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A). We have reviewed the record and the objection to the respondent\u2019s motion, and we conclude that there is substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s decision that the minor petitioner failed to establish continuous physical presence in the United States for a period of not less than ten years as required for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A); <em>Lopez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 847, 850-51 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition in part is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-15\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b613-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
