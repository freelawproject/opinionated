Mukasey, </em>518 F.3d 1081, 1083 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-25\">Although we have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion for continuance to reapply for adjustment of status and a waiver of his conviction, <em>Sandoval-Luna v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 1243, 1246-47 (9th Cir.2008) (per curiam), we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s underlying determination that under the standard of <em>Matter of Jean, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 373 (BIA 2002), petitioner would not merit a discretionary waiver under INA \u00a7 209(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1159(c). <em>See Mejia v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 991, 999 (9th Cir.2007). Given the IJ\u2019s determination, there was no abuse of discretion in denying a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-26\">We also have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of deferral of removal under the CAT, which was a decision on the merits. <em>Lemus-Galvan, </em>518 F.3d at 1084. Nonetheless, the IJ\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel the conclusion that it is more likely than not that petitioner would be tortured if returned to Armenia. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.17; <em>Bellout v.
