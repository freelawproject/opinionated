On April 12, 2006, he submitted applications to the Immigration Court, seeking asylum and withholding based on his political opinion and membership in a particular social group, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). He claimed that Guinean police arrested and tortured him from January 19, 2005 until his escape on May 15, 2005 because of his membership in the Union des Forces Republi-caines and his status as an ethnic Malinke. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Both groups are known to oppose the Guinean President.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">On September 1, 2006, an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Tour\u00e9\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT. On January 23, 2007, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) dismissed Tour\u00e9\u2019s appeal. Tour\u00e9 filed a timely Petition for Review with this Court on February 2, 2007. Because substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision, we will deny his petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Inasmuch as we write primarily for the parties, who are familiar with this case, we need not repeat the factual or procedural background.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Both the BIA and IJ based them decisions primarily on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. This Court \u201clook[s] at the adverse credibility determination made by the IJ and BIA to ensure that they were appropriately based on inconsistent statements, contradictory evidences, and inherently improbable testimony in view of the background evidence on country conditions.\u201d <em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 223 (3d Cir.2004) (citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Central to the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination were two major inconsistencies between Tour\u00e9\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence that he submitted. First, Tour\u00e9 provided news articles that detailed a January 19, 2005 mass arrest, which he alleged to be the event that started his detention. One of these articles, however, stated that by January 24, 2005, police had released everyone arrested except for one prisoner who had died in custody. This fact, if true, cuts to the core of Tour\u00e9\u2019s claim. Even if he were arrested as he claimed, Tour\u00e9\u2019s account of being tortured for four months before finally escaping would be rendered pure fabrication. Second, the IJ interpreted a State Department Report as saying that, of those who escaped during a prison break on May 15, 2005, only one military prisoner remained at large by the end of the year. Based on this reading, the IJ concluded that since Tour\u00e9 was not a member of the military, he was not the military prisoner mentioned, and therefore could not have escaped from the prison as he claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Tour\u00e9 has done nothing to explain these inconsistencies. Tour\u00e9 relies on the \u201ccommon understanding that most news accounts get some facts right and others wrong.\u201d Br. of Pet\u2019r at 10. He does not explain, however, why the facts that help his case are right, while those that do not are wrong. Tour\u00e9 also does not show that the IJ\u2019s interpretation of the State Department Report was unreasonable or unsupported by the record. His focus on the report\u2019s statement that a prison break occurred in no way demonstrates that he was, in fact, part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">Tour\u00e9 argues that the BIA and IJ improperly relied on these discrepancies in their decisions. Given the critical nature of these inconsistencies, however, we fault neither the BIA nor the IJ for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">Tour\u00e9 also alleges nine instances of clear error in the IJ\u2019s decision. At best, Tour\u00e9 has pointed to minor flaws in the IJ\u2019s reasoning that were in no way central to its final disposition. None of these purported errors do anything to explain the major discrepancies surrounding Tour\u00e9\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>detention and escape, nor do they otherwise show that he was in fact imprisoned and tortured for four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Nothing on the record suggests that a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to find Tour\u00e9 credible. His claim for asylum must fail. Since he has not satisfied the standard for asylum, he does not meet the standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Lukwago v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157, 182 (3d Cir.2003). Finally, Tour\u00e9 has identified nothing that would require a reasonable adjudicator to grant him relief under CAT. As a result, Tour\u00e9 has not shown that the BIA or IJ committed any errors that warrant granting his Petition for Review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-8\">. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). When the BIA defers to the IJ, we review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s decision under the \"substantial evidence\u201d standard. <em>Thu v. Attorney General of the United States, </em>510 F.3d 405, 412 (3d Cir.2007). We will not disturb the agency's determination unless \"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Thu, </em>510 F.3d at 412.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
