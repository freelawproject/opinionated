Terry\u2019s civil rights complaint. For the following reasons, we will dismiss this appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-19\">Terry is a prisoner currently incarcerated at the State Correctional Institution at Mercer, Pennsylvania. In February 2008 he filed a civil rights complaint pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, 1986 and 1988, against police officers, district attorneys, public defenders, a judge and witnesses involved in his criminal conviction in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County in July 1993. In his complaint, Terry also named two federal judges who adjudicated his habeas corpus petition arising out of his 1993 conviction. Terry alleged, inter alia, that defendants falsified evidence and testimony in order to obtain his conviction for aggravated assault, burglary, and spousal sexual assault. The District Court, adopting the Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-20\">For substantially the reasons given by the District Court, we agree that Terry has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The Supreme Court has held that, if judgment in favor of a plaintiff in a civil suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 would necessarily imply the invalidity of a prior criminal conviction, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has .already been invalidated. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 484-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Thus, before Terry may bring a complaint alleging that he was convicted based on falsified evidence and testimony, he must first demonstrate that his conviction or sentence has been invalidated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Terry has failed to make such a showing. Moreover, judicial officers have absolute immunity from suit when acting within their official capacities. <em>See Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 12, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991) (per curiam). Therefore, Terry\u2019s claims against the judges named in his complaint must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Accordingly, because Terry\u2019s appeal lacks arguable legal merit, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Terry\u2019s motion for summary action and motions for discovery, a hearing, bill of particulars, and subpoenas are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-10\">. To the extent that Terry attempts to raise ineffective assistance of counsel or otherwise attempts to challenge the validity of his conviction, we note that he must first obtain permission from this Court in order to file a second or successive habeas corpus petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
