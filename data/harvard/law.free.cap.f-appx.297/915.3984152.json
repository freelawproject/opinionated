Smith, a Georgia state police officer, and other officials of DeKalb County, Georgia, in which Wallace alleged that Smith violated his Fourth Amendment rights by arresting him without probable cause. On appeal, Wallace argues that the district court erred and displayed impropriety by granting summary judgment to Smith because the arrest warrant was not supported by probable cause, and the court relied on extra-affidavit information to find that there was no genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-21\">We review <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally, holding them to a less stringent standard than those drafted by attorneys. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same standard as the district court and viewing all evidence and factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Burton v. Tampa Hous. Auth., </em>271 F.3d 1274, 1276-77 (11th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-22\">For summary judgment, the moving party must first \u201cidentify those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Fitzpatrick v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number><em>City of Atlanta, </em>2 F.3d 1112, 1115 (11th Cir.1993) (quotations and alterations omitted). For an issue on which the non-moving party bears the burden of proof, the moving party need only show \u201cthat there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party\u2019s ease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1115-16 (quotation omitted). Once the moving party has properly supported its motion for summary judgment, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to come foiward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. <em>Id. </em>at 1116; Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e). \u201c[Mjere conclusions and unsupported factual allegations are legally insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion.\u201d <em>Ellis v. England, </em>432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2005). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 \u201cmandates the entry of summary judgment ... against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">The Fourth Amendment provides that \u201cno Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation.\u201d U.S. CONST, amend. IV. To succeed in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim based on an unlawful arrest, the plaintiff has the burden of showing the absence of probable cause. <em>Rankin v. Evans, </em>133 F.3d 1425, 1436 (11th Cir.1998). Probable cause to arrest exists when \u201cthe facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, of which he or she has reasonably trustworthy information, would cause a prudent person to believe, under the circumstances shown, that the suspect has committed ... an offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1435 (quotation omitted). An arrest warrant issued solely on the basis of an affidavit containing a conclusory assertion by the affiant that the defendant committed an offense, without more, does not show probable cause. <em>Garmon v. Lumpkin County, Ga., </em>878 F.2d 1406, 1408-09 (11th Cir.1989). However, the Fourth Amendment does not bar consideration of \u201can affiant\u2019s oral testimony, extrinsic to the written affidavit, which is sworn before the issuing magistrate, in determining whether the warrant was founded on probable cause.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Hill, </em>500 F.2d 315, 320-21 (5th Cir.1974); <em>see also Garmon, </em>878 F.2d at 1409 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">In this case, the arrest warrant affidavit contained only a conclusory assertion that Wallace committed the offense described therein. It was insufficient to support an independent assessment of probable cause. However, the arrest warrant itself, issued by a state magistrate judge, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">For sufficient cause made known to me in the above Affidavit, incorporated by reference herein, <em>and other sworn or affirmed testimony establisldng probable cause for the arrest of the Defendant named in the foregoing Affidavit, </em>you are hereby commanded to arrest said Defendant charged by the Prosecutor therein with the offense against the laws of this State named in said Affidavit and bring him or her before me or some other judicial officer of this State to be dealt with as the law directs.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">(emphasis added). On the face of the warrant, \u201cother sworn or affirmed testimony\u201d presented to the magistrate established probable cause to issue the warrant. Wallace failed to point to any evidence suggesting otherwise. Thus, Wallace failed meet his burden to present triable facts showing an absence of probable cause for the issuance of the arrest warrant. Accordingly, we conclude the district court did not err or display impropriety by granting summary judgment to Smith and dismissing Wallace\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"An9\">.
