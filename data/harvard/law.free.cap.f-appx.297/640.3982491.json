We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will uphold the agency\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The agency denied Lontoh\u2019s asylum application claim as time-barred. Lontoh does not challenge this finding in his opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">We deny the petition with respect to Lontoh\u2019s withholding of removal claim because substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Lontoh did not establish past persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003). Further, even if the disfavored group analysis set forth in <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir.2004) applies in the context of withholding of removal, Lontoh has not demonstrated that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted if returned to Indonesian. <em>See id. </em>at 1184-85. The record also does not compel the conclusion that Lontoh established a pattern or practice of persecution of Christians in Indonesia. <em>See Lolong, </em>484 F.3d at 1178-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s CAT denial because he failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b666-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except'as provided by 9th Cir.
