Appellant argues that the indictment violates the Double Jeopardy Clause, U.S. Const., amend. V, because he has already been convicted of the same offense in state court. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-17\">The court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 to hear an interlocutory appeal from an order denying a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. <em>See United States v. Figueroa-Soto, </em>938 F.2d 1015, 1016 (9th Cir.1991) (citing <em>Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977)). However, interlocutory jurisdiction exists only if the appellant\u2019s claim of double jeopardy is color-able. <em>United States v. Zone, </em>403 F.3d 1101, 1104 (9th Cir.2005). \u201cA double jeopardy claim is colorable if it has some validity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Because appellant\u2019s claim presents an issue of first impression with \u201csome validity,\u201d <em>see United States v. Price, </em>314 F.3d 417, 420 (9th Cir.2002), we have jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>The Supreme Court has held that the Double Jeopardy Clause is not violated by successive state and federal prosecutions. <em>See Abbate v. United States, </em>359 U.S. 187, 79 S.Ct. 666, 3 L.Ed.2d 729 (1959); <em>United States v. Lanza, </em>260 U.S. 377, 382, 43 S.Ct. 141, 67 L.Ed. 314 (1922). We apply on-point Supreme Court precedents and leave to the Supreme Court \u201cthe prerogative of overruling its own decisions.\u201d <em>Agostini v. Felton, </em>521 U.S. 203, 237, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997). Accordingly, appellant\u2019s double jeopardy claim must fail unless it falls within an exception to the rule permitting successive state and federal prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Appellant alleges that his claim is covered by such an exception, because the state prosecution here was a \u201ctool\u201d and a \u201ceovex-\u201d for the federal government. <em>See Figueroa-Soto, </em>938 F.2d at 1019. \u201cWe have recognized that in theory [a \u201ctool\u201d or \u201ccover\u201d] exception does exist. As a practical matter, however, ... it is extremely difficult and highly unusual to prove that a prosecution by. one government is a tool, a sham, or a cover for the other government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Appellant can make no such showing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Appellant alleges that the state prosecution was a \u201ctool\u201d or \u201ccover\u201d because the federal Drug Enforcement Administx\u2019ation [\u201cDEA\u201d] initiated appellant\u2019s ax-rest and requested that the state prosecute appellant; because appellant did not learn of the DEA\u2019s role in his arrest during his state prosecution; and because cex-tain DEA evidence relating to appellant\u2019s role in the methamphetamine trafficking operation and to the informant who led the DEA to the appellant was withheld from both the appellant and the state prosecutor. While troubling, these circumstances do not justify the conclusion that the state prosecution was \u201c <em>\u2018merely </em>a tool of the federal authorities\u2019 \u201d such that the initial prosecution was \u201c <em>\u2018in essential fact </em>another federal prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bartkus v. Illinois, </em>359 U.S. 121, 123-24, 79 S.Ct. 676, 3 L.Ed.2d 684 (1959)) (emphasis added). Although the state prosecution served the federal govex-nment\u2019s interest in maintaining the secrecy of an ongoing DEA investigation, the prosecution also vindicated the state\u2019s sovereign intex-est in enforcing its drug laws. Likewise, although the DEA\u2019s actions affected the state prosecution by limiting the information and evidence available to the state and to the appellant, the fedex-al government played no active role in the state prosecution beyond its initial x-equest that the appellant be prosecuted in state court. Because the state remained an independent sovereign pui-suing its own sovereign interests thx-oughout the state prosecution, appellant has failed to demonstx-ate that the state government was a \u201ctool\u201d ox- \u201ccover\u201d fox- the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">Accox-dingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b686-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-10\">. At oral argument, the government argued that Contreras-Cisneros's double jeopardy claim must be rejected because his federal indictment for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7' 846(a)(1), 846(b)(l)(A)(viii), does not involve the same offense as his state indictment for possession of methamphetamine for sale, Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code 11378. <em>See United States v. Felix, </em>503 U.S. 378, 390-91, 112 S.Ct. 1377, 118 L.Ed.2d 25 (1992). Because this argument was not raised in briefing before this court, it has been waived. Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9,)(A); 29(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b687-7\">. The district court also rejected appellant's argument that the \u2022 indictment violated due process. That argument is not before this court on appeal, and we offer no opinion as to the merits of any subsequent appeal premised on due process grounds rather than double jeopardy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
