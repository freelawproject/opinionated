The district court issued its most recent decision in the case on September 4, 2007, when it denied Burts\u2019 post-judgment motion for transcripts. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed as to even the most recent order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-24\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), <em>or </em>reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The district court\u2019s latest order was entered on the docket on September 4, 2007. The notice of appeal was filed in July 2008. Because Burts failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
