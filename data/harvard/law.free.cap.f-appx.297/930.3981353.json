Moton appeals from a final judgment entered by the district court awarding him $500 in attorneys\u2019 fees following the district court\u2019s grant of Moton\u2019s summary judgment motion, resulting in an award of $1000 in statutory damages, pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692-1692p. Moton does not challenge the resolution of the underlying lawsuit, but instead argues that the district court abused its discretion in assessing attorneys\u2019 fees under the FDCPA by awarding a flat fee of $500 instead of using the \u201clodestar\u201d formula. After careful review, we vacate and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">In FDCPA cases, we review the award of attorneys\u2019 fees for abuse of discretion, but \u201cclosely scrutinize questions of law decided by the district court in reaching the fee award.\u201d <em>Hollis v. Roberts, </em>984 F.2d 1159, 1160 (11th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>Camden I Condominium Ass\u2019n v. Dunkle, </em>946 F.2d 768, 770 (11th Cir.1991)). A district court abuses its discretion when it \u201capplies the wrong law, follows the wrong procedure, bases its decision on clearly erroneous facts, or commits a clear error in judgment.\u201d <em>Tran v. Toyota Motor Corp., </em>420 F.3d 1310, 1315 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">The relevant facts are these. Moton sued Nathan &amp; Nathan, P.C., alleging that the firm had violated the FDCPA during its collection of a consumer debt on behalf of Bank of America by omitting from its initial FDCPA-mandated disclosures the required notice that a formal statutory dispute must be in writing. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court entered an order in Moton\u2019s favor, holding that Nathan &amp; Nathan\u2019s omission violated the FDCPA, and awarded maximum FDCPA statutory damages of $1,000 to Moton. In the same order\u2014 and without any motion for attorneys\u2019 fees filed by either party \u2014 the district court held that Nathan &amp; Nathan\u2019s violation was \u201cde minimus,\u201d and on that basis, directed the entry of a judgment awarding to Mo-ton \u201cthe sum of $500.00 as reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs.\u201d Moton subsequently filed motions to alter or amend the judgment and for an award of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, attaching fee documentation not previously considered by the district court, showing 25.3 attorney hours for which compensation was sought at the rate of $250 per hour, for a total fee request of $6,325. The district court denied Moton\u2019s motions, standing by the $500 in fees it had previously awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">The FDCPA authorizes an award to any successful plaintiff of the costs of the action and a \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fee as determined by the court.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(a)(3). In interpreting this provision, we have held that Supreme Court precedent in the civil rights fee-shifting context is applicable. <em>Hollis, </em>984 F.2d at 1161 (\u201cAlthough <em>[Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984) ] was decided in the context of the civil rights fee-shifting statute, its principles are equally applicable here.\u201d). Under the Supreme Court\u2019s approach, we said, \u201c[t]he initial estimate of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee is properly calculated by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation times a reasonable hourly rate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Blum, </em>465 U.S. at 888, 104 S.Ct. 1541). In addition, \u201c \u2018reasonable fees\u2019 under \u00a7 1988 are to be calculated according to the prevailing market rates in the relevant community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Blum, </em>465 U.S. at 888, 104 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>1541). Our clear precedent thus requires a district court, when awarding attorneys\u2019 fees under the FDCPA \u2014 like under the typical fee-shifting statute \u2014 to do the following:</p>\n<p id=\"ACKI\">The starting point in fashioning an award of attorney\u2019s fees is to multiply the number of hours reasonably expended by a reasonable hourly rate. This \u201clodestar\u201d may then be adjusted for the results obtained. Although a district court has wide discretion in performing these calculations, the court\u2019s order on attorney\u2019s fees must allow meaningful review \u2014 the district court must articulate the decisions it made, give principled reasons for those decisions, and show its calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\"><em>Loranger v. Stierheim, </em>10 F.3d 776, 781 (11th Cir.1994) (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">The district court did not do this here. Rather, the district court awarded a flat fee of $500.00, based on the amount of damages plaintiff received, without so much as attempting to perform a \u201clodestar\u201d analysis, nor articulating what it deemed to be reasonable fees or reasonable hours for the attorneys\u2019 work on this case. It also never explained why the flat rate it awarded deviated as it did from the \u201clodestar\u201d calculation. Although the district court admittedly has wide discretion in this arena, we nonetheless are constrained to hold that the district court abused its discretion by failing to perform any \u201clodestar\u201d calculation at all. <em>See Camacho v. Bridgeport Financial, Inc., </em>523 F.3d 973, 982 (9th Cir.2008) (FDCPA case holding that \u201cthe district court erred by awarding a \u2018flat award,\u2019 and on remand the court should calculate the lodestar to determine a presumptively reasonable fees-on-fees award before assessing whether upward or downward adjustments are warranted\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">Accordingly, we vacate and remand to the district court to calculate attorneys\u2019 fees using the \u201clodestar\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-7\">. The cases cited by Nathan &amp; Nathan, purporting to hold that a flat-fee award is permissible under the FDCPA, are not binding on us, and in any event, are not helpful here. Indeed, in <em>French v. Corporate Receivables, Inc., </em>489 F.3d 402 (1st Cir.2007), the district court, though briefly, did say that it had performed the \u201clodestar\u201d calculation and then adjusted accordingly. And in <em>Carroll v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, </em>53 F.3d 626 (4th Cir.1995), it is hard to tell from the opinion whether the district court calculated the \u201clodestar\u201d and then deviated from it, or whether it never calculated it at all. Moreover, the plaintiff there did not win the maximum amount of statutory damages, but rather, received only $50 in statutory damages at the close of underlying litigation, which was five percent of amount she initially sought. Finally, in <em>Johnson v. Eaton, </em>80 F.3d 148 (5th Cir.1996), the plaintiff won no damages at all, and therefore, the court held that she was not entitled to any attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
