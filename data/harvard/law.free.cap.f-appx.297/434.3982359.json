(hereinafter, \u201cLeggett\u201d) on its counterclaim for breach of a representation of a Net Asset Value (hereinafter, \u201cNAV\u201d) representation in an agreement with Counterdefendant-Appellant TransPro, Inc. (hereinafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>\u201cTransPro\u201d). TransPro appeals the district court\u2019s decision. For the reasons stated below, the Court AFFIRMS the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">TransPro and Leggett entered into an Agreement on April 17, 2000, whereby Leggett was to purchase TransPro\u2019s Crown North America Division (hereinafter, \u201cDivision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Section 4.22 of their Agreement provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The [NAV] of the Purchased Assets at Closing will be at least $15,500,000. [NAV] shall mean the dollar amount equal to the book value of the Purchased Assets minus the book value of Assumed Liabilities. Book value will be determined from Seller\u2019s and VMS\u2019 books and records as of the opening of business on the Closing Date (prior to any write ups under purchase accounting on Buyer\u2019s books and records) under GAAP as applied by Seller and VMS prior to Closing. The aggregate under-funded pension liability for the Fabricators and 136 Plans shall be deemed to be $850,000. If the Closing Date is after April 30, 2000, the [NAV] shall be adjusted by mutual agreement of the parties, and in accordance with the past practice, to reflect the later than expected Closing Date.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Paragraph/Section 11.5(a) of the Agreement provided Leggett with up to \u201ctwelve months following the Closing\u201d to bring a claim for breach of representation. Leg-gett, however, was barred from seeking indemnification for breach of a representation or warranty \u201cto the extent [Leggett] had actual knowledge of such breach prior to the date [of the Agreement]\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 11.5(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">During negotiations for the Agreement, Leggett was provided access to the Division\u2019s books and records as part of the due diligence process, and the Division provided any information that Leggett requested. Among the documents available to Leggett were the Division\u2019s own internal, unaudited monthly balance sheets showing the assets and liabilities of the Division\u2019s operations in the United States and Canada. Susan McCoy, Leggett\u2019s Manager of Due Diligence, learned how the Division and its parent, TransPro, accounted for incurred but not recorded (hereinafter, \u201cIBNR\u201d) medical claims. Specifically, she learned that no IBNR accrual was recorded in the financial statements of the Division but was recorded instead on Trans-Pro\u2019s books. TransPro prepared its own audited corporate balance sheets showing the assets and liabilities of all of its divisions on a consolidated basis, including the Division, but never provided the audited corporate books to Leggett.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> McCoy did not review TransPro\u2019s books at that time to see what portion of its accrual for IBNR was attributable to the Division because TransPro\u2019s financial statements were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>subject to due diligence review and were not available to Leggett. McCoy proposed no specific adjustments in light of the Division\u2019s treatments of IBNR claims prior to closing, and no portion of the $2.5 million purchase price adjustment was attributable to her findings about the Division\u2019s lack of IBNR accrual.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The transaction closed on May 5, 2000 (\u201cClosing Date\u201d), when Leggett acquired the assets and liabilities of the Division. Leggett paid $37,500,000 in cash for the Division based in part on TransPro\u2019s representation that the net asset value of the business, i.e., assets minus liabilities, was equal to at least $15,500,000. In August 2000, McCoy conducted a follow-up visit to the Division\u2019s office to calculate the NAV and address other post-closing issues. At that time, she concluded that - the NAV exceeded $15.5 million and that no payment was due from TransPro.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Even so, after the Closing Date, several adjustments were to be made and were made by the parties. TransPro requested and received reimbursement for $600,000 in actual employee medical claim liabilities that had been incurred \u201cas of\u2019 May 5, 2000. Leggett paid workers\u2019 compensation claims of former Division employees that TransPro was required to reimburse under the Agreement. TransPro also requested reimbursement for employee payroll amounts paid in early May 2000 because someone had mistakenly paid $573,553 in payroll expenses from Trans-Pro\u2019s bank accounts during this time. Under the Agreement, TransPro was to process but not pay the Division\u2019s payroll for the period immediately prior to the Closing Date, as Leggett had assumed those liabilities and was responsible for those payroll obligations. TransPro did not discover the mistake until November 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">After TransPro demanded reimbursement for the payroll expenses, McCoy revisited the NAV calculation, relying on information that was not available on the Closing Date. To calculate what she thought the accrual \u201cshould have been,\u201d McCoy included those actual medical claims that were not submitted to the Division until after the Closing Date, meaning that they were not reflected on the Division\u2019s books and records on the Closing Date, and including an additional amount for future estimated claims, based on the claims submitted after the Closing Date.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">McCoy reviewed information relating to the Division\u2019s assets and liabilities \u201cas of May 5, 2000\u201d in order to calculate the NAV as of that date, using the best available actual information as required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (hereinafter, \u201cGAAP\u201d) to insure that the calculation was as accurate as possible and including information that resulted in both upward and downward adjustments to the NAV. Ultimately, Leggett determined and its expert confirmed that the NAV was only $15,180,373, a shortfall of $319,627 from the contractual representation of TransPro. Based on the shortfall, Leggett concluded that it owed TransPro only $253,926 for post-closing payroll adjustments, which Leggett paid. TransPro insisted that Leggett was not entitled to any offset and that Transpro was entitled to recover the full amount of $573,553 from Leggett.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">On November 26, 2002, TransPro sued Leggett alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment, claiming in part that Leggett had breached the Agreement by failing to reimburse it for $319,627 in payroll expenses that TransPro paid after the Closing Date.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 6, 2003, Leg-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>gett filed a Counterclaim against TransPro asserting breach of the Agreement\u2019s NAV representation in an amount equal to TransPro\u2019s claim, $319,627.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, focusing on the validity of Leggett\u2019s NAV calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The district court ultimately granted Leggett\u2019s motion and denied TransPro\u2019s motion. In its decision, the district court first rejected TransPro\u2019s argument that, based on \u00a7 11.5(c) of the Agreement, Leg-gett could not assert a breach of NAV representation based on the IBNR adjustment because Leggett knew before closing that the Division did not accrue the IBNR claims on its financial statements. The district court reasoned that \u201c[t]he Agreement\u2019s plain language precluded a claim for breach of a representation of warranty only if Leggett had actual knowledge of a breach.\u201d Thus, explained the court, \u201cknowledge of a breach is required, not merely knowledge of a condition that may or may not lead to a breach.\u201d Finding that it was undisputed that Leggett did not know of a breach before the Closing Date, the district court concluded that \u00a7 11.5(c) did not preclude Leggett\u2019s claim for breach of the NAV representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The district court next determined that Leggett\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 4.22 was correct and that Leggett was permitted to include the IBNR adjustment in the NAV calculation even though that information was not available until after the Closing Date. Based on the proposed readings offered by the parties, the district court concluded that \u201cthe phrase \u2018as of used in \u00a7 4.22 of the Agreement is ambiguous because it may be interpreted in at least two, mutually exclusive ways.\u201d The court then considered extrinsic evidence presented by the parties, including Leggett\u2019s expert, John Lane, and the deposition testimony of a TransPro officer and a former Trans-Pro officer, to reach its conclusion. Notably, Lane opined that standard accounting .practice under GAAP defines \u201cas of\u2019 to mean that one calculates the value of an entity\u2019s assets on that date and the amount of the entity\u2019s incurred liabilities on the same date. Thus, he explained that a balance sheet is actually prepared and published after the closing date of a transaction using information gathered after the closing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">TransPro\u2019s former CFO, Timothy Coyne, testified that, as a practical matter, it would be impossible to actually prepare the final balance sheet on the closing date of a transaction because all of the necessary information would not be available instantaneously. TransPro\u2019s Corporate Controller, Kenneth Flynn, also conceded that balance sheets are, by their very \u201cnature,\u201d prepared after the Closing Date using information gathered after that point in time. The district court concluded that their testimony \u201cprovided the court with ample evidence of how GAAP is applied by TransPro.\u201d TransPro offered no evidence countering Leggett\u2019s proffered interpretation. The district court concluded that Leggett\u2019s interpretation of \u201cas of\u2019 was correct, writing that \u201cexpenses incurred before the Closing Date are to be included in the NAV calculation, even though they may not be reported until after the Closing Date. Leggett\u2019s [IBNR] adjustment was proper, as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">The district court entered judgment in favor of Leggett on July 16, 2007. On July 27, 2007, TransPro filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment in order to obtain a more definite statement of pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>judgment interest to be awarded. The district court adopted the proposed amended judgment entry on September 21, 2007. On October 1, 2007, TransPro filed its Notice of Appeal of \u201cthe final judgment entered in this action on September 21, 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">II. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The district court had jurisdiction of this matter, an action between citizens of different states with an amount in controversy in excess of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. In turn, this Court has jurisdiction of this appeal, timely taken on October 1, 2007, from the September 21, 2007, final decision of the district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; Fed. R.App. P. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">III. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">This Court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>using the same standard as the district court. <em>S.S. v. E. Ky. Univ., </em>532 F.3d 445, 452 (6th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In considering' a motion for summary judgment, the district court must construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). The nonmoving party \u201ccannot respond by merely resting on the pleadings, but rather the non-moving party must present some \u2018specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wiley v. United States, </em>20 F.3d 222, 224 (6th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). The central issue is \u201cwhether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 251-52,106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">IV. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b465-15\">A. Section 11.5(c) of the Agreement Does Not Preclude Leggett\u2019s Claim for Breach of NAV Representation Based on IBNR Adjustment Because Leggett Did Not Have Actual Knowledge of Breach Before Closing Date</p>\n<p id=\"b465-16\">Section 11.5(c) provides that \u201c[Leggett] shall not be entitled to indemnification for breach of a representation or warranty under this Article 11 to the extent [Leggett] had actual knowledge of such breach prior to the date hereof.\u201d Trans-Pro takes the position that, if \u00a7 11.5(c) is read in its entirety and applied properly to the undisputed facts, Leggett had actual knowledge of a breach of the NAV representation made by TransPro and could not base its NAV counterclaim on the known absence of IBNR accrual. For the reasons stated below, TransPro\u2019s argument is without merit, and the decision of the district court shall be affirmed in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-17\">When considering a claim founded on a contract, \u201cif the relevant contract language is clear and unambiguous, courts must give the language its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Phillips Home Builders, Inc. v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>700 A.2d 127, 129 (Del.1997).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>\u201c[c]ontracts are to be interpreted in a way that does not render any provisions \u2018illusory or meaningless.\u2019 \u201d <em>O\u2019Brien v. Progressive N. Ins. Co., </em>785 A.2d 281, 287 (Del.2001) (quoting <em>Sonitrol Holding Co. v. Marcean Investissements, </em>607 A.2d 1177, 1183 (Del.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">While it is undisputed that during due diligence Leggett learned that the Division did not accrue IBNR medical claims on its balance sheets, there is no evidence in the record that suggests that Leggett learned or could have learned of the actual existence or the dollar value of the IBNR claims that were incurred prior to but recorded after the Closing Date. In other words, \u201cto the extent\u201d that Leggett knew that the Division did not accrue IBNR medical claims on its balance sheets, it \u201cknew\u201d only that IBNR claims might exist that would impact the NAV. It was no less possible, as far as Leggett knew, that such IBNR claims might not exist at all or might not be large enough to cause the NAV to fall below the $15,500,000 warranted in the Agreement. Thus, Leggett\u2019s knowledge that there might be IBNR claims is not the same as \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of IBNR claims sufficient to reduce the NAV below the warranted amount of $15,500,000 that would constitute a breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">This reading does not render any provision of \u00a7 11.5(c), notably the phrase \u201cto the extent,\u201d illusory or meaningless as TransPro suggests. Rather, it respects the plain meaning of the language of the Agreement where, as the district court wrote, \u201cknowledge of a breach is required, not merely knowledge of a condition that may or may not lead to a breach.\u201d Section 11.5(c) does not bar Leggett\u2019s claim for breach of the NAV representation, and the district court did not err in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">B. Section 4.22 of Agreement Does Not Bar Leggett From Using Information Obtained After Closing Date Regarding Pre-Closing Date Transactions When Calculating NAV</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">Nor did the district court err in determining that \u00a7 4.22 does not preclude Leggett from including the IBNR accrual, calculated from information received after the Closing Date, in its valuation of the NAV even though that information was not and could not have been contained in the books and records of the Division on the Closing Date.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">Again, if the relevant language in the Agreement \u201cis clear and unambiguous, courts must give the language its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Phillips Home Builders, </em>700 A.2d at 129; <em>Pellaton v. Bank of New York, </em>592 A.2d 473, 478 (Del.1991) (holding that a court may not consider parol evidence to interpret contract which is clear and unambiguous on its face). The fact that parties offer different interpretations of contractual language is insufficient, by itself, to make the language ambiguous, and for good reason:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">When the language of a contract is clear and unequivocal, a party will be bound by its plain meaning because creating an ambiguity where none exists could, in effect, create new contract rights, liabilities and duties to which the parties had not assented. By such judicial action, the reliability of written contracts is undermined, thus diminishing the wealth-creating potential of voluntary agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"AGE\"><em>Allied Capital Corp. v. GC-Sun Holdings, L.P., </em>910 A.2d 1020, 1030 (Del.Ch.2006) (citing <em>Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Am. Legacy Found., </em>903 A.2d 728, 739 (Del.2006); and <em>Sharon Steel Coup. v. Chase Manhat</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number><em>tan Bank, N.A., </em>691 F.2d 1039, 1048 (2d Cir.1982)). Ambiguity exists only where the \u201cthe provisions in controversy are reasonably or fairly susceptible of different interpretations or may have two or more different meanings.\u201d <em>Rhone-Pouleuc Basic Chem. Co. v. Amer. Motorists Ins. Co., </em>616 A.2d 1192, 1196 (Del.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Before the district court, as here, Leggett and TransPro both offered reasonable interpretations of this provision, which reads, \u201cBook value will be determined from Seller and VMS\u2019 books and records as of the opening of business on the Closing Date ... as applied by Seller and VMS prior to Closing.\u201d Leggett argues that the \u201cas of\u2019 language in \u00a7 4.22 establishes the point in time for which the NAV is calculated but does not limit the availability date for the information used to calculate that value. Thus, Leggett contends that \u00a7 4.22 unambiguously permits Leggett to use information representing assets and/or liabilities incurred by the Division prior to Closing when calculating the NAV, even if that information was obtained after the Closing Date. Leggett\u2019s theory allows for events that occur before the Closing Date and which affect the book value of the assets and liabilities \u201cas of\u2019 the Closing Date even if that information is not obtained or recorded until after the Closing Date. By contrast, TransPro argues that \u201cas of\u2019 \u201crelates only to when the NAV calculation is performed \u2014 not what is included in that calculation\u201d and that only information available on the Closing Date may be used in the NAV calculation. These opposing theories present a classic instance of ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Further, there is no merit to TransPro\u2019s assertion that the district court erroneously admitted and considered extrinsic evidence \u2014 in the form of Lane\u2019s affidavit \u2014 to manufacture ambiguity in \u00a7 4.22. In fact, the district court first determined that the contract was, as a matter of law, ambiguous, i.e., susceptible to two reasonable interpretations as presented by the parties. Only after did the district court examine extrinsic evidence in the form of Lane\u2019s affidavit, Leggett\u2019s expert witness, and the testimony of Flynn and Coyne, an officer and former officer of TransPro, respectively-</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The record demonstrates that the district court performed its duty \u201cto examine solely the language of the contractual provisions in question to determine whether the disputed terms are capable of two or more reasonable interpretations,\u201d \u201ccon-fin[ing itself] to the language of the document and not [looking] to extrinsic evidence to find ambiguity.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>785 A.2d at 289. The testamentary evidence offered from Lane, Flynn, and Coyne was only considered after the district court\u2019s determination that the words \u201cas of\u2019 were ambiguous and was not used to manufacture an ambiguity, as TransPro suggests. This was not error by the district court. <em>See Allied Capital Corp., </em>910 A.2d at 1030 (\u201cOnly where the contract\u2019s language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation may a court look to parol evidence; otherwise, only the language of the contract itself is considered in determining the intentions of the parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">TransPro\u2019s argument that the district court should not have considered Lane\u2019s affidavits because they had \u201cabsolutely no relevance to the proper interpretation of \u00a7 4.22\u201d is also meritless. Through his first affidavit, Lane testified regarding the use of estimates known to be inaccurate under GAAP, a term used in \u00a7 4.22 and a term of art, and spoke specifically to the propriety of McCoy\u2019s adjustments to the NAV for the IBNR medical claims using GAAP. In his second affidavit, Lane set forth that, in the accounting industry and under GAAP, \u201cas of\u201d is a term of art and that balance sheets are routinely pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>pared \u201cas of\u2019 a closing date using information acquired and learned after that date. Thus, Lane\u2019s affidavits have \u201ca tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence,\u201d and they were properly admitted. Fed.R.Evid. 401 and 402; <em>see also Nucor Corp. v. Neb. Public Power Dist., </em>891 F.2d 1343, 1350 (8th Cir.1989) (holding that experts are permitted to testify as to terms of art contained in contracts); <em>Kona Tech. Corp. v. S. Pac. Transp. Co., </em>225 F.3d 595, 611 (5th Cir.2000) (finding expert testimony properly admitted to interpret contract provisions having a specialized meaning in the railroad industry); <em>see also North Am. Specialty Ins. Co. v. Myers, </em>111 F.3d 1273, 1281 (6th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>TCP Indus., Inc., v. Uniroyal, Inc., </em>661 F.2d 542, 549 (6th Cir.1981)) (\u201cAbsent any need to clarify or define terms of art, science, or trade, expert opinion testimony to interpret contract language is inadmissible.\u201d); <em>WH Smith Hotel Servs., Inc. v. Wendy\u2019s Int'l Inc., </em>25 F.3d 422, 429 (7th Cir.1994) (finding no error in admitting expert testimony regarding customary and usual meaning of rent provisions in the commercial real estate industry).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Finally, the record contains no evidence rebutting Lane\u2019s opinion testimony or countering Flynn and Coyne\u2019s testimony regarding TransPro\u2019s own post-Closing Date preparation of balance sheets using data available after a closing date but related to the value of assets or liabilities \u201cas of\u2019 a closing date. A court may interpret an ambiguous contract as a matter of law where the moving party\u2019s record is not rebutted. <em>See Eagle Indus., Inc. v. DeVilbiss Health Care, Inc., </em>702 A.2d 1228, 1232-33 (Del.1997). Further, a court may rely on extrinsic evidence to interpret the contract as a matter of law where the extrinsic evidence does not create an issue of material fact. <em>Id.; Royal Ins. Co. v. Orient Overseas Container Line, Ltd., </em>514 F.3d 621, 634-35 (6th Cir.2008). It follows that the district court properly construed and interpreted the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In the absence of error, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-9\">. The Division's balance sheet instead listed an artificial insurance premium amount of approximately $2,000, which the Division paid to TransPro's corporate office. Liability for employee medical claims was reflected only on a consolidated basis on TransPro\u2019s corporate balance sheet. Because Leggett was never provided with TransPro\u2019s corporate books, no one from Leggett reviewed the employee medical claim liability figures recorded on TransPro\u2019s corporate balance sheet. Had Leggett reviewed those figures, however, they would have learned very little about the Division's liabilities. TransPro's corporate balance sheet for December 1999 showed $1,600,000 as the consolidated liability for employee medical claims for the entire company, not just the Division operations being purchased by Leggett. Even if Leggett had seen TransPro's corporate balance sheet prior to the Closing Date, Leggett could not have known the actual amount of employee medical claim liability attributed to the Division.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\">. TransPro sought to recover for other items, as well, but those claims were resolved by the parties and are not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b464-6\">. In addition, Leggett asserted that TransPro breached the Agreement by failing to reimburse and indemnify Leggett for workers\u2019 compensation payments made to three former employees of the Division.
