However, neither this Court nor the District Court has jurisdiction to seal or expunge a conviction where there is no challenge to the validity of the conviction or arrest. <em>United States v. Rowlands, </em>451 F.3d 173, 178 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 1032, 127 S.Ct. 598, 166 L.Ed.2d 431 (2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We do not have jurisdiction to consider an expungement on the basis that a defendant is having difficulty in finding or retaining employment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-20\">We therefore will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-16\">. Although Boniella uses the term \"seal,\u201d he essentially seeks expungement. \u201cAlthough different states may define expungement' differently, \u2018in general when a defendant moves to expunge records, she asks that the court destroy or seal the records of the fact of the defendant's conviction and not the conviction itself.'\u201d <em>Rowlands, </em>451 F.3d at 176 (quoting <em>United States v. Crowell, </em>374 F.3d 790, 792 (9th Cir.2004)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
