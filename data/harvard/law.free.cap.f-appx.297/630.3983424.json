Petitioner seeks review only of the IJ\u2019s determination that he failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution upon his return to Guatemala. Petitioner is not entitled to a presumption of future persecution on the basis of past persecution, for he does not seek review of the IJ\u2019s findings that he did not suffer past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Where an applicant for asylum has not demonstrated past persecution, the applicant must show \u201cboth a subjective fear of future persecution and an objectively \u2018reasonable possibility\u2019 that the applicant will be persecuted upon return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Recinos De Leon v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 1185, 1190 (9th Cir.2005) (internal citation omitted). Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that he failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. He testified that, before leaving Guatemala in 1993, he had difficulties in his hometown of Panorama with guerillas. Since his departure, peace accords between the government and guerillas have been signed. There is thus nothing in this record to suggest any objective basis for a fear of worse treatment in the future than in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b656-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
