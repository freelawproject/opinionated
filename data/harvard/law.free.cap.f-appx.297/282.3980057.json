McCullough challenges these rulings on appeal. We hold that McCullough did not suffer an adverse employment action. Therefore, she has failed to state a prima facie case of discrimination. We further hold that McCullough has presented no evidence that Houston County\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for reducing her work responsibilities and terminating her from the District Clerk\u2019s Office are pretextual. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of McCullough\u2019s discrimination and retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Houston County District Attorney (\u201cDA\u201d) Cindy Maria Garner hired McCullough as a Grand Jury Clerk in March 2003. At that time, McCullough was one of four clerical employees in the DA\u2019s Office and the only African-American. The other employees\u2019 names were Patti, Janet, and Lisa.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">On November 2, 2004, David Cervantes defeated Garner in an election for DA. On November 3, 2004, Garner wrote to Cervantes in an e-mail that her \u201cfirst order of business\u201d was to meet with her staff and talk with them about their future with the DA\u2019s Office. In the e-mail, Garner listed the names of her staff members and their respective positions. Cervantes responded that he was not planning on making any major personnel changes. Notwithstanding Cervantes\u2019s plans, McCullough told her co-workers that she did not want to work for Cervantes.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">On November 28, 2004, Cervantes sent a fax to the DA\u2019s office asking Patti, Janet, and Lisa to call him and set up a time to discuss whether they wanted to work for him. Cervantes did not address the fax to McCullough. He did not think McCullough would want to work for him in light of the way she had treated him before he was elected.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> McCullough took Cervantes\u2019s fax to mean that he would not interview her for a position. At some point before her last day of employment with the DA\u2019s Office, McCullough accepted a part-time position with the Houston County District Clerk\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">On November 29, 2004, Garner sent each of her four clerical employees a \u201clay off letter\u201d stating that the DA\u2019s office was \u201cdown-sizing\u201d and their last paid day would be December 31, 2004. Garner did not actually intend to lay off anyone; she intended to help her employees obtain unemployment benefits if they chose not to continue employment with Cervantes. These letters were never made a part of the employees\u2019 official files. Cervantes was not aware that Garner had \u201claid off\u201d her four clerical employees until after he took office.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>On January 1, 2005, Cervantes was sworn in as the Houston County DA. Cervantes understood that all of the employees in the DA\u2019s Office would keep their positions despite the change in leadership, and while he could make employment changes as he saw fit, he could do so only after being sworn into office.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Cervantes\u2019s first day of work as the new DA was January 3, 2005. McCullough did not come to work that day or call in sick. Cervantes sent a letter to Houston County Treasurer Dianne Rhone, the county employee responsible for .personnel matters, asking whether McCullough had resigned. Rhone told Cervantes that McCullough had started work that day with the Houston County District Clerk\u2019s Office. Although clerical openings became available during Cervantes\u2019s tenure, McCullough never reapplied to the DA\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">McCullough\u2019s duties at the District Clerk\u2019s Office included answering the phone, assisting customers, and filing. On June 1, 2005, Carolyn Rains became the District Clerk. Two months later, on August 3, 2005, McCullough filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, claiming she was discharged from the DA\u2019s Office based on her race and her age, and in retaliation for exercising her First Amendment rights. McCullough alleged that she received a letter from Garner on November 29, 2004, notifying her that she would be \u201cdownsized\u201d and that her employment with the DA\u2019s Office would cease after December 31, 2004. McCullough has not alleged any discriminatory conduct or motivation on the part of Garner. Instead, she acknowledged in her deposition that the purpose of Garner\u2019s letter was to help McCullough secure unemployment benefits if she did not continue to work in the DA\u2019s Office after Garner left office.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">On January 20, 2006, McCullough filed suit in the district court pursuant to \u00a7 1983, alleging (1) that Houston County discriminated against McCullough based on her age and race in violation of Title VII, the ADEA, and'42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; and (2) that Houston County retaliated against McCullough for exercising her First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> McCullough based her discrimination claims on Cervantes\u2019s terminating her from, or alternatively Cervantes\u2019s failure to rehire her at, the DA\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Meanwhile, McCullough continued her employment with the District Clerk\u2019s Office. On January 27, 2006, Rains assigned McCullough the responsibilities of coordinating administrative activities for Judge Fletcher in the 349th Judicial District Court. McCullough\u2019s suit against Houston County was still moving forward, and on April 28, 2006, McCullough gave deposition testimony. On May 9, 2006, Judge Fletcher complained about McCullough\u2019s performance and requested that Rains reassign McCullough. Immediately thereafter, Rains returned McCullough to answering phones, filing, helping people that entered the District Clerk\u2019s Office, and shredding.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">On July 17, 2006, McCullough faxed a physician\u2019s note to the District Clerk\u2019s Office indicating that she would not be at work for four weeks due to unspecified medical reasons. McCullough did not address the matter directly with Rains. On July 21, 2006, Rains hired two part-time summer employees. On July 26, 2006, Rains sent McCullough a letter detailing Houston County leave policy. ' She reminded McCullough that, as a part-time employee, she did not qualify for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, sick leave, or vacation. Rains also forwarded McCullough a copy of the Houston <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>County employment manual. McCullough never responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">On August 18, 2006, McCullough sent Rains another physician\u2019s note with the apparent intent of extending her time off work for an additional four weeks. Given McCullough\u2019s prolonged absence unaccompanied by much in the way of an explanation, Rains assumed McCullough would not be returning to work. Consequently, Rains committed to provide another one of the part-time summer employees twenty hours of work per week during the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">On September 8, 2006, McCullough participated in mediation for her suit against Houston County, which resulted in McCullough and Houston County coming to an impasse. Later that day, McCullough contacted Rains for the first time about coming back to work, asking if she could start back on September 11, 2006. While Rains knew about the lawsuit generally, she did not keep up-to-date on specific proceedings, including the mediation. Rains allowed McCullough to work sporadically through. September and October, but on October 12, 2006, Rains fired McCullough from the District Clerk\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">On December 22, 2006, McCullough amended her federal lawsuit against Houston County to add an additional cause of action for retaliation arising out of her termination from the District Clerk\u2019s Office.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> McCullough claimed that she was terminated for pursuing her discrimination lawsuit against Cervantes and Houston County.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Appellees filed two motions for summary judgment, one pertaining to McCullough\u2019s discrimination claims and the other pertaining to McCullough\u2019s retaliation claims. The district court granted summary judgment for Appellees on McCullough\u2019s discrimination claims, holding that McCullough failed to establish a prima fa-cie case of discrimination. The district court found that Cervantes\u2019s fax, which excluded McCullough from an invitation to interview, did not constitute an adverse employment action. The district court emphasized the following facts: (1) Garner, not Cervantes, gave the lay off letter to McCullough; (2) before Cervantes took office, no one other than Garner had the authority to terminate McCullough; (8) McCullough\u2019s continued employment with the DA\u2019s Office was not contingent on interviewing with Cervantes; and (4) McCullough never sought employment with Cervantes after he began his tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">In a separate memorandum opinion and order, the district court likewise granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees on McCullough\u2019s retaliation claims. The district court held that McCullough had not established a prima facie case of retaliation because she failed to show a causal connection between her termination from the Houston County Clerk\u2019s Office and her protected activity. The district court alternatively held that Houston County had articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating McCullough from the District Clerk\u2019s Office, and McCullough had not rebutted Houston County\u2019s proffered reasons by demonstrating pretext. McCullough appeals from both of the district court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. of Am. v. Baptist Health Sys., </em>313 F.3d 295, 297 (5th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.; see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). A germine issue of material fact exists if a reasonable jury could enter a verdict for the non-moving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). We resolve all reasonable doubts in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 143, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">A. Discrimination Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">McCullough argues that she suffered an adverse employment action when Cervantes sent the fax inviting her white, younger co-workers to interview with him while excluding her from the invitation. According to McCullough, the fact that Cervantes had not yet officially been sworn into office when he sent the fax was \u201cof little moment\u201d because Cervantes was the \u201cactual decisionmaker\u201d as the newly-elected DA. McCullough contends that by sending the fax, Cervantes effectively terminated her, or alternatively, failed to rehire her. Under her failure to rehire theory, McCullough contends that not applying for a job with Cervantes does not preclude her claim because such efforts would have been futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Houston County responds that Cervantes did not cause McCullough to suffer an adverse employment action. Houston County emphasizes that it was Garner, not Cervantes, who \u201claid off\u2019 McCullough. Cervantes was never McCullough\u2019s employer, nor did he ever have the authority to terminate her.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">Employment discrimination claims may be established either through direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>Laxton v. Gap, Inc., </em>333 F.3d 572, 578 (5th Cir.2003). Absent direct evidence, we apply the burden-shifting framework articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Carp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>Russell v. McKinney Hosp. Venture, </em>235 F.3d 219, 222 (5th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">Under the <em>McDonnell </em>framework, the plaintiff has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>McDonnell, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. Where the alleged discrimination resulted in a failure to rehire, a prima facie case requires the plaintiff to show that: (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she sought and was qualified for an available employment position; (3) she was rejected for that position; and (4) the employer continued to seek applicants with the plaintiffs qualifications. <em>LaPierre v. Benson Nissan, Inc., </em>86 F.3d 444, 448 (5th Cir.1996). Where the alleged discrimination resulted in termination, a prima facie case requires the plaintiff to show that: \u201c \u2018(1) [she] is a member of a protected class; (2)[she] was qualified for her position; (3)[she] was subject to an adverse employment action; and (4)[she] was replaced by someone outside the protected class,\u2019 or, in the case of disparate treatment, ... \u2018that others similarly situated were treated more favorably.\u2019 \u201d <em>Okoye v. Univ. of Tex. Houston Health Sci. Ctr., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>245 F.3d 507, 512-13 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Shackelford v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, LLP, </em>190 F.3d 398, 404 (5th Cir.1999)). For purposes of a Title VII discrimination claim, \u2018\u201cadverse employment actions include only ultimate employment decisions such as hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, or compensating.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCoy v. City of Shreveport, </em>492 F.3d 551, 559 (5th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Green v. Adm\u2019rs of Tulane Educ. Fund, </em>284 F.3d 642, 657 (5th Cir.2002)). Although \u201cadverse employment action\u201d is defined more broadly under \u00a7 1983 than it is under Title VII, its definition likewise includes discharges and refusals to hire. <em>Southard v. Tex. Bd. of Criminal Justice, </em>114 F.3d 539, 555 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">We hold that McCullough has failed to make a prima facie case of discrimination. We easily dispose of McCullough\u2019s claim that Cervantes\u2019s fax failed to rehire her. To establish a prima facie case of discrimination where the alleged adverse employment action is failure to rehire, the plaintiff must have actually sought the position she alleged to have been denied. <em>La-Pierre, </em>86 F.3d at 448. McCullough concedes that she neither applied for nor was interested in a position with the DA\u2019s office during Cervantes\u2019s tenure. McCullough justifies her failure to apply by arguing that any attempts on her part to obtain employment from Cervantes would have been futile. McCullough\u2019s reliance on the \u201cfutile gesture doctrine\u201d is misplaced as this circuit \u201crequires a showing that the applicant ... was deterred by a <em>knoum and consistently enforced policy of discrimination.\u201d Shackelford, </em>190 F.3d at 406 (emphasis added). McCullough has offered no evidence whatsoever to the effect that Cervantes had a known and consistently enforced policy of discriminating based on either age or race.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Nor has McCullough demonstrated to this court that Cervantes\u2019s fax effectively terminated her from the DA\u2019s Office. Notwithstanding McCullough\u2019s allegations to the contrary, Cervantes\u2019s fax did not \u201cdecline[] to allow\u201d McCullough to interview. Cervantes simply sent a fax to Garner\u2019s office inviting McCullough\u2019s co-workers to meet with him, which is not the logical equivalent of declining to interview McCullough. Even if Cervantes had \u201cdeclined to allow\u201d McCullough to interview, it is uncontroverted that Cervantes had no actual authority to terminate or hire anyone until he was sworn into office on January 1, 2005. It was McCullough who sought different employment prior to January 1, 2005, and it was McCullough who failed to show up for work on January 3, 2005 when Cervantes took office.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">At bottom, Cervantes never had the opportunity either to fail to rehire or to terminate McCullough because she never gave him the opportunity. Thus, because McCullough has not satisfied her initial burden of establishing a prima facie case, our analysis under the <em>McDonnell </em>framework of McCullough\u2019s discrimination claims ends here.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">B. Retaliation Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">In addition to her discrimination claims, McCullough also alleges that she was terminated from the District Clerk\u2019s Office in retaliation for pursuing her claims against Houston County arising out of her separation from the DA\u2019s Office. McCullough contends that her \u201cwork situation\u201d deteriorated immediately after she gave her deposition in her case against Houston County, that the Monday following mediation of her case she was told there was no work left for her to do, and that Rains ultimately terminated her within one month of her mediation. These facts, according to McCullough, establish a causal link between her suit against Houston County and her termination from the District Clerk\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Houston County argues that no causal connection exists between McCullough\u2019s lawsuit and the adverse employment actions taken against her, and that McCullough failed to present any evidence to the contrary. According to Houston County, Rains reduced McCullough\u2019s responsibilities to no longer include working with Judge Fletcher because Judge Fletcher said McCullough was incapable and requested that she be reassigned. Houston County further contends that McCullough was terminated for the simple reason that she took eight weeks of unapproved medical leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Like discrimination claims, we analyze retaliation claims using the <em>McDonnell </em>framework. <em>McCoy v. City of Shreveport, </em>492 F.3d 551, 556 (5th Cir.2007). Thus, the plaintiff has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case. <em>Id. </em>To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, the plaintiff must show that: (1) she engaged in a protected activity; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>Id. </em>at 556-57. The Supreme Court recently clarified in <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006), that for purposes of Title VII, an \u201cadverse employment action\u201d is defined differently in the retaliation context than it is in the discrimination context. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 126 S.Ct. 2405. In the retaliation context, it is an action that \u201ca reasonable employee would have found ... [to be] materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). The causal link required by the third prong does not rise to the level of a \u201cbut for\u201d standard at the prima facie stage. <em>Gee v. Principi, </em>289 F.3d 342, 345 (5th Cir.2002). \u201cClose timing between an employee\u2019s protected activity and an adverse action against [her] may provide the \u2018causal connection\u2019 required to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation.\u201d <em>Swanson v. Gen. Servs. Admin., </em>110 F.3d 1180, 1188 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see, e.g., Richard v. Cingular Wireless LLC, </em>233 Fed.Appx. 334, 338 (5th Cir.2007) (concluding that two and one half months is a short enough time period to support an inference of a causal link); <em>Raggs v. Miss. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>278 F.3d 463, 471-72 (5th Cir.2002) (holding that a five-month lapse, by itself, does not support an inference of a causal link).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Assuming the plaintiff establishes a pri-ma facie case, then the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. <em>McCoy, </em>492 F.3d at 557. If the employer articulates a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason, then \u201cany presumption of discrimination raised by the plaintiffs <em>prima facie </em>case vanishes.\u201d <em>Septimus v. Univ. of Houston, </em>399 F.3d 601, 609 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">In the final stage of the <em>McDonnell </em>framework, the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of demonstrating a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the employer\u2019s proffered reason is a pretext for a retaliatory purpose. <em>See McCoy, </em>492 F.3d at 557. The plaintiff must show that \u201cthe adverse employment action taken against the plaintiff would not have occurred \u2018but for\u2019 her protected conduct.\u201d <em>Septimus, </em>399 F.3d at 608.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This court has expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>rejected the notion that temporal proximity standing alone is sufficient to establish but-for causation. <em>Strong v. Univ. Healthcare Sys., </em>482 F.3d 802, 808 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">McCullough fails to point to any evidence that the District Clerk\u2019s actions were coordinated with or show a cognizance of what was happening in McCullough\u2019s lawsuit arising out of her separation from the DA\u2019s Office. However, even assuming arguendo that McCullough has established a prima facie case of retaliation, we nonetheless affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>See BMG Music v. Martinez, </em>74 F.3d 87, 89 (5th Cir.1996) (\u201cThis Court can affirm the district court\u2019s decision based on any legally sufficient ground, even one not relied upon by the district court.\u201d). Houston County articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for reducing McCullough\u2019s job responsibilities shortly after her deposition \u2014 Judge Fletcher complained that McCullough was incapable and requested that she be reassigned. Houston County also articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for having no work for McCullough on the day of her mediation and ultimately terminating McCullough shortly after her mediation\u2014 the fact that McCullough took eight weeks of unapproved leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Thus, the burden shifted back to McCullough to show that Houston County\u2019s proffered reasons were a pretext for retaliation. McCullough\u2019s attempt at meeting her burden consisted of four points: (1) Rains hired a temporary employee to fill in for McCullough while she took leave, (2) Rains permitted another employee to wait six weeks before starting her position on September 11, 2006, (3) on the day of McCullough\u2019s mediation, Rains told McCullough there was no work for her to do, and (4) Rains fired McCullough approximately one month after her mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">McCullough\u2019s four points fail to rebut Houston County\u2019s proffered legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons. McCullough\u2019s rebuttal points are both irrelevant and nonresponsive to the fact that, at Judge Fletcher\u2019s request, Rains removed McCullough\u2019s administrative coordinating responsibilities because Judge Fletcher found McCullough incapable. Neither the fact that Rains hired another employee after McCullough took leave, nor the fact that Rains arranged for a delayed start date with another employee who was pregnant when hired, demonstrate that but for McCullough\u2019s discrimination lawsuit she would have kept her job. McCullough\u2019s third and fourth points accomplish nothing more than temporally juxtaposing the mediation of her suit against Houston County with a reduction in her workload and her termination. In this circuit, temporal proximity alone will not suffice to establish the requisite but-for causation. <em>See Strong, </em>482 F.3d at 808. McCullough has failed to raise a fact issue suggesting pretext. We hold that the district court properly dismissed her retaliation claim against Houston County.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">Because we find that McCullough did not suffer an adverse employment action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>we also conclude that McCullough failed to make a prima facie case of discrimination. Furthermore, McCullough presented no evidence that Houston County\u2019s legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for reducing her work responsibilities and ultimately terminating her from the District Clerk\u2019s office were pretextual. Accordingly, we AFFIRM both of the district court\u2019s grants of summary judgment in favor of Houston County and Cervantes.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

Thus, McCullough apparently seeks to use \u00a7 1983 as a method for vindicating federal rights conferred to her under Title VII and the ADEA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-14\">. In an affidavit submitted to the district court, Lisa said that she had witnessed McCullough in the past act discourteously toward Cervantes. Specifically, McCullough told Lisa about one time when McCullough shut the door on Cervantes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\">. McCullough abandoned this claim in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\">. McCullough\u2019s retaliation claim only pertained to Houston County; this was not a claim against Cervantes in his individual or official capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\">. Under Texas law, the failure to keep an employee when there is a change in administration is considered a dismissal. <em>County of Dallas v. Wiland, </em>216 S.W.3d 344, 354 (Tex. 2007). However, in <em>Wiland, </em>the new officeholder, Constable Dupree, sent a letter to the plaintiffs after he took office stating that he would not rehire them. He also refused to swear them in when they appeared at the office. Unlike Cervantes here, Dupree took affirmative steps after taking office that the Court found constituted a dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b312-12\">. McCullough\u2019s pleadings under \u00a7 1983 do not alter this analysis. <em>McDonnell, </em>411 U.S. at 802-07, 93 S.Ct. 1817 (dealing with Title VII claims); <em>Russell, </em>235 F.3d at 222 (applying <em>McDonnell </em>to ADEA claims); <em>Lawrence v. Univ. of Tex. Medical Branch at Galveston, </em>163 F.3d 309, 311 (5th Cir.1999) (applying <em>McDonnell </em>to claims brought under \u00a7 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b314-5\">. In order to satisfy his/her ultimate burden under the <em>McDonnell </em>burden-shifting framework, it is now established that in Title VII <em>discrimination </em>cases, \u201ca plaintiff need only meet the \u2018motivating factor' standard even if the plaintiff is adducing only circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Campbell v. England, </em>234 Fed. Appx. 183, 186 n. 4 (5th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, </em>539 U.S. 90, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003); <em>Rachid v. Jack In The Box, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 305, 312 (5th Cir.2004)) (emphasis added). This court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>not extended the holdings of either <em>Desert Palace </em>or <em>Rachid </em>so as to apply the mixed-motives analysis to Title VII <em>retaliation </em>claims. <em>Septimus, </em>399 F.3d at 607 n. 7; <em>Campbell, </em>234 Fed.Appx. at 186 n. 4; <em>Staten v. New Palace Casino, LLC, </em>187 Fed.Appx. 350, 362 (5th Cir.2006). This is particularly true where, as is this case here, neither party raises die issue, bodi parties argue pretext, and both parties engage in a but-for analysis. <em>See Campbell, </em>234 Fed.Appx. at 186 n. 4. Accordingly, we apply the but-for analysis to determine whether McCullough has satisfied her ultimate burden under third stage of the <em>McDonnell </em>burden-shifting framework.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
