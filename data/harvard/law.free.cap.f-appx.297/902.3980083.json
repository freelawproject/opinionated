He was released from prison in 2005, and in 2007, Myers violated his supervised release. He was sentenced to 3 months\u2019 imprisonment and 36 months of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">During this second term of supervised release, Myers\u2019s probation officer petitioned the court to revoke Myers\u2019s release because Myers had again violated the release terms by failing to submit monthly reports, failing to adhere to drug testing requirements, and testing positive for cocaine. Myers admitted the violations and waived his right to a revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">At sentencing, the court noted that this was Myers\u2019s second violation of supervised release, that Myers had not successfully completed a drug addiction program while previously incarcerated, and that he repeatedly failed to cooperate with his release terms. The court considered the Chapter 7 sentencing guidelines provisions and determined that a sentence within the guideline was not appropriate. Accordingly, the court imposed a 24-month term of imprisonment with no further supervised release. The court asked counsel whether there was anything further, but did not elicit specific objections. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-14\">On appeal, Myers first argues that the district court erred by failing to elicit objections, as required by <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097 (11th Cir.1990) <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136 (11th Cir.1993), and that the record is insufficient for meaningful review of his sentence. Second, Myers argues that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-15\">I. Objection-Elicitation Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b929-16\">District courts must \u201celicit fully articulated objections, following imposition of sentence, to the court\u2019s ultimate findings of fact and conclusions of law,\u201d as well as \u201cthe manner in which the sentence is pronounced.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>899 F.2d at 1102. This requirement applies to revocation of supervised release proceedings. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1348 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-17\">Here, the parties concede that the court failed to elicit objections as required by <em>Jones. </em>\u201cWhere the district court has not elicited fully articulated objections following the imposition of sentence, [we] will vacate the sentence and remand for further sentencing in order to give the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>an opportunity to raise and explain their objections.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>899 F.2d at 1103. However, remand is unnecessary when the record on appeal is sufficient for meaningful appellate review. <em>Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Upon review of the record, we conclude remand is not necessary because the record is sufficient for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">II. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">We review a sentence imposed pursuant to revocation of a term of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). However, we review \u201ca district court\u2019s decision to exceed the Chapter 7 recommended guidelines range for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 798 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g), the court is required to revoke supervised release where the defendant violates the terms of supervised release by possessing drugs or refusing to comply with drug testing requirements. The court must then sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment as authorized under \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Because Myers\u2019s original conviction was a Class A felony, the maximum term the court could impose was five years\u2019 imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g), (e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">The advisory guideline range for a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release is calculated by the grade classification of the violation for which supervised release was revoked, as determined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(l)-(3), and the criminal history category that was \u201capplicable at the time the defendant originally was sentenced to a term of supervision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). Here, the parties agree that the advisory guidelines range under Chapter 7 was three to nine months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">In determining the appropriate sentence upon revocation, the court may consider (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, (2) the need for deterrence, to protect the public, and to provide the defendant with needed educational or medical care, (3) the kinds of sentences and sentencing range provided by the Guidelines, (4) the need to avoid sentencing disparities, and (5) the need to provide restitution to victims. The court may revoke a term of supervised release and impose a sentence of imprisonment if it \u201cfinds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e), (e)(3), 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(6), (a)(7). As this court has explained, however, a court is not required to consider the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a) when revocation is mandatory under \u00a7 3583(g). <em>United States v. Brown, </em>224 F.3d 1237, 1241 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">Here, the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors even though it was not required to do so. The court also considered the advisory guidelines range and explained why it believed a sentence within the guidelines range was inappropriate to provide punishment. In doing so, the court considered Myers\u2019s repeated violations of the terms of his release and the lack of deterrence that previous incarceration had provided. The court also noted Myers\u2019s substance abuse problem and his unsuccessful attempts at rehabilitation. Moreover, the ultimate sentence imposed was well below the statutory maximum sentence. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion, and we AFFIRM Myers\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
