Archibald appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Archibald worked as a mechanic and an oil derrick hand. Although he never graduated high school, he did earn a GED. At age 47, he filed an application for title XVI SSI benefits, alleging he had become disabled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held a hearing and ruled that Archibald was not disabled. Using the five-step process required by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4), the ALJ found that (1) Archibald had not engaged in a substantially gainful activity since his disability filing; (2) he had a severe impairment from degenerative disc disease; (3) his disabilities did not qualify for presumptive disability; and (4) he was unable to perform past relevant work based on his residual functional capacities. Ultimately, however, the ALJ found at step five that Archibald could perform other work based on his age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The Appeals Council denied Archibald\u2019s request for review, thus making the ALJ\u2019s decision the Commissioner\u2019s final administrative decision ripe for judicial review. Archibald sued, and the magistrate judge recommended the Commissioner\u2019s final decision be upheld. The district court adopted the recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\u201cIn reviewing the Commissioner\u2019s determination, we consider only whether the Commissioner applied the proper legal standards and whether substantial evidence in the record supports the decision to deny benefits.\u201d <em>Audler v. Astrue, </em>501 F.3d 446, 447 (5th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 236 (5th Cir.1994)). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla and less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Masterson v. Barnhart, </em>309 F.3d 267, 271 (5th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). It consists of \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Audler, </em>501 F.3d at 447 (citing <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). Our job is to review the record for the presence of relevant evidence, not to reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for the Commissioner\u2019s. <em>See Perez v. Barnhart, </em>415 F.3d 457, 461 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">Archibald alleges that the ALJ did not have substantial evidence when it found him to have residual functional capacity. The notes of several doctors, including Archibald\u2019s treating psychologist, Mustafa Hussain, disprove that assertion. Hus-sain, with whom Archibald had a long term relationship, stated several times in his treatment notes how Archibald was not disabled. He noted that Archibald was not depressed, did not exhibit mental problems, and was \u201cdoing well from a psychiatric point of view.\u201d The ALJ relied on those statements, providing part of the substantial evidence needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-13\">Although Hussain ultimately believed Archibald was disabled, the numerous references in Hussain\u2019s notes to Archibald\u2019s healthy condition did not support that conclusion, and the ALJ had discretion to reject that medical opinion as \u201cbrief [,] conelusory [, and not] otherwise supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 237 (5th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Scott v. Heckler, </em>770 F.2d 482, 485 (5th Cir. 1985)). The ALJ \u2014 not this court \u2014 should weigh the various medical facts and opinions, and that weighing correctly took place here with the ALJ\u2019s examination of Hussain\u2019s medical notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Other evidence also showed that Archibald was not disabled. Another physician, Dr. Cutts, stated in his notes that he could not \u201cindicate [that Archibald] is disabled.\u201d The same notes also indicate that Archibald had been lifting objects weighing over 100 pounds only weeks before one appointment. Other physicians examining Archibald found inconsistencies in his symptoms and his testimony and concluded that his impairments had only a minimal impact on his ability to function.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">With the evidence from the doctors, the ALJ had substantial evidence to find that Archibald was not disabled. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-10\">. Archibald claims he has at least 25 ailments, including rotator cuff injuries, depression, dessication, degenerative disc disease, bipolar disorder, and sleep apnea.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
