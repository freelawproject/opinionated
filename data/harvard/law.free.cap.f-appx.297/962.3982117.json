Cutts was convicted, upon his guilty pleas, for filing a fraudulent Hurricane Katrina claim with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\u201cFEMA\u201d) in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (conspiracy to defraud the United States), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287 (submitting a false claim against the United States), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 (theft of government funds).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-18\">On appeal, Cutts argues the district court\u2019s reliance on his drug use during his pretrial release to deny his request for an acceptance of responsibility reduction was inappropriate as his drug use was unrelated to the offenses of his convictions. Cutts also contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his request for a downward variance so that his sentence would match the lower sentence received by his father for similar conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-20\">The denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>408 F.3d 745, 756 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility\u201d and is therefore \u201centitled to great deference on review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Section 3E1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines permits a district court to give a defendant a sentence reduction \u201cprovided that the defendant \u2018clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense, and he has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by taking one or more of the following steps: (1) timely providing complete information to the government concerning his own involvement in the offense; or [2] timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Gonsalves, </em>121 F.3d 1416, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>1420 (11th Cir.1997) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1). However, continued criminal activity, such as drug use, during the pretrial period can result in a denial of. this reduction. <em>Gonsalves, </em>121 F.3d at 1420-21. i</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Here, Cutts\u2019s drug use during his pretrial release was unrelated to the underlying offenses for which he pled guilty. However, in <em>United States v. Pace, </em>17 F.3d 341, 343 (11th Cir.1994) we rejected the same argument that Cutts advances here, namely that because he accepted full responsibility for the non-drug related offenses with which he was charged, he should not be denied an acceptance of responsibility reduction for his drug addiction. In <em>Pace, </em>a defendant who pled guilty to making false statements by filing false tax returns was denied an acceptance of responsibility reduction due to his marijuana use while out on bond. 17 F.3d at 342. In reviewing the district court\u2019s decision in <em>Pace, </em>we held that \u201ca district court is authorized to consider subsequent criminal conduct, even if it is unrelated to the offense of conviction, in determining whether a decrease for acceptance of responsibility is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343. Thus, in accordance with our precedent, we find that the district court did not clearly err in denying Cutts an acceptance of responsibility reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">Next, Cutts argues that he is entitled to a downward variance of his sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) in order to avoid a disparity in sentencing between his sentence of twelve months and one day and his father\u2019s sentence of five months for similar conduct. Section 3553(a)(6) requires the district court to consider \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Cutts\u2019s request for a downward departure. Cutts was not similarly situated to his father in that Cutts had a criminal history category of VI while his father had a criminal history of IV. Thus, the resulting difference in their sentences did not create an unwarranted sentencing disparity. Furthermore, the district court imposed a sentence that was within the guidelines range and expressly examined that sentence in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
