Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">An alien who is subject to a final order of removal is limited to filing one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Because petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen was filed beyond the 90-day deadline, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s untimely motion to reopen. <em>See id. </em>Petitioner\u2019s arguments as to why the time limits should not apply to his motion to reopen are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-18\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-19\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-20\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"Ags\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
