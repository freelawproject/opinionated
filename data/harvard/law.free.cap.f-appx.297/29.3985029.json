Dec. 13, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A99 423 307 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 28, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">As an initial matter, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) provides that no court shall have' jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s finding that an asylum application was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), or its finding that neither changed nor extraordinary circumstances excuse the untimeliness under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Notwithstanding that provision, however, we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and \u201cquestions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Because Diallo has failed to present any constitutional claim or question of law related to the agency\u2019s finding that his asylum application was time-barred, we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s decision insofar as it pretermitted his asylum claim. We therefore dismiss the petition for review to that extent. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). However, we may review his challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of his applications for withholding of removal and relief under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, the Court may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. <em>Jigme Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). \u201cWe review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard .... \u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir.2008); see <em>also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact.\u201d <em>Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>We find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Indeed, the IJ properly relied on inconsistencies found in the record. For example, Diallo\u2019s testimony that he joined the Union for Progress and Renewal (\u201cUPR\u201d) in January 2000 was inconsistent with a UPR registration form indicating that he joined the group in October 2000. Likewise, Diallo\u2019s testimony that he received medical treatment for back injuries after being beaten in detention was inconsistent with his supporting medical certificate, which indicated that he received treatment for gastric problems. Although Diallo offered explanations for these inconsistencies, a reasonable fact-finder would not have been compelled to accept them. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.2005). Additionally, we note that, contrary to Diallo\u2019s argument, the IJ did not err in relying on minor inconsistencies that did not go to the heart of his claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii) (providing that the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility determination on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether those inconsistencies go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim\u201d); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 165-66 (noting that under the REAL ID Act, an IJ may base an adverse credibility determination on \u201cinconsistencies and omissions that are \u2018collateral or ancillary\u2019 to an applicant\u2019s claims\u201d). Accordingly, the agency\u2019s denial of Diallo\u2019s application for withholding of removal was proper. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">As to Diallo\u2019s claim for relief under CAT, regardless of whether the agency erred in relying on its adverse credibility determination to deny his application for such relief, <em>see Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005), we find that the agency\u2019s alternative finding \u2014 that Diallo failed to bear his burden of proof \u2014 was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Indeed, the IJ explicitly considered the country conditions evidence in the record and reasonably concluded that the record evidence did not demonstrate a likelihood that Diallo would be tortured.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
