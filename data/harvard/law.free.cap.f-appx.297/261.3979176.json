The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Calwile that failure to timely file specific objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Calwile failed to file specific objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-26\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned of the consequences of noncompliance. <em>See United States v. Midgette, </em>478 F.3d 616, 621-22 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3032, 168 L.Ed.2d 749 (2007); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985); <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir. 1985). Calwile has waived appellate review by failing to file specific objections after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal..</p>\n<p id=\"b287-29\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
