California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Ferreiro has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u201cThis Court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion, if necessary.\u201d <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Article III, section 2, of the Constitution limits federal court jurisdiction to actual cases and controversies. <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). The case-or-controversy requirement demands that \u201csome concrete and continuing injury other than the now-ended incarceration or parole \u2014 some \u2018collateral consequence\u2019 of the conviction \u2014 must exist if the suit is to be maintained.\u201d Spencer, 523 U.S. at 7, 118 S.Ct. 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Counsel asserts that there are no non-frivolous issues relating to the district court\u2019s revocation of Ferreiro\u2019s supervised release and sentence of 12 months in prison. During the pendency of this appeal, Ferreiro completed his 12 month imprisonment sentence. The judgment imposed no further supervised release term. Accordingly, there is no case or controversy for this court to address, and this appeal is DISMISSED as moot. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
