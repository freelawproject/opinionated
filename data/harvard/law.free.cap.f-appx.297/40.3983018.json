Gordon-Uruakpa, denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In </em>re <em>Dan Ling Jiang, </em>No. A95 709 758 (B.I.A. Mar. 12, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 709 758 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 28, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Mei Chai Ye v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>489 F.3d 517, 523 (2d Cir.2007). Because the agency did not make an explicit credibility determination in Jiang\u2019s case, she is afforded \u201ca rebuttable presumption of credibility.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>see also Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also Gjolaj v. BCIS, </em>468 F.3d 140, 143 (2d Cir.2006) (reviewing the question of nexus for substantial evidence).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">As a preliminary matter, because Jiang failed to sufficiently challenge the agency\u2019s denial of her CAT claim in her brief to this Court, we consider that claim to be waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Accordingly, we review only her challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-14\">As amended by the REAL ID Act, Title 8, Section 1158(b)(l)(B)(i) of the U.S. Code provides that an asylum \u201capplicant must establish that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.\u201d We find no error in the agency\u2019s conclusion that Jiang\u2019s asylum claim lacked a sufficient nexus to a protected ground. Jiang claimed that she feared being arrested, as her father had been after he used her name to open an account into which he deposited allegedly embezzled funds. We agree with the' agency that such fear was of prosecution, not persecution on account of a protected ground. We have observed that the possibility that an individual may suffer prosecution for violating a generally applicable statute does not, by itself, constitute a valid basis for granting asylum. <em>See Qun Yang v. McElroy, </em>277 F.3d 158, 163 n. 5 (2d Cir.2002) (per curiam); <em>see also Saleh v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>962 F.2d 234, 239 (2d Cir.1992). While Jiang argues that the authorities would impute her father\u2019s political opinion to her, and persecute her on that basis, she provides no support for that argument. <em>See Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>at 545 (asylum applicants are required to show the persecutor\u2019s motive through direct or circumstantial evidence). Accordingly, the agency did not err in denying her asylum application on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">As Jiang was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, she was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-10\">. As Jiang's asylum application was filed with the IJ after May 11, 2005, the provisions of the REAL ID Act apply. <em>See Matter of S-B-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 42, 45 (B.I.A.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
