The parties are familiar with the facts of the case, so we repeat them here only to the extent necessary to explain our decision. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-19\">Kramer was entitled to absolute immunity for the discretionary decisions involved in the filing and prosecution of the dependency case. <em>Beltran v. Santa Clara County, </em>514 F.3d 906, 908 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>2008) (en banc) (\u201c[Sjocial workers have absolute immunity when they make discretionary, quasi-prosecutorial decisions to institute court dependency proceedings to take custody away from parents.\u201d (internal quotation omitted)). This discretion includes the decision to name both of McKinney\u2019s children in the dependency petition. Kramer was also entitled to absolute immunity for his actions in executing the court order to remove C.M. from McKinney\u2019s custody. <em>See Coverdell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. and Health Servs., </em>834 F.2d 758, 764-65 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Contrary to the district court\u2019s decision, however, Kramer was not entitled to absolute immunity for his investigation. After the district court\u2019s decision in this case, an en banc panel of this court held in <em>Beltran </em>that just \u201cas prosecutors and others investigating criminal matters have no absolute immunity for their investigatory conduct, a fortiori, social workers conducting investigations have no such immunity.\u201d 514 F.3d at 908-09. We therefore conclude that Kramer is not entitled to absolute immunity for his investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Nonetheless, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment because we agree with the district court that Kramer was protected by qualified immunity. Under <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), we apply a two-part test to determine if qualified immunity shields a defendant from liability. First, \u201cdo the facts alleged show the officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151. And second, if the officer\u2019s conduct did deprive plaintiff of a constitutional right, the court analyzes whether \u201cthe right was clearly established.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Here, we do not reach the second step of the <em>Saucier </em>analysis because we conclude that Kramer\u2019s conduct did not violate McKinney\u2019s constitutional rights. McKinney claims Kramer denied him due process in two main ways: (1) by failing to interview him before initiating dependency proceedings; and (2) by failing to adduce any evidence he had abused C.M. and instead relying only on accusations of abuse against R.M. Neither claim is persuasive. As to the failure to interview him, we see no due process requirement that a child abuse investigation include an interview with the alleged abuser, no matter what other witnesses say about his conduct. And here, the investigation was thorough, as it included interviews with the alleged victim himself (R.M.), the victim\u2019s mother (Mary Cunniffe), and other family members. Notably, McKinney\u2019s first wife Bonnie stated that he abused her and had deprived her son Jason of sleep as a punishment, which was the same sort of abuse alleged by R.M. Investigators also contacted Bonnie\u2019s daughter Lisa, who corroborated McKinney\u2019s tendencies toward physical and emotional abuse. They also contacted William Holtz, Cunniffe\u2019s son, who said McKinney had choked him and Cunniffe, and punched him and his brother Greg in the face. Holtz also stated that he had seen bruises and cuts on R.M.\u2019s wrists, which R.M. attributed to McKinney.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">These interviews refute McKinney\u2019s suggestion that Kramer relied too heavily on statements from R.M. and Cunniffe. Even if McKinney had pled his theory that R.M. and Cunniffe were fabricating the story because he had R.M. arrested for setting a fire, R.M. and C.M. would almost certainly have been removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">Moreover, given the pattern of abuse toward five other children and two wives, it was more than reasonable to infer that C.M. would become a target of abuse, if he had not already. The investigation yielded probable cause to believe C.M. would be a victim, and was constitutionally adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">Because Kramer\u2019s actions did not violate McKinney\u2019s constitutional due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>rights, Kramer was protected by qualified immunity. The decision of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b620-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
