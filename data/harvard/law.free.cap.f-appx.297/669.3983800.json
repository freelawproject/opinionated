We affirm the BIA\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because the decision by the BIA did not adopt or rely on that finding. We may only review a final agency action. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-15\">Substantial evidence supports the denial of Rizvi\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. Under the post-Real ID Act version of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158, the IJ did not err by requiring Rizvi to provide evidence that corroborated his testimony. <em>Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>533 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir.2008). A reasonable factfin-der could conclude, as the IJ and BIA did, that Rizvi should have provided copies of corroborating medical records, since he testified to obtaining the same documents for an earlier asylum application in Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-16\">The BIA did not err in finding that Rizvi could avoid future persecution by relocating within Pakistan. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13 (2008). It was reasonable to conclude that the attacks were solely attributable to a group of Sunnis in Karachi, who were acting without the government\u2019s support. Given that no one has attacked Rizvi\u2019s family since he left Pakistan and that fourteen million Shiites remain in Pakistan, the record does not compel the finding that Rizvi has a \u201cwell-founded\u201d fear of persecution simply because he is a Shiite.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-17\">It was also proper for the district court to deny Rizvi\u2019s petition under the Convention Against Torture. Rizvi admitted that the Pakistan government is not involved in attacks on Shiites. Rizvi did not establish that the government was unable or unwilling to protect against persecution, and the evidence showed the contrary, that some of his attackers were apprehended by the police and prosecuted criminally. Accordingly, Rizvi did not meet his burden of proof. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16; <em>Nv/rn v, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number><em>Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"b696-18\"> xhis disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
