We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Even if their asylum application had been timely filed, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that petitioners did not establish eligibility for asylum because the mistreatment they suffered during a single incident in 1973 in Indonesia did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016-18 (9th Cir.2003). Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that petitioners did not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution because even if the disfavored group analysis set forth in <em>Sael </em>applies to Indonesian Christians, petitioners have not demonstrated an individualized risk of persecution. <em>Cf. Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir.2004). Further, the record does not compel the conclusion that petitioners have demonstrated a pattern and practice of persecution against Indonesian Christians. <em>See Lolong v.Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1180-81 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Because petitioners did not establish eligibility for asylum, it necessarily follows that they did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s determination that petitioners are not entitled to CAT relief because they have not demonstrated that it is more likely than not that they will be tortured if they return to Indonesia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b670-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
