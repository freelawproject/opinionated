Robertson pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base, a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. He was sentenced to 51 months of imprisonment, which was within the applicable guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">The abuse-of-discretion standard of review applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">On appeal, Robertson argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court failed to take into account the Government\u2019s role in selecting cocaine base as the drug to be smuggled, which he argues constituted sentencing entrapment. We have not yet determined whether sentencing entrapment, or the related concept of sentencing factor manipulation, is a cognizable defense to a sentence. However, even if we were to do so, Robertson has not shown that he was persuaded to commit a criminal offense greater than he was predisposed to commit, or that the Government\u2019s conduct was outrageous. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>44 F.3d 1271, 1280 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-18\">Robertson does not contend that his sentence is otherwise procedurally or substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97. He likewise has not rebutted the presumption that his sentence, which falls within a properly calculated sentencing guidelines range, is reasonable. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b343-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
