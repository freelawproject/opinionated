Cash\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that it was error for the district court to enhance his sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000) when no 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000) information was filed by the Government. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Cash explicitly agreed in his plea agreement that the Government complied with \u00a7 851\u2019s notice requirements and that he would not challenge the qualifying nature of his prior convictions. He also attested at his plea hearing that he read his plea agreement, was familiar with and understood this provision, and entered the plea agreement knowingly and voluntarily. Despite the seemingly mandatory phrasing of \u00a7 851, we have recently recognized that its formal requirements can be waived. <em>United States v. Beasley, </em>495 F.3d 142, 148 (4th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1471, 170 L.Ed.2d 296 (2008). In light of the particular facts revealed by the record in this appeal, we conclude that Cash waived his right to challenge the Government\u2019s technical noncompliance with \u00a7 851. <em>See United States v. Mooring, </em>287 F.3d 725, 728 (8th Cir.2002) (finding \u00a7 851\u2019s notice requirements waived by the defendant where: (i) the defendant stipulated in his plea agreement that he received proper \u00a7 851 notice, even though he had not; (ii) admitted the prior conviction to the district court; and (iii) indicated that he was aware of the enhanced sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
