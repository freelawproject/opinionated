Mr. Arceneaux pled guilty to possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and was sentenced to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release. He appealed his sentence and this court affirmed. <em>United States v. Arceneaux, </em>No. 99-6049, 2000 WL 136150 (10th Cir. Jan.26, 2000) (unpublished). He later sought relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; the district court denied the motion and we denied a certificate of appealability. <em>United States v. Arceneaux, </em>26 Fed.Appx. 894 (10th Cir.2002). Thereafter, on motion by the government pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35, the district court (in September 2000) reduced Mr. Arceneaux\u2019s sentence to 220 months. Mr. Arceneaux\u2019s projected release date is July 13, 2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">On April 17, 2008, Mr. Arceneaux filed a motion for resentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), pursuant to Amendment 706 of the Sentencing Guidelines. Thereafter, he filed a counseled motion for reduction of sentence joined at least in part by the government. Mr. Arceneaux and the government agreed that Amendment 706 was applicable, that the revised Guideline calculation would result in a Guideline range of 235 to 293 months, and that a proportional reduction in his sentence would result in a sentence of 176 months. 1 R. Doc. 258 at 2. Mr. Arceneaux sought a sentence of 163 months (235-72 months), claiming that the Guidelines were merely advisory, which the government opposed as contrary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, Application Note 3 (Mar. 3, 2008 Supp.). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">On May 1, 2008, the district court denied the motion entirely after considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 and in light of Mr. Arceneaux\u2019s \u201clack of institutional adjustment.\u201d 1 R. Doc. 259. Mr. Arceneaux contends that the district court erred in denying his motion, leaving in place an unreasonable sentence in light of the statutory factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that the government never opposed his motion based on any public safety factors, and that the disagreement between the parties was whether Mr. Arceneaux\u2019s alternative to computing the proportional reduction was proper. Aplt. Br. at 11; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) &amp; Application Note 3 (Mar. 3, 2008 Supp.). He further notes that his institutional record was relatively unexceptional, did not result in additional criminal charges, and none of the incidents reported were related to controlled substances, alcohol, or dangerous weapons. Aplt. Br. at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for resentencing for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Sharkey, </em>543 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>F.3d 1236 (10th Cir.2008). Section 3582(c)(2) permits the district court to reduce a term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to U.S.C. 994(o) ... after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a).\u201d Factors to be considered under \u00a7 3553(a) include, but are not limited to, the character of the offense and the defendant\u2019s history; the need for the sentence to protect the public, afford deterrence, and reflect the seriousness of the offense; and the applicable sentencing range. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, the district court plainly may consider post-sentencing conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, Application Note l(B)(iii) (Mar. 3, 2008 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Given our standard of review, we affirm the district court. First, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 (Mar. 3, 2008 Supp.) grant the district court discretion on whether to reduce a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has been subsequently modified. The subsequent modification under Amendment 706 did not make mandatory a sentencing reduction. Second, in making its determination, the district court must consider the factors set forth under \u00a7 3553(a). After a review of the record, including the Presentence Investigation Report and the Preliminary Report for Consideration of Sentence Reduction Based on Crack Cocaine Amendment, both prepared by the Probation Office, we note that Mr. Arcen-eaux has a record of disciplinary infractions spanning his imprisonment and that the district court\u2019s denial of his motion does not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b846-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
