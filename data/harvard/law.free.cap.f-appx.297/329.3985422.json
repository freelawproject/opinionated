The district court imposed an eight-level enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines because it determined that Garcia\u2019s second state conviction for possession of a controlled substance qualified as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d Garcia contends that, in light of <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), his second 'possession offense does not qualify as an aggravated felony because he did not receive the type of procedural safeguards required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 before a second simple possession offense is punishable as a felony under the recidivist provisions of the Controlled Substances Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-25\">While Garcia\u2019s appeal was pending, we decided <em>United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333 (5th Cir.2008). We rejected the argument made here by Garcia and affirmed the district court\u2019s determination that a second state possession offense qualifies as an aggravated felony without a showing that the State provided the type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>of procedural safeguards required under \u00a7 851. <em>Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d at 335-36 &amp; n. 11. As here, the appellant in <em>Cepeda-Rios </em>\u201chad the opportunity to object to the finality of his first state possession conviction at his federal sentencing hearing, but he did not do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
