The District Court granted West Penn\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Nicholson appeals the District Court\u2019s order. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-25\">We write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the factual context and legal history of this case. Therefore, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-26\">Terri Nicholson was employed as a registered nurse at Allegheny Specialty Practice Network, which is affiliated with West Penn. Following a January 2005 incident in which she was a victim of a violent crime, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Nicholson began suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. As a result, she sought medication and other treatment, but also resorted to alcohol. Nicholson informed Dr. Lara Kunschner, a doctor for whom she worked, of the January incident and appeared at Dr. Kunschner\u2019s house intoxicated on several occasions. Dr. Kunschner told the Human Resources department of Nicholson\u2019s alcohol problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Starting in April 2005, Nicholson began requesting medical leave time. Human Resources granted each of her requests. In June 2005, following one leave, Nicholson met with several personnel members and signed a Last Chance Agreement, which stated that should she fail to comport with its terms \u2014 one of which was to not consume any alcohol \u2014 her employment could be terminated. In February 2006, Nicholson did consume alcohol and telephoned a coworker while under the influence. Nicholson was admitted to Sewick-ley Valley Hospital and took additional medical leave. In March 2006, Nicholson met with Joanne Menzer of Human Resources who informed her that since she violated the Last Chance Agreement by consuming alcohol, her employment was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Nicholson brought an employment discrimination action in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against West Penn alleging violations of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), asserting that West Penn terminated her employment due to her disability and her taking medical leave. West Penn moved for summary judgment and Nicholson moved for partial summary judgment. In her response to West Perm\u2019s motion, Nicholson stipulated to dismissing her FMLA claim. On October 23, 2007, the District Court granted West Penn\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that Nicholson failed to set forth a prima facie case of discrimination pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act. Nicholson timely appealed the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">The District Court had jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review where a district court grants a motion for summary judgment. <em>Boyle v. County of Allegheny, </em>139 F.3d 386, 393 (3d Cir.1998). Summary judgment should be granted \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and the disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We will construe \u201call of the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Peters v. Del. River </em>Port <em>Auth., </em>16 F.3d 1346, 1349 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">Nicholson argues on appeal that the District Court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing Nicholson\u2019s Rehabilitation Act claim. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">\u201cNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance .... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). It is not disputed that Allegheny Specialty Practice Network received federal funding while Nicholson was employed, thereby implicating section 504 protection for its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>In order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a plaintiff employee \u201cmust initially show \u2018(1) that he or she has a disability; (2) that he or she is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations by the employer; and (3) that he or she was nonetheless terminated or otherwise prevented from performing the job.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wishkin v. Potter, </em>476 F.3d 180, 184-85 (3d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Shiring v. Runyon, </em>90 F.3d 827, 831 (3d Cir.1996)). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant employer to rebut the presumption of discrimination by \u201carticulat[ing] some legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason for the employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185. Where the defendant sufficiently does so, the plaintiff must show that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason is \u201cpretextual.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The District Court determined that Nicholson failed to establish that she suffered from a \u201cdisability.\u201d As used in the Rehabilitation Act, an \u201cindividual with a disability\u201d is someone who \u201c(i) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person\u2019s major life activities; (ii) has a record of such an impairment; or (iii) is regarded as having such an impairment.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20)(B). Nicholson argues that the District Court erred in concluding there were no genuine issues of material fact about whether her PTSD, depression, and alcohol abuse substantially impaired her ability to perform major life activities. She also asserts that she established a record of a disability. Further, Nicholson claims that she was \u201cregarded as\u201d having a disability. Upon reviewing the record, we conclude that Nicholson\u2019s arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">First, the District Court correctly determined Nicholson did not sufficiently establish she was substantially limited in performing one or more major life activities. A condition is a substantial limitation on a major life activity if it renders the person incapable of performing, or \u201c[significantly restrict[s] as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform,\u201d a major life activity \u201cthat the average person in the general population can perform.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(l)(i)-(ii). Major life activities are those functions \u201cthat are of central importance to daily life,\u201d <em>Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 197, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002), encompassing fundamental acts \u201csuch as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(i). \u201cWhere a plaintiff seeks to establish that his or her condition substantially limits his or her ability to work, that plaintiff \u201cmust, at a minimum, allege that he or she is \u2018unable to work in a broad class of jobs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tice v. Ctr. Area Transp. Auth., </em>247 F.3d 506, 512 (3d Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 491, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Here, Nicholson did not show that her PTSD, depression, or alcohol abuse substantially limited any major life activity. At her deposition, Nicholson testified that her depression and PTSD invoked \u201cflashbacks\u201d and \u201cintrusive thoughts,\u201d but the record does not show Nicholson satisfied the \u201cdemanding standard for qualifying as disabled.\u201d <em>Toyota Motor Mfg., </em>534 U.S. at 197, 122 S.Ct. 681. On appeal, Nicholson argues specifically that her conditions prevented her from working, pointing to her incidents of FMLA medical leave. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>District Court aptly determined, though, that the fact that an employee receives FMLA medical leave does not equate to a finding that he or she is disabled for Rehabilitation Act purposes. As stated in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.702(b), a \u201cserious health condition\u201d under the FMLA is a \u201cdifferent concept[]\u201d than the term \u201cdisability\u201d and thus both \u201cmust be analyzed separately.\u201d Also, the record fails to indicate that Nicholson\u2019s conditions precluded her from working in a wide range of jobs; in fact, at the time of her deposition, she was employed full-time as a registered nurse at Jefferson Regional Medical Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Second, the District Court was correct when it found no genuine issue of material fact as to any record of Nicholson\u2019s impairment. To prove a record of a disability, a plaintiff \u201cstill must demonstrate that the recorded impairment is a \u2018disability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tice, </em>247 F.3d at 513. Despite Nicholson\u2019s incidents of FMLA medical leave, such occurrences are insufficient to establish she had a \u201cdisability\u201d under the Rehabilitation Act because the FMLA and Rehabilitation Act call for differing analyses. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.702(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Third, Nicholson did not show that her employer regarded her as disabled. Nicholson argues to this Court that she was terminated after consuming alcohol, which evinces her employer\u2019s view that she was substantially impaired in performing her job. In order to be regarded as having a disability, the employee must establish that the employer considered \u201cthe employee to be suffering from an impairment within the meaning of the statutes, not just that the employer believed the employee to be somehow disabled.\u201d <em>Rinehimer v. Cemcolift, Inc., </em>292 F.3d 375, 381 (3d Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). As discussed by the District Court, even if Nicholson\u2019s employer perceived her to be an alcoholic, her claim cannot succeed. The Rehabilitation Act excludes from coverage \u201cany individual who is an alcoholic whose current use of alcohol prevents such individual from performing the duties of the job in question or whose employment, by reason of such current alcohol abuse, would constitute a direct threat to property or the safety of others.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20)(C)(v). Nicholson\u2019s argument that the District Court erroneously relied on this provision must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">In sum, Nicholson failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she was disabled under the Rehabilitation Act. Aside from disputing the District Court\u2019s \u201cdisability\u201d determination, Nicholson also argues on appeal that the District Court erroneously dismissed her failure to accommodate claim. She asserts that the Last Chance Agreement does not relieve her employer\u2019s \u201congoing duty\u201d to reasonably accommodate her, and also alleges that the Last Chance Agreement is a per se violation of the duty to accommodate. We need not reach these arguments because the District Court correctly found there were no genuine issues of material fact as to the threshold determination of whether Nicholson had a legally recognizable disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-6\">. In analyzing whether there has been a section 504 violation, the standards used for claims brought pursuant to Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 are to be applied. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
