UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>182 Fed. Appx. 607, 609-10 (8th Cir.2006) (unpublished per curiam), Joeffre Kolosky challenges the district court\u2019s <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> adverse grant of summary judgment in favor of UNUM Life Insurance Co. of America (UNUM), on his claim related to long-term disability (LTD) benefits. Upon careful review, we conclude that the district court did not err in its summary judgment decision, <em>see Kozisek v. County of Seward, Neb., </em>539 F.3d 930, 934 (8th Cir.2008) (de <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>novo standard of review), especially in light of the lack of evidence that UNUM\u2019s conflict of interest affected its benefits decision. <em>See Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 2348-52, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008) (where plan administrator and insurer are same, conflict exists, but abuse-of-discretion judicial review standard still applies; under such circumstances, conflict is \u201cbut one factor among many that a reviewing judge must take into account\u201d in deciding whether abuse of discretion occurred; noting that conflict of interest becomes more important \u201cwhere circumstances suggest a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision\u201d); <em>Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, </em>538 U.S. 822, 829-34, 123 S.Ct. 1965, 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003) (special deference need not be afforded to treating physicians\u2019 opinions in ERISA cases); <em>McGee v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>360 F.3d 921, 924-25 (8th Cir.2004) (plan administrator\u2019s denial of LTD benefits was not abuse of discretion where claimant\u2019s medical records lacked reliable objective evidence to support finding of LTD).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">We further conclude that Kolosky is not entitled to relief on issues outside the scope of the limited remand. <em>Cf. United States v. Walterman, </em>408 F.3d 1084, 1085 (8th Cir.2005) (\u201c[wjhere a remand is limited to the resolution of specific issues, those issues outside the scope of the remand are generally not available for consideration\u201d); <em>Kessler v. Nat\u2019l Enters., Inc., </em>203 F.3d 1058, 1059-60 (8th Cir.2000) (on appeal after remand, dismissing cross-appeal raising issue not preserved by cross-appeal at time of first appeal; general rule is that, where argument could have been raised on initial appeal, it is inappropriate to consider that argument on second appeal after remand).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">The judgment is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-25\">. The Honorable Michael J. Davis, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
