He argues the Double Jeopardy Clause forbids the court from convicting and sentencing him for both counts because possession of child pornography is a lesser-included crime of receipt of child pornography. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and review for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 730-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (defining limitations on a reviewing court\u2019s authority to correct plain error).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>In light of <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>519 F.3d 940 (9th Cir.2008), and <em>United States v. Giberson, </em>527 F.3d 882 (9th Cir.2008), the district court plainly erred when it convicted and sentenced Drost, based on the same conduct, for both receipt of child pornography and possession of child pornography. (We note that the district court did not have the benefit of these cases, as the proceeding in the district court occurred months before the publication of <em>Davenport </em>and <em>Giberson). </em>Possession of child pornography is a lesser-included offense of receipt of child pornography. <em>See Davenport, </em>519 F.3d at 947. The Double Jeopardy Clause does not permit convictions for both the greater and necessarily-included lesser offenses when the convictions arise from the same conduct. <em>See id. </em>at 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">We reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to vacate Drost\u2019s conviction for possession of child pornography. Counsel agreed at oral argument that there is no need for the district court to resentence Drost. Drost\u2019s conviction and sentence for receipt of child pornography should remain intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b704-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
