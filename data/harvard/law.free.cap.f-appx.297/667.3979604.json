We deny the petition. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we recite them only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-23\">Guerra filed his motion to reopen over three years after the Immigration Judge entered Guerra\u2019s removal order. Therefore, the Board of Immigration Appeals did not abuse its discretion by holding Guerra\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (\u201c[T]he motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-24\">Further, equitable tolling is inapplicable because Guerra provides no reason for the delay and the record contains no evidence that Guerra acted with reasonable diligence nor that the government delayed his ability to act. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 1090, 1095-96 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-25\">Although we need not consider any further ground for determination of Guerra\u2019s petition, we also affirm the Board of Immigration Appeals because Guerra had been removed from the United States before he filed his motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1); <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 1117, 1121 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-26\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b693-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
