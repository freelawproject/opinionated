We will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-26\">Zimmer filed a complaint on October 9, 2007 against Secretary Michael Chertoff, alleging that he was discriminated against on the basis of race, age and reprisal when he was terminated from the position of Transportation Security Screener on January 12, 2005. The complaint asked for damages, but did not give any more information regarding Zimmer\u2019s claims. The District Court entered an order dismissing Zimmer\u2019s complaint without prejudice to his filing an amended complaint within 20 days. The Court noted that the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>lacked \u201csufficient allegations to determine whether he has stated a claim on which relief may be granted against Secretary Chertoff or the Department of Homeland Security,\u201d and noted that there were \u201cno allegations regarding the circumstances of his termination to support even an inference of discrimination.\u201d The Court ordered that any amended complaint \u201cshall specify the facts on which his claim of unlawful employment discrimination is based,\u201d and warned that failure to file such a complaint would result in dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Zimmer filed an amended complaint within the time period specified, but the District Court found that the amended complaint did not sufficiently include the factual basis of his claims. The amended complaint stated that he had been \u201cabruptly terminated from his position of Security Screener without prior warning,\u201d and that he had been retaliated against for claiming discrimination in writing and verbally to the Agency. The amended complaint stated that Zimmer had a black supervisor named Nathaniel Johnson, who had acknowledged that Zimmer felt he was being discriminated against because he was white, and stated that \u201cthe three supervisors bringing disciplinary actions against plaintiff are Black.\u201d He also refers to some \u201cletters from the Black supervisors\u201d that he alleges contained \u201cdefamation, retaliation and lies\u201d against him. Zimmer then attached over 450 pages of documents from administrative proceedings, and urged the District Court Judge to review them.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">We exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint <em>sua sponte </em>for failure to state a claim. <em>Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). In considering whether a district court properly dismissed a complaint, we are required to \u201caccept all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Phillips v. County of Allegheny, </em>515 F.3d 224, 233 (3d Cir.2008), quoting <em>Pinker v. Roche Holdings Ltd., </em>292 F.3d 361, 374 n. 7 (3d Cir.2002). We are guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1969 n. 8, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The Court noted that \u201c \u2018stating ... a claim requires a complaint with enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest\u2019 the required element.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>515 F.3d at 234, (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1965). Stated differently, the \u201c[fjactual allegations [of the complaint] must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Id. See also Wilkerson v. New Media Technology Charter School, Inc., </em>522 F.3d 315, 321 (3d Cir.2008) (allegations of the complaint must plausibly suggest that complainant is entitled to relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Although Zimmer\u2019s complaint states that he is white, that one or more of his supervisors was black, and that he was \u201cabruptly terminated,\u201d the complaint does not contain factual matter that would plausibly suggest that he was terminated on the basis of his race<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or as retaliation for protected activity. We agree with the District Court that Zimmer\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and we do not fault the District Court for failing to wade through the over 450 pages of attachments to attempt to discern Zimmer\u2019s claims. We will therefore affirm the judgment of the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\">. Although Zimmer's initial complaint also mentioned discrimination on the basis of age, the amended complaint does not contain any allegation relating to age.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AEP\">. Zimmer\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
