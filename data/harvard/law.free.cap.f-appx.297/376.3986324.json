Johnson argues that with respect to the September 23, 2006, robbery the district court clearly erred when it enhanced her offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) on the basis that she threatened the teller\u2019s life. Johnson contends that the statements in the Presentence Report (PSR) in support of the \u00a7 2B3.1 enhancement lacked sufficient indicia of reliability. She argues that \u201c[i]n contrast, the research on \u2018false memory\u2019 raises the issue of whether the judge\u2019s conclusion is \u2018materially untrue.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Because Johnson did not present to the district court her argument about false memory, it is subject to plain error review. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>324 F.3d 375, 381 (5th Cir.2003). With respect to the remainder of her argument, this court reviews the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines de novo and its fact finding for clear error. <em>United States v. Conner, </em>537 F.3d 480, 489 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cUnless the factual finding is implausible in light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Griffith, </em>522 F.3d 607, 611-12 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 211, 172 L.Ed.2d 156 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-17\">The facts the district court relies on must have some indicia of reliability. <em>United States v. Shacklett, </em>921 F.2d 580, 584-85 (5th Cir.1991). A PSR \u201cgenerally bears sufficient indicia of reliability to be considered as evidence by the sentencing judge in making factual determinations required by the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>502 F.3d 353, 357 (5th Cir.2007). (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court may also rely on hearsay for sentencing purposes, provided that it is reliable. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>178 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.1999). The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the information that the district court relied on is materially untrue. <em>Trujillo, </em>502 F.3d at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-18\">The Government supplied evidence that Johnson made a death threat when it presented the testimony of Officer Tooke that the victim teller told two detectives immediately following the robbery that Johnson indicated that she was armed. <em>See Trujillo, </em>502 F.3d at 357. Johnson\u2019s attempts to render this testimony unreliable by presenting her newly-raised theory of \u201cfalse memory\u201d fails under a plain error analysis. On plain error review, this court may correct the sentencing determination on Johnson\u2019s \u201cfalse memory\u201d theory only if (1) there is an error, (2) that is plain, meaning an error that is clear under current law, and (3) it affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008). The decision to correct the forfeit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ed error is within the sound discretion of the court of appeals, and this court should not correct the error unless it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Johnson\u2019s mere assertion that it is \u201cmore likely that the victim teller\u2019s perception was in fact a mixing of fragments of memory events, both real and imagined\u201d than truth falls short of amounting to evidence that the victim-teller in this case actually suffered from false memory. Accordingly, she fails to show that the district court\u2019s purported failure to intuit that the victim teller suffered from \u201cfalse memory\u201d was error, clear or otherwise. Moreover, the district court was entitled to credit Officer Tooke\u2019s testimony regarding Johnson\u2019s threat that she was armed and to discredit Johnson\u2019s testimony that she never made the threat. <em>See United States v. Perez, </em>217 F.3d 323, 331-32 (5th Cir. 2000). Given Officer Tooke\u2019s testimony that the victim-teller told the investigation officers that Johnson said she was armed, the district court\u2019s finding that she made the threat is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Griffith, </em>522 F.3d at 611-12. Thus, Johnson fails to show that the district court erred when it enhanced her offense level under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Johnson also argues with respect to her September 23, 2006, and October 10, 2006, robbery convictions that she received ineffective assistance of counsel because her trial lawyer failed to present a theory of \u201cfalse, memory.\u201d Because this court cannot fairly evaluate this claim from the record, it declines to consider it without prejudice to Johnson\u2019s right to raise it in a subsequent proceeding. <em>See United States v. Gulley, </em>526 F.3d 809, 821 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 159, 172 L.Ed.2d 116 (2008); <em>United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Johnson argues that the district court erred when it refused to grant the request for a \u00a7 5K.1 downward departure based on her substantial assistance that she made in both cases. Johnson contends that, because the Guidelines are merely advisory, the district court was not bound by \u00a7 5Kl.l\u2019s requirement that a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion be filed by the Government. Although the Guidelines are advisory only, the district court was required to compute a guidelines sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The Guidelines precluded the district court from granting Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion based on substantial assistance absent a Government motion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5K1.1. Thus the district court was not mistaken when it refused to grant Johnson\u2019s motion, and Johnson is not entitled to this court\u2019s review of the denial of that motion. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">Johnson also argues that, with respect to the December 1, 2006, robbery, the district court should have imposed a non-Guidelines sentence based on her substantial assistance to the Government in arresting Terrence Smith. Johnson has abandoned this argument with respect to her September 23 and October 10, 2006, robberies by failing to brief it adequately in that case. <em>See United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 936 n. 2 (5th Cir. 2003). <em>Post-Booker </em>sentences are reviewed for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). Johnson does not argue, and the record does not reflect, that the district court committed any procedural error in sentencing her. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97. Moreover, the district court\u2019s guidelines sentence was presumptively reasonable. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-63, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number><em>v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The district court extensively considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Johnson\u2019s arguments that Terrence Smith coerced her into committing the robberies before concluding that her guidelines sentence of 60 months was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
