The district court dismissed Howard\u2019s complaint, on <em>res judicata </em>grounds, because it found that Howard had previously filed a similar action that was dismissed for failure to adequately plead exhaustion. On appeal, Howard argues that <em>res judicata </em>is inapplicable in the instant case because: (1) the final order dismissing his previous case for lack of exhaustion was based on a curable procedural defect; and (2) lack of exhaustion is an affirmative defense, and, as plaintiff, he did not have the burden of pleading it. After thorough review, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">The district court screened and dismissed Howard\u2019s complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, which requires the court to screen complaints in all civil actions that are filed by prisoners against government entities. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. \u201cA district court\u2019s decision to dismiss for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>taking the allegations in the complaint as true.\u201d <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cPro se pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">\u201cThe doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, will bar a subsequent action if: (1) the prior decision was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) there was a final judgment on the merits; (3) the parties were identical in both suits; and (4) the prior and present causes of action are the same.\u201d <em>Davila v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>326 F.3d 1183, 1187 (11th Cir.2003) (quotations omitted). In addition, <em>res judicata </em>is inapplicable when \u201cbetween the first and second suits, there has been an intervening change in the law or modification of significant facts creating new legal conditions.\u201d <em>Jaffree v. Wallace, </em>837 F.2d 1461, 1469 (11th Cir.1988) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">The district court dismissed Howard\u2019s instant case on <em>res judicata </em>grounds; however, Howard\u2019s previous action was dismissed because he failed to plead exhaustion. This Court has held that \u201cexhaustion of administrative remedies is a matter in abatement and not generally an adjudication on the merits.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Rich, </em>530 F.3d 1368, 1374 (11th Cir.2008). Since a finding of exhaustion is not an adjudication on the merits, the dismissal of Howard\u2019s 2005 action fails to satisfy the \u201cfinal judgment on the merits\u201d element of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-14\"><em>Res judicata </em>is also inapplicable because there has been an intervening substantial change in the law applicable to Howard\u2019s previous case. In 2007, the Supreme Court held \u201cthat failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A], and that inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.\u201d <em>Jones v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number><em>Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 127 S.Ct. 910, 921, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). As a result, the 2005 decision dismissing Howard\u2019s complaint for failure to plead exhaustion is at odds with current Supreme Court case law, and, is therefore not entitled to <em>res judicata </em>deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Accordingly, we vacate and remand this case to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
