Landry asserts that his injuries were the result of inadequate supervision and Warden Lynn Cooper\u2019s negligence. \u2019 Landry\u2019s arguments are not supported by citation to the record or relevant legal authority. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Moreover, he has wholly failed to show that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint was error as his claims sound in negligence and seek to hold Warden Cooper liable for his employees\u2019 actions. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991); <em>Williams v. Luna, </em>909 F.2d 121, 123 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-21\">The appeal is without arguable merit and, thus, frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Landry\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal both count as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Landry is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-22\">APPEAL DISMISSED. SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
