R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b679-17\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-18\">Yudi Muttaqin Efendi, a native and citizen of Indonesia, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order summarily affirming an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we grant the petition and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-19\">In assessing Efendi\u2019s claim of past persecution, the IJ disregarded Efendi\u2019s documentary evidence, but erred by neglecting to consider Efendi\u2019s testimony regarding the burning of his parents\u2019 store in May of 1998, after finding he was credible. <em>See Katana v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1107, 1114 (9th Cir.2000) (In the absence of an adverse credibility finding, we accept a petitioner\u2019s factual contentions as true).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-20\">In addition, the BIA erred when it summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s opinion without considering Efendi\u2019s challenge that the IJ failed to consider his claim that he faces persecution in Indonesia on account of his imputed political opinion as well as his Confucian-Christian religion. <em>See Sagaydak v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 1035, 1040 (9th Cir.2005) (the BIA is not free to ignore arguments raised by a petitioner).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-21\">Accordingly, we grant the petition and remand to the agency for further proceedings, including a determination of the applicability to this case of <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922 (9th Cir.2004), an opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>issued after the BIA entered its order. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b679-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
