(\u201cMitek\u201d) appeals from a final judgment of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, <em>Depuy Mitek, Inc. v. Arthrex, Inc., </em>No. 04-CV-12457, 2007 WL 4598512 (D.Mass. Aug. 16, 2007), entered after a jury found that Arthrex, Inc. and Pearsalls Limited (collectively, \u201cArthrex\u201d) did not infringe Mitek\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 5,314,446 (\u201cthe '446 patent\u201d). On appeal, Mitek challenges the district court\u2019s denials of its motion for judgment as a matter of law and its motion for new trial. Because the evidence introduced at trial supports the jury\u2019s verdict, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"aye-dedup-0\">The '446 patent is directed to \u201csterilized heterogeneous braids.\u201d In general terms, the invention of the '446 patent relates to a braided suture used in orthopedic surgery that is made from at least two sets of dissimilar yarns. According to the specification of the '446 patent, this heterogeneous braiding method using different types of yarns improves certain desirable properties of the suture, including handleability and pliability. <em>See </em>'446 patent, col. 2, 11. 62-66. Claim 1 is representative of the invention:</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">1. A surgical suture consisting essentially of a heterogeneous braid composed of a first and second set of continuous and discrete yarns in a sterilized, braided construction wherein at least one yarn from the first set is in direct intertwining contact with a yarn from the second set; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">a) each yarn from the first set is composed of a plurality of filaments of a first fiber-forming material selected from the group consisting of PTFE, FEP, PFA, PVDF, PETFE, PP and PE; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">b) each yarn from the second set is composed of a plurality of filaments of a second fiber-forming material selected from the group consisting of PET, nylon and aramid; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">c) optionally a core.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-14\">In September 2005, Mitek filed suit against Arthrex. It argued that Arthrex\u2019s FiberWire product (\u201cFiberWire\u201d) infringed the '446 patent. During the course of the proceedings, the district court construed the claim terms in dispute. Because the claims use the transitional phrase, \u201cconsisting essentially of,\u201d the district court also examined the basic and novel characteristics of the invention. The case eventually went to trial on whether Arthrex\u2019s manufacture and sale of Fiber-Wire infringed claims 1, 2, 8, 9, and/or 12 of the '446 patent. The parties stipulated that infringement of the asserted claims would rise or fall with infringement of claim 1, and that Arthrex\u2019s FiberWire contained every recited limitation of that claim. Thus, the only question for the jury to resolve was whether a silicone coating added to FiberWire-an element in addition to those listed in the claim \u2014 materially affected the basic and novel properties of the invention and thus took the accused structure out of the scope of coverage of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-15\">After a six-day trial on this issue, the jury returned a verdict of non-infringement in favor of Arthrex. Following trial, Mitek renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law and also moved for new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>trial. The district court denied Mitek\u2019s motions without opinion. Mitek appealed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AN10\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"AhiV\">The grant or denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law or a motion for new trial is reviewed under the law of the regional circuit. <em>Riverwood Int\u2019l Corp. v. R.A. Jones &amp; Co., </em>324 F.3d 1346, 1352 (Fed.Cir.2003). The First Circuit reviews rulings on motions for judgment as a matter of law de novo. <em>Porto v. Town of Tewksbury, </em>488 F.3d 67, 72 (1st Cir.2007). A district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law must be affirmed \u201cunless the evidence was \u2018so strongly and overwhelmingly\u2019 inconsistent with the verdicts that no reasonable jury could have returned them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The First Circuit reviews rulings on motions for new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>Goulet v. New Penn Motor Express, Inc., </em>512 F.3d 34, 44 (1st Cir.2008). \u201cA district court should grant a motion for a new trial only if \u2018the outcome is against the clear weight of the evidence such that upholding the verdict will result in a miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"AqJ\">1. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">As a threshold issue, Arthrex argues that we lack subject matter jurisdiction over this appeal. At the close of Arthrex\u2019s case at trial, counsel for Mitek moved for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a), stating: \u201cYour Honor, they have a declaratory judgment counterclaim for noninfringement, and we\u2019re moving as a matter of law on that counterclaim.\u201d J.A. at 2133-34. The district court denied Mi-tek\u2019s motion without permitting its counsel to elaborate on the grounds for the motion. Arthrex now contends that Mitek\u2019s motion was deficient because it failed to conform to Rule 50 by \u201cspecifying] the judgment sought and the law and facts that entitle the movant to the judgment.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 50(a)(2). Arthrex argues that because the motion for judgment as a matter of law was deficient under Rule 50(a), Mi-tek\u2019s attempt to renew that motion under Rule 50(b) was also deficient. Thus, according to Arthrex, Mitek\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely because the deadline for filing that notice was not tolled by the improper renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">We disagree. Only one issue was tried to the jury: whether the coating on Arthrex\u2019s FiberWire materially affected the basic and novel characteristics of the invention of the '446 patent, warranting a judgment of non-infringement. Thus, when Mitek \u201cmov[ed] as a matter of law on that counterclaim,\u201d it was adequate to put Arthrex and the district court on notice of the grounds for the motion. <em>See Cambridge Plating Co. v. Napco, Inc., </em>85 F.3d 752, 760 (1st Cir.1996). Moreover, the district court denied Mitek\u2019s motion without permitting counsel for Mitek to elaborate, J.A. at 2134, which indicates either that it was aware of the grounds for the motion or that it perceived no need to hear them. Under these circumstances, Mitek\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law was sufficient under Rule 50(a)(2). <em>See Wilson Sporting Goods Co. v. Geoffrey &amp; Assocs., </em>904 F.2d 677, 683 (Fed.Cir.1990). Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>quently, its renewed motion also was proper and tolled Mitek\u2019s deadline to file a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">2. Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">Because claim 1 uses the transitional phrase, \u201cconsisting essentially of,\u201d it covers products or devices which include the listed elements, as well as unlisted elements, so long as the unlisted elements \u201cdo not \u2018materially affect the basic and novel properties of the invention.\u2019 \u201d <em>AK Steel Corp. v. Sollac, </em>344 F.3d 1234, 1239 (Fed.Cir.2003) (citation omitted). The district court defined the basic and novel characteristics of the invention of the '446 patent as:</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">(1) a surgical suture, (2) composed of two dissimilar yarns from the lists in Claim One, (3) where at least one yarn from the first set is in direct intertwining contact with the yarn from the second set, (4) so as to improve pliability and handleability without significantly sacrificing the physical properties of the constituent elements of the suture.</p>\n<p id=\"ApuZ\"><em>Depuy Mitek, Inc. v. Arthrex, Inc., </em>No. 04-CV-12457, slip op. at 18-19 (D.Mass. Jan. 31, 2007). Mitek does not challenge the district court\u2019s identification of the basic and novel characteristics of the invention. It does, however, argue that there is insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that FiberWire\u2019s coating materially affects these basic and novel properties. Mitek provides a host of arguments to support this contention. As discussed below, we find them unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">Mitek\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that \u201c[t]he basic and novel characteristics relate to the contribution of the novel braid structure to handleability and pliability, not to handleability and pliability per se.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 13; <em>see also </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 31. In other words, because the coating applied is only a surface coating, that coating \u201cdoes further improve the handleability performance of the braid,\u201d but it \u201cdoes not ... affect the inventive heterogeneous multifilament internal braid structure which imparts han-dleability and pliability to the suture to begin with.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 24 (emphases omitted). We reject this argument, because Arthrex presented evidence at trial that that the silicone coating did permeate the surface of the suture, reaching the braid, and that this materially improved the handleability and pliability of the suture by lubricating the interlocking yarns. J.A. at 2071-72; <em>cf. id. </em>at 1594. Arthrex also presented evidence at trial that, even if it the coating did not penetrate the surface, it still materially affected the physical properties of the suture, both positively and negatively. For example, Arthrex presented evidence that the han-dleability and pliability of the suture of the '446 patent were dramatically improved by the addition of a coating. <em>Id. </em>at 1943-47, 2572-80; <em>see also id. </em>at 1777-78 (evidence that a coating is a virtual necessity for use in orthopedic surgery due to the high surface friction of uncoated, braided sutures.). Arthrex also presented evidence that the coating materially improved \u201cknot rundown\u201d \u2014 i.e., the ease with which a knot is slid down the suture. <em>Id. </em>at 2408-10. Finally, Arthrex presented evidence that the coating had a significant negative effect on knot security \u2014 i.e., the ability of the suture to hold a knot. <em>Id. </em>at 1968-69, 2579. Although Mitek presented evidence to the contrary, the jury could have reasonably relied upon the evidence presented by Ar-threx in concluding that the addition of the coating to the suture materially affected its pliability and handleability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">Finally, Mitek argues that because the specification of the '446 patent contemplates that a coating may be added to the claimed suture, Arthrex\u2019s addition of a coating cannot possibly materially affect the basic and novel properties of the inven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>tion. We agree that the specification teaches that a coating may be added. <em>See, e.g., </em>'446 patent, col. 6,11. 5-8 (\u201cIf desired, the surface of the heterogeneous multifilament braid can be coated with a bioabsorbable or nonabsorbable coating to further improve the handleability and knot tie-down performance of the braid.\u201d). However, as Arthrex points out, the specification also criticizes coatings. For example, it discusses the \u201cdeficiencies which plague conventionally coated multi-filament sutures.\u201d <em>Id., </em>col. 2,11. 12-13. It also teaches that \u201cif the surface of the heterogeneous braid is engineered to possess a significant fraction of the lubricous yarn system, the conventional coating may be eliminated saving expense as well as avoiding the associated braid stiffening.\u201d <em>Id., </em>col. 6, 11. 13-17. Thus, as the district court observed, the patent \u201csays all things to all people,\u201d and thus it does not save Mitek from the jury\u2019s verdict that the addition of a silicone coating materially affected the basic and novel characteristics of the invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">3. Motion for New Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Mitek argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying its motion for new trial because the jury\u2019s verdict is \u201cplainly against the weight of the credible evidence.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 51. As discussed above, in light of the evidence presented, the jury\u2019s determination that the addition of the silicone coating materially, affected the basic and novel properties of the invention is not unreasonable. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Mitek\u2019s motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">The district court\u2019s denials of Mitek\u2019s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion for new trial are <em>AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">. Arthrex also argues that Mitek's motion for new trial was insufficient to toll the deadline for filing a notice of appeal. Because we find, <em>infra, </em>that Mitek\u2019s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law was sufficient to toll the deadline, we need not and do not reach Arthrex's argument with respect to the motion for new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
