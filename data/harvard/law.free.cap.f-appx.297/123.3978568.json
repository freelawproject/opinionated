Hughes appeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, which affirmed the denial by the Commissioner of Social Security of Hughes\u2019 application for disability insurance benefits. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We exercise appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is limited to determining whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-16\">Hughes sustained an injury to her right hip when she slipped at work in January of 2002. Although a battery of diagnostic studies were performed, and several diagnoses were ruled out, no definitive diagnosis was made. In April of 2003, Dr. Gibson documented that treatment \u201chas not been terribly successful.\u201d He expressed his belief that she had a total disability and opined that he still felt that \u201cher diagnosis is likely consistent with muscle ligamen-tous capsular tear.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-17\">In October of 2003, Dr. Gibson documented that the results of several diagnostic studies were negative and that he thought \u201cthat she is permanently and totally disabled.\u201d In May of the following year, Dr. Gibson opined that Hughes\u2019 right hip was \u201cthe same.... She is left with a permanent disability about her right hip which is significant. I feel there is no other treatment available at this time.\u201d He prescribed pain medication and noted that he would see her as needed. In response to a request by the Social Security Administration for information about Hughes\u2019 medical status, Dr. Gibson documented that Hughes complained of pain in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>her right groin and that an exhaustive work up had been negative for any objective findings. Dr. Gibson opined that she had a chronic soft tissue injury of the right hip, and that her prognosis was poor. In addition, Dr. Gibson completed a form regarding Hughes\u2019 ability to do physical work-related activities, and reported that she was unable to perform the full range of sedentary work because of limitations in her ability to lift, to carry, to sit, to stand, to walk, and to perform postural maneuvers.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">On December 15, 2005, Hughes testified during a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). She described the origin of her injury and explained that she was unable to work because of limitations arising from her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In January of 2006, Dr. Gibson again responded to a request from the Social Security Administration. He documented that he had last treated Hughes in September of 2005, and that she continued to complain of chronic inflammatory type pain in her right groin. Objective findings, however, were negative. Dr. Gibson\u2019s diagnosis of Hughes\u2019 condition changed slightly from chronic soft tissue injury of the right hip to \u201cchronic strain right groin, unrelenting and unimproved.\u201d Her prognosis, Dr. Gibson opined, was still poor, and she remained unable to perform the full range of sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In a decision dated January 27, 2006, the ALJ denied Hughes\u2019s application for benefits. The ALJ applied the five step sequential analysis set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. At step one, he found that Hughes had not engaged in any substantial gainful activity. Step two required the ALJ to determine if Hughes had a severe impairment. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii). He concluded that she did not have severe impairment and was not disabled for purposes of Social Security.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The ALJ explained that Hughes had to prove that she had a physical impairment by offering \u201cmedical evidence, consisting of signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings.\u201d Although the ALJ acknowledged Hughes\u2019 complaints of chronic pain in her right hip, groin, and leg, he pointed out that \u201cdespite an exhaustive diagnostic work up, no medically determinable impairment has been established that would account for these symptoms.\u201d He also considered the medical evidence, including the documentation from her treating physician Dr. Gibson. He gave little weight to Dr. Gibson\u2019s opinion, however, as his progress notes failed to \u201cset forth any objective basis for the assigned physical limitations.\u201d The ALJ specified that \u201cthe only clinical finding [Dr. Gibson] describes is \u2018pain (right) groin,\u2019 which is a subjective symptom and not a finding and he specifically admits that exhaustive work up was negative for objective findings.\u201d In the absence of any objective findings, the ALJ concluded that Hughes had failed to meet her burden of proof at step two in the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">Hughes\u2019 appeal to the District Court was unsuccessful. This appeal followed. She argues that the ALJ erred because the burden at step two is de minimis and the evidence she adduced was sufficient to demonstrate that she had a severe impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Regulation \u00a7 404.1508 specifies that an individual\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">impairment must result from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which can be shown by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques. A physical ... impairment must be established by medical evidence consisting of signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings, not only by your statement of symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1508. Regulation 404.1528 explains that \u201c[s]igns are anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which can be observed, apart from your statements (symptoms).... They must also be shown by observable facts that can be medically described and evaluated.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1528(b). Laboratory findings can be shown by medically acceptable laboratory diagnostic techniques, chemical tests, electrophysiological studies, and x-rays. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1528(c). Examples of objective medical findings are set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(2), including \u201creduced joint motion, muscle spasm, sensory deficit, or motor disruption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We are sympathetic to Hughes\u2019 predicament, but we do not find any error in the ALJ\u2019s application of these regulations to the medical evidence of record. As the ALJ noted, Dr. Gibson\u2019s assessments were unsupported by objective findings. Dr. Gibson acknowledged this very fact in responding to the Social Security Administration\u2019s two requests for information. Noticeably absent from this record is any documentation regarding the examples of objective medical findings cited in regulation \u00a7 404.1529(c)(2). We conclude that there is substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that Hughes did not have a medically determinable severe impairment that meets the 12-month duration requirement. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
