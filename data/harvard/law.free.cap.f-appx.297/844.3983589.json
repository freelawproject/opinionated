C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1), and the BIA\u2019s order denying their motion to reconsider the BIA\u2019s ' prior decision, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b). The Polyakovs argue that the BIA abused its discretion by dismissing them appeal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>the IJ\u2019s order denying then\u2019 motion to reopen as untimely, and by denying their motion to reconsider, because they exercised due diligence in complying with the procedural requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of motions to reopen and for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006) (motion to reopen); <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1340-41 (11th Cir.2003) (motion to reconsider). \u201cOur review is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">A petitioner may file a motion to reopen proceedings before the immigration court if the motion states new facts that would be proven at a hearing and if those facts are supported by affidavits or other evidence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3). \u201cMotions to reopen are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1149 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the statute and regulations, a \u201cmotion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1). An alternate order of removal in connection with a grant of voluntary departure becomes final \u201cupon overstay of the voluntary departure period except where the respondent has filed a timely appeal with the Board.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(f). For purposes of the filing deadlines for motions to reopen and reconsider, however, the BIA looks to the date of the IJ\u2019s order, not the expiration of voluntary departure. <em>In re Goolcharan, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 5, 8 (BIA 2001) (interpreting filing deadlines under previous 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.23, now located at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23). The Polyakovs do not dispute that them motion was untimely or that it did not fall within any of the exceptions to the 90-day time for filing listed in the statute and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">In <em>Anin v. Reno, </em>we considered a petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen an <em>in absentia </em>deportation order based on ineffective assistance of counsel, pursuant to INA \u00a7 242B(c)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(e)(3)(A), which contained a 180-day filing deadline to contest deportation orders based on exceptional circumstances. 188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.1999). We concluded that the 180-day filing deadline was \u201cjurisdictional and mandatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1278-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">In <em>Abdi, </em>we addressed whether a petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, filed after the 90-day deadline in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), could be equitably tolled. 430 F.3d at 1148-49. We concluded that the 90-day filing deadline is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional, and, therefore, it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1150. There, we concluded that the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">A motion to reconsider filed with the BIA must, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cspecify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1):</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">Because the Polyakovs filed their , motion to reopen after the 90-day period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>for filing a motion to reopen had expired, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in dismissing their appeal of the denial of their motion to reopen. In addition, because the Polyakovs could not identify any errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s previous decision, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the Polyakovs\u2019 motion to reconsider. Accordingly, we deny the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">PETITIONS DENIED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ac5G\">.
