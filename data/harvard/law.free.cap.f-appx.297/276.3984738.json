To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Camara fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Camara cannot meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Chen v. INS, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Next, we uphold the finding below that Camara failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Guinea. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2008). Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review Camara\u2019s challenge to the Board\u2019s finding that he did not meet his burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that he filed his asylum application within one year of his entry into the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2006); <em>Niang v. Gonzales, </em>492 F.3d 505, 510 n. 5 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Accordingly, we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-15\"> Camara claims that the Board erred in declining to consider evidence he submitted with his appeal brief. We find no error in the Board's ruling. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003. l(d)(3)(iv) (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
