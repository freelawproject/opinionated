Michels appeals from an order entered February 22, 2007 by the District Court for the Western District of New York (Skretny, J.) affirming a decision of the Commissioner of Social Security (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) which denied Michels\u2019s claim for disability insurance benefits under the Social Security Act. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal. Michels argues that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) failed to give her treating physician\u2019s opinion the requisite controlling weight in determining her residual functional capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">When a district court reviews a determination of the Commissioner, we \u201creview the administrative record <em>de novo </em>to determine whether there is substantial evidence supporting the Commissioner\u2019s decision and whether the Commissioner applied the correct legal standard.\u201d <em>Machadio v. Apfel, </em>276 F.3d 103, 108 (2d Cir.2002). Substantial evidence means \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Under the \u201ctreating physician\u201d rule, \u201cthe medical opinion of a claimant\u2019s treating physician is given controlling weight if it is well supported by medical findings and not inconsistent with other substantial record evidence.\u201d <em>Shaw v. Chater, </em>221 F.3d 126, 134 (2d Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2) (\u201cIf we find that a treating source\u2019s opinion on the issue(s) of the nature and severity of your impairment(s) is well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in your case record, we will give it controlling weight.\u201d). The deference accorded to a treating physician\u2019s opinion may, however, be reduced upon consideration of other factors, including the length and nature of the treating doctor\u2019s relationship with the patient, the extent to which the medical evidence supports the doctor\u2019s opinion, whether the doctor is a specialist, the consistency of the opinion with the rest of the medical record, and any other factors \u201cwhich tend to support or contradict the opinion.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2)(i)-(ii) and (d)(3)-(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Michels asserts that the ALJ and the district court erred by failing to give Dr. Bogner\u2019s opinions \u2014 especially his 2004 assessment describing Michels\u2019s physical limitations and opining that she was disabled \u2014 the requisite \u201ccontrolling weight.\u201d No such deference is required, however, \u201cwhere, as here, the treating physician issued opinions that are not consistent with other substantial evidence in the record. ...\u201d <em>Halloran v. Barnhart, </em>362 F.3d 28, 32 (2d Cir.2004). Dr. Bogner\u2019s assessments are called into question by other medical evidence in the record <em>(e.g., </em>Dr. Landi\u2019s report of March 2003), as well as by the claimant\u2019s own self-reported activities and her failure to seek medical treatment until one year following her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">Moreover, Dr. Bogner\u2019s reports are internally inconsistent. In March and May of 2003, Dr. Bogner called Michels \u201ctotally disabled\u201d, but in November 2003, Dr. Bog-ner indicated \u2014 in conjunction with Mi-chels\u2019s adoption efforts \u2014 that her prognosis was good and she was \u201cfeeling well.\u201d He also stated that her back was \u201cmuch improved\u201d, her \u201clabs were normal\u201d, and that (with the exception of an occasional dose) she was \u201cnot on any of her pain [medications].\u201d Less than one year later, in July/August 2004, Dr. Bogner again opined that Michels was disabled and had been unable to perform any substantial gainful activity since May of 2001, but indicated at the same time that she could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>perform \u201ca wide range of work at the light exertional level.\u201d \u201cConsistency\u201d is a factor in deciding the weight accorded to any medical opinion. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(4). Given the inconsistencies here, the ALJ was free to discount Dr. Bogner\u2019s opinions in favor of a broader view of the medical evidence, notwithstanding Bogner\u2019s status as the \u201ctreating physician.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">In any event, no deference is owed to the doctor\u2019s statement that Michels was \u201cdisabled.\u201d <em>See Green-Younger v. Barnhart, </em>335 F.3d 99, 106 (2d Cir.2003). A statement by a doctor that an individual is \u201cdisabled\u201d does not constitute a determination of disability within the meaning of the Social Security Act; the latter determination is a legal, not a medical, one. <em>See Shaw, </em>221 F.3d at 131 (\u201cThe ALJ\u2019s decision must be guided by the relevant <em>legal </em>standards. To receive federal disability benefits, an applicant must be \u2018disabled\u2019 within the meaning of the [law].\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also Green-Younger, </em>335 F.3d at 106 (\u201c \u2018A treating physician\u2019s statement that the claimant is disabled cannot itself be determinative.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Snell v. Apfel, </em>177 F.3d 128, 133 (2d Cir.1999)). A doctor\u2019s designation of a party as \u201cdisabled\u201d begins the disability inquiry, it does not end it. It is up to the ALJ, the Commissioner, and the courts to decide whether, and to what extent, the claimant has met her burden in steps one through four of the Social Security evaluation process before granting benefits. To that extent, the treating physician\u2019s conclusions regarding Michels\u2019s \u201cdisability\u201d are far less probative than his objective medical assessment of her specific capabilities and limitations, which indicated that she could perform light and sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Finally, other evidence in the record provides substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s findings. Michels did not seek medical care for her injuries until one year after she voluntarily left her job; her self-reported daily activities are extensive; and she applied for jobs as a child care worker and sought to adopt another child during the period for which she now claims benefits. Viewing this non-medical evidence in conjunction with the medical findings and the inconsistency of the treating physician\u2019s assessments, we are convinced that the ALJ\u2019s conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
