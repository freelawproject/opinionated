On August 8, 2006, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey sentenced Zalatarou to the maximum of 240 months of imprisonment on the child pornography offense and to a consecutive 60 months of imprisonment on the money laundering count. Zalatarou filed a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-18\">Zalatarou\u2019s defense counsel in the District Court proceeding was appointed to represent him on appeal. Defense counsel filed a motion to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that he could not find any non-frivolous issues to raise on appeal. The United States agrees with this representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-19\">In <em>Anders, </em>the Supreme Court stated that the \u201cconstitutional requirement of substantial equality and fair process\u201d means that appellate counsel must act as an advocate for the defendant. 386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Thus, counsel\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b123-20\">role as advocate requires that he support his client\u2019s appeal to the best of his ability. Of course, if counsel finds his case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw. That request must, however, be accompanied by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-21\"><em>Id. </em>A satisfactory <em>Anders </em>brief requires evidence that counsel has thoroughly and conscientiously examined the record for appealable issues, and an explanation of why the issues presented are frivolous. <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001). It is not necessary for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>counsel to \u201craise and reject every possible claim,\u201d but the brief must demonstrate a conscientious review of the case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">After considering the submission of Zalatarou\u2019s counsel, and following our own independent review of the present record, we agree that there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal. Counsel explained that the issues that Zalatarou could raise were limited, by virtue of Zalatarou\u2019s unconditional guilty plea, to questioning the validity of his guilty plea, and challenging the legality of his sentence. <em>See United States v. Broce, </em>488 U.S. 563, 574-76, 109 S.Ct. 757, 102 L.Ed.2d 927 (1989). Counsel asserted that the transcript of the guilty plea colloquy revealed no deficits. We agree. The transcript confirms that the District Court, as required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 and <em>Boykin v. Alabama </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), engaged in a thorough colloquy with Zalatarou to ensure that his plea was both knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We also accept counsel\u2019s claim that there is no basis for attacking the legality of Zalatarou\u2019s sentence. As counsel pointed out, Zalatarou\u2019s objections to the presentence report were resolved in his favor at sentencing. In light of the fact that the plea agreement appended a set of stipulations regarding several sentencing enhancements, we cannot discern any ground for arguing that the advisory guideline range was not computed correctly. The transcript of the sentencing proceeding demonstrates that the District Court meaningfully considered the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). As the government points out, Zalatarou agreed to waive any challenge to his sentence if it was within the guideline range for an offense level of 40. Zalatarou\u2019s sentence of 300 months was within the guideline range of 292 to 365 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Defense counsel observed that Zalatarou could conceivably raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Counsel recognized, however, that it is preferable to address claims of this nature on collateral review. <em>United States v. Thornton, </em>327 F.3d 268, 271-72 (3d Cir.2003) (citing <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Zalatarou was notified by the Court on two occasions that he was entitled to file a <em>pro se </em>brief with this Court, but he has not done so. <em>See </em>Third Circuit L.A.R. 109.2(a). Because Zalatarou has not raised any non-frivolous issues for appeal, and because our own independent review of the record fails to reveal any non-frivolous issues for appeal, we will grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-22\">. The District Court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231.
