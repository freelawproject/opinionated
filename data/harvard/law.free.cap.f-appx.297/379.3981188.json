He argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not explain its reasons for selecting the sentence or give adequate consideration to his history of drug and alcohol abuse and that the sentence is substantively unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>sonable because it \u201coverpunish[es]\u201d his offense of illegal reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"AW2Z\">We review Herrera-Calvo\u2019s arguments for plain error, because he did not object to his sentence or the adequacy of reasons for selecting it. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008). Plain error review \u201crequires considerable deference to the district court and erects a more substantial hurdle to reversal of a sentence than does the reasonableness standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391. To demonstrate plain error, an appellant must show (1) error, (2) that is clear or obvious, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Even if those factors are established, the decision to correct the forfeited error is discretionary and will not be exercised unless the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2463, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), Herrera-Calvo argues that his within-guidelines sentence should not be accorded a presumption of reasonableness, for the reason that the justification for applying a presumption of reasonableness is undercut because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b), used to calculate his advisory sentencing range, was promulgated without taking into account \u201cempirical data and national experience.\u201d <em>Kimbrough </em>does not support Herrera-Calvo\u2019s contention. The question presented there was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 564. Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine guidelines, the Court merely ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. The Court said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir. 2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008), which involved a similar challenge to \u00a7 2L1.2. The appellate presumption is therefore applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">The district court\u2019s statements, at sentencing were adequate to show that' it had considered Herrera\u2019s arguments and the pertinent sentencing factors. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468. After reviewing for procedural errors and considering the substantive reasonableness of the sentence (fifty-one months for illegal reentry after deportation), we conclude that HerreraCalvo has failed to show that his sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness or is plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
