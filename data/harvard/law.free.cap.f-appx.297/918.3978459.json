Burstein asserts Rumball was not in privity with defendants in a prior proceeding, <em>Burstein v. Emtel, Inc., </em>No. 0:03-cv-60474-WJZ (S.D.Fla.2006) (unpublished) <em>(Burstein </em>I), and the issues of liability in the present case differ from those in <em>Bur-stein I </em>and a second action which was dismissed without prejudice, <em>Burstein v. Rumball, </em>No. 9:05-cv-80544-DTKH (S.D.Fla.2005) (unpublished) <em>(Burstein II). </em>After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-16\">We review a grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim <em>de novo, </em>accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Swann v. S. Health Partners, Inc., </em>388 F.3d 834, 836 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cWe also review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination of res judicata or collateral estoppel.\u201d <em>EEOC v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., </em>383 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2004). A district court\u2019s conclusion that an issue was actually litigated in a prior action is reviewed for clear error. <em>Richardson v. Miller, </em>101 F.3d 665, 667-68 (11th Cir.1996). Clear error is a highly deferential standard of review and will not be found unless, although there is evidence in the record to support the. finding, \u201cthe reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Morrissette-Brown v. Mobile Infirmary Med. Ctr., </em>506 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">\u201cWhen claim preclusion does not apply to bar an entire claim or set of claims, the doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, may still prevent the relitigation of particular issues which were actually litigated and decided in a prior suit.\u201d <em>Citibank, N.A. v. Data Lease Fin. Corp., </em>904 F.2d 1498, 1501 (11th Cir.1990). The party seeking to bar an issue on collateral estoppel grounds must establish four factors: (1) the issue was identical in both the prior and current action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action; (3) the determination of the issue was critical and necessary to the judgment in the prior action; and (4) the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the earlier proceeding. <em>Barger v. City of Cartersville, Ga., </em>348 F.3d 1289, 1293 (11th Cir.2003). This Court has also noted another factor: that the burden of persuasion in the subsequent action was not significantly heavier than in the prior proceeding. <em>Johnson v. Florida, </em>348 F.3d 1334, 1347 (11th Cir.2003). Although <em>res judicata </em>requires a final judgment, the finality requirement for collateral estoppel is \u201cless stringent.\u201d <em>In re Bayshore Ford Trucks Sales, Inc., </em>471 F.3d 1233, 1253 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Christo v. Padgett, </em>223 F.3d 1324, 1339 (11th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Burstein is incorrect that he could not appeal the dismissal without prejudice of <em>Burstein II. See Justice v. United States, </em>6 F.3d 1474, 1481 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201cA plaintiff may appeal from an involuntary dismissal without prejudice.\u201d). Contrary to the assertion in Rumball\u2019s appellate brief and consistent with the assertion in his 12(b)(6) motion, no evidence in the record exists that Burstein moved for reconsideration of the dismissal of <em>Burstein II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">Collateral estoppel bars this action. The complaint in the present case is identical to the complaint in <em>Burstein II, </em>except for an additional defendant here, Emtel Texas. Both cases were dismissed based on claim preclusion principles. This is<em>sue </em>\u2014 -ie., whether the action was barred by principles of claim preclusion \u2014 was litigated in <em>Burstein II </em>via Burstein\u2019s failed motion to consolidate <em>Burstein II </em>with <em>Burstein I, </em>and Burstein\u2019s response to the court\u2019s order to show cause regarding why <em>Burstein II </em>was not subject to dismissal. This issue was also litigated in this case via Burstein\u2019s response to Rumball\u2019s 12(b)(6) motion, and failed motion for reconsideration. Considering that both <em>Burstein II </em>and the present action were dismissed based on claim preclusion, the determination of the issue was critical and necessary to the judgment in the prior action, <em>ie., Burstein II. See Barger, </em>348 F.3d at 1293. Finally, Burstein had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the earlier proceeding, <em>see id., </em>considering that he had the opportunity to move for reconsideration and appeal, <em>see Justice, </em>6 F.3d at 1481. Accordingly, the issue of whether the current action is barred by claim preclusion is itself barred by collateral estoppel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-13\">. The petition for rehearing en banc is denied as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b945-14\">. Burstein also sued Joseph Degioanni and Emtel, Inc. (Emtel Texas), and the district court likewise dismissed the suit with respect to them. Nevertheless, because Burstein has since settled his claims against those parties, they are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b946-6\">. In light of our conclusion, we need not address the district court's holdings, in the alternative, that the suit is also barred by a prohibition against claim splitting and res ju-dicata.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
