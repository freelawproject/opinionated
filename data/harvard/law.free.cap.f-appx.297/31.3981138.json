Dec. 13, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 255 900 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 17, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Mei Chai Ye v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>489 F.3d 517, 523 (2d Cir.2007). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). For applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility determination on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether those inconsistencies go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see In re J-Y-C-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 260, 265 (B.I.A 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">We find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. In particular, the IJ noted that while Gao\u2019s initial claim, presented at her airport and credible fear interviews, was based on her affiliation with Falun Gong, her asylum application and testimony were based on her alleged campaign against corrupt officials. The IJ also noted that although Gao initially stated that she was a high school graduate who worked for a company that sold car parts, she later alleged that she was a college graduate who worked for the town government. Gao admitted that she lied in her airport and credible fear interviews, but claimed that she did so at the behest of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>smugglers. While applicants should be encouraged to recant false statements, the agency is not required to overlook such falsities in making its ultimate determination. <em>See Rui Ying Lin v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 127, 133 (2d Cir.2006) (discussing the approach <em>o\u00ed falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus </em>(false in one thing, false in everything)).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Beyond her admittedly false statements, the IJ observed that Gao failed to provide any evidence corroborating her claims that: (1) she ever worked for the town government; (2) she traveled to Beijing; (3) she had ever been arrested; or (4) she ever was charged with violating the social order. Gao also failed to provide copies of the anti-corruption leaflets she allegedly distributed. Under the REAL ID Act, these findings provided substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Gao was not credible under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii), (iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Because Gao\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims were based on the same factual predicate, the adverse credibility determination was fatal to both claims. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Finally, because Gao has failed to argue sufficiently her CAT claim before this Court, we deem any such arguments waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
