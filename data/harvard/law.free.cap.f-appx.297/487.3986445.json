(\u201cDTR\u201d), violated the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d) when attempting to dissuade its employees from unionizing. DTR seeks review of two parts of the NLRB\u2019s order. First, DTR asserts that Executive Coordinator Thomas King\u2019s (\u201cKing\u2019s\u201d) statements to employees were objective predictions, not threats of layoffs should employees unionize. Second, DTR argues that the NLRB incorrectly credited employee Daniel Gahman\u2019s (\u201cGahman\u2019s\u201d) testimony when concluding that DTR threatened to discipline Gahman for his pro-union activities and gave Gah-man the impression that DTR was surveil-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>ling his union activities. The NLRB filed a cross-application for enforcement of the order. For the following reasons, we ENFORCE the NLRB\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ANcR\">A. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">DTR manufactures hose and rubber anti-vibration products for use in automobiles. DTR employs approximately 800 individuals at its Bluffton, Ohio facility. DTR is a \u201cjust in time\u201d operation, manufacturing only the quantity purchased by a buyer and not producing excess parts for inventory. Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 508-09 (Dee. 18, 2003, NLRB Hr\u2019g Tr., King Test, at 467:4-468:20). Additionally, DTR is a sole-source supplier for three-fourths of its customers, with those customers relying entirely upon DTR for the production of a given product.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In summer 2002, some DTR employees began a union-organizing campaign. Gah-man, a union supporter, was involved in that effort to obtain union representation. Shortly after the organizing campaign began, DTR management made its disapproval of his activities clear to Gahman. In early August, Gahman\u2019s supervisor told Gahman that he was required to attend a meeting with King and several other supervisors. King, DTR\u2019s Executive Coordinator, reports directly to DTR\u2019s president, COO, Chairman, and CEO. King is responsible for DTR\u2019s human resources and had been with DTR for over a decade as of 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">According to Gahman\u2019s testimony, at the meeting King informed Gahman that King was aware of Gahman\u2019s support of unionization and knew Gahman attended union meetings. In addition, King made it clear that he knew about several things that Gahman had mentioned at a union meeting the night before; King\u2019s knowledge left Gahman feeling spied upon and feeling as though he \u201cwas being betrayed by the UAW.\u201d J.A. at 223 (Dec. 17, 2003, NLRB Hr\u2019g Tr., Gahman Test, at 183:9). Specifically, King accused Gahman of sharpening a knife for an employee in exchange for the employee signing a union card. But Gahman explained that he sharpened the knife as a favor for the employee while explaining the benefits of unionization. Next, King said that he had heard that Gahman refused to install a fan for an employee who did not support the union. Gahman, however, responded by stating he installed fans whenever there was a work order. Gahman testified that at the conclusion of the meeting King stated that if he continued to hear about Gahman\u2019s union support, King would discipline Gahman for the knife and fan incidents. Gahman said that he would discontinue his union support and \u201cthat there won\u2019t be no further problems.\u201d J.A. at 223 (Gahman Test, at 183:22-23).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">After the meeting with Gahman, DTR continued to make its disapproval of unionization clear to its employees. King\u2019s public comments regarding the effects of unionization are the primary focus of this case. DTR conducts monthly President Associates (\u201cPA\u201d) meetings where management discusses company issues with its employees. On August 29, 2002, King used one of those PA meetings to address the possible effects of unionization. Although there is no transcript or recording of King\u2019s statements, the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) and the NLRB credited the testimony of several employees who heard King\u2019s comments. DTR employee James Lehman (\u201cLehman\u201d) testified that King stated that the employees \u201chad the right to choose whether we want[ed] third party representation or not but there was some facts he thought we needed to know.\u201d J.A. at 72 (Dec. 16, 2003, NLRB Hr\u2019g Tr., Lehman Test, at 33:8-10).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Rita McVetta (\u201cMcVetta\u201d), another DTR employee, testified on direct examination that King explained DTR\u2019s status as a sole-source supplier. According to McVet-ta, King stated \u201cthat if we got [a] Union into the plant that they wouldn\u2019t probably do business with us and we wouldn\u2019t have jobs.\u201d J.A. at 54 (Dec. 16, 2003, NLRB Hr\u2019g Tr., McVetta Test, at 15:22-24). On cross examination, McVetta stated that King made it clear at the PA meeting that \u201c[i]f we had a Union in there[,] customers would not want to deal with us because of the Union.\u201d J.A. at 63 (McVetta Test, at 24:13-14). On cross examination, Lehman corroborated McVetta\u2019s recollection of the PA meeting; according to Lehman, King stated \u201cthat if Honda or Toyota or any other customer became concerned about reliability of DTR\u2019s production flow, ... those customers would look for other sources.\u201d J.A. at 76 (Lehman Test, at 37:6-8). Lehman\u2019s impression was that King wanted employees to know that unionization might threaten DTR\u2019s reliability, lead to a loss of business, and ultimately force job cuts.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Gahman also testified about King\u2019s comments at the PA meeting. On direct examination Gahman summarized King\u2019s statements:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">[King] explained to us that we had a sole supplier deal going with some of our customers where we were the only company that made particular parts for them, and said that if the UAW was to get into DTR that we would lose that sole supplier status be-, because the companies would no longer feel confident with us being their only supplier because the UAW would make us more unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">And so they would allow other companies, you know, to compete with us for some of the parts that we were making. And he stated that if that happened it would result in layoffs and DTR had never laid anyone off he said [ ], in the time that they\u2019d been a company, but if the UAW came there that that policy would, would have to change.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">J.A. at 225 (Gahman Test, at 185:3-15). On cross-examination, Gahman stated that King expressed his concern \u201cabout action the customers might take\u201d should DTR become unionized. J.A. at 275 (Gahman Test, at 235:13-14).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Subsequent to these events, DTR terminated Gahman for submitting a false sample for a drug test. DTR conducts random drug tests of its employees, and company policy dictates that DTR terminate any employee who returns a fraudulent sample. In September 2002, Gahman was selected for drug testing; the first sample he provided was brown-colored and undersized, so it was discarded, and DTR requested that Gahman produce another. Gahman\u2019s second sample was a bright col- or and was not warm enough, but the lab sealed and kept the sample. DTR requested that Gahman provide a third sample before a witness at the hospital, and this sample tested positive for marijuana. The second sample was tested and the lab concluded that the sample was \u201cnot consistent with normal human urine.\u201d J.A. at 6 (NLRB Order at 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">B. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">On the basis of these and other incidents, the union filed charges with the NLRB against DTR on September 30, 2002.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a three-day trial, on April 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>2004, the ALJ issued an opinion holding that DTR violated 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) by creating the impression that its employees were under surveillance, threatening employees with discipline if they continued to support the union, and threatening employees with layoffs if DTR unionized. The ALJ also concluded that DTR violated 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3) for improperly terminating Gahman.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The NLRB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that DTR had violated 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) by creating the impression that its employees were under surveillance, threatening employees with discipline if they continued to support the union, and threatening employees with layoffs if DTR unionized. In reaching this conclusion, the NLRB distinguished the previous DTR case, <em>DTR Industries, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>39 F.3d 106 (6th Cir.1994), and concluded that King\u2019s statements were not protected speech. However, the NLRB reversed the ALJ\u2019s finding that Gahman was wrongly discharged. Because Gahman\u2019s second urine sample was found to be fraudulent, the NLRB concluded that DTR\u2019s dismissal of Gahman was consistent with DTR\u2019s policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The NLRB issued its order on September 7, 2007, and DTR timely filed a petition for review. On October 12, 2007, the NLRB filed a cross-application for the enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"ay0-dedup-0\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Although the NLRB must have \u201cmore than a mere scintilla of evidence\u201d supporting its decision, we review the NLRB\u2019s decision deferentially; \u201c[t]his Court reviews the NLRB\u2019s factual determinations, and its application of the law to a particular set of facts, for substantial evidence.\u201d <em>ITT Auto. v. NLRB, </em>188 F.3d 375, 384 (6th Cir.1999). \u201c[A]s long as the record as a whole contains substantial evidence supporting the NLRB\u2019s findings, this Court must sustain those findings even if we might have reached a different conclusion upon de novo review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Substantial evidence \u201cmeans such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consol. Edison Co. of New York v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">B. King\u2019s Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">The primary question on appeal is whether King\u2019s statements at the PA meetings were impermissibly coercive in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) or whether the statements constituted protected speech under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c). Section 158(a)(1) makes it \u201can unfair labor practice for an employer ... to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the\u201d employees\u2019 rights to self-organization and collective bargaining. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a). Section 158(c) protects \u201c[t]he expressing of any views, argument, or opinion, or the dissemination thereof,\u201d but only if the \u201cexpression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c). The NLRB concluded that King\u2019s statements \u201cthreatened employees with job loss in violation of\u2019 \u00a7 158(a)(1), and we agree. JA. at 1 (NLRB Order at 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">DTR asserts that King\u2019s statements were not threats but were instead simply objective predictions of what would happen should DTR employees succeed in unionizing. Although the Supreme Court has made it clear that \u00a7 158(c) protects objective predictions, the Court also has stressed that any such predictions must be carefully phrased lest they erode into unsubstantiated threats:</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">Thus, an employer is free to communicate to his employees any of his general views about unionism or any of his specific views about a particular union, so long as the communications do not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>tain a \u2018threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.\u2019 He may even make a prediction as to the precise effects he believes unionization will have on his company. In such a case, however, <em>the prediction must be carefully phrased on the basis of objective fact </em>to convey an employer\u2019s belief as to demonstrably probable consequences beyond his control or to convey a management decision already arrived at to close the plant in case of unionization. If there is any implication that an employer may or may not take action solely on his own initiative for reasons unrelated to economic necessities and known only to him, the statement is no longer a reasonable prediction based on available facts but a threat of retaliation based on misrepresentation and coercion, and as such without the protection of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). Section 158(c) was intended to allow free debate about unionization in the workplace, but it is not so permissive as to allow coercive, threatening speech. <em>Chamber of Commerce v. Brown, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2408, 2413-14, 171 L.Ed.2d 264 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Because of the unique relationship between employer, employee, and union, the scope of protected employer speech in the labor setting is limited: \u201cThus, an employer\u2019s rights cannot outweigh the equal rights of the employees to associate freely, as those rights are embodied in \u00a7 7 and protected by \u00a7 8(a)(1) and the proviso to \u00a7 8(c).\u201d <em>Gissel Packing, </em>395 U.S. at 617, 89 S.Ct. 1918. As the Supreme Court has explained, in assessing the scope of permissible employer expression, \u201cany balancing of those rights must take into account the economic dependence of the employees on their employers, and the necessary tendency of the former, because of that relationship, to pick up intended implications of the latter that might be more readily dismissed by a more disinterested ear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This balancing must \u201crecogniz[e] that what is basically at stake is the establishment of a nonpermanent, limited relationship between the employer, his economically dependent employee and his union agent,\u201d as opposed to \u201cthe election of legislators or the enactment of legislation whereby that relationship is ultimately defined and where the independent voter may be freer to listen more objectively and employers as a class freer to talk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617-18, 89 S.Ct. 1918. Therefore, while certain statements may be innocuous in many settings, when made during an effort to unionize those same statements may take on another character entirely. \u201cIn reviewing Company statements made in the emotion of a union drive, the Board reasonably considers the effect of the remarks from the point of view of those whose livelihood may depend on them.\u201d <em>Indiana Cal-Pro, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>863 F.2d 1292, 1299 (6th Cir.1988). Statements threatening plant closure or layoffs are particularly suspect because \u201cthreats of plant closure are \u2018among the most flagrant\u2019 of unfair. labor practices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301 (quoting <em>Gissel Packing, </em>395 U.S. at 611 n. 31, 89 S.Ct. 1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">Applying the <em>Gissel Packing </em>standard, we must consider whether King\u2019s statements, taken as a whole, were carefully phrased predictions on the basis of objective fact, or contained \u201ca threat of retaliation based on misrepresentation and coercion.\u201d <em>Gissel Packing, </em>395 U.S. at 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although some of King\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>statements contained predictions of what DTR\u2019s customers would do if DTR unionized, these predictions were not \u201ccarefully phrased on the basis of objective fact.\u201d <em>Gissel Packing, </em>395 U.S. at 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918. Considered in context, and given King\u2019s explicit statements that DTR would have to change its no-layoff policy and that DTR employees would lose them jobs, the statements as a whole had a \u201creasonable tendency\u201d to be \u201ccoercive in effect.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Pentre Elec., Inc., </em>998 F.2d 363, 369 (6th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>Peabody Coal v. NLRB, </em>725 F.2d 357, 363 (6th Cir. 1984)), overruled on other grounds by <em>Holly Farms Corp. v. NLRB, </em>517 U.S. 392, 116 S.Ct. 1396, 134 L.Ed.2d 593 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">According to DTR, King\u2019s statements were objective predictions because we previously held that similar statements made by DTR\u2019s president were objective predictions not containing impermissible threats. In 1989, during a prior unionization push at DTR, company president Yuji Kobaya-shi (\u201cKobayashi\u201d) sent a four-page letter to employees explaining his views regarding the effects of unionization. His letter included the following statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Our business would automatically be reduced if the union wins the election and our customers took away 50 percent of our sole source business. They could, of course, take it all away and sole source with some non-union company. They do not have to give any business to DTR.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Furthermore, most labor contracts are for three year terms. The U.S. auto companies force their unionized suppliers to build a 90-day inventory of parts before any labor contract termination. If the supplier fails to do so, it usually loses its order. That means that unionized suppliers, such as our associate Norbalt, are required to work overtime before the end of every labor contract and then, if the contract is negotiated without a strike, employees are laid off while the inventory is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Point 3 really comes down to this. Bringing a union would lose business for DTR....</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\"><em>DTR Indus., Inc., </em>311 NLRB 833, 833 (1993) (quoting letter from Kobayashi to DTR employees (Nov. 10, 1989)). The letter went on to conclude:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">Having a union will hurt our business and our chances for success. We will lose some or all of our sole source business and create the danger of losing the confidence of our customers. Let us show what DTR and its associates can do together as a team without the union. You have our attention and our commitment. We will listen and we will respond and we will have a mutual commitment to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\"><em>DTR Indus., </em>39 F.3d at 109 (quoting letter from Kobayashi). Kobayashi\u2019s letter to DTR employees certainly bears some similarity to King\u2019s statements at the PA meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-14\">When we previously considered the effect of Kobayashi\u2019s letter, we concluded that the letter was an objective prediction. We first observed that \u201cthere is a distinction between \u2018threats\u2019 motivated by union animus and \u2018predictions\u2019 about the probable economic consequences of unionization; the former clearly violates section 8(a)(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>while the latter may be protected by section 8(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113 (footnote omitted) (quoting <em>Pentre Elec., </em>998 F.2d at 369). We then concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">[T]he Kobayashi letter, taken in context, is an objective prediction of what the petitioner\u2019s customers would do in the event the union prevailed, and thus is protected speech. Kobayashi explained in the communication that companies that sole-sourced with the petitioner were likely to split their business in order to have an alternative supply source in the event of a strike. As <em>Pentre Electric </em>demonstrated, Kobaya-shi was entitled to make this statement based on his industry experience and his knowledge of the petitioner\u2019s customer base, at which point it was incumbent on the Board to prove its falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\"><em>DTR Indus., </em>39 F.3d at 114. Although we determined that Kobayashi\u2019s letter was protected speech, that conclusion does not compel us to find that King\u2019s distinct statement is also protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Kobayashi and King, despite the vague similarities between what they said, did not make identical statements, and their statements were made in different contexts. Although both Kobayashi and King explained the nature of DTR\u2019s sole-source-supply business and expressed the view that DTR\u2019s customers might not be happy with a unionized DTR, the similarities end there. Not once did Kobayashi\u2019s letter state that layoffs or plant closures were an inevitable outcome of unionization.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Explaining the importance of sole-source customers to DTR\u2019s business, Kobayashi made the tautological point that \u201c[o]ur business would automatically be reduced if the union wins the election <em>and </em>our customers took away 50 percent of our sole source business.\u201d <em>DTR Indus., </em>311 NLRB at 833 (emphasis added). It is notable that Kobayashi did not follow this by saying that layoffs would ensue. Even if layoffs were the eventual byproduct of unionization, Kobayashi\u2019s letter was predicated upon the necessary condition of customers taking away 50 percent of the sole-source business, something that Kobayashi did not guarantee. When discussing how automakers have required unionized suppliers such as Norbalt to build up supply prior to the end of labor contracts, Koba-yashi stated that <em>other </em>companies have typically laid off employees while the excess supply was depleted. However, this was a factual statement and not a threat; as the dissent acknowledges, this experience would lead to layoffs only \u201cif other companies\u2019 experience was any guide.\u201d Dissenting Op. at 501. Kobayashi did not go so far as to say that DTR would lay off employees. In fact, Kobayashi closed his letter by expressing his desire for \u201cDTR and its associates\u201d to work \u201ctogether as a team\u201d and describing the \u201cmutual commitment to each other.\u201d <em>DTR Indus., </em>39 F.3d at 109 (quoting letter from Kobayashi).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Kobayashi\u2019s letter, by not promising layoffs at DTR, is different than King\u2019s statements to employees at the PA meetings. McVetta, Lehman, and Gahman all agreed that the import of King\u2019s statement was that unionization would lead to job layoffs. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion that King \u201cdid not <em>guarantee </em>that layoffs would result from unionization,\u201d Dissenting Op. at 502, King specifically stated that increased competition \u201cwould result in lay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>offs\u201d and that, \u201cif the UAW came there [DTR\u2019s no-layoff| policy would, would have to change,\u201d J.A. at 225 (Gahman Test, at 185:12-15). McVetta also recalled King\u2019s statement \u201cthat if we got [a] Union into the plant that they wouldn\u2019t probably do business with us and we wouldn\u2019t have jobs.\u201d J.A. at 54 (McVetta Test, at 15:22-24). Thus, the tenor of King\u2019s statements was different than Kobayashi\u2019s. Unlike Kobayashi, King explicitly stated that a decrease in business as a result of unionization would be dealt with through layoffs at DTR.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In addition to the fact that King explicitly raised the spectre of DTR layoffs while Kobayashi did not, another key distinguishing feature is the context of these statements. First, Kobayashi was president of DTR, while King was an Executive Coordinator, DTR\u2019s chief human-resources officer. Although Executive Coordinator may in fact be an important position at DTR, the NLRB distinguished King and Kobayashi by noting that Kobayashi\u2019s privileged position at the company gave him \u201cindustry experience and knowledge of [DTR\u2019s] customer base,\u201d while King\u2019s statement lacked such context. J.A. at 2 (NLRB Order at 2). In other words, King\u2019s tenure at DTR says nothing to employees about his ability to know whether layoffs would be an economic necessity. As one NLRB Chairman noted, \u201cthere are ways, other than layoffs, to deal with drop-offs of business,\u201d J.A. at 2 (NLRB Order at 2 n. 14), but the record does not suggest that King was in a position to assess the viability of alternative measures. As chief human-resources officer, King\u2019s statements could reasonably have been viewed by employees as indicating that DTR would deal with a decline in business through layoffs or other labor-related options, increasing the threatening quality of the statements. Although King may have known about Kobayashi\u2019s prior statements and the ensuing NLRB litigation, there is no indication that any of this knowledge was expressed to the employees. As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cthe Board could reasonably conclude that the intended and understood import of that message was not to predict that unionization would inevitably cause the plant to close but to threaten to throw employees out of work <em>regardless of the economic realities.\u2019\u2019 Gissel Packing, </em>395 U.S. at 619, 89 S.Ct. 1918 (emphasis added). If the person making the statements threatening layoffs is not seen as in a position to know the economic realities of the company, then the threat is made regardless of the company\u2019s economic realities. While it is true, as the dissent observes, that we found statements of lower-level supervisors to be protected in the earlier DTR case, we emphasized that these statements \u201cmerely repeated the observations made in Kobayashi\u2019s letter,\u201d <em>DTR Indus., </em>39 F.3d at 114, and therefore were taken in the context of the objective facts and predictions already provided by DTR\u2019s president.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">While Kobayashi no doubt knew the economic condition at DTR, King\u2019s statement was made \u201cwithout objective facts for actually believing[] that plants might close if employees voted in the union.\u201d <em>ITT Auto., </em>188 F.3d at 386. \u201cIn the present case, no objective evidence was presented by the Company supporting a statement that unionization would result or even could result in an objectively required economic closing of the plant. Indeed, the Company failed before both the ALJ and the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>to support such a statement as based in fact.\u201d <em>Indiana Cal-Pro, </em>863 F.2d at 1298-99 (holding that the NLRB possessed substantial evidence supporting the conclusion that a supervisor violated \u00a7 158(a)(1) when he told employees that he heard from ownership that unionization would lead to the owners shutting down the plant). Further, King provided no objective facts to explain why layoffs, rather than alternative measures, would be a necessary consequence of a decrease in business. Without this objective support, employees could reasonably view this choice as a threat of reprisal. Combined with King\u2019s lower position at DTR, his failure to provide objective facts to support his statements leads to the conclusion that \u201ctheir ... reasonable tendency is coercive in effect.\u201d <em>Pentre Elec., </em>998 F.2d at 369 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Peabody Coal, </em>725 F.2d at 363).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In addition to asserting that our prior holding in the earlier DTR case protects King\u2019s statements, DTR encourages us to apply <em>Pentre Electnc </em>to conclude that King\u2019s statement was not impermissibly coercive. We hold that <em>Pentre Electric </em>is inapposite. In that case we approvingly cited the following summary of the law: \u201cWhile coercive speech and conduct by an employer are prohibited by the NLRA, the expression of noncoercive views, arguments, and opinions for and against unionization cannot be held unlawful.\u201d Rebecca Hanner White, <em>The Statutory and Constitutional Limits of Using Protected Speech as Evidence of Unlawful Motive Under the National Labor Relations Act, </em>53 Ohio St. L.J. 1, 3 (1992) (footnote omitted), <em>quoted in NLRB v. Pentre Elec., Inc., </em>998 F.2d 363, 368 (6th Cir.1993). Although it is true that noncoercive arguments are not unlaw-fill, in' <em>Pentre Electnc </em>we held merely that there was no violation of \u00a7 158(a)(1) because \u201c[t]he record is simply devoid of any evidence that [the supervisors] suggested that Pentre might close its doors, much less that they would close Pentre as a means to punish the employees if they voted in favor of the union.\u201d <em>Pentre Elec., </em>998 F.2d at 370. Thus, contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertions, <em>Pentre Electric </em>is factually very different than the case at hand; King did threaten layoffs, and we believe that the Board\u2019s decision that his statements were coercive is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">We recognize that this case is not easy given the similarities between King\u2019s statements and Kobayashi\u2019s letter. In reaching our conclusion, however, we bear in mind our deferential standard of review and the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that \u201ca reviewing court must recognize the Board\u2019s competence in the first instance to judge the impact of utterances made in the context of the employer-employee relationship.\u201d <em>Gissel Packing, </em>395 U.S. at 620, 89 S.Ct. 1918. DTR has not challenged the NLRB\u2019s conclusion that DTR did commit some violations; thus, it is clear that the DTR unionization effort led to a tense atmosphere. Given that atmosphere, King\u2019s statements were not carefully phrased to avoid implied threats of reprisal. For these reasons, we uphold the NLRB\u2019s conclusion that King\u2019s statements were coercive and threatening in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">C. Gahman\u2019s Credibility</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">The second issue on appeal is whether the NLRB erred in concluding that DTR threatened to punish Gahman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>for his union activities and gave Gahman the impression that he was under' surveillance. DTR argues that the NLRB erred because it based its decision solely on Gahman\u2019s testimony \u2014 the uncorroborated, biased testimony of a discredited employee. We conclude that the NLRB had substantial evidence in support of its decision. \u201c[T]his Court generally defers to the credibility determinations of the NLRB, particularly where the \u2018record is fraught with conflicting testimony and essential credibility determinations have been made.\u2019 \u201d <em>ITT Auto., </em>188 F.3d at 384 (quoting <em>Tony Scott Trucking, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>821 F.2d 312, 315 (6th Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The ALJ did not rely solely upon Gah-man\u2019s testimony in determining that DTR threatened Gahman with punishment for his union activities and gave Gahman the impression that his activities were under surveillance. The ALJ believed that Gah-man\u2019s testimony was corroborated by King\u2019s own notes from the meeting with Gahman. According to the AL J\u2019s decision, King\u2019s notes show that the meeting \u201cwas about Gahman\u2019s union activity ... creating the impression of surveillance.\u201d J.A. at 27 (ALJ Dec. at 27). Furthermore, the ALJ observed that there were other supervisors at the meeting between Gahman and King, yet \u201c[n]one of these other supervisors were called by [DTR] to corroborate King\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, there was substantial evidence supporting the ALJ and NLRB\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The fact that Gahman was separately found to have submitted a fraudulent drug sample does not mean that the ALJ and NLRB cannot find him credible as to other issues. The ALJ has the ability to credit parts of a witness\u2019s testimony, even when discrediting other parts of the testimony. <em>Carrier Corp. v. NLRB, </em>768 F.2d 778, 782 (6th Cir.1985). Given our level of deference for ALJ and NLRB credibility determinations, we conclude that there was substantial evidence supporting the ALJ and NLRB\u2019s conclusion that DTR threatened to punish Gahman for his union activities and gave Gahman the impression that he was under surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">In the sensitive labor relations setting, employers\u2019 predictions of plant closures and job losses are readily perceived as coercive and threatening by employees, who are dependent on the employer for their livelihood. <em>See Gissel Packing, </em>395 U.S. at 617,. 89 S.Ct. 1918. Given the strong interest in protecting the rights of employees to associate freely, it is therefore not enough for an employer simply to preface a threat of layoffs with a prediction about customer response to unionization: Any \u201cprediction must be carefully phrased on the basis of objective fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918. Without such objective context, it is all too easy for vulnerable employees to perceive their employer as intending to punish union supporters by laying them off if business drops. The law does not require much of an employer, who, as the party in control of the employer-employee relationship, is in the best position to \u201cavoid coercive speech simply by avoiding conscious overstatements he has reason to believe will mislead his employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620, 89 S.Ct. 1918. Requiring any less would allow employers to consistently circumvent the prohibitions of \u00a7 158(a)(1) by simply assuring that their threats are accompanied by vague predictions of the effect of unionization on the firm\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">For these reasons, we believe that there was substantial evidence supporting the NLRB\u2019s conclusions that King\u2019s statements violated 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) and that DTR threatened to punish Gahman for his union activities and gave Gahman the impression that he was under surveil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>lance. Therefore, we DENY the petition for review, and we ENFORCE the NLRB\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\">. Among the other incidents that provoked the union\u2019s actions, DTR ordered Gahman to remove a hat emblazoned with the UAW logo, claiming the hat was offensive. The NLRB found this to be a violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), and DTR does not contest that finding on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b518-8\">. The dissent attempts to set up a false dichotomy, asserting that \"[w]hen the employer\u2019s prediction concerns a consequence over which he has no control, that by definition cannot constitute a 'threat of reprisal.\u2019 \u201d Dissenting Op. at 499. This ignores the complex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ities and nuances of the type of statements at issue in \u00a7 158(a)(1) cases. As contemplated by \u00a7 158(c), a statement may contain both predictive and coercive elements. For example, an employer may make a prediction that unionization will cause a customer to decrease its business while also threatening that the employer will choose to deal with that loss of business through layoffs. If the statement that layoffs, rather than alternative measures, will be employed is not \"carefully phrased on the basis of objective fact,\" it may reasonably be viewed by employees as containing a threat of reprisal, losing the protections of \u00a7 158(c). <em>Gissel Packing, </em>395 U.S. at 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\">. The record before us does not contain the entirety of Kobayashi\u2019s letter. However, when the NLRB considered the effect of the letter, it concluded that the letter <em>was </em>threatening and coercive, <em>DTR Industries, </em>311 NLRB at 833; thus, presumably the NLRB would have quoted the most damning sections of the letter. To the extent that we rely upon Kobayashi's letter in making our decision, we rely upon the language that the NLRB used in determining that the letter was coercive and threatening.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b521-6\">.

The requirement of objective support does not mean that employers must provide empirical evidence: Although \"an employer is not required to \u2018produce evidence to corroborate predictions about the effect of unionization,''' our decisions \"still requireL] an employer\u2019s statements to have the support of precise objective facts.\u201d <em>ITT Auto., </em>188 F.3d at 386 n. 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b524-4\">SUTTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AKB\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">I agree with the majority that Thomas King\u2019s remarks to Daniel Gahman amounted to an unfair labor practice. But I respectfully disagree with its conclusion that King\u2019s speeches at the pre-election employee meetings did not constitute protected employer speech under \u00a7 8(c) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA bars employers from taking actions that \u201cinterfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of\u2019 an employee\u2019s right to organize and participate in union representation. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1).

Concerned that the Board\u2019s \u201caggressive enforcement of \u00a7 8(a)(1) had made it excessively difficult for employers to engage in any form of non-coercive communications with employees regarding the merits of unionization,\u201d <em>Allegheny Ludlum Corp. v. NLRB, </em>104 F.3d 1354, 1361 (D.C.Cir.1997), and concerned about the infringement of the employer\u2019s free-speech rights, <em>cf. Necia Mining Co. v.

Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 617, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969); <em>see also United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union Local 204 v. NLRB, </em>506 F.3d 1078, 1081 (D.C.Cir.2007).

And uninhibited discourse levels the playing field for the employer, whose \u201conly effective way of arguing against the union is ... to point out to the workers the adverse consequences of unionization.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Pentre Elec., Inc., </em>998 F.2d 363, 369 (6th Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Holly Farms Corp. v.

NLRB, </em>439 F.2d 876, 878 (6th Cir.1971). Consistent with the free-speech principles underlying \u00a7 8(c), we have applied this rule in favor of speech by management, <em>see Pentre, </em>998 F.2d at 368-71, and in favor of speech by a union president, <em>see NLRB v. Constr. &amp; Gen. Laborers\u2019 Union Local No. 534, </em>778 F.2d 284, 290-91 (6th Cir.1985) (reversing Board\u2019s decision that a union president\u2019s speech amounted to an unfair labor practice and holding it was protected where the president \u201cdid not explicitly threaten that [the union] would take some action against persons who file unfair labor practice charges\u201d but instead \u201cthe action threatened was action that would have been taken by an independent third party with no instigation or assistance from the Union,\u201d his statements did not contain \u201csome implied threat that the Union or its members would take some action against persons who file charges\u201d and the Board did not find his statements were \u201cfalse\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Section 8(c) thus confirms that \u201can employer is free to communicate to his employees any of his general views about unionism or any of his specific views about a particular union.\u201d <em>Gissel, </em>395 U.S. at 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918. And an employer \u201cmay even make a prediction as to the precise effects he believes unionization will have on his company\u201d if it is \u201ccarefully phrased on the basis of objective fact\u201d and is designed \u201cto convey an employer\u2019s belief as to demonstrably probable consequences <em>beyond his control.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Threats of reprisal by an employer, by contrast, serve none of these objectives and indeed add nothing of value to the dialogue Congress sought to foster. That is why \u00a7 8(c) offers no safe harbor to statements that \u201ccould easily and understandably be perceived as veiled threats of retaliation,\u201d and an employer \u201ccannot obtain the protection of section 8(c) simply by labeling [such] statements \u2018opinion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Peabody Coal v. NLRB, </em>725 F.2d 357, 363 (6th Cir.1984); <em>see also NLRB v. Price\u2019s Pic-Pac Supermarkets, Inc., </em>707 F.2d 236, 240 (6th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">But that does not mean every employer\u2019s prediction of hard times (and potentially lost work for employees) flowing from unionization amounts to an impermissible threat of reprisal or retaliation. There is a difference between a prediction that unionization will hurt the company\u2019s business and a threat to retaliate against employees if they unionize. When the employer\u2019s prediction concerns a consequence over which he has no control, that by definition cannot constitute a \u201cthreat of reprisal,\u201d namely a threat of retaliation. \u201c[E]mployees may not reasonably conclude that they are being coerced where the [employer\u2019s] opinions refer to matters over which the speaker has no control.\u201d <em>Pen-tre, </em>998 F.2d at 369. What divides protected predictions from prohibited threats of reprisal, then, is whether the employer\u2019s speech contains an \u201cimplication that [the] employer may or may not take action <em>solely on his own initiative </em>for reasons unrelated to economic necessities and known only to him.\u201d <em>Gissel, </em>395 U.S. at 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>at 619, 89 S.Ct. 1918. Only a statement that \u201cconveys that the employer will act on its own initiative to punish its employees as the result of anti-union animus\u201d falls outside \u00a7 8(c)\u2019s protective scope. <em>Pentre, </em>998 F.2d at 371. As Judge Friendly and \u201cthe dictionaries tell us, a \u2018threat of reprisal\u2019 means a \u2018threat of retaliation\u2019 and this in turn means not a prediction that adverse consequences will develop but a threat that they will be deliberately inflicted in return for an injury \u2014 \u2018to return evil for evil.\u2019 \u201d <em>NLRB v. Golub Corp., </em>388 F.2d 921, 928 (2d Cir.1967). The burden rests on the <em>Board </em>to prove that \u00a7 8(c) does not protect a particular statement, <em>not </em>on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>employer to prove the opposite. <em>See Pentre, </em>998 F.2d at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Our cases consistently have stood by this rule. On the one side of the line, where an employer tells employees that the company will terminate them if they unionize, the statement receives no protection. <em>See, e.g., Dayton Newspapers, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>402 F.3d 651, 660 (6th Cir.2005); <em>Ind. Cal-Pro, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>863 F.2d 1292, 1298-99 (6th Cir.1988). On the other side of the line, where an employer expresses his view that unionizing a company or plant will lead to consequences beyond the employer\u2019s control \u2014 such as current or prospective customers\u2019 likely responses to dealing with a unionized supplier \u2014 his statements fall within \u00a7 8(c)\u2019s safe harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\"><em>Pentre </em>sharpens the distinction. Company officials gave speeches to the effect that unionization would severely undercut the company\u2019s customer base. <em>See id. </em>at 369-70. Although the company\u2019s leaders never promised plant closure or layoffs, they said that they were \u201c \u2018not prepared\u2019 to endure the hardships of rebuilding a customer base,\u201d strongly suggesting that the workers\u2019 tenure would be short-lived if the union won. <em>Id. </em>Pentre held that the statements still received protection because the speakers never said the company would retaliate for employees\u2019 exercise of their statutory rights. \u201cNot a shred of evidence indicates that [the speakers] predicted these consequences based on matters within [their] own volition or control,\u201d and the \u201crecord [was] simply devoid of any evidence that [the speakers] suggested ... they would close [the company] as a means to punish employees if they voted in favor of the union.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370. \u201cNo employee,\u201d as a result, \u201ccould reasonably have come away from [the employers\u2019 speeches] with the belief that antiunion sentiment on the part of the company could lead to closure if the employees voted in favor of the union.\u201d <em>Id.; see also NLRB v. Vemco, </em>989 F.2d 1468, 1489 (6th Cir.1993) (holding that an employer\u2019s statement that unionization would result in a work shortage resulting in reduced hours or layoffs was a permissible, objective prediction, and thus protected speech under \u00a7 8(c), where nothing suggested that the expected work shortage \u201cwas within [the employer\u2019s] control\u201d or that the employer \u201cwould implement a cutback in hours or a layoff solely on its own initiative for reasons unrelated to the economic necessity of adjusting to a shortage of work\u201d); <em>accord Be-Lo Stores v. NLRB, </em>126 F.3d 268, 285-86 (4th Cir. 1997); <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. NLRB, </em>117 F.3d 627, 633 (D.C.Cir.1997); <em>NLRB v. Vill.

Crown Cork, </em>36 F.3d at 1138-39, 1144-46 (collecting cases and cataloguing statements that, federal courts have held protected by \u00a7 8(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">This principle, it seems to me, should make short work of this case. As recounted by the employees whose testimony the ALJ credited, King told the employees at the meetings that it was their own choice whether to unionize, explained the company\u2019s sole-source relationships and just-in-time manufacturing model, expressed his \u201cexpectation\u201d that if DTR became unionized, the company\u2019s sole-source, just-in-time customers would seek other suppliers to prevent production-flow interruptions in the event of a strike, JA 275, and predicted that this would result in less work to go around at DTR and thus lead to layoffs, <em>see </em>JA 76-77 (employee agreeing that King\u2019s message was that \u201ccustomers would have to evaluate whether to keep DTR as the sole source supplier\u201d based on reliability concerns, and \u201cif the customers pulled some business away from DTR because of this fear of reliability, that would mean there would be less work and fewer jobs at DTR\u201d); JA 275 (employee agreeing that \u201cthe concern [King] expressed was about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>actions the customers might take\u201d and \u201cwhen ... [King] mentioned layoffs, the layoffs would be because customers pulled part or all of their business out of DTR and there wasn\u2019t enough work to go around\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Nothing in King\u2019s remarks amounted to a \u201cthreat of reprisal,\u201d as this court and other courts have construed the phrase. The whole point of his statements was that other factors \u2014 the decisions of clients\u2014 would cause a slowdown in business and eventually job layoffs, not that the company vindictively planned to lay off workers, whether business slowed down after unionization or not. The predicted economic consequences \u2014 a severe reduction in the company\u2019s business leading in turn to layoffs \u2014 simply did not encompass anything within DTR\u2019s control. <em>Cf. Vemco, </em>989 F.2d at 1489. That a company may be forced by a loss of business to lay off workers does not make its action a voluntary one in the sense that <em>Gissel </em>described. <em>See Crown Cork, </em>36 F.3d at 1137 (\u201cThe fact that an identifiable manager, and not an invisible hand, makes these decisions (subject to sanction by the market if he or she makes them incompetently), does not mean that they are any less \u2018economic necessities\u2019 or \u2018beyond his control\u2019 in the sense those phrases are used by <em>Gissel. \u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">But even if there were uncertainty about the guidance these cases offer, our application of these principles to the same employer, the same union and strikingly similar statements ought to suffice to resolve this ease. Fourteen years ago, we decided <em>DTR Industries, Inc. v. NLRB (DTR I), </em>39 F.3d 106 (6th Cir.1994), which involved an attempt by the same union, the UAW, to unionize the same DTR plant, <em>see id. </em>at 109. A week before the election, the company\u2019s then-president, Yuji Kobayashi, sent a letter to the plant\u2019s employees arguing that because the company\u2019s success depended heavily on its sole-source relationships with just-in-time manufacturers, unionization would seriously harm its business, possibly requiring layoffs. <em>Id. </em>Koba-yashi told the employees that DTR\u2019s \u201cbusiness would automatically be reduced if the union wins the election and our customers took away 50 percent of our sole source business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Those customers, he added, who did not turn to other suppliers would likely require DTR to produce and maintain a 90-day inventory when each collective-bargaining agreement approached its expiration \u2014 an experience that, if other companies\u2019 experience was any guide, would lead to layoffs. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The union alleged, and the Board found, that Kobayashi\u2019s letter and the other supervisors\u2019 statements amounted to unlawful threats of reprisal and thus constituted an unfair labor practice. <em>Id. </em>at 110. We disagreed. \u201cKobayashi[\u2019s] letter,\u201d we explained, \u201ctaken in context, is an objective prediction of what the petitioner\u2019s customers would do in the event the union prevailed, and thus is protected speech.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114. The letter set forth the basis for Kobayashi\u2019s prediction, explaining the company\u2019s sole-source business and the reasons customers would diversify their portfolios of suppliers, and we noted that Kobayashi \u201cwas entitled to make this statement based on his industry experience and his knowledge of [DTR\u2019s] customer base.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Board offered nothing to show that Kobayashi\u2019s statements were either untruthful or \u201csubjective\u201d as we defined that term in <em>Pentre, see </em>id.\u2014 i.e., that the statement \u201cconveys that the employer will act on its own initiative to punish employees as the result of anti-union animus,\u201d <em>Pentre, </em>998 F.2d at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Our decision in <em>DTR I </em>fully answers the questions raised by this case.- King, like Kobayashi, explained the nature of the company\u2019s sole-source business, his expec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>tations that unionization would lead the company\u2019s customers to redirect business to other suppliers and his view that this would lead to layoffs. <em>Cf. </em>39 F.3d at 109; <em>DTR Industries, Inc., </em>311 NLRB 833, 833 (1993) (reprinting portions of Kobayashi\u2019s letter). Just as we held Kobayashi\u2019s statements entitled to \u00a7 8(c)\u2019s protection, so too we should hold King\u2019s statements entitled to protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">In reaching the opposite conclusion, the majority attempts to distinguish King\u2019s and Kobayashi\u2019s statements. The language of Kobayashi\u2019s letter, it says, \u201cdid not guarantee\u201d that DTR\u2019s customers would \u201ctak[e] away 50 percent of the sole-source business.\u201d Maj. Op. at 494. But of course Kobayashi did not guarantee that unionization would cause the company to lose a specific percentage of business. How could he do that, or for that matter how could anyone do that? What matters is that he plainly promised that unionization would decrease DTR\u2019s business. \u201cBringing a union,\u201d he said, \u201cwould lose business for DTR.\u201d <em>DTR Indus., </em>311 NLRB at 833. \u201cHaving a union,\u201d he added, \u201cwill hurt our business and our chances for success. We will lose some or all of our sole source business----\u201d <em>DTR I, </em>39 F.3d at 109. The 50% loss was one way of estimating what would happen and one way of illustrating why jobs would be lost. Kobayashi, indeed, was hardly fixated on a 50% estimate, as he raised more ominous possibilities later, saying that DTR\u2019s customers might \u201ctake [the company\u2019s business] <em>all </em>away and sole source with some non-union company.\u201d <em>DTR Indus., </em>311 NLRB at 833. Viewed from the perspective of employees prone \u201cto pick up intended implications ... that might be more readily dismissed by a more disinterested ear,\u201d <em>Gissel, </em>395 U.S. at 617, 89 S.Ct. 1918, his words left no doubt that unionization would cause the company to lose a substantial amount of, if not all of, its sole-source business.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">In a similar vein, the majority insists that Kobayashi, unlike King, never \u201cexplicitly raised the spectre of DTR layoffs.\u201d Maj. Op. at 495. Yet Kobayashi\u2019s letter explicitly <em>did </em>mention layoffs. <em>See DTR Indus., </em>311 NLRB at 833. To be sure, he did not <em>guarantee </em>that layoffs would result from unionization, but neither did Kong; they both made predictions about the effect unionization would have on business and, in turn, jobs. The key point is this: <em>Gissel </em>tells us to stand in the employees\u2019 shoes when gauging the effect of Kobaya-shi\u2019s and King\u2019s words, and both permitted an employee to infer that unionization would cause a drop-off in business, which would lead to layoffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Beyond the words King and Kobayashi used, the majority argues that differences in the contexts of their statements sets them apart. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 495-96. Context no doubt can be crucial to understanding the meaning that an employer\u2019s statement carries. <em>See Ind. Cal-Pro, </em>863 F.2d at 1299. But as the Board bears the burden of proving a statement unprotected by \u00a7 8(c), <em>Pentre, </em>998 at 371, it must demonstrate why the context of King\u2019s statements made them threats of reprisal while Kobayashi\u2019s letter (and other supervisor\u2019s statements) in a nearly identical scenario did not. In trying to meet this burden, the Board noted that Kobayashi\u2019s \u201cletter explained that [his] perspective was based upon his industry experience and knowledge of [DTR\u2019s] customer base,\u201d while King\u2019s speeches did not. JA 2. But that purported distinction misreads our decision in <em>DTR I: </em>While <em>we </em>pointed out that Kobayashi\u2019s experience and knowledge \u201centitled\u201d him to make the statements in his letter, we never mentioned (much less rested our decision upon) the letter\u2019s recitation of his qualifications. <em>See DTR I, </em>39 F.3d at 114. And although we defer to the Board\u2019s interpretations of the statutes it administers, we do not give it the benefit of the doubt in interpreting <em>our </em>prece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>dents. <em>See Albertson\u2019s, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>301 F.3d 441, 448 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">But, the majority adds, Kobayashi was the company president when he wrote his letter, Maj. Op. at 495, while King served as the company\u2019s chief human-resources officer. Thus, it continues, while Kobaya-shi \u201cno doubt knew the economic condition at DTR,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 496, as his \u201cprivileged position at the company gave him industry experience and knowledge of [DTR\u2019s] customer base,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 495 (internal quotation marks omitted), there is no reason to believe that King had any similar knowledge, and thus his \u201cstatement was made without objective facts for actually believing that plants might close if employees voted in the union,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 495 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Yet \u00a7 8(c) protects \u201cthe expressing of any views, argument, or opinion,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c), and we have never suggested that these words require employers to exercise them freedom of speech only through pre-vetted economic experts or that \u00a7 8(c)\u2019s protection otherwise depends on the status of the speaker. To the contrary, we held in <em>DTR I </em>that \u00a7 8(c) protected the statements of <em>three low-level supervisors </em>who told employees that unionization would lead to a drastic loss of business from two of the company\u2019s three largest sole-source customers. <em>See </em>39 F.3d at 109,114-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Even though King was not the president of the company, I fail to understand why he lacked a sufficient basis to make his observations for an independent reason. He attended Kobayashi\u2019s presentations during the 1989 union campaign, which may explain why he spoke this time around. He observed the ensuing proceedings that culminated in <em>DTR I. </em>And he had served as the company\u2019s top human-resources officer for over a decade. Far from being in the dark about the labor-related options at DTR\u2019s disposal \u201cto deal with drop-offs in business,\u201d King would have been in an ideal position to understand and \u201cassess the viability of alternative measures\u201d to layoffs. Maj. Op. at 495 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">In condemning King\u2019s statements because he presented \u201cno objective evidence ... supporting [his] statement that unionization would result or even could result in an objectively required economic closing of the plant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 496 (internal quotation marks omitted), the majority asks more of DTR than our cases \u2014 including <em>DTR </em>I\u2014 demand. Just as King did not accompany his remarks with empirical evidence supporting his personal views and predictions, neither did Kobayashi. To construe \u00a7 8(c) as imposing on employers the burden of proving objectively the truth of every assertion they make would contravene both the language of the statute \u2014 which encompasses \u201cany views, argument, or opinion,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c) \u2014 and its purpose, <em>see Pentre, </em>998 F.2d at 371 (\u201cRequiring an employer to present, in advance and without a request from the Board, evidence to corroborate its predictions would, in our mind, defeat the integral purpose of section 8(c).\u201d). If, as the Supreme Court has said, the purpose of the statute is to foster \u201cuninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate in labor disputes\u201d through \u201cfreewheeling use of the written and spoken word,\u201d <em>Chamber of Commerce, </em>128 S.Ct. at 2414 (internal quotation marks omitted), I am hard-pressed to understand how this objective-evidence requirement is consistent with that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">At the end of the day, Kobayashi\u2019s and King\u2019s statements must stand or fall together. Either both crossed the line from protected speech to prohibited threats of reprisal, or both stayed within \u00a7 8(c)\u2019s shield. Absent a meaningful distinction between the two statements, the answer to the two cases must be the same. Neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the statements of Kobayashi, nor of his underlings nor of King amounted to \u201cthreats of reprisal,\u201d and accordingly <em>DTR II </em>should come out the same way as <em>DTR I. Pentre, </em>998 F.2d at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">What ultimately separates us in this case is the meaning of threats of \u201creprisal.\u201d As I read <em>Gissel, Pentre </em>and <em>DTR I, </em>they define the term just the way the dictionaries do \u2014 as requiring a threat to <em>punish </em>employees or to <em>retaliate </em>against them for voting for unionization, something that simply is not covered when the employer warns that unionization will cause a drop off in business and will lead to layoffs. When an employer threatens punishment or retaliation if employees vote for unionization, by contrast, he communicates that layoffs will result no matter what happens to the business \u2014 that layoffs will follow in spite of, not because of, potential declines in business. All of this, the majority says, is a \u201cfalse dichotomy.\u201d Maj. Op. at 492-93 n. 2. But why that is so is never explained, much less supported by the case law. Consistent with the case law and the plain meaning of \u201creprisal,\u201d the dichotomy is the fulcrum upon which the case turns and which the statute\u2019s text and controlling precedent put front-and-center: What matters is whether King\u2019s statements conveyed a promise or even the possibility that DTR would \u201cpunish\u201d its employees for unionizing \u2014 by laying off workers irrespective of, or beyond the extent of, the uncontrollable impact unionization would have on DTR\u2019s business. <em>Cf. Gissel, </em>395 U.S. at 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918 (holding statements unprotected \u201c[i]f there is any implication that an employer may or may not take action solely on his own initiative for reasons unrelated to economic necessities and known only to him\u201d); <em>Pentre, </em>998 F.2d at 369, 371 (explaining that a \u201cstatement is an unlawful threat\u201d if it \u201cis subjectively phrased in that it conveys that the employer will act on its own initiative to punish its employees as the result of anti-union animus\u201d). King\u2019s words, like Kobayashi\u2019s words before him, did no such thing, and the employees in attendance did not suggest otherwise. Whatever else can be said about King\u2019s remarks, they cannot be characterized as \u201cthreat[s] of reprisal,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c); <em>Gissel </em>395 U.S. at 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918. The majority seeing these issues differently, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
