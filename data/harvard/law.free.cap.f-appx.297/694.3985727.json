We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and review de novo. <em>Whitman v. Mineta, </em>541 F.3d 929, 931 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>The Association argues on appeal that the district court erred by finding no coverage in light of undisputed evidence that Faramarz Ghoddoussi\u2019s failure to investigate and repair construction defects, while he acted as the association director, caused water damage to the property. Contrary to the insurance companies\u2019 contention, the Association adequately argued this point in the district court. We agree with the Association\u2019s causation argument. The undisputed evidence establishes that Ghoddoussi\u2019s acts, as the sole officer and director of the Association, caused some of the property damage. As a result, his acts, if merely negligent, were covered under the policy. The district court\u2019s ruling to the contrary is reversed, and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b720-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
