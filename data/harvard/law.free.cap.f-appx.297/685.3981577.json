(collectively \u201cHarrah\u2019s\u201d), in Glanton\u2019s action seeking damages for tor-tious constructive discharge, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. We vacate the district court\u2019s decision and remand to the district court with instructions to remand the case to the Nevada state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Although Glanton did not contest the removal of his claims from Nevada state court to the federal district court, \u201ca court may raise the question of subject matter jurisdiction, sua sponte, at any time during the pendency of the action, even on appeal.\u201d <em>Snell v. Cleveland, Inc., </em>316 F.3d 822, 826 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">\u201cThe existence of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, and our review is de novo.\u201d <em>Nike, Inc. v. Comercial Iberica de Exclusivas Deportivas, S.A., </em>20 F.3d 987, 990 (9th Cir.1994). \u201cWe will dismiss an action on appeal if jurisdiction is lacking.\u201d <em>May Dep\u2019t Store v. Graphic Process Co., </em>637 F.2d 1211, 1216 (9th Cir.1980). The issue on appeal is not \u201cwhether the case was properly removed, but whether the federal district court would have had original jurisdiction ... had it been filed in that court\u201d at the time of judgment. <em>Rains v. Criterion Sys., Inc., </em>80 F.3d 339, 342-43 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, a district court has \u201coriginal jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d An action \u201carises under\u201d federal law when \u201cfederal law creates the cause of action.\u201d <em>Merrell Dow Pharm. Inc. v. Thompson, </em>478 U.S. 804, 808, 106 S.Ct. 3229, 92 L.Ed.2d 650 (1986). An action can also arise under federal law if the cause of action is based on state law, but \u201cnecessarily raise[s] a stated federal issue, actually disputed and substantial, which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.\u201d <em>Grable &amp; Sons Metal Prods. v. Darue Eng\u2019g &amp; Mfg., </em>545 U.S. 308, 314, 125 S.Ct. 2363, 162 L.Ed.2d 257 (2005). Because none of Glanton\u2019s claims was created by federal law, the district court may only have subject matter jurisdiction over this case if: (1) the federal issues are essential to his claims; (2) there is a substantial federal interest in resolving such issues; and (3) a federal forum may entertain the state-law claims without disturbing the balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities. <em>Id. </em>Harrah\u2019s concedes that there is no \u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction for the infliction of emotional distress claims. Thus, the only issue is whether Glanton\u2019s constructive discharge claim \u201carises under federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">The interpretation of federal law is not an \u201cessential element\u201d of Glanton\u2019s state-law claim. \u201cWhen a [state-law] claim can be supported by alternative and independent theories \u2014 one of which is a state law theory and one of which is a federal law theory \u2014 federal question jurisdiction does not attach because federal law is not a necessary element of the claim.\u201d <em>Rains, </em>80 F.3d at 346 (although plaintiff cited Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, state-law public policies cited in complaint provided alternate and independent grounds for resolving wrongful termination in violation of public policy, and so it was not necessary to litigate the federal issue); <em>Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800, 810, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Under Nevada law, a claim of constructive discharge requires, among other things, a showing of intolerable working conditions and/or a violation of Nevada public policy. <em>Dillard Dep\u2019t Stores v. Beckwith, </em>115 Nev. 372, 989 P.2d 882, 885 (1999). Although Glanton\u2019s complaint alleges violations of \u201cEPA, OSHA\u201d and \u201cfederal statutes and regulations,\u201d these violations are not the sole means of establishing intolerable working conditions or violations of Nevada public policy. Indeed, Glanton alleges violations of state statutes and regulations that prohibit the same or similar conduct as their federal counterparts and do not depend on their federal counterparts. Because there are alternative and independent theories, the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over Glanton\u2019s claims. <em>Rains, </em>80 F.3d at 345; <em>cf. Merrell, </em>478 U.S. at 814 n. 12, 106 S.Ct. 3229.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Nor is there a substantial federal interest in adjudicating Glanton\u2019s claim in a federal forum. This action was not brought to enforce EPA or OSHA regulations. Nor is the meaning of the OSHA and EPA regulations in dispute. <em>See Grable, </em>545 U.S. at 315, 125 S.Ct. 2363 (substantial federal interest when interpretation of disputed federal tax provision affected government\u2019s strong interest in prompt and certain collection of delinquent taxes). There was and is no special need for federal expertise or uniformity in adjudicating these \u201cgarden variety state\u201d actions. <em>Cf. Grable, </em>545 U.S. at 317, 125 S.Ct. 2363.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Jurisdiction in this case would also undermine \u201cCongress\u2019s intended division of labor between state and federal courts.\u201d <em>See Grable, </em>545 U.S. at 319, 125 S.Ct. 2363. Although the absence of a private federal right of action is not dispositive, it remains relevant to our assessment of the \u201csensitive judgments about congressional intent\u2019 that \u00a7 1331 requires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318, 125 S.Ct. 2363. To find jurisdiction where there is no private federal cause of action \u201cflout[s], or at least undermine[s], congressional intent.\u201d <em>Merrell, </em>478 U.S. at 812, 106 S.Ct. 3229.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">OSHA does not provide a private cause of action. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 653(b)(4); <em>Crane v. Conoco, Inc., </em>41 F.3d 547, 553 (9th Cir.1994). Indeed, OSHA creates an intra-agency mechanism by which an alleged violation can be raised by a private actor, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 657(f)(1), 660(c), suggesting that Congress did not intend for OSHA-based actions to be litigated by private actors in federal court. Because Congress did not provide a private right of action here, \u201cthe presence of the federal [statute] as an element of the state tort is not the kind of adjudication for which jurisdiction would serve congressional purposes and the federal system.\u201d <em>Merrell, </em>478 U.S. at 814, 106 S.Ct. 3229.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">VACATED and REMANDED to the district court with instructions to remand the case to the Nevada state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b711-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>by 9th Cir.
