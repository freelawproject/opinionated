After carefully reviewing the record and counsel\u2019s brief, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>We first conclude that Watkins\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable because it was within the properly calculated advisory Guidelines range and it resulted from the court\u2019s consideration of appropriate factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a). <em>See United States v. Nelson, </em>453 F.3d 1004, 1006 (8th Cir.2006) (appellate court reviews revocation sentence to determine whether it is unreasonable in relation to, inter alia, advisory Guidelines range and \u00a7 3553(a) factors); <em>United States v. Tyson, </em>413 F.3d 824, 825 (8th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (revocation sentences are reviewed for unreasonableness in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">We further conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in ordering that Watkins\u2019s revocation sentence run consecutively to his state sentences. <em>See United States v. Cotroneo, </em>89 F.3d 510, 512 (8th Cir.1996) (decision to impose consecutive or concurrent sentence upon revocation of supervised release is committed to court\u2019s sound discretion); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7331.3(f) (term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of supervised release shall be ordered to be served consecutively to any sentence of imprisonment defendant is serving).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Finally, we conclude that the district court did nothing improper in declining to recommend Watkins\u2019s placement in a medical facility. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b) (Bureau of Prisons shall designate place of prisoner\u2019s imprisonment).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-15\">.
