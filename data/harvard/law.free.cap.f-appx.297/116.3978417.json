The District Judge referred the petition to a Magistrate Judge. On September 5, 2008, Nelson petitioned this Court for a writ of mandamus, requesting an order compelling the District Court to act upon his habeas petition. On September 11, 2008, the Magistrate Judge issued a Report recommending denial of Nelson\u2019s habeas petition. On September 29, 2008, the District Court adopted the Report and denied Nelson\u2019s petition. Given that Nelson has now received the relief he seeks in his mandamus petition\u2014a ruling on his habeas petition\u2014we will deny his mandamus petition, along with his motion for appointment of counsel, as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
