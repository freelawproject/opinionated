He orally guaranteed the lathe, but the guaranty was not entered on the purchase order. After delivery he serviced the lathe without charge, as is customary in the case of a guaranteed tool, and later made a written report to the Administrator stating that the tool had been sold as a rebuilt and guaranteed machine. The judgment entered on the trial was for treble the amount of the price charged in excess of that fixed for a non-guaranteed lathe of the same age.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-16\">The point is made that the Administrator, in order to maintain the suit, must show that the sale was to a purchaser for use in trade or business; and it is complained that there was neither proof nor finding to this effect. The contention lacks merit. The complaint alleged that none of the purchases \u201cwas made for use or consumption other than in the course of trade or business.\u201d The allegation was not denied in the answer, and accordingly must be taken as admitted. Rule 8(d), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c. Neither proof nor finding is requisite in respect of uncontested issues. Aside from this, evidence introduced by appellant indicates that the sale was to a purchaser for use in the course of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-17\">Appellant argues that although there was not written guaranty, the tool was in fact guaranteed, and that the letter of the regulation should not have been applied. We think otherwise. Maximum Price Regulation No. 1, governing sales of used machine tools, establishes two general categories, namely, \u201ctools rebuilt and guaranteed\u201d and \u201ctools in other condition.\u201d Prices are fixed at a percentage of the price of the nearest equivalent machine tool and are substantially higher if the tool comes within the classification \u201crebuilt and guaranteed.\u201d Section 3(c) of the regulation painstakenly defines the term \u201crebuilt and guaranteed.\u201d Four restrictions are enumerated, numbers (3) and (4) of which provide that the term applies only to a machine tool which carries a binding written guaranty of satisfactory performance for a period of not less than 30 days from the date of shipment, and is expressly invoiced as a rebuilt machine tool or its equivalent and as having been guaranteed for satisfactory operation for 30 days. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>Neither of these requirements was met by appellant. In the absence of compliance he was not entitled to take advantage of the price permitted for rebuilt and guaranteed tools. A holding otherwise would encourage equivocation and evasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Appellant says that his good faith in the transaction should be taken into account. Good faith, however, is no't a defense to an action for damages. Lack of willfullness, coupled with the taking of practicable precautions against the occurrence of a violation, operates only to reduce damages to the amount of the overcharge. Consult \u00a7 205(e). Appellant did not plead the partial defense afforded by \u00a7 205(e) nor did he attempt to bring himself within its provisions. Cf. Bowles v. Glick Bros. Lbr. Co., 9 Cir., 146 F.2d 566, 571, 572. His claim below and here is merely that no damages at all were assessable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
