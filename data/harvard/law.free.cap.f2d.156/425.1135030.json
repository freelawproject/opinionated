The bond, executed by taxpayer as principal, and the Indemnity Company as surety, was conditioned to secure, among other things, the payment of all taxes on brandy produced by taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-16\">On December 26, 1936, taxpayer, a California corporation, was engaged in the manufacture of wines at Livermore, California. Sometime during the night of December 26-27, 1936, one Renteria, who was then employed by taxpayer as a night distiller, attached a water hose to the distilling material line in the distillery building, and turned the water into the still to wash it. He left the water on all night but neglected to open the stop line valve with the result that the water backed up into a receiving tank, which was also in the distillery, and which was partially filled with brandy.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-17\">The following morning the receiving tank was found overflowing with a mixture of brandy and water. Some diluted brandy was recovered from the tank and from the distillery material sump in the floor of the distillery. The District Court found that a total of 1619.56 proof gallons of brandy had been lost by the overflow.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-18\">The District Court also found that under \u00a7 2800 of the Internal Revenue Code <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cthe tax attached to the distilled spirits as soon as they came into existence,\u201d and that this tax \u201cbecame payable by the distillery upon their removal from the place where they were distilled,\u201d since they were not deposited in a bonded warehouse. The District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Court concluded that the 1619.56 gallons which had been lost through the overflow had been removed from the place where distilled with \u00a7 2800(b) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and entered judgment for the Government for the full amount of the tax together with penalties and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">On appeal here taxpayer argues that this judgment should be reversed because [1] there was no removal of spirits \u201cfrom the place where they were distilled,\u201d and [2] assuming there was a removal that the tax should be abated under \u00a7 2901(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Taxpayer also urges other alleged errors relating to the admission of certain testimony and exhibits, and to the weight of evidence supporting the District Court\u2019s finding on the quantity of spirits lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">As to taxpayer\u2019s first contention that because the distilled spirits were not \u201cremoved\u201d within \u00a7 2800 (b) (2),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the tax was not due and payable, both parties concede, as they must, that under \u00a7 2800(c) the tax attaches to the distilled spirits as soon as it comes into existence as such. But under taxpayer\u2019s reasoning (and assuming that the spirits were not <em>removed </em>from the distillery) the necessary conclusion is that even though the tax had attached, the tax could never be collected by the Government, because the destruction or loss of the spirits made <em>removal </em>impossible. We do not agree.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">Congress has provided for the <em>abatement </em>of the tax which has already <em>attached </em>in certain, situations but there is nothing in the law which authorizes the abatement of the tax merely because the possibility of removal of the spirits in the sense contemplated by the statute had been destroyed through loss thereof by the overflow of the tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">The Internal Revenue Code in 1936 (the year of the loss here in question) provided in \u00a7 2901(b) <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for the abatement of the tax in case of actual destruction of the spirits while <em>in </em>a bonded warehouse or <em>after </em>the time the spirits should have been drawn off and placed in a bonded warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">Section 2847, U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, Title 26,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> allows relief from the <em>assessment </em>of the tax for failure to produce eighty per cent of the distillery\u2019s capacity when it appears that <em>prior to removal </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>spirits were destroyed by accidental fire or other casualty without negligence of the distiller. Section 2901(c) provides that no tax shall be assessed if the spirits are stolen under certain circumstances, and \u00a7 2902 indicates the other narrow and sharply defined conditions under which this tax which has attached may be abated.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">It seems clear that Congress, having provided that the tax <em>attaches </em>when the spirits come into existence, and having set forth narrowly circumscribed exceptions when the tax may be abated, intended that the tax <em>may </em>be assessed and collected when the distiller does not bring himself within one of those narrow exceptions, even though the spirits may not have been \u201cremoved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">In Greenbrier Distillery Co. v. Johnson, 6 Cir., 88 F. 638, 641, Chief Justice (then Circuit Judge) Taft held that the distilled spirits tax which had already attached under Revised Statutes \u00a7 3248, now 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 2800(c),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> must be paid unless the distiller \u201ccan put his finger upon some clause which relieves him from its payment. The particularity with which Congress specifies the circumstances under which the tax can be remitted is itself significant of the legislative intention that, unless that claim of exemption from the payment of the tax comes within the particular description in some one of the remedial statutes, it shall not be allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">And in Thompson v. United States, 142 U.S. 471, 12 S.Ct. 299, 300, 35 L.Ed. 1084, the Supreme Court, also construing Revised Statutes \u00a7 3248 held that the tax could, not be voided \u201cexcept upon satisfactory proof, under section 3221 [R.S.], of destruction by fire. or other casualty.\u201d Revised Statutes \u00a7 3221, referred to in the opinion, is now \u00a7 2901(b) of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C.A.].<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-16\">In 1942, \u00a7 2901(b) was amended<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in terms which appear to have been especially designed to give relief under the circumstances of this case. The passage of this amendment would seem to be a recognition by Congress that no such relief was possible under the law as it existed in 1936. This amendment, which is specifically made prospective only in application, fortifies our conclusion that when the tax has attached Congress has defined each situation under which the tax may be abated.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-17\">Taxpayer has not brought itself within any category entitling it to relief. The spirits were never in a bonded warehouse, and there is no evidence that this overflow occurred after the time when the 'spirits should have been drawn off within \u00a7 2901 (b), or that the spirits were stored in the fortifying room.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-18\">The Government had the burden of proof to show the spirits came into existence as such within \u00a7 2800(c). But once this showing has been made the burden of showing that the tax has attached has been met and taxpayer must then bring himself within one of the abatement statutes, if he is to avoid payment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-19\">This the taxpayer has failed to do, and since no showing has been made that the distilled spirits in question were in a bonded warehouse, or that loss occurred after the time the storekeeper-gauger should have drawn them off, or while they were stored in a fortifying room, it is unnecessary to consider whether the loss was caused by \u201caccidental fire or other casualty\u201d, and equally unnecessary to decide whether or not taxpayer was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Ample evidence appears in the record to support the finding of the District Court that 1619.56 gallons of brandy was lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">The Government having sustained the burden of showing that 1619.56 gallons of brandy came into existence and that the tax attached; taxpayer having failed to show wherein it is exempt from paying the tax because of loss, and our conclusion that the questions of removal and negligence have no application, it is unnecessary to pass upon the numerous errors assigned relative to the admissions of evidence in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-12\">\u201c\u00a7 2800.
