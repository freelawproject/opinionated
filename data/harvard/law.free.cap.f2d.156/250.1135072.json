The broad tide of the application is \u201cFor Mercury -impounds as Disinfectants.\u201d The specification recites:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">\u201cThe present invention relates to new disinfectants, and more particularly to certain organic mercury compounds which are especially effective against plant pests and microorganisms with the result that they may be used for all purposes of preserving and disinfecting, for example, in the immunizing of seed grain, the prevention of mildew formation, the preservation of wood, in the preservation of glue and the like.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">It appears that claims 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9 are generic in character. The others are species claims and are, as stated, in substance, in the brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office, divisible into three groups, (1) Nos. 4, 10, and 13, specific to the use of mercury acetates; (2) claims 5, 11, and 14, specific to the use of organic mercury hydroxides, and (3) claims 6, 12, and 15, specific to the use of organic mercury chlorides.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">Inasmuch as all the generic claims were rejected, appellant was required under Patent Office rule 41 to elect one species for prosecution. He elected the mercury acetate group, that is, claims 4, 10, and 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">In consequence, none of the other species claims received consideration on their merits by the tribunals of the Patent Office. The examiner held them \u201cnot readable on the elected species,\u201d and the board held them \u201cnot entitled to examination in this case in the absence of an allowable generic claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">Generic claim 1 reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-16\">\u201c1.

This language, or phrase,- appears in all the claims and is stressed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>We deem it proper to state at this point that counsel for appellant, although present at ,the hearing before us, declined to avail himself of his right under the rules of the court to present an oral argument, either byway of a preliminary opening statement or by way of reply to the statemens and arguments made orally by the Solicitor for the Patent Office, although he was invited to do so. Further, it may be said that, he did not file, or seek to file, any reply brief to the brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office, which, of course, was filed subsequent to his.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The brief of the solicitor presents a comprehensive analysis of the involved claims based upon the disclosures of the specification and compares them in considerable detail with the showing of the references.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The brief for appellant states that the formula embraced in generic claim 1, supra, is the general formula used in the claims and that the \u201cR\u2019s represent certain designated elements or radicals.\u201d In view of this statement it is deemed unnecessary to quote the other claims here involved, since it is obvious that they stand or fall together.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In rejecting the claims (both the generic and elected species claims) the examiner cited two patents, viz.:</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Gornitz et al. 2,145,594 Jan. 31, 1939</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Callsen 2,119,701 June 7, 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Specifically, the examiner, in his statement following the appeal to the board, said: \u201cThe * * * claims stand rejected as unpatentable over Gornitz, considered with Callsen,\u201d and thereafter analyzed what-he deemed to be the pertinent features of the references.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">The board rendered two written decisions in the case, the first dated October 12, 1944. Following it appellant filed a request for reconsideration in which the board was severely criticized for its' failure to discuss as fully as counsel for appellant thought necessary certain of the issues raised before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">In a well-tempered response the board further discussed appellant\u2019s contentions, but adhered to its original conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">The board gave little attention to the Callsen patent, saying that' it was regarded as merely cumulative. It was not overruled as a reference, however, and it is discussed to some extent in the brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office. It relates to certain described mercury compounds (all the claims being product claims) which the specification states have a variety of uses, among them being (1) use for \u201cthe preservation of wood,\u201d (2) \u201cfor disinfecting purposes,\u201d (3) \u201cfor combating parasites, especially for immunizing seed grain * * which three \u00e1re uses named in appellant\u2019s specification, supra. It is conceded by appellant that it \u201cdiscloses starting materials or reactants, some of which are included in Applicant\u2019s broad class of substance's,\u201d but appellant contends that the patentee \u201cdoes not propose the use of these materials as bactericides or fungicides but on the contrary reacts them with other substances to form bactericides or fungicides in which he is interested,\u201d the brief saying further:</p>\n<p id=\"b306-14\">\u201cIn other words, he [Callsen] was totally unaware that many of his initial reactants were themselves efficient seed disinfectants so that it was unnecessary to go through the complicated reaction proposed by him in order to arrive at substances having these desirable properties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-15\">On the other hand, the brief of'the Solicitor for the Patent Office asserts (references to record pages being omitted):</p>\n<p id=\"b306-16\">\u201cThe fact of the matter is that Callsen specifically discloses * * * as a starting material or reactant, chloroethoxyethyl mercuric' hydroxide. This is the hydroxy compound which Migrdichian asserts may be obtained by the action of dilute alkalies on the <em>\u00a13 </em>\u2014 chlorethoxyethyl mercury acetate, his \u2018typical\u2019 compound * * *. The disclosure in the Callsen patent of chloroethoxyethyl mercuric hydroxide effectively refutes Migrdichian\u2019s statement * * * that such compounds are new.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-18\">\u201cThe examiner found the Callsen patent to be pertinent as showing that no invention resides in modifying the Gornitz et al. compounds so that they include a single negative substituent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>The foregoing assertion, which accords with the statement of the examiner is not answered by appellant, and we have no reason to doubt its accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">We are confronted here with questions relating to chemical compounds and formulas which are technical in character. In such cases, where the findings of the examiner are not overruled by the board and are not questioned by the applicant, as is the situation here, we accept them without question.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The Gornitz et al. patent embraces both product and method claims. The method claims, however, are for the method of <em>producing </em>the products defined in the product claims. The claims here at issue, as may be seen from generic claim 1, supra, are for the method of protecting organic materials against plant pests, etc., by <em>using </em>the product defined in the formulas.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The patent recites that it relates to seed disinfectant compositions containing certain organic derivatives of mercury, stating that it is known that certain organic mercury compounds are suitable seed disinfectants. Claim 1 of the patent reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">\u201c1. A seed disinfectant composition, comprising an organic mercury compound of the structural formula</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"215\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" width=\"481\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">wherein Y represents an acid radical taken from the class consisting of inorganic and lower fatty acids, R a trihalogenated alkyl radical, R' is a radical taken from the class consisting of hydrogen and lower alkyl radicals and R\" is a radical taken from the class consisting of hydrogen and lower saturated hydrocarbon radicals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">The brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office, after quoting the foregoing formula from the patent (references to the record pages being omitted as indicated by stars), proceeds:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">\u201cY in the patentees\u2019 formula may represent * * * the acid radical, acetoxy (OCOCHs), or halogen (chlorine, Cl, e. g.) ; in these respects Y has the same values as R2 in appellant\u2019s general formula * * *. Continuing to compare these two formulas clement by element, progressing toward the left, the next substituent is mercury (Hg) in both. Next in the patentees\u2019 formula, R may, for one thing, denote hydrogen (H) ; and to that extent it is, in its four appearances, identical with appellant\u2019s Rs, R4, Rs, and R6. The linking oxygen (O) in both formulas is the same. Upon analysis, it is thus apparent that Migrdichian\u2019s disinfecting compounds and the disinfectant compositions of the patentees, Gornitz et al., have, in large part, the same chemical construction. They differ in structure only to the extent that group Ri of Migrdichian differs from the patentees group</p>\n<p id=\"Aun\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"121\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" width=\"169\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-18\">\u201cUpon the basis of the disclosures of the application and the patent, this difference is not great. In the patent * * * R may, inter alia, be a halogenated alkyl, of which chlorethyl (CICH2CH2 \u2014 ) would be an example. Such a constituent is comprehended in Migrdichian\u2019s definition of Ri * * * as an \u2018organic group * * * containing, in addition to hydrogen, at least one negative substituent, e. g., cyanogen, thiocyanogen, halogen, alkyloxy, carbalkoxyl and the like,\u201d and the very substituent here cited as an example is included in Migrdichian\u2019s \u2018typical\u2019 compound /? \u2014 chlorethoxyethyl mercury acetate * * *. The \u2014 CH\u2014appears in the patentees\u2019 formula merely to show the linkage of the OR' (as it does in like manner in the formula of <em>a- </em>carbethoxyethyloxyethyl mercury acetate, which formula appears in example 3 on page 5 of the record); and so the patentees\u2019 formula and Migrdichian\u2019s differs only in the \u2014 OR'-\u2014substitutent where O is oxygen and R' is hydrogen (H), or an alkyl such as methyl (CHs).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-22\">\u201cMigrdichian\u2019s definition of Ri <em>in his specification </em>does not exclude such a substituent as the patentees\u2019 OR', for Migrdichian there recites * * * that his Ri group contains \u2018at least one negative substituent,\u201d which means that the Ri group may contain more than one negative substituent. Only Migrdichian\u2019s claims are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>restricted; the claims call for \u2018only one negative substituent.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The statement so quoted from the solicitor\u2019s brief follows, although expressed in somewhat different phraseology, the statement of the examiner, and its accuracy has not been challenged before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">In the brief on behalf of appellant it is asserted, the italics quoted:</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\u201cMany of the compounds used in the method claims are <em>new materials having never before been made or mentioned,.1\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Assuming that appellant used compounds consisting of new materials, etc., in the making of his ultimate product, the fact remains that he made no claim for patent-ability of a new product independently of using it.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">We are not convinced that appellant made a product different in a patentable sense from the products^ described in the prior art cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Nothing patentable over Callsen\u2019s ultimate product is found in appellant\u2019s ultimate product.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">The Gornitz et al. patent discloses throughout that the product was developed to be used for the prevention of ravages by insects upon seeds. It did not claim its use for the purpose developed, supposedly for the reason that every person possessing ordinary intelligence, even if not \u201cskilled in the art\u201d of immunizing seed, would understand the purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">Owing to the fact that appellant\u2019s product does not differ patentably from those disclosed by the prior art, and as the prior art teaches that products of the general type as that defined by the appealed claims are useful in \u201cprotecting organic materials [such as seeds] subject to attack by plant pests and microorganisms,\u201d the claims on appeal, which define no particular method of treatment, are clearly not patentable over the references of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b308-14\">BLAND, Associate Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aaq\">(specially concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-15\">I agree that, in view of the product being old or so similar to other products in the prior art as to suggest its use as a disinfectant, appellant is not entitled to a patent for a method of protecting organic materials with the use of his stated materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-17\">I concur specially because it is settled law that one may have a patent for a method of treating plant life with an old substance, or even a patented substance (subject, of course, to the patent), if its application as a disinfectant was new, unobvious, and useful. Since the majority opinion does not clearly so state and since the latter part of the opinion is so limited in its discussion of the differences between the inventor of a product and the inventor of a process as not to distinctly differentiate between the disinfectant product and the process of using it I feel called upon to cite and discuss the authorities mentioned below.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-18\">It is not sufficient to say, in answer to the claim of a discoverer of a new method of using an old product, that a patentee of a product is entitled to all of its uses and that the public is entitled to all unknown uses of a non-patented product. To that effect, I think the holding in Re Thuau, 135 F.2d 344, 346, 30 C.C.P.A., Patents, 979, should be modified. The following portion of the Thuau case is, in my view, \u2022 repugnant to settled law on the question:</p>\n<p id=\"b308-19\">\u201cIt is our opinion that not only is the weight of authority contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, but that it is clearly contrary to the spirit, and in our opinion contrary to the letter of the patent laws that patents should be granted for old compositions of matter based upon new uses of such compositions where such uses consist merely in the employment of such compositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-20\">\n<em>*</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-21\">\u201cThe doctrine is so familiar as not to require citation of authority that a patentee is entitled to every use of which his invention is susceptible, whether such use be known of unknown to him. Likewise, with regard to an unpatentable article or substance long in use, any member of the public has the right to every use of which the article or substance is susceptible so long as it is unchanged in any way, regardless of whether or not such uses were known prior to his own use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Of course, any patentee is entitled to every use of his material. This does not prevent another from getting a patent upon the use of the patentee\u2019s particular material as a disinfectant if that use was not obvious and was foreign from its known use. The new inventor, however, could only practice his invention with the consent of the patentee, but with such consent he could prevent others from using it as a disinfectant and on the expiration of the article patent he would have a monopoly on its use as a disinfectant.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">The latter part of the majority opinion implies, I think, that one cannot get a method patent for the use of an old compound as a disinfectant. This portion of the opinion would seem to suggest that unless he was the inventor of the compound he is not entitled to a patent for a method of its use in immunizing seeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">While the opinion does not cite the Thuau case, the Solicitor for the Patent Office has quoted abundantly from it in his brief and states:</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\u201cInvolved in the issues presented by the present appeal is the question whether application of the doctrine of In re Thuau, supra, can be avoided by calling the use of an old compound a process, and expressing that use in claims drawn in broad method form. Single step method claims of the same character as those here appealed have previously been before this Court as in Re Christensen, 82 F.2d 715, 23 C.C.P.A. [Patents] 1015, 468 O.G. 277; and In re Jones, 120 F.2d 1019, 28 C.C.P.A. [Patents] 1302, 533 O.G. 1052, but the Court apparently has not heretofore had reason to pass upon the question which this appeal raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\"><em>\u201cThe Board has several times ruled that where invention is involved in the discovery of the asserted new use of an old coma-pound, that new use may be protected by a process patent. </em>Ex parte Chamberlain, 2 U.S.P.Q. 145; Ex parte Kurtz, 15 U.S.P.Q. 149; Ex parte Bosland, 44 U.S.P.Q. 695. Conversely, where the new use is obvious, such protection should be denied. The use of the compounds here claimed by Migrdichian for, generally, treating organic materials, and, specifically, immunizing seed, is an obvious use.\u201d [Some italics mine.]</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">It would seem from the foregoing that the Solicitor, in view of the authorities cited, is of the opinion that a new use of an old compound may be protected by a process patent if its use was not obvious, and apparently he is inviting comment upon the Thuau case and does not urge its soundness.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">I think the majority, while in effect applying the doctrine of the Thuau case, should frankly discuss it and rely upon it if they are of the opinion that it is controlling in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">I shall briefly analyze the authorities cited, supra, by the Solicitor and other authorities relating to the question as to the propriety of granting method claims in a patent for a new, unobvious and useful purpose of an old compound, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">Ex parte Chamberlain, 2 U.S.P.Q. 145, involved a method of pickling metals. It was found that the pickling bath itself, containing the particular proposed reagent, was not anticipated by the prior art, and the examiner was of the opinion that the bath could be allowed as a new pickling bath. Under these circumstances, the Board of Appeals said:</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">\u201c* * * we believe it is equally true that a new process is involved in applying it [the bath]. Such process should include the positive step of immersing metal in the bath containing the essential identified ingredients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">Ex parte Kurtz, 15 U.S.P.Q. 149, involved a method of securing rubber to metal. The general steps of the process were old. The board held applicant\u2019s material was not the same as that of the prior art references and stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b309-15\">\u201cPatents are frequently granted and sustained for improved processes wherein the improvement resides solely in the substitution of a material not known to be an equivalent. The case of Tolfree v. Wetzler [3 Cir.] 25 F.2d 553 is illustrative. * * * Their equivalency may be apparent after appellant\u2019s teaching but their availability is in no way suggested by any cited art.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The case cited by the board, Tolfree v. Wetzler et al., 3 Cir., 25 F.2d 553, involved a method of stopping leaks. An old composition, gambier (extract from certain trees or shrubs), which \u201chad been used for years in the tanning art and in other ways\u201d and whose \u201cqualities were known\u201d was used in suspension in water' to stop leaks. Such use was held to be invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Ex parte Bosland, 44 U.S.P.Q. 695, involved the method of sizing cellulose textile materials. The prior art showed a similar composition used for an entirely different purpose. In its decision the board stated, \u201cAssuming the composition per se to be old, this case involves the protection of a new use thereof,\u201d and allowed the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Ex parte Bosland, 44 U.S.P.Q. 696, a companion case of the Bosland case, supra, is even stronger in its statement of the well settled rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The following statement from Corpus Juris (48 C. J. <em>77) </em>summarizes the law on this point:</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u201c[\u00a7 84] 17. Application to New Use. The application of an old method or device to a similar or analogous subject with no change in the manner of applying it and no result substantially distinct in its nature is not invention. This is true, even if the new form of result has not before been contemplated, and regardless of how remote the new use may be from the old if no changes or modifications in the old device are necessary to adapt it to the new use. Invention is not involved in the mere conception of applying an oldjmethod or device to a new use. Even though changes or modifications are essential to the practical application of the method or device to the new use, invention is not involved if the new use is so analogous to the old that the thought of adapting the device and applying it to the new use would occur to a person skilled in the art and seeking to devise means to perform the desired function. The adaptation of the new device does not constitute invention, even though advantages not otherwise procurable are attained. <em>On the other hand, invention is involved where the new use is so remote from that to which the method or device has been applied, or for which it was conceived, that the thought of making the necessary modifications and changes and applying it to the new use would not occur to a person skilled in the art and seeking means by which the desired function could be performed. </em>It is immaterial. that once given the thought of applying the old method or device to the new use, the changes or modifications necessary to make the thought practical are obvious.\u201d [Italics added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">From Walker on Patents, Deller\u2019s Edition, Volume One, pages 226 et seq., the following statements are quoted:</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">\u201cIt is not invention to use an old process for a new and analogous purpose. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">\u201cAn old composition of matter applied to a new and analogous use does not involve invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">\u201cIt may be invention, to use an old process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or design, for a new and non-analogous purpose. (Potts v. Creager, 155 U.S. 597, 608 [15 S.Ct. 194, 39 L.Ed. 275]; etc., etc.)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">The courts have held that, while gravity is a simple, well understood force, a novel application of it to increase utility in an existing machine may be invention of a high order. (Eibel Process Co. v. Minnesota [&amp; Ontario] Paper Co., 261 U.S. 45, [43 S.Ct. 322, 67 L.Ed. 523].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">It should be noted that all of the appealed claims involved in the instant case are method claims and that the latter part of the majority opinion stresses the fact that appellant was not the inventor of the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-15\">I agree that in the instant case the appellant, in his claims, defines an obvious use of an old compound, or one so closely related to the old one that its use as a disinfectant would be obvious, and he is not entitled to the allowance of his claims.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
