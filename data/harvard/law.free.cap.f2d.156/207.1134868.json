Villaneuva and those claiming under him caused Deval to be driven or ejected from these lands on or about the year 1828. By deed dated January 1, 1811 and registered August 27, 1811 in Book \u201cE\u201d, folio 21, of the Conveyance Records of the Parish of .Terrebonne, Villaneuva conveyed the land to Pierre Dennis de la Ronde, the consideration therefor being a b\u00e9t \u2019 on a lottery. Pierre Dennis de la Ronde conveyed the lands to Joseph M. Ducros, from whom the defendants claimed their title through mesne conveyances.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Complainants in August -or September, 1937, applied to the 'General Land Office, Department of Interior, to make \u25a0 a survey of the lands covered by Deval\u2019s Claim No. 595, and to have a patent issued therefor in his name and for the benefit of his heirs and legal representatives. However, on December 21, 1937, the General Land Office issued a patent, No. 1094750 in favor of Thomas Villaneuva, his heirs and assigns, recognizing his claim No. 115 as having been confirmed by the Act of April 12, 1814, and that the claim had been regularly surveyed and designated as Sections \u25a0eighty-one and ninety-three in Township fifteen, south of Range sixteen east of the Louisiana Meridian, Louisiana^ containing six hundred seventy-six acres and sixty-nine hundredths of an acre, according to the official plat of Survey of the Lands on file in the General Land Office, approved September 30, 1856. This patent was recorded in the Conveyance Records of the Parish of Terrebonne.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">\u25a0Complainants waive in these proceedings any claim to any portion of the lands to which they may be entitled under Deval\u2019s claim and which have been heretofore conveyed to the United States or to any agency thereof, and particularly that portion conveyed by J. Boyd Ewing to the Rural Resettlement Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The hill sets up the maimer in which the complainants claim to have inherited from Deval. Deval died in the year 1845.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The State of Louisiana, through the Louisiana Highway Commission, claims an adverse title to complainants in certain parcels of land embraced within Deval\u2019s claim No. 595, but complainants do not ask the State to be made a party defendant, and they reserve such right as they may have against the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The prayer of the complaint is for a decree that defendants and each of them have no estate or interest whatever in the lands in question and that they be enjoined and restrained from asserting any claim whatsoever to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The decree of the District Court dismissed complainants\u2019 suit on a motion which set forth that \u201cit is apparent on the face of the complaint that the defense of laches is well founded,\u201d and \u201cit is further apparent on the face of the complaint that the State of Louisiana is a necessary and indispensable party and cannot be brought before the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">It has been difficult to marshal the facts from the bill of complaint in a short and concise manner. It can best be summarized in this wise: Deval asserted claims to the lands by reason of action taken in 1802, when the Spanish government owned and controlled what was afterwards known as the Louisiana Purchase. His claims consisted of two claims, No. 469 and No: 595, whereas Villaneuva, the defendants\u2019 ancestor, rested his claim on action taken in <em>1802, </em>which may have <em>been </em>prior in point of time to Deval\u2019s claim, since the Villaneuva claim was No. 115. Moreover, Villaneuva\u2019s claim was recognized by the Register as having been confirmed to him under the Act of April 12, 1814, by certificate dated August 11, 1828. It is manifest that the Government passed title by the enactment o'f the Congress of April 12, 1814 to Villaneuva, and the patent which was issued to him in the year 1937 was only documentary evidence of his title.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">\u201cIn the Legislation of Congress a patent has a double operation. It is a conveyance by the Government when the Government has any interest to convey, but where it is issued upon the confirmation of a claim of a previously existing title it is documentary evidence, having the dignity of a record, of the existence of that title, or of such equities respecting the claim as justify its recognition and confirmation.\u201d Langdeau v. Hanes, 21, Wall. 521, 529, 88 U.S. 521, 529, 22 L.Ed. 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">The many enactments of Congress which were passed under and by authority of Sec. 3 of Article IV of the Federal Constitution will disclose, in some sort, the task which was before this Government in an effort to establish and fix title to these lands. These Acts date from March 28, 1804 to May 20, 1836, and comprise a long line of enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">The fraud which is alleged was certainly known by Deval at the time he was driven from the lands, and which was sometime about the year 1828. lie thereafter, so far as the record discloses, made no effort to have his alleged claim tested and set at rest. Long acquiescence and laches by parties out of possession are productive of much hardship and injustice to others and cannot be excused except by showing some actual hindrance or impediment caused by the fraud of the party in possession, and no such showing is made here.
