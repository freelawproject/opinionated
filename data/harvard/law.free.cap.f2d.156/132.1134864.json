We agree with Elizabeth Arden Sales Corporation v. Gus Blass Co., 8 Cir., 150 F.2d 988, <em>991-993, </em>certiorari denied 66 S.Ct. 231<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in rejecting petitioners\u2019 contention that \u00a7 2(e) is unconstitutional because of the omission of the words \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d (i.e., interstate commerce), found in the other subsections of \u00a7 2. The fact that the purpose of Congress in enacting the Robinson-Patman Price Discrimination Act was patently to exercise its well-recognized constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce, and the clear interrelation of (d) and (e), serve to show that the omission was inadvertent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a statute should be read in such a way as to carry out the Congressional intention, despite a contrary literal meaning, especially in, order to avoid unconstitutionality.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-23\">2. We 'reject the contention that the standard in \u00a7 2(e) is so indefinite that men of common intelligence cannot adequately grasp its meaning and that therefore it is invalid as an improper delegation of legislative power and violative of due process. We have read portions of peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>tioners\u2019 brief in the Blass Company case which show that they experienced no difficulty in giving the standard a clear meaning. Aside from that, subsection (e) fully conforms to the doctrines as to delegation and due process enunciated in many recent decisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\">3. We also reject petitioners\u2019 contention that subsection (e) must be construed to mean that the furnishing of services and facilities is unlawful only when\u2014 as expressly provided in subsection (a)\u2014 the Commission finds that the practice has had an adverse effect upon competition. Congress / validly made the decision that conduct coming within the more definite standard of (e) was unlawful. We see no reason why the limitations contained in (a), or their equivalent, should be read into (c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">4. Petitioners ask us, in any event, to modify the provision of the Commission\u2019s order which makes it applicable to \u201cother retail purchasers who in fact resell such products in competition with retailers who receive such services.\u201d Petitioners assert that \u201cArden does not sell any of its products to wholesalers who in turn sell them to retailers.\u201d But the evidence shows that petitioners have, before 1941, sold to retailers directly and also indirectly through wholesalers or jobbers, and have discriminated in favor of some indirect purchasers and against some competitive retailers who made direct purchases, although furnishing some demonstrator services to other direct purchasers. The order appropriately prevents a resumption of that practice. Petitioners express an apprehension that it may compel them to accord demonstrator services \u201con proportionately equal terms\u201d to retail stores which acquire Arden products from so-called \u201cbootleg sources.\u201d As that question did not arise in the proceedings before the Commission, we construe the order as not intended to cover it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Petition for. review dismissed; enforcement of the Commission\u2019s order granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-9\"> Cf.
