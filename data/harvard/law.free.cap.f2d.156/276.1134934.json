Due regard must be given to the opportunity of the trial Court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-18\">The law has been well settled in the State of Mississippi that it is the non-delegable duty of the master to furnish a sufficient number of servants to perform the services required of them where a servant is employed to act in concert with others, and that if injury proximately results from a negligent failure so to do, the master is liable. See Natural Gas Engineering Corporation v. Bazor, Miss., 137 So. 788; Everett Hardware Co. v. Shaw, 178 Miss. 476, 172 So. 337; Jefferson v. Denkmann Lumber Co., 167 Miss. 246, 148 So. 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-19\">Whether or not the plaintiff\u2019s negligence was the sole proximate cause of the injury in this case is a question of fact which was resolved by the trial Judge against appellant with substantial evidence to support his conclusion. Our judgment should not be substituted for his.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-20\">The plaintiff assumes the ordinary risks such as are inherent in the work which he accepts employment to do, but he does not assume the risk of his master\u2019s negligence, nor the risks that arise from the failure of the master to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances for his safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-21\">The Court below held as a matter of fact that the defendant was guilty of negligence in failing to furnish the plaintiff with sufficient help to do the work which he was commanded to do, and the over-estimation of his strength by the plaintiff in attempting to lift too heavy an object would amount merely to contributory negligence which, under the law of Mississippi, would not defeat recovery but would go only toward the reduction of damages. Under the facts so found we agree with the conclusions reached by the trial Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>The proportion of the negligence contributed by the plaintiff to the total negligence presents a question of fact in this case, of which we are not the triers. We cannot say that the judgment of the lower Court is clearly erroneous either as to the facts in evidence or as to the legal conclusions applied to those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">We have considered all of the specifications of error argued by the appellant and haveN concluded that the judgment of the lower Court is without reversible error, and it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
