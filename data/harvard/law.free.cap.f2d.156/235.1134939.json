Pratt created a trust for a term measured by the lives of two individuals and the survivor of them. The trust income was to be paid to the settlor during his life and upon the termination of the trust the corpus was to be paid to him, if living, and, if not, to others. He died in 1939 before the end of the trust term. The corpus of the trust was included in the settlor\u2019s estate as a transfer \u201cintended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death\u201d within the meaning of section 811(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 811(c). The petitioners contend that the application of the section to a trust created before the enactment of a statute imposing an estate tax is unconstitutional. Concededly a decision in their favor requires us to overrule Commissioner v. Flanders, 2 Cir., 111 F.2d 117. The rule we there laid down for valuing the settlor\u2019s interest in the trust property was shown to have been too favorable to the taxpayer in Commissioner v. Estate of Field, 324 U.S. 113, 65 S.Ct. 511, 89 L.Ed. 786, 159 A.L.R. 230. But we find nothing in the Supreme Court cases nor in the petitioners\u2019 able argument to convince us that the Flanders decision was wrong with respect to the constitutional point. On the authority of the Flanders case, the decision is affirmed. See also Matter of Pratt\u2019s Estate, 262 App.Div. 240, 28 N.Y.S.2d 997, affirmed 289 N.Y. 621, 43 N.E.2d 839.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
