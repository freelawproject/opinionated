The jurisdictional claim was that the suit was one arising under the constitution and laws of the United States, to-wit, under Revised Statutes 3709, 41 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The claim on the merits was that, having bid 24.87$ per cubic yard as against plaintiff\u2019s bid of 36.20$, Jones &amp; Gillis, on the plea of typographical error, was allowed by defendant to correct its bid to 34.87^ and receive the award of the contract, whereas the defendant should have either awarded the contract to plaintiff or rejected both bids and readvertised.</p>\n<p id=\"ABP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>The defenses on jurisdiction were: .(1) That' the statute, enacted for the benefit of the United States, conferred no rights on bidders, and the suit was therefore not one arising under the Constitution and laws; and (2) that the suit was against thejlnit\u00e9d States. On the merits the defenses were: (1) That the invoked statute conferred no rights on bidders; and (2) that if it did, plaintiff, the admittedly high bidder, had no'standing under.it. The district judge, of the opinion that the juris'dictional points were well taken, dismissed the suit for want of jurisdiction, and plaintiff has \u00e1ppealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">On oral argument it was admitted that'the contract had been awarded, a large part of it had been, and the whole would .soon, be) completed, and the claim was advanced, that the. controversy had become moot. It does appear that little of substance remains in the case. In view, however, of the fact that the petition prayed not merely that the award of the contract but further performance under it be restrained, we think the controversy is not wholly moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">Whatever we might have thought before Gully v. First National Bank, 299 U.S. 109, 57 S.Ct. 96, 97, 81 L.Ed. 70, the doctrine of that case compels us to conclude that plaintiff\u2019s suit' is not one arising under the constitution and laws. For a suit to so arise it is not sufficient that a statute be invoked as the basis of a claim. \u201cTo bring a case within the statute, a right or immunity created by the Constitution \u00a1or laws of the United States must be an element, and an essential one, of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.\u201d Gully v. First National Bank, supra; Cf. Calhoun County v. Roberts, 5 Cir., 137 F.2d 130; Cook v. United States, 5 Cir., 115 F.2d 463; International Trading Corporation v. Edison, 71 App.D.C. 210, 109 F.2d 825; Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U.S. 113, 60 S. Ct, 869, 876, 84 L.Ed. 1108. The invoked statpte was not enacted to, it does not, confe-r.jrights on bidders. Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., supra, thus \u2022 states its purpose and effect:.,</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">\u201cSection 3709 of the Revised Statutes requires for the Government\u2019s benefit that its\u2019 contracts be made after public advertising. It was not enacted for the protection of sellers and confers no enforceable rights upon prospective bidders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">An examination of the statute in question in the- light of this construction of it \u2022leaves us in no doubt that plaintiff\u2019s suit does not jurisdictionally arise under it, \u00a1and .that, the requisite diversity lacking, the suit \u25a0 was properly dismissed. In addition, the suit having for its purpose to compel the officers of the government to take affirmative action affecting the government under a statute enacted for the benefit of the government and not of plaintiff and persons in like 'case with it, We think the suit was a suit against the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For that' reason also, it should have been dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-12\">But if there was jurisdiction, the judgment of dismissal should still stand. For on the merits appellant\u2019s case is no better. The high bidder, and therefore without right to \u00e1n award in its favor, nothing in the statute supports its claimed right to demand the rejection of all bids. Certainly nothing supports its claim as high bidder to have the award made to it. The authorities appellant relies on do not support it. United States v. Brookridge Farm, 10 Cir., 111 F.2d 461 was a suit brought under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 41(20), for damages for breach of contract. Noce v. Edward E. Morgan Co., 8 Cir., 106 F.2d 746, while a suit for injunction, was, as the opinion shows, a very different kind of suit from that brought here. There the injunction was brought -not to compel the United States to take affirmative action with respect to others than plaintiff, but to prevent an officer from following an unlawful and unauthorized course; affirmatively directed against the -plaintiff.- Here the officer sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>be restrained is taking no affirmative action against, is requiring nothing of, plaintiff. Plaintiff\u2019s suit is one to compel him to take affirmative action as an officer of the United States with respect to matters as to which plaintiff is without standing to sue. The appeal is without merit. The judgment of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-13\"> \u201cAll purchases and contracts for supplies or services, in any of the departments of the Government, except for personal services, shall be made by advertising a sufficient time previously for proposals respecting the same, when the public exigencies do not require the immediate delivery of the articles, or performanee of the service.
