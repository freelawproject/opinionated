A memorandum of my conclusions had previously been filed with the clerk of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">The city desires to review this order by certiorari, and applies to me as the Supreme Court justice assigned to Essex county for a writ to review my order of October 26th. Some doubt is intimated as to whether the justice who by the statute is specially endowed with jurisdiction to order and supervise the investigation upon the application of twentv-fivo free<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>holders, is qualified to pass on applications for <em>certiorari </em>of his own orders in the matter. But my present view is that he is so qualified. <em>Certiorari </em>seems to be accredited as the remedy. <em>Park Ridge </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>73 <em>N. J. L. </em>116; 74 <em>Id. </em>449; <em>Hoboken </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>74 <em>Id. </em>57; <em>In re North Bergen, </em>91 <em>Id. </em>19; <em>North Bergen </em>v. <em>Gough, </em>107 <em>Id. </em>424; <em>In re Newark, </em>118 <em>Id. </em>533. In this last case I heard and refused an application for <em>certiorari </em>of an order in this very proceeding, and further application was made to the court <em>in banc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Taking up the merits of the present application: the propriety of the awards made was fully argued before me on October 23d last, and decided October 26th, by an order based on the memorandum above mentioned, on file as already noted. No new considerations are presented on this present application. The awards made herein seem quite in line with those made in the North Bergen matter, <em>supra, </em>and in a New Brunswick investigation in 1934, in each of which cases a copy of the order is before me. <em>Allocatur </em>of a <em>certiorari </em>is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
