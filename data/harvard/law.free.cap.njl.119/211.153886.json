L. </em>1927, <em>p. </em>570, \u00a7 7, which was amended in 1932. <em>Pamph. L., p. </em>573. The ground of the denial was that the statute gives the right to the widow of a male employe but not to a widower of a female employe. The original section 7 reads in part: \u201cThe widow of any sheriff\u2019s employe * * * shall receive a pension so long as <em>she </em>shall remain unmarried,\u201d &amp;c. The section as amended in 1932 merely adds: \u201cor in case there be no widow, his minor child or children until each reaches the age of sixteen years,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">The court is aslied to say that the word \u201cwidow\u201d was intended by the legislature to include \u201cwidower.\u201d We think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the language and the context plainly bar any such construction. The word itself, in common and universal usage, connotes a female. The statute speaks of an employe who loses <em>his </em>life in the performance of <em>his </em>duty; and the pension goes to the widow so long as <em>she </em>shall remain unmarried. It would be a strange application of the statute to say that if a surviving husband, assumed to be entitled, should remarry, he should lose the pension because of having assumed the burden of supporting a second wife; but that would necessarily follow if prosecutor is right in this claim. We are not here concerned with the clause relating to minor children as it does not appear that there are any; and hence deem the reasoning in <em>Ghesquier </em>v. <em>Fire, &amp;c. </em>117 <em>N. J. L. </em>327, inapplicable. We are not unmindful of section 9 of \u201cAn act relative to statutes <em>(Comp. </em>Stat., <em>p. </em>4972) and are of the opinion that the context is \u201crepugnant to the construction\u201d provided in the purview of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The writ will be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
