The writ was improvidently allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">The prosecutor\u2019s remedy is either in ejectment or in the Court of Chancery. See <em>Van Schaick </em>v. <em>Riparian Commissioners, </em>82 <em>N. J. L. </em>219. It is either entitled to the lands which it claims to be affected by the lease or it is not. If it is entitled to these lands nothing the city did can affect its remedy. If the city was not entitled to a riparian grant that question can also be determined in the Court of Chancery. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number><em>Harz </em>v. <em>Board of Navigation, </em>119 <em>N.
