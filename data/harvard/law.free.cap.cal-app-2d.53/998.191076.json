No. Under all but the most limited circumstances, credibility of witnesses is a question of fact to be resolved by the jury. Here, the court invaded that province and exceeded the discretion granted under the code. Because the error was prejudicial, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AMK\">I. <em>The Dispute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">This suit revolved around the acquisition of a business known as Dynatex. David Vorse<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sued Lewis Sarasy, alleging various causes of action in tort and in contract stemming from Sarasy\u2019s purchase of Dynatex.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complaint alleged that Vorse, Sarasy, and nonparty Donald Schmidt formed a partnership for the purpose of engaging in various business enterprises. The three subsequently decided to acquire Dynatex, with each partner acquiring an ownership interest. When Sarasy alone acquired Dynatex, Vorse sued for damages flowing from Sarasy\u2019s failure to acquire Dynatex on behalf of the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Sarasy defended, arguing there was no agreement to jointly acquire Dynatex. Instead, Sarasy claimed the three men agreed only to broker Dynatex to a third party and to divide any resulting commissions. Sarasy presented evidence that they worked with a potential purchaser, Winfield Polytek, to raise funds for the acquisition. When the deal with Polytek failed, the three tried unsuccessfully to find other buyers. Ultimately, Sarasy purchased Dynatex with his own assets. The central issue at trial was whether Vorse, Sarasy, and Schmidt orally agreed to acquire and share in the equity of Dynatex.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">On December 31, 1991, after Vorse had filed suit but before trial, Schmidt signed a declaration faxed to him by Vorse\u2019s attorneys. The declaration, filed in connection with a discovery dispute, supported Vorse\u2019s interpretation of the partnership agreement: \u201cDavid Vorse, Lewis Sarasy and I formed an oral partnership ... in 1989 to engage in certain business ventures. One of these ventures was the acquisition of a high-tech company by the name of Dynatex Corporation ... by the partnership. The partnership planned to form a corporation ... in order to acquire the assets of Dynatex. Pursuant to our oral agreement, the partners were to be the shareholders in [the corporation].\u201d According to the declaration, the law firm of Miller, Starr &amp; Regalia was retained to complete the purchase on the partnership\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Schmidt was deposed in late 1994, three years after he had signed the declaration. In marked contrast to that document, Schmidt claimed there had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>been <em>no </em>partnership agreement to acquire the assets of Dynatex and that he never believed Miller, Starr &amp; Regalia represented him with regard to any such acquisition. Schmidt failed to produce certain documents concerning the dispute. He asserted attorney-client privilege in response to questions about his alleged attempts to engage counsel to sue Sarasy independently or with Vorse.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">At deposition, Schmidt acknowledged signing a declaration faxed to him by Vorse\u2019s attorneys in December 1991. However, he claimed he had just moved to Florida, \u201cthings were very chaotic,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t recall reading it . . . .\u201d As to the body of the declaration, Schmidt claimed, \u201cNone of this verbiage is something I wrote or said. It\u2019s language more akin to what David Vorse would write or say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">More importantly, Schmidt claimed the substance of the declaration \u201cis not fact\u201d and \u201cis totally contrary, not just what I think it is now versus what I thought it was then, but to the facts as they really happened.\u201d In a second declaration, signed the day after his deposition, Schmidt said: \u201cMr. Vorse suggested that I could prevent the [Sarasy/Dynatex] transaction from closing by claiming to be a Sarasy partner excluded from the deal, although the three of us had never had any agreement about our respective ownership interests, if any, in any acquiring entity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Regarding Dynatex itself, Schmidt claimed in his deposition, \u201cYes, we were going to try to acquire the assets of Dynatex but it wasn\u2019t necessarily the three of us. . . .\u201d Asked whether he expected any compensation after Sarasy acquired Dynatex by himself, Schmidt replied: \u201c. . . I felt it would have been very nice had Sarasy reimbursed me at least my expenses, which at that point were quite substantial, and something for my time and effort during those months when I was endeavoring to raise financing and, in fact, did raise an offer, period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Finally, in a third declaration signed November 9, 1994, Schmidt explained that since December 1991 he had come to realize that \u201c. . . Mr. Vorse had made substantial misrepresentations with regard to his role in the Dynatex transaction, had lied to me repeatedly over the years, had been abusing my friendship and trust, and was manipulating me with respect to whether or not Mr. Sarasy had done anything to warrant a lawsuit. ... In addition, Mr. Vorse has candidly acknowledged that he, Mr. Sarasy and I did not have a partnership with respect to the Dynatex matter, but that this \u2018could be worked out\u2019 with respect to a lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>II. <em>The Referee\u2019s Report</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">On December 27, 1994, a week before the scheduled trial date, a discovery referee issued a lengthy report to the trial court. The report concerned plaintiff\u2019s motion to compel Schmidt to answer questions and produce documents being withheld on the ground of attorney-client privilege, and Schmidt\u2019s motion for a protective order to limit the length of his deposition. In the motion to compel, plaintiff put Schmidt\u2019s credibility at issue by arguing that the attorney-client privilege should not apply when \u201cthe perjury of a witness in a civil proceeding can only be revealed through the disclosure of an attorney-client communication.\u201d Although the referee rejected this argument, the report included a finding that Schmidt, \u201chas intentionally decided with conscious disregard for both his past statements to others besides David Vorse and for his 1991 declaration (filed with this Court in 1992) to now present a totally contradictory version of what occurred before and after this litigation was commenced. This has occurred in at least two forms; Schmidt\u2019s November 4, 1994, declaration and his recent deposition testimony. I do not know which of Mr. Schmidt\u2019s versions of the past is truthful, but I find, based on abundant evidence in the form of documentary evidence, as well as Schmidt\u2019s own words, deeds, and convenient lapses of memory, that Mr. Schmidt is not a trustworthy witness.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Relying primarily on the referee\u2019s condemnation of Schmidt, plaintiff moved to exclude Schmidt as a trial witness but, at the same time, to introduce Schmidt\u2019s 1991 declaration into evidence. The court denied the motion, expressly permitting Schmidt to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">III. <em>The Trial Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">During plaintiff\u2019s case-in-chief, with no objection from Sarasy, Schmidt\u2019s 1991 declaration was admitted into evidence. The court instructed the jury: \u201cA declaration under oath again is given under penalty of perjury. If it\u2019s introduced into evidence, it\u2019s as if the person testified to that.\u201d The jury was shown an enlarged copy of the declaration while counsel read the text aloud. In cross-examining Sarasy, counsel suggested Sarasy had subsequently \u201cprevailed upon\u201d Schmidt to change his 1991 testimony only because Vorse had since died and could no longer defend his own position.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Sarasy called Schmidt to testify for the defense. According to Schmidt, in April of 1989, he, Sarasy, and Vorse began to help Winfield Polytek raise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>funds to purchase Dynatex. The three men orally agreed that, if Polytek completed the purchase, they would take their commission in stock, divided equally among themselves. Polytek withdrew in the summer of 1989, and the three agreed to look for another buyer. While they discussed different ideas about compensation for these efforts, they did not reach any formalized understanding on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In late 1989, after a deal with another potential purchaser failed, Sarasy, Schmidt, and Vorse discussed whether Sarasy himself would purchase Dynatex. The three discussed, but reached no agreement upon, their respective participation if Sarasy were to buy the company with his own assets. Schmidt understood he would not share in any commission if Sarasy made the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Schmidt testified Vorse called him in March 1990 to report that \u201cSarasy had gone into contract for the acquisition of Dynatex . . . and that we needed to do something about it.\u201d The court sustained an objection to any further questions on direct examination about what Vorse and Schmidt may have discussed about suing Sarasy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Sarasy\u2019s counsel turned to questioning Schmidt about the faxed 1991 declaration, exhibit 143. By December of 1991, Schmidt had \u201cpretty much decided against\u201d pursuing litigation against Sarasy, and his interest level in Vorse\u2019s suit was \u201cclose to zero.\u201d Nonetheless, when Vorse called in late December and said his attorney would be sending him a document to sign, Schmidt agreed. Schmidt admitted the handwriting and signature on the last page of the declaration were his, as was the fax strip at the top of the page. However, he did not recall whether he had received or seen the first two pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Schmidt was asked whether the substance of the declaration was \u201cconsistent with your recollection of the transactions in which you were involved with the Dynatex Corporation.\u201d The court sustained plaintiff\u2019s objection that the \u201cdocument speaks for itself. He\u2019s trying to impeach his own witness.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] It\u2019s a sworn statement by Mr. Schmidt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Sarasy\u2019s attorney then turned to exhibit 144, purportedly the later-filed original of the faxed declaration. Sarasy\u2019s counsel had earlier indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>Schmidt would testify that the original signature page of exhibit 144 was a forgery. Essentially, Schmidt intended to testify that the declaration faxed to him by Vorse\u2019s counsel was different from exhibit 144, the purported original of the faxed declaration. This testimony would support an inference that counsel had fraudulently altered the preceding pages of the faxed declaration to induce Schmidt to sign the declaration, and then forged Schmidt\u2019s signature on the later-filed original of the faxed declaration. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney stated he had no objection to the document itself, but requested and was granted a section 402 hearing outside the presence of the jury as to the upcoming line of questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">The court excused the jury and opined it was \u201coffensive\u201d for Sarasy\u2019s counsel to suggest that the filed declaration had been altered.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court pointed out that the direct effect of Schmidt\u2019s testimony was to accuse opposing counsel of falsifying Schmidt\u2019s declaration, an accusation that could force counsel to testify and possibly result in a mistrial at virtually the end of the case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court added that \u201cwithout hearing more, I can only tell you so far I don\u2019t believe Mr. Schmidt.\u201d When Sarasy\u2019s counsel made an offer of proof that Schmidt would testify that the verification on exhibit 144 was not his signature, the court responded: \u201cYou\u2019re accusing these two people who could be disbarred, could be disbarred for filing false documents, for forging the documents. And I\u2019m not going to allow that in front of this jury, I\u2019m going to tell you that, unless you have strong evidence. And since I do not believe this witness, I\u2019m not going to allow him to testify to that.\u201d The court also precluded Schmidt from testifying that statements in his 1991 declaration were inconsistent with his recollection of the transaction, ruling that \u201che has not answered questions truthfully and either\u2014and I\u2019m going to strike his testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">At that point, Sarasy\u2019s counsel offered to \u201cmove to another line of questioning that doesn\u2019t involve Exhibit 144.\u201d He intended to inquire about an alleged admission by Vorse, made in November 1991, that there was never a partnership agreement to buy Dynatex. Following further argument as to what, if any, of Schmidt\u2019s testimony should be stricken, the court made its ruling: \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before ever. It\u2019s extreme. Now, I\u2019ve had people I didn\u2019t believe on the stand, but I never had a situation in which the credibility and the ethics of lawyers, not the parties, you could impugn Mr. Vorse, his testimony from here to kingdom come, it would be perfectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>appropriate. [\u00b6 But to imply so that the jury should infer that these two attorneys, who are not parties to this case but represent a party, forged documents, filed false documents is so prejudicial not only to them but to the plaintiff\u2019s case that it requires comment and possibly a dismissal for misconduct on your part. I consider it misconduct. . . . [\u00b6 . . . [\u00b6 . . . [E]ven though I respect [the discovery referee], I didn\u2019t want to take his word for the fact that Mr. Schmidt didn\u2019t tell the truth. I wanted to hear this myself, and I didn\u2019t\u2014the impact of what you were doing with [exhibits] 143, 144 didn\u2019t really come through earlier today when you were telling me about it, or I would have stopped you then. [*]D But it has come through now, and it is damaging to the plaintiff\u2019s case, let alone\u2014let alone to counsel's reputation. That\u2019s not before the jury, but I think that I have to make some comment to the jury . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">IV. <em>The Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">When the jury was recalled, the trial court made the following statement. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, I have discharged the witness. I found that Mr. Schmidt\u2019s testimony was not to be believed, and therefore I have stricken it. And I am going to instruct you not to consider anything to which he testified. Just a minute. Exhibit 143 is already in evidence. That remains in evidence. But as to what he testified to orally, all of it is to be stricken from your minds.\u201d At the end of trial, the court instructed the jurors: \u201cYou are the sole and exclusive judges of the believability of the witnesses and the weight to be given the testimony of each witness.\u201d However, it added: \u201cIn this case I did comment on the veracity of one witness, and that witness\u2019 testimony was stricken. You are not to consider that witness in considering the evidence before you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The jury found Vorse, Sarasy, and Schmidt had entered into a partnership to acquire the assets of Dynatex and found against Sarasy on all but one cause of action predicated on the alleged partnership agreement. Sarasy timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">I. <em>The Court Abused Its Discretion in Conclusively Assessing Schmidt\u2019s Credibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">This case compels consideration of how far a trial court may go in assessing the credibility of proffered testimony during a section 352 analysis without overstepping the jury\u2019s role as fact finder. Here, the court found a witness untruthful and struck his testimony for that reason. Such action is not generally permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>It appears from the record that, in striking Schmidt\u2019s testimony, the trial court relied on the discretion granted by section 352, which permits exclusion of evidence when its probative value is substantially outweighed by the likelihood that its admission will unduly consume time or create a substantial danger of unduly prejudicing, confusing, or misleading the jury. The trial court erred here, because it weighed the probative value of the evidence against an inaccurate standard of prejudice and because it misconstrued its role in the factfinding process.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">There is no dispute here that Schmidt\u2019s testimony was relevant. There were only three people involved in the alleged partnership: Vorse, Sarasy, and Schmidt. The existence and nature of a partnership among the three were central issues in the case. Schmidt offered to testify about his understanding of the Dynatex negotiations and to recount the actions of the alleged partners. Such testimony clearly falls within section 210\u2019s definition of relevant evidence as that \u201chaving any tendency in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The probative value of Schmidt\u2019s testimony, if true, was also quite high. Schmidt, as the third party to the alleged agreement, could offer direct testimony pertaining to the existence of the partnership, an ultimate fact at issue. Sharply conflicting versions of the relevant events were presented by the parties. Thus, what Schmidt had to say, and his demeanor while saying it, were singularly important to the jury\u2019s evaluation. It is against this high degree of probative value that the trial court was required to weigh the substantial danger of undue prejudice. The court failed, first, by applying an improper understanding of that latter concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">\u201cPrejudice\u201d as contemplated by section 352 is not so sweeping as to include any evidence the opponent finds inconvenient. Evidence is not prejudicial, as that term is used in a section 352 context, merely because it undermines the opponent\u2019s position or shores up that of the proponent. The ability to do so is what makes evidence relevant. The code speaks in terms of <em>undue </em>prejudice. Unless the dangers of undue prejudice, confusion, or time consumption \u201c \u2018substantially outweigh\u2019 \u201d the probative value of relevant evidence, a section 352 objection should fail. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cudjo </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 585, 609 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 390, 863 P.2d 635].) \u201c \u2018The \u201cprejudice\u201d referred to in Evidence Code section 352 applies to evidence which uniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against the defendant as an individual and which has very little effect on the issues. In applying section 352, \u201cprejudicial\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cdamaging.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Karis </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 612, 638 [250 Cal.Rptr. 659, 758 P.2d 1189].)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>The prejudice that section 352 \u201c \u2018is designed to avoid is not the prejudice or damage to a defense that naturally flows from relevant, highly probative evidence.\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018Rather, the statute uses the word in its etymological sense of \u201cprejudging\u201d a person or cause on the basis of extraneous factors. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Zapien </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 929, 958 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 122, 846 P.2d 704].) In other words, evidence should be excluded as unduly prejudicial when it is of such nature as to inflame the emotions of the jury, motivating them to use the information, not to logically evaluate the point upon which it is relevant, but to reward or punish one side because of the jurors\u2019 emotional reaction. In such a circumstance, the evidence is unduly prejudicial because of the substantial likelihood the jury will use it for an illegitimate purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Here, the court focused on the fact that the evidence hurt one party\u2019s case. That is what opposing evidence is generally supposed to do. Further, the court expressed concern that the proffered testimony would impugn the reputation, thus inure to the prejudice, of plaintiff\u2019s counsel. The good faith presentation of an assertive defense may legitimately require such a tactic. The court may not prevent a party from a robust attack on the credibility of the other side merely because counsel\u2019s reputation might be impugned.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Having misconstrued \u201cprejudice,\u201d the court went on to evaluate the testimony\u2019s probative value and, in doing so, improperly invaded the jury\u2019s role as fact finder. The court apparently concluded Schmidt\u2019s testimony was of limited probative value because the court did not believe it. Such an analysis overlooks the essential differences between the roles of judge and jury. It is axiomatic that questions of credibility are exclusively within the province of the jury. (\u00a7312, subd. (b); see also Pen. Code, \u00a7 1127.) The court may not set itself up as a gatekeeper excluding otherwise competent and relevant evidence simply because the court finds it unbelievable.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The Supreme Court has spoken often on this topic in the context of criminal trials. Third party culpability cases, in which the defense offers evidence that someone other than the defendant actually committed the offense, are analogous to the issue presented here. \u201cWe recognize that an inquiry into the admissibility of such evidence and the balancing required under section 352 will always turn on the facts of the case. Yet courts must weigh those facts carefully. They should avoid a hasty conclusion . . . that evidence of [the third party\u2019s] guilt was \u2018incredible.\u2019 Such a determination is properly the province of the jury.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 826, 834 [226 Cal.Rptr. 112, 718 P.2d 99].)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcala </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 742, 755 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 842 P.2d 1192], the defendant was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>young girl. At trial, he sought to call Tim Fallen to testify he had seen the girl on the particular day. If believed, Fallen could have undercut the prosecution\u2019s theory of when the girl was kidnapped, thus raising the possibility that someone other than the defendant had killed her. The prosecution moved to exclude Fallen\u2019s testimony because he had also identified a photograph of a different little girl. \u201cThe trial court accepted the prosecution\u2019s argument and excluded the testimony ... on the ground of relevancy and pursuant to Evidence Code section 352. Relying upon the language of that statute, the court stated that Fallen\u2019s positive misidentification of the other girl destroyed whatever probative value his testimony might have had, and that allowing such testimony only would \u2018confuse the issues.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 790.)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">The Supreme Court concluded the trial court\u2019s action was error: \u201cAlthough the court was vested with wide discretion in determining the relevance and weighing the prejudicial effect of proffered evidence against its probative value [citation], the circumstance that Fallen\u2019s testimony readily was subject to impeachment did not afford the court a legitimate basis for excluding this evidence. Eyewitness testimony may be vulnerable to impeachment for numerous reasons, including the possible existence of prior, conflicting testimony; such vulnerability, however, does not render the evidence irrelevant or unduly prejudicial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Alcala, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at p. 790.)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Often a criminal defendant, seeking to suggest another might be guilty, must rely upon hearsay testimony from witnesses whose credibility is vulnerable. Our Supreme Court, however, has made it very clear that a trial court must proceed cautiously in excluding evidence when it questions the veracity of the <em>testifying witness. </em>In <em>People </em>v. <em>Cudjo, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 585, the trial court excluded the testimony of John Lee Culver, who claimed the defendant\u2019s brother, Gregory, had confessed to the murder. Gregory, having invoked his right against self-incrimination, was unavailable to testify. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 604-606.) The statements attributed to Gregory by Culver were, however, clearly against Gregory\u2019s penal interest. (\u00a7 1230.) Consequently, Culver\u2019s testimony, though hearsay, came within the exception. \u201cIt is true, as the People suggest, that the alleged statement was inconsistent to some extent with the physical evidence .... However, such discrepancies might be attributable to Gregory\u2019s agitation or Culver\u2019s misunderstanding of what he was told. They did not negate all possibility that if Gregory claimed to be the murderer, he was telling the truth. Hence, the court could properly have found that \u2018a reasonable [person] in [Gregory\u2019s] position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true.\u2019 (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1230.) [1 But the trial court did not focus exclusively, or even primarily, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>whether Gregory\u2019s <em>hearsay statement </em>might be false. Instead, the court apparently accepted the prosecution\u2019s contention that <em>Culver </em>was probably a liar who should therefore be excluded as a <em>live witness. </em>In doing so, the court erred. [\u00b6 The People argue that in considering the admissibility of evidence offered under the hearsay exception for declarations against interest, the trial court could properly consider the credibility of the in-court witness, Culver. We disagree. The credibility of the in-court witness is not a proper consideration in this context.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 607-608, italics and brackets in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The trial court\u2019s ability to exclude hearsay testimony based upon an evaluation of the testifying witness\u2019s credibility is limited to circumstances in which \u201cthe testimony is physically impossible or its falsity is apparent \u2018without resorting to inferences or deductions.\u2019 [Citations.] Except in these rare instances of <em>demonstrable falsity, </em>doubts about the credibility of the in-court witness should be left for the jury\u2019s resolution; such doubts do not afford a ground for refusing to admit evidence under the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cudjo, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at pp. 608-609, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Similarly, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1670 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 778], Division Four of this district held it was error to exclude, under section 352, hearsay evidence of a third party\u2019s culpability. \u201cWe know of no rule that excludes testimony on the ground that it could be a fabrication . . . . It is the duty of the trier of fact to assess credibility. \u2018Objection, your honor, this could be perjury!\u2019 has not yet made it into the Evidence Code.\u201d <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>at p. 1679.)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Plaintiff defends the court\u2019s action by relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Blankenship </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 840, 848-849 [213 Cal.Rptr. 666] <em>(Blankenship), </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Love </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 928, 939-940 [142 Cal.Rptr. 532] <em>(Love). </em>Before considering those two cases, we turn to <em>People </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 872 [123 Cal.Rptr. 862] <em>(Chapman), </em>upon which the courts in <em>Blankenship </em>and <em>Love </em>relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">In <em>Chapman, </em>the trial court excluded evidence of hearsay statements by a third party confessing to the crime. In making a preliminary factual determination as required by the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest (\u00a7\u00a7 405, 1230), the trial court determined the hearsay statements were untrustworthy. The appellate court agreed: \u201cThe record here strongly suggests the existence of a plan by three fellow prisoners to have one person take the blame for another\u2019s crime under circumstances where the one taking the blame could not suffer any real detriment to his own interests.\u201d <em>(Chapman, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d at p. 880.) Because the trial court also relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>upon section 352, the appellate court addressed that section as well, concluding that the exclusion of evidence was proper: \u201cThus in applying Evidence Code section 352, the trial court in weighing \u2018probative value\u2019 necessarily considers, among other things, credibility of the witnesses who testify to the proffered evidence.\u201d <em>(Chapman, supra, </em>at p. 881.) Not only was this statement unnecessary to the court\u2019s resolution of the case, it was inaccurate and has since become the source of great mischief.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">In <em>Love, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.3d 928, the defendant sought to implicate a third party, Walton, for the crime. Walton was called as a witness and denied involvement. Thereafter, the defendant attempted to call two witnesses who would testify that Walton had confessed to them. The trial court denied this request under section 352, without specifying its reasoning. <em>(Love, supra, </em>at pp. 934-935.) The appellate court upheld that ruling, holding that an assessment of the <em>testifying </em>witness\u2019s credibility is not only a preliminary fact determination when assessing the admissibility of a hearsay statement as a prior inconsistent statement (\u00a7 1235) but is also necessary to assessing the probative value of the evidence in light of section 352. <em>(Love, supra, </em>at p. 939.) On this point, the <em>Love </em>court cited <em>Chapman, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d at page 881. However, the <em>Love </em>court went on to assess the credibility of not only the testifying witnesses but of the hearsay <em>declarant, </em>Walton, as well. <em>(Love, supra, </em>at pp. 940-941.)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">In <em>Blankenship, supra, </em>167 Cal.App.3d 840, the defendant was prevented from testifying that a third party, Hahn, had confessed to him. The appellate court affirmed: \u201c. . . [N]othing in the offer of proof concerning defendant\u2019s proposed testimony provided an internal indication of veracity. As the proposed testimony was to come from defendant himself it was highly suspect both because defendant had a motive to falsify and because accurate details concerning the crime could be explained by defendant\u2019s own knowledge and guilt rather than Hahn\u2019s. . . . The trial court\u2019s finding that the proposed testimony [about the hearsay statement] lacked trustworthiness is reasonable in light of the evidence and the exclusion of the proposed testimony was not error.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 849.)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The reasoning of <em>Chapman, Love, </em>and <em>Blankenship </em>is contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s analyses in both <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcala, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th 742 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Cudjo, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 585. We recognize that the majority in <em>Cudjo </em>mentioned <em>Blankenship </em>and <em>Chapman. </em>(6 Cal.4th at p. 610.) The court did not engage in a lengthy analysis of those cases, however, and did distinguish them factually. Rejecting the section 352 analysis of the courts in <em>Chapman, Love, </em>and <em>Blankenship, </em>we instead follow the Supreme Court\u2019s more recent reasoning.  A trial court may exclude the live testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>of a witness whom the court disbelieves only in \u201crare instances of demonstrable falsity.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cudjo, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 609.) The court may not exclude evidence when the court simply does not believe the testifying witness. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Alcala, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 790-791.) By contrast, the trial court must assess the credibility of the hearsay <em>declarant </em>because that person is not under oath and subject to cross-examination before the jury. <em>(Cudjo, supra, </em>at p. 608.)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Here, the court refused admission of Schmidt\u2019s live testimony. The court then struck <em>all </em>of Schmidt\u2019s previous testimony because the court did not believe him. There is no case law to support plaintiff\u2019s contention that an assessment of Schmidt\u2019s credibility was a proper component of the section 352 balancing test in this context. Schmidt may or may not have been lying. Such a decision, however, was for the jury to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">II. <em>The Error Was Prejudicial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The test for prejudice in such cases is well settled. \u201c. . . [N]o judgment shall be reversed . . . unless it appears, upon examining the entire cause including the evidence, a miscarriage of justice has resulted. [Citations.] A miscarriage of justice should be declared only when the reviewing court is convinced after an examination of the entire case, including the evidence, that it is reasonably probable a result more favorable to the appellant would have been reached absent the error. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Smith </em>(1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 725, 751 [145 Cal.Rptr. 205].)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">In arguing that Sarasy has not established prejudice, plaintiff details at some length evidence supporting Vorse\u2019s version of the alleged partnership agreement. He is correct that there was substantial evidence the jury could have inteipreted in his favor. On the other hand, he cannot dispute that Schmidt was a unique and important witness on the pivotal issue. Indeed, his attorneys acknowledged, in two separate declarations submitted to the trial court, that Schmidt was a \u201ckey witness\u201d in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Nor can plaintiff dispute the damage inflicted on Sarasy\u2019s case when the court let Schmidt\u2019s 1991 declaration stand unchallenged and unexplained. Shortly after the ruling, Schmidt\u2019s wife testified that Vorse had encouraged her and her husband to join in his lawsuit against Sarasy. According to Mrs. Schmidt, Vorse admitted that, although there had never been a partnership between the three men to purchase Dynatex, Sarasy would be unable to prove it and they could expect a \u201creal kill\u201d from suing Miller, Starr &amp; Regalia, Sarasy, and others. On cross-examination, plaintiff\u2019s counsel called Mrs. Schmidt\u2019s attention to an enlarged copy of exhibit 143, then repeatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>asked Mrs. Schmidt whether she knew her husband had declared under penalty of perjury that he, Sarasy, and Vorse had formed a partnership to acquire Dynatex.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s closing arguments also highlighted the Schmidt declaration: \u201cIn 1991 Don Schmidt executed a declaration stating unequivocally he was a partner with Mr. Vorse and with Mr. Sarasy. This is in evidence. <em>In fact, Mr. Schmidt\u2019s declaration is the only evidence which you have been presented regarding Mr. Schmidt\u2019s position in this case. </em>Mr. Schmidt testified that there was a partnership, and that he was a partner with Mr. Vorse and Mr. Sarasy.\u201d (Italics added.) In arguing the existence of a partnership, counsel again stressed that \u201cMr. Schmidt\u2019s declaration, which we already had on the easel, states under oath that there was a partnership.\u201d Again, in his rebuttal argument, plaintiff\u2019s attorney either read from or paraphrased the 1991 declaration: \u201cMr. Schmidt testified in 1991 in his declaration, which I read to the jury, David Vorse, Lewis Sarasy formed an oral partnership by the name of LDD in 1989 to engage in certain business for the acquisition of [a] high tech company by the name of Dynatex Corporation by the partnership .... Mr. Schmidt testified there was a partnership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Not only did the trial court exclude evidence of an important defense witness, it allowed to remain in evidence a statement that very witness was prepared to disavow. Despite the existence of countervailing evidence, the error was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s remaining contentions are not persuasive. He protests that, had the court not condemned Schmidt as a liar and jettisoned his testimony outright, it could have commented on Schmidt\u2019s veracity as permitted by BAJI No. 15.21. Such permissible comment, however, would not have deprived the jurors of the opportunity to hear the pertinent testimony and make their own assessments of Schmidt\u2019s credibility. (See BAJI No. 15.21 and com. (8th ed. 1994 bound vol.) pp. 364-365 [court must make clear that its comments on evidence are not binding, as jury is exclusive arbiter of questions of fact and witness credibility].) Here, the court\u2019s action prevented the jury from discharging its role as fact finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Last, plaintiff asserts Sarasy waived the error by not objecting when the declaration was originally admitted in evidence. We disagree. At the time the declaration was admitted, the court had expressly ruled Schmidt would be permitted to testify. The defense was prepared to have Schmidt attack Vorse\u2019s credibility. Such a course involves a legitimate tactical choice. The failure of Sarasy\u2019s counsel to object to admission of the declaration cannot be construed as a waiver of his right to challenge the court\u2019s subsequent ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s point that Sarasy\u2019s counsel should have asked the court to strike the declaration after its ruling on Schmidt\u2019s testimony has more resonance but, ultimately, is not persuasive. First, the court made quite clear its belief that Schmidt had told the true story in the 1991 declaration and that this assessment was at the core of its decision to preclude his oral testimony as recent fabrication. In light of the court\u2019s statements, Sarasy\u2019s counsel could reasonably have believed a request to strike would have been futile. Moreover, as the jury had already been read and shown the declaration, an order from the court that it be stricken would, realistically, have had marginal utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Because the error requires reversal, we do not reach the additional issues and arguments raised on appeal and cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The judgment is reversed, and the matter remanded to the trial court.
