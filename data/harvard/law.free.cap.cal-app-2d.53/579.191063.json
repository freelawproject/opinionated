J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMj\">Larry R. Borges was rounding up cattle for his employer on April 5,1988, while driving an all-terrain vehicle. He ran into a cable and suffered injuries to his head, neck, arms, chest and spine. Shortly thereafter, Borges began receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits for his industrial disability from his employer\u2019s carrier, State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">Borges also filed an action in the superior court against the landowner on whose land he was injured. The civil case eventually was settled for $57,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">By the time of the settlement, SCIF had paid Borges more than $46,000 in workers\u2019 compensation benefits. As a consequence, it applied for a lien on Borges\u2019s recovery, pursuant to Labor Code section 3856, subdivision (b). SCIF agreed to release its lien in the civil action for $17,000, provided that its right to a credit against <em>further </em>claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits was in no way compromised.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After deducting SCIF\u2019s lien and Borges\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs, Borges received a net recovery in the civil action of $22,435.57.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>In June 1995, four and one-half years after the civil case settled, the workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) made a finding that Borges\u2019s employer had not been negligent. The WCJ also ordered that SCIF \u201creceive credit in the amount of $22,435.57, towards any workers\u2019 compensation benefits due [Borges], said sum representing the net recovery by [Borges] from third party tortfeasor.\u201d The WCJ deferred findings on the amount to be awarded Borges for permanent disability and for future medical treatments.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">In February 1996, the WCJ determined that Borges was entitled to $20,475 from SCIF for his permanent disability. From this sum, any amounts SCIF had already paid<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were to be deducted. As this award was less than the amount of SCIF\u2019s statutory credit of $22,435.57, SCIF had no further obligation toward Borges. Nevertheless, the WCJ ordered SCIF to pay Borges\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in the sum of $3,000, noting, \u201cThis lien is a priority which attached prior to determination of third party credit.\u201d SCIF filed a petition for reconsideration with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB), which denied the petition on May 13, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">SCIF now petitions this court to annul, vacate and set aside the WCAB opinion and order denying reconsideration. We shall annul the order and direct WCAB to issue a new decision not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">An employer<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that has paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits to an employee whose industrial injury was caused, in whole or in part, by the negligence of a third party, may seek reimbursement for the benefits paid and for certain other expenses from the third party tortfeasor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The employer may seek reimbursement by (1) filing an independent action against the third party (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3852), or (2) by intervening in the employee\u2019s lawsuit against the tortfeasor (Lab. Code \u00a7 3853), or (3) by asserting a lien against the employee\u2019s recovery in the third party lawsuit (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3856, subd. (b), 3862). <em>(Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1961) 57 Cal.2d 57, 69 [17 Cal.Rptr. 369, 366 P.2d 641].) In the instant case, SCIF applied for a lien in Borges\u2019s third party action for the amount of benefits paid (approximately $46,000). Later, it agreed to release its lien for the amount of $17,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>As noted, reimbursement applies to benefits paid <em>prior to </em>a third party judgment or settlement. With respect to <em>future </em>workers\u2019 compensation benefits due the injured party, a different mechanism applies\u2014credit. An employer is entitled to a credit against its obligation to pay further compensation benefits in the amount of the worker\u2019s <em>net </em>recovery against the third party tortfeasor. (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3858, 3861.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">An employer who receives reimbursement for benefits paid prior to settlement of a third party suit does not thereby lose its statutory right to credit. <em>(Hodge </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1981) 123.Cal.App.3d 501, 511 [176 Cal.Rptr. 675].) Nor does an employer who, as here, settles for only part of its reimbursement claim. <em>(Herr </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 321, 327 [159 Cal.Rptr. 435].) As one noted commentator explains, \u201cThe right to credit and to a lien are separate and distinct, and waiver of the latter does not necessarily mean waiver of the credit right. Nor does a lien recovery, by way of a judgment or settlement in the third-party action, constitute a waiver of the right to claim a credit or to have determined the amount of any credit to be allowed in the compensation proceedings.\u201d (1 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers\u2019 Compensation (1996) \u00a7 11.42[5][a], p. 11-107, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Labor Code section 3861 provides that the employer\u2019s credit shall be applied against the employer\u2019s \u201cliability for compensation.\u201d \u201cCompensation,\u201d in this context, is given a broad, expansive meaning. As explained in <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Brown) </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 933, 942 [182 Cal.Rptr. 171], every benefit payable to or on behalf of the employee that is enumerated in division 4 of the Labor Code is to be considered compensation liability which may be offset by the employer\u2019s credit. Under this expansive reading, the following types of compensation payments may be offset by the credit: (1) disability indemnity; (2) medical-legal costs <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (McDowell) </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 136, 138 [142 Cal.Rptr. 654]); (3) medical expenses and future medical expenses <em>(Simmons </em>v. L <em>&amp;S Lighting Fixture Co. </em>(1978) 43 Cal.Comp.Cases 348); (4) penalties <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Brown), supra, </em>130 Cal.App.3d at p. 941); and (5) attorney\u2019s fees awarded in the employee\u2019s compensation case <em>(ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">In <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Brown), supra, </em>130 Cal.App.3d 933, the court was presented with a set of facts virtually identical to those in the instant case: the employee\u2019s net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>recovery from a third party lawsuit exceeded the amount of benefits remaining due to the employee; the WCAB nevertheless granted a \u201cpriority lien\u201d to the employee\u2019s compensation attorney and ordered the employer to pay it before applying the statutory credit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The Court of Appeal ruled that the \u201clien for attorney fees is improper. The Board\u2019s authority to award liens for attorney fees derives from section 4903, subdivision (a). [Fn. omitted.] That section specifies that the lien is to be allowed \u2018against any sum <em>to be paid </em>as compensation The Board acknowledged that funds might not be available once the amount defendant owed was credited; yet it nevertheless awarded plaintiff\u2019s attorney $650. . . . [T]he effect would be to coerce defendant to pay $650 more than it owed in the workers\u2019 compensation proceeding. This the Board cannot do. [Fn. omitted.] If the credit proves greater than the outstanding debt the attorney fees will have to be considered as paid. [][]... [T]he lien for $650 in attorney fees shall stand only if and to the extent any sums remain payable to the employee after application of the credit.\u201d <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Brown), supra, </em>130 Cal.App.3d at pp. 942-943.)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Despite this binding authority, the WCJ and WCAB decided in this case to ignore <em>Brown </em>and instead rely on a \u201cwrit denied\u201d California Compensation Case, <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Sota) </em>(1995) 60 Cal.Comp.Cases 342. In that case, the parties stipulated that the employer was \u201c \u2018entitled to credit for applicant\u2019s net third party recovery against all classes of benefits, including rehabilitation benefits, pursuant to <em>Oldaker v. McGratin Steel Company, </em>46 [Cal.Comp.Cases] 186 (1981).\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The employer argued it was \u201centitled to credit against all classes of benefits, and that such credit included a credit against the allowed attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 343.) The WCJ disagreed, finding that \u201c \u2018Attorney fees are not clearly indicated as compensation benefits.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The WCJ\u2019s reasoning was that \u201c \u2018. . . [attorney's fees is <em>[sic] </em>not a form of compensation as it does not directly innure [sic] to . . . the applicant.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The WCAB affirmed the decision of the WCJ judge, finding that, \u201c \u2018although the parties stipulated that defendant was entitled to \u201ccredit for applicant\u2019s net third party recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>against all classes of benefits,\u201d the parties did not expressly classify attorney\u2019s fees as a compensation benefit for purposes of credit. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">As discussed earlier, the term \u201ccompensation\u201d in the context of an employer\u2019s credit under Labor Code section 3681 is given a broad meaning. The narrow meaning prescribed by the WCJ in <em>Sota </em>is not in accord with any of the case law on this subject. As pointed out in Hanna, \u201cEvery payment conferred by Division 4 of the Labor Code is to be considered compensation liability and may be offset by credit or included in the employer\u2019s judgment or lien.\u201d (1 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers\u2019 Compensation, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 11.42[5][b], p. 11-109, fh. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Moreover, it is not in dispute that attorney\u2019s fees awarded in the workers\u2019 compensation case are considered compensation which is subject to the credit offset. <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Brown), supra, </em>130 Cal.App.3d 933; 1 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers\u2019 Compensation, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 11.42[5][d], p. 11-110, fn. omitted; Cal. Workers\u2019 Compensation Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1985) \u00a7 14.96, p. 615 [noting that \u201c. . . Attorney fees are ordinarily the responsibility of the applicant\u201d]; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 14.97, pp. 615-616; <em>id. </em>(Cont.Ed.Bar Supp. 1996) \u00a7 14.97, p. 266; Cal. Workers\u2019 Damages Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1985) \u00a7 5.3, p. 109.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Indeed in another recent \u201cwrit denied\u201d compensation case, the general rule that attorney\u2019s fees are compensation subject to the credit was applied. In <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Bd. </em>(1994) 59 Cal.Comp.Cases 151, the WCJ was persuaded by the employee\u2019s attorney to grant him a priority lien before application of the third party credit. The employer moved for reconsideration. The WCAB granted the motion, \u201cvacating the award of a priority lien to Parker\u2019s attorney for reasonable fees and amending one of the WCJ\u2019s finding of fact, with the result that Parker\u2019s attorney would be entitled to a reasonable fee, or any fee, only after the exhaustion of SCIF\u2019s credit, and then only should funds become available.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 152.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">In the present case, the WCJ and the WCAB disregarded the binding authority cited above and instead chose to rely upon <em>Sota, </em>a case clearly erroneous in its narrow construction of the word \u201ccompensation\u201d in the context of the employer credit statute. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3861.) The correct rule is that the attorney may be paid only if there are benefits still owing to Borges out of which his lien may be satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">The order of the WCAB denying reconsideration is annulled, and the WCAB is ordered to issue a new opinion not inconsistent with this order. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Borges\u2019s attorney\u2019s request for fees for having to oppose a petition with no reasonable basis (Lab.

In this case, however, the WCJ found that Borges\u2019s employer was not negligent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Specifically, the WCAB found; \u201c \u2018The Board recognizes that, allowing credit to defendant, there may be insufficient remaining indemnity payable to applicant from which to deduct the fee of applicant\u2019s attorney. Therefore, we are inclined to agree with counsel\u2019s argument that his fee should be a priority lien against compensation, payable to counsel in advance of deduction of credit for settlement proceeds. . . . Therefore our decision after reconsideration will provide credit for settlement proceeds after payment of counsel\u2019s lien of $650.00.\u2019 \u201d <em>(State Compensation Ins.
