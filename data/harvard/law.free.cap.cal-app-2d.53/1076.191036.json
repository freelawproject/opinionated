The superior court ordered the DMV to release this information, and the DMV appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">Facts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">In February 1992, Brian Moore leased a new Mercedes Benz 500 SL from the Mercedes Benz Credit Corporation (hereafter MBCC) and obtained an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>automobile liability policy for the car from State Farm. In August 1993, Moore placed the car on consignment with Celebrity Motorcars, Ltd. (hereafter Celebrity), seeking someone to assume his lease payments. Moore alleges that in October 1993, he discovered that Celebrity had closed and that his car was missing. When Moore reported the missing car to the police, they purportedly told him that Celebrity had stolen approximately 20 other vehicles. Celebrity\u2019s owner later pled guilty to forgery and theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">Moore told State Farm he had learned that Celebrity had sold his car to an unknown doctor in Malibu (hereafter the subsequent purchaser), and Moore made a claim to State Farm for the car. State Farm resolved the claim by paying $87,654.60 to MBCC. In return, Moore and MBCC transferred title to State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">When State Farm tried to register the car in its name, the DMV declined to do so. The subsequent purchaser disputed ownership through an attorney, but refused to disclose his or her identity. State Farm requested the subsequent purchaser\u2019s identity and address from the DMV, which declined to release the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">In April 1995, Jo Ann Montoya, an attorney for State Farm, submitted a request to the DMV for the subsequent purchaser\u2019s name and address pursuant to Vehicle Code section 1808.22, subdivision (c). The DMV refused to release the information without a court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Relevant Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">On July 20, 1995, State Farm filed its petition for writ of mandate in the superior court, requesting an order requiring DMV to identify the subsequent purchaser, and to register the car in State Farm\u2019s name. Following a hearing on August 23,1995, the trial court denied the petition in part, but ordered the DMV to release the requested information. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">The DMV contends that the information State Farm seeks cannot be released under Vehicle Code section 1808.22, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">A. <em>Mootness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">The issue of mootness arises at the threshold of our discussion because State Farm learned the subsequent purchaser\u2019s name and address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>from a source other than the DMV during the pendency of this appeal. The DMV nonetheless urges us to hear this appeal, contending that the issue presented is one of public significance that requires review.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">\u201cIf an action involves a matter of continuing public interest and the issue is likely to recur, a court may exercise an inherent discretion to resolve that issue, even though an event occurring during its pendency would normally render the matter moot. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fales </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 712, 715-716 [106 Cal.Rptr. 21, 505 P.2d 213].) The issue presented here reaches privacy concerns of interest not only to the DMV but to the public it serves. Moreover, it is probable that although the issue arises with some frequency, the DMV is left without guidance from an appellate court because, as here, the party seeking information obtains it from another source without litigation. In our view, this appeal presents a matter of continuing public interest that is likely to recur, and thus satisfies the exception to the general rule against deciding issues that are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">B. <em>Vehicle Code Section 1808.22, Subdivision (c)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The issue presented concerns the scope of the exception found in Vehicle Code section 1808.22, subdivision (c), to the privacy provisions of the Vehicle Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 1808.21, subdivision (a), provides: \u201cAny residence address in any record of the department is confidential and shall not be disclosed to any person, except a court, law enforcement agency, or other government agency, or as authorized in Section 1808.22 or 1808.23.\u201d Subdivision (c) of section 1808.22 provides: \u201cSection 1808.21 does not apply to an attorney when the attorney states, under penalty of perjury, that the motor vehicle or vessel registered owner or driver residential address information is necessary in order to represent his or her client in a criminal or civil action which directly involves the use of the motor vehicle or vessel that is pending, is to be filed, or is being investigated. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Here, State Farm\u2019s application for address information contained statements, certified by State Farm\u2019s counsel, that Celebrity had improperly sold the Mercedes Benz to the subsequent purchaser, that State Farm had acquired Moore\u2019s and MBCC\u2019s interests in the vehicle when it paid benefits under Moore\u2019s policy, and that the address information was needed \u201cto recover the car or otherwise resolve the title issue.\u201d State Farm\u2019s counsel also certified that the requested information was necessary \u201cto represent [State Farm] in a criminal or civil action, which directly involves the use of the motor vehicle/motorcycle, that is pending, is to be filed, or is being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>investigated.\u201d The DMV nonetheless contends that State Farm\u2019s information request falls outside the exception in section 1808.22, subdivision (c), because the action being investigated by State Farm does not \u201cdirectly involve[] the use of the motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of that exception.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">We review this issue of statutory interpretation de novo. (See <em>Eidsmore </em>v. <em>RBB, Inc. </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 189, 195 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 357].)  \u201cThe objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. To accomplish that objective, courts must look first to the words of the statute, giving effect to their plain meaning. If those words are clear, we may not alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history. [Citation.] Whenever possible, we must give effect to every word in a statute and avoid a construction making a statutory term surplusage or meaningless. [Citations.]\u201d (I<em>n re Jerry R. </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1432, 1437 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 155].)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">We begin by observing that the exception in question permits attorneys to seek information while a civil action \u201cis being investigated,\u201d before the facts and the precise claims to be filed in the action are fully known. (\u00a7 1808.22, subd. (c).) The exception thus authorizes the release of address information in situations in which an attorney is investigating a <em>potential </em>claim or cause of action \u201cwhich directly involves the use of the motor vehicle or vessel . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1808.22, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">In view of the facts certified in State Farm\u2019s application to the DMV, State Farm clearly has a potential claim for conversion against the subsequent purchaser.  \u201c \u2018 \u201cConversion is any act of dominion wrongfully exerted over another\u2019s personal property in denial of or inconsistent with his rights therein.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Messerall </em>v. <em>Fulwider </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1324, 1329 [245 Cal.Rptr. 548].) One who buys property in good faith from a party lacking title and the right to sell may be liable for conversion. (See <em>Culp </em>v. <em>Signal Van &amp; Storage </em>(1956) 142 Cal.App.2d Supp. 859, 861 [298 P.2d 162]; 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 622, 624, pp. 717-718.) The remedies for conversion include specific recovery of the property, damages, and a quieting of title. (5 Witkin, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 611, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>pp. 708-709.) Finally, an assignee of an original owner\u2019s right of possession may state a claim for conversion based on this right. (See <em>Staley </em>v. <em>Mc-Clurken </em>(1939) 35 Cal.App.2d 622, 626 [96 P.2d 805].)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Any investigation of this conversion claim would necessarily confront questions of <em>use. </em>Generally, a mere claim of ownership by the subsequent purchaser would not be an act of conversion, absent actual interference with property rights. (5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>Torts, \u00a7 615, pp. 710-712.) State Farm\u2019s investigation would thus involve an inquiry into whether the subsequent purchaser had used the vehicle, or assumed control over its use. (See <em>Messerall </em>v. <em>Fulwider, supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d at p. 1329 [to show conversion, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[i]t is not necessary that there be a manual taking of property; it is only necessary to show an assumption of control or ownership over the property, or that the alleged converter has applied the property to his own use.\u201d [Citation.]\u201d\u2019].) We therefore conclude that an inquiry into a potential conversion claim is an investigation of an action that \u201cdirectly involves the use of the motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of section 1808.22, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The DMV contends to the contrary that this exception applies only to actions stemming from accidents involving an unknown driver. We disagree.  \u201cStatutes are not to be read in isolation, but must be construed with related statutes. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Jerry R., supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th at p. 1437.)  Here, section 1808.22 contains several exceptions to the privacy provisions in section 1808.21. Prior to enacting the exception in subdivision (c), the Legislature enacted subdivision (b) of section 1808.22, which permits the DMV to release address information to an insurer that \u201crequests the information for the purpose of obtaining the address of another motorist or vehicle owner involved in an accident with their insured . . . .\u201d (See Stats. 1989, ch. 1213, \u00a7 6, p. 4715; Stats. 1990, ch. 431, \u00a7 1, p. 1833.) Had the Legislature intended to limit the exception in subdivision (c) to actions involving \u201chit and run\u201d accidents, it could have done so in express terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The DMV also contends that because the interpretative question concerns an exception to a statute, we must construe this exception narrowly. However, exceptions to a statute are not construed so narrowly as to exclude situations that are \u201cwithin the words and reason of the exception\u201d (see <em>Hayter Trucking, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shell Western E&amp;P, Inc. </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1, 20 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 229]) or that \u201c \u2018fall fairly within its terms\u2019 \u201d (see <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>S. F. Bay etc. Com. </em>v. <em>Town of Emeryville </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 533, 543 [72 Cal.Rptr. 790, 446 P.2d 790], quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dickson </em>(1841) 40 U.S. 141, 163 [10 L.Ed. 689]).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>Here, the language of the exception plainly indicates the Legislature\u2019s intent to give attorneys access to information necessary to investigate claims that directly involve the use of a motor vehicle or vessel as an element or issue. We discern no basis in the statute for distinguishing actions for conversion from actions arising from \u201chit and run\u201d accidents, both of which directly implicate the use of a motor vehicle. In our view, the DMV\u2019s proposed construction would arbitrarily exclude situations \u201cwithin the words and reason of the exception. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Hayter Trucking, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shell Western E&amp;P, Inc., supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th at p. 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">In sum, we conclude that section 1808.22, subdivision (c), permits attorneys to obtain address information when, as here, they represent the purported owner of a motor vehicle or vessel, and are investigating facts raising a potential claim against an unknown party for conversion of the motor vehicle or vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Epstein, Acting P. J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b820-13\">Because the issue presented on appeal is purely legal and none of the factual allegations are in dispute, we accept them as true for the purposes of our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b821-13\">The DMV also contends that the superior court properly declined to order the DMV to register the car, and properly denied State Farm an award of attorney fees. Because State Farm has not claimed error concerning these rulings adverse to State Farm, we do not address the DMV\u2019s contentions on these matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\">All subsequent statutory references are to this code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\">We observe that the DMV\u2019s opening brief also contains a cursory citation to Evidence Code section 1040, which grants public entities the privilege to refuse to disclose \u201cofficial information.\u201d Because this citation is unaccompanied by any argument or authority pertaining to Evidence Code section 1040, the DMV has waived all contentions of error that would rely on this section. (See <em>In re Marriage of Ananeh-Firempong </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 272, 278 [268 Cal.Rptr. 83].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
