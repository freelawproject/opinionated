Cotter contends the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) preempts California\u2019s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65). We find the FHSA does not preempt the warning requirements of Proposition 65 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">As You Sow (AYS), a nonprofit organization, investigates and sometimes litigates possible Proposition 65<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> violations. Health and Safety Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 25249.6 requires warnings for products causing cancer or reproductive toxicity. Toluene is a reproductive toxin which requires a warning pursuant to Proposition 65.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">On December 10, 1992, AYS sent a 60-day notice pursuant to section 25249.7 to the Attorney General of the State of California alleging that Cotter and 3 other paint and coatings manufacturers failed to provide warnings of toluene exposure in violation of Proposition 65.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cotter is a national member-owned cooperative with 300 to 500 True Value Hardware stores in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>On September 17, 1993, the Attorney General filed a suit against Cotter and three other companies<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> alleging they violated Proposition 65 and Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq. On July 23, 1994, Cotter and the People entered into a permanent injunction pursuant to stipulation requiring Cotter to take certain steps to provide warnings for its paint products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\">Cotter filed a motion for summary judgment alleging Proposition 65\u2019s regulations involved \u201ccautionary labeling requirements\u201d as defined by the FHSA. Consequently, Cotter argued, federal law has preempted Proposition 65. In addition, Cotter alleged it could only comply with Proposition 65 by labeling its products; therefore Proposition 65 constituted a de facto labeling requirement. The People responded by filing opposition to Cotter\u2019s motion and a cross-motion for summary adjudication to Cotter\u2019s fifth affirmative defense, which alleged preemption of Proposition 65 by the FHSA. On March 9, 1993, the court denied summary judgment to Cotter and granted summary adjudication to the People on the fifth affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">Cotter and the People entered into a consent judgment on June 9, 1995, resolving the litigation and requiring Cotter to pay $275,000 as penalties and restitution for the Proposition 65 violations. The consent judgment permitted Cotter to appeal from the order on preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">\n<em>Statutory Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">\n<em>Proposition 65</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">Proposition 65 states, in part: \u201cNo person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 25249.6.) Twelve months after the statute designates a substance as toxic, products containing the listed toxic substance must have warnings about the health risks. (\u00a7 25249.10, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-9\">The statute does not define \u201cwarning,\u201d but explains: \u201c \u2018Warning\u2019 within the meaning of Section 25249.6 need not be provided separately to each exposed individual and may be provided by general methods such as labels on consumer products, inclusion of notices in mailings to water customers, posting of notices, placing notices in public news media, and the like, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>provided that the warning accomplished is clear and reasonable.\u201d (\u00a7 25249.11, subd. (f).) The regulations describe four types of \u201csafe harbor\u201d warnings for consumer products: product labeling, \u201cshelf labeling, signs, menus, or a combination thereof.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 12601, subd. (b)(1)(B).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">The warnings must be \u201cprominently placed upon a product\u2019s label or other labeling or displayed at the retail outlet with such conspicuousness, as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices in the label, labeling or display as to render it likely to be read and understood by an ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase or use.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 12601, subd. (b)(3).) Thus, a merchant can comply with Proposition 65 by posting a sign stating the products are known to the state to cause cancer and/or are reproductively toxic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">\n<em>The FHSA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">Congress enacted the FHSA in 1960 and the act itself does not contain a section stating its purpose. (See <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Boyle-Midway Household Products, Inc. </em>(W.D.Pa. 1992) 792 F.Supp. 1001, 1008.) However, the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce stated, \u201c \u2018The purpose of this bill is to provide <em>nationally uniform </em>requirements for <em>adequate </em>cautionary labeling of packages of hazardous substances which are sold in interstate commerce and are intended or suitable for household use.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting H.R.Rep. No. 1861, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 1 (1960), reprinted in 1960 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 2833.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">In 1966, Congress added a limited preemption provision to protect manufacturers from having to create different labels to comply with varying state regulations. It modified the preemption provision in 1976 to state: \u201c \u2018Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), if a hazardous substance or its packaging is subject to a cautionary labeling requirement under section 2(p) or 3(b) [subsection (p) of this section or section 1262(b) of this title] designed to protect against a risk of illness or injury associated with the substance, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect a cautionary labeling requirement applicable to such substance or packaging and designed to protect against the same risk of illness or injury unless such cautionary labeling requirement is identical to the labeling requirement under section 2(p) or 3(b) [subsection (p) of this section or section 1262(b) of this title].\u2019 \u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261 note (b)(1)(A) (hereinafter 15 U.S.C. section 1261 note).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">Although the FHSA does not define \u201ccautionary label,\u201d it does define label as the following: \u201cThe term \u2018label\u2019 means a display of written, printed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>or graphic matter upon the immediate container of any substance or, in the case of an article which is unpackaged or is not packaged in an immediate container intended or suitable for delivery to the ultimate consumer, a display of such matter directly upon the article involved or upon a tag or other suitable material affixed thereto; and a requirement made by or under authority of this chapter that any word, statement, or other information appear on the label shall not be considered to be complied with unless such word, statement, or other information also appears (1) on the outside container or wrapper, if any there be, unless it is easily legible through the outside container or wrapper and (2) on all accompanying literature where there are directions for use, written or otherwise.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261(n).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">Cotter raises two issues on appeal: (1) Does the FHSA preempt Proposition 65 warnings because point of sale signs are labels as defined by the FHSA? (2) If point of sale signs are not labels, does the FHSA still preempt Proposition 65 because the state statute imposes a de facto labeling requirement? We address each of these issues separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">I. <em>Point of Sale Signs Are Not Labels Under the FHSA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">Cotter contends the court erred in denying its summary judgment motion because Proposition 65 imposes a \u201ccautionary labeling requirement\u201d which is preempted by the FHSA. Since Cotter presents a facial challenge to Proposition 65, it must establish Proposition 65 would not be valid under any set of circumstances. <em>(Chemical Specialties Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. </em>v. <em>Allenby </em>(9th Cir. 1992) 958 F.2d 941, 943, cert. den. (1992) 506 U.S. 825 [113 S.Ct. 80, 121 L.Ed.2d 44] <em>(Allenby).) </em>Thus, to find preemption, we \u201c \u2018must determine that <em>all </em>possible consumer product warnings that would satisfy Proposition 65 conflict with provisions\u2019 \u201d of the FHSA. <em>(Comm, of Dental Amalgam Mfrs. &amp; Distribs. </em>v. <em>Stratton </em>(9th Cir. 1996) 92 F.3d 807, 810 <em>(Stratton).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">The People claim Cotter could satisfy Proposition 65 by using point of sale signs. This method, they assert, does not conflict with the preemption provision of the FHSA. They rely on <em>Allenby, supra, </em>958 F.2d 941, which held such signs are not labels under the FHSA. Cotter, however, claims the Ninth Circuit in <em>Allenby </em>misapplied and misinterpreted federal and state law and the trial court erred by following <em>Allenby.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">In deciding whether <em>Allenby </em>represents good law, we first review the federal preemption doctrine and examine the most recent United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>Supreme Court decisions. We then explain why <em>Allenby </em>correctly found point of sale signs are not labels under the FHSA. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">The trial court denied Cotter\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on preemption and granted the People\u2019s motion for summary adjudication to Cotter\u2019s defense of preemption. Summary adjudication was proper only if the defense of preemption presented no triable issue of material fact and Cotter could not raise the defense as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (f)(1).) Since the parties do not dispute the facts related to preemption and the summary adjudication raises a purely legal question, we employ de novo review. <em>(Schrader </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1679, 1684 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 433].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">B. <em>Preemption Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">\u201cPreemption analysis starts with the presumption that the traditional police powers of states are not displaced by federal law unless displacement was the \u2018clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Allenby, supra, </em>958 F.2d 941, 943; accord with <em>Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr </em>(1996)_U.S._,_ [116 S.Ct. 2240, 2248, 135 L.Ed.2d 700] <em>(Medtronic).)</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>One reason for this presumption is Congress has the power to make its intention clear. \u201c[I]f the court erroneously finds preemption, the State can do nothing about it, while if the court errs in the other direction, Congress can correct the problem.\u201d (958 F.2d at p. 943.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-10\">The second presumption underlying a preemption analysis requires a determination of Congress\u2019s purpose, which \u201c \u2018is the ultimate touchstone\u2019 in every pre-emption case. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Medtronic, </em>supra,_U.S____[116 S.Ct. 2240, 2250].) We determine intent primarily \u201cfrom the language of the pre-emption statute and the \u2018statutory framework\u2019 surrounding it. [Citation.]\u201d (I<em>d. </em>at p._[116 S.Ct. at p. 2251].) \u201cAlso relevant, however, is the \u2018structure and purpose of the statute as a whole,\u2019 [citation], as revealed not only in the text, but through the reviewing court\u2019s reasoned understanding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>the way in which Congress intended the statute and its surrounding regulatory scheme to affect business, consumers, and the law.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-4\">If the statute does not have an express preemption clause, state law is only preempted if (1) the law actually conflicts with federal law, or (2) federal law \u201cso thoroughly occupies a legislative field \u201c \u2018 \u201cas to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc. </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 504, 516 [112 S.Ct. 2608, 2617, 120 L.Ed.2d 407] <em>(Cipollone).) </em>\u201cWhen Congress has considered the issue of pre-emption and has included in the enacted legislation a provision explicitly addressing that issue, and when that provision provides a \u2018reliable indicium of congressional intent with respect to state authority\u2019 [citation], \u2018there is no need to infer congressional intent to pre-empt state laws from the substantive provisions\u2019 of the legislation. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 517 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2618].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">In this case, Congress enacted an express preemption clause and we only need to \u201cidentify the domain expressly pre-empted.\u201d (See <em>Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. 504, 517 [112 S.Ct. 2608, 2618].) Moreover, we must narrowly read the preemption clause because Proposition 65 is an instance of the state exercising its police power. <em>(Medtronic, </em>supra,_U.S._,_[116 S.Ct. 2240, 2250]; <em>Ketchum </em>v. <em>Hyundai Motor Co. </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1672, 1678 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 595].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">C. <em>Cipollone and Medtronic</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">The two most recent United States Supreme Court cases to consider preemption are <em>Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. 504 and <em>Medtronic, </em>supra,_U.S. _[116 S.Ct. 2240]. Both the People and Cotter contend <em>Cipollone </em>supports their position. The Supreme Court decided <em>Medtronic </em>while this appeal was pending, and both parties discussed its impact on this appeal at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-13\">In <em>Cipollone, </em>the United States Supreme Court found the amended Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 (Smoking Act) preempted common law claims based on a failure to warn about the hazards of smoking, but not those premised on express warranty, intentional fraud and misrepresentation, or conspiracy. (505 U.S. 504.) The federal statute set forth the exact warning to be placed on each package<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the preemption clause specified \u2018\u201c[n]o requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this Act.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 515 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2617].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">When determining whether federal law expressly preempted the common law claims, the court in <em>Cipollone, </em>held the following as the central inquiry: \u201c[W]e ask whether the legal duty that is the predicate of the common-law damages action constitutes a \u2018requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health . . . imposed under State law with respect to . . . advertising or promotion,\u2019 giving that clause a fair but narrow reading.\u201d (505 U.S. 504, 524 [112 S.Ct. 2608, 2621].) Thus, federal law preempted state claims based on inadequate warnings about health risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">The United States Supreme Court further refined preemption analysis in <em>Medtronic, </em>supra,_U.S._[116 S.Ct. 2240]. In <em>Medtronic, </em>the manufacturer of a pacemaker argued the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) to the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act governed the requirements for medical devices and its preemption clause prevented the plaintiff\u2019s claims of negligence and strict liability based on a defective device and inadequate warnings. <em>(Id. </em>at p._[116 S.Ct. at p. 2250].) The preemption provision under the MDA provided: \u201c[N]o State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement\u2014 [\u00b6 (1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device, and [H (2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.\u201d (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-9\">The court in <em>Medtronic </em>stated courts should broadly interpret the preemption provision of federal statutes with limited applicability and narrowly interpret those statutes with general applicability. Accordingly, the court in <em>Cipollone </em>broadly interpreted the word \u201crequirement\u201d in the preemption provision because: \u201cThe pre-emptive statute in <em>Cipollone </em>was targeted at a limited set of state requirements\u2014those \u2018based on smoking and health\u2019\u2014and then only at a limited subset of the possible applications of those requirements\u2014those involving the \u2018advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of\u2019 the federal statute. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>_U.S. _,_ [116 S.Ct. 2240, 2252], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-12\">In contrast to the Smoking Act, the MDA in <em>Medtronic </em>applied to all medical devices, warranting a narrow interpretation of \u201crequirement.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>court defined \u201crequirement\u201d under the MDA to include only those situations in which the state and federal government had imposed a conflicting \u201cduty\u201d on the manufacturer. <em>(Medtronic, </em>supra,_U.S. _,_ [116 S.Ct. 2240, 2251].) The FDA approved the marketing of the pacemaker in <em>Medtronic </em>because it was \u201c \u2018substantially equivalent\u2019 to devices already on the market,\u201d and had not specifically evaluated the pacemaker. <em>(Id. </em>at p__[116 S.Ct. at p. 2248].) Accordingly, the court found the MDA had not issued \u201cany requirement\u201d applicable to this device and it did not preempt the state claim alleging negligent design. <em>(Id. </em>at p__[116 S.Ct. at p. 2249].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">The court in <em>Medtronic </em>also held the MDA did not preempt claims based on inadequate labeling. The MDA required manufacturers of every medical device to include a label containing \u201c \u2018information for use, . . . and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>_ U.S. _, _ [116 S.Ct. 2240, 2256].) The labeling requirements did not apply specifically to the pacemaker; therefore, the court found the federal government had not imposed a labeling \u201crequirement\u201d for the pacemaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-10\">The court explained why a decision regarding preemption should consider the \u201cgenerality\u201d of the federal statute: \u201cThe generality of those requirements make [sic] this quite unlike a case in which the Federal Government has weighed the competing interests relevant to the particular requirement in question, reached an unambiguous conclusion about how those competing considerations should be resolved in a particular case or set of cases, and implemented that conclusion via a specific mandate on manufacturers or producers.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>_ U.S. _, _ [116 S.Ct. 2240, 2258].) Instead, \u201c. . . the federal requirements reflect important but entirely generic concerns about device regulation generally, not the sort of concerns regarding a specific device or field of device regulation which the statute or regulations were designed to protect from potentially contradictory state requirements.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-13\">When both the state and federal requirements reflect \u201cgeneric concerns\u201d rather than specific regulations, they probably will not conflict, resulting in no preemption. <em>(Medtronic, </em>supra,_U.S._,_[116 S.Ct. 2240, 2258].) Preemption occurs \u201conly where a particular state requirement threatens to interfere with a specific federal interest.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p__[116 S.Ct. at p. 2257].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>D. <em>The FHSA, Proposition 65, and Preemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">Only one case, <em>Allenby, supra, </em>958 F.2d 941, has reviewed preemption under the FHSA and Proposition 65. It held the FHSA did not preempt Proposition 65.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">Cotter argues <em>Allenby </em>does not represent good law because it conflicts with the holding in <em>Cipollone, </em>contradicts other state and federal decisions made post <em>-Cipollone, </em>and ignored and failed to defer to the conclusions of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). To support its contention, Cotter cites one other Proposition 65 case in the federal district court <em>(Committee of Dental Amalgam Alloy Mfrs. </em>v. <em>Henry </em>(S.D.Cal. 1994) 871 F.Supp. 1278), which was recently reversed in <em>Stratton, supra, </em>92 F.3d 807, and tort claims preempted by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">Prior to assessing each of Cotter\u2019s criticisms of <em>Allenby, </em>we briefly summarize Allenby's analysis of preemption under the FHSA and conduct our own independent analysis of preemption and the FHSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">1. <em>Allenby</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-8\">When analyzing preemption under the FHSA, the court in <em>Allenby, supra, </em>958 F.2d 941, 946, noted the preemption provision in the FHSA only applies to \u201ccautionary labeling\u201d on packages (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261 note). The act defines labels as including accompanying literature only if the material contains \u201cdirections for use.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261(n).) Thus, if point of sale signs were not \u201cdirections for use,\u201d they represented a method in which a manufacturer could satisfy Proposition 65 without requiring warning labels in addition to the FHSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-9\">The court rejected the argument that Proposition 65 warnings \u201cimpliedly\u201d direct the consumer to handle the product to \u201cavoid or minimize direct exposure\u201d and were therefore directions for use. <em>(Allenby, supra, </em>958 F.2d 941, 949.) The court explained this was a \u201cnonsensical reading\u201d of the term \u201cdirections for use\u201d and it agreed with the lower court\u2019s comments during oral argument about a sign stating, \u201c \u2018this product may cause birth defects.\u2019 \u201d The Ninth Circuit quoted the lower court as responding: \u201c \u2018[D]oesn\u2019t tell you whether it\u2019s going to cause defects if you pour it on your feet, or if you drink it, or if you poke it in your ear, it just says that it may cause birth defects. How is that a direction for use?\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Instead, the court in <em>Allenby </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>determined Congress\u2019s intent more likely related to \u201chow much of a detergent to use, or how long a paint solvent should be mixed.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-4\">The court in <em>Allenby </em>concluded Proposition 65 did not frustrate any congressional purpose. The FHSA regulates cautionary labeling to promote uniformity but permits the states through the use of point of sale signs to regulate the sale and use of hazardous chemicals. <em>(Allenby, supra, </em>958 F.2d 941, 950.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">2. <em>Allenby\u2019s analysis of labels under the FHSA remains good law post-Cipollone</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">(i) <em>Predicate duty analysis does not apply to general statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">Cotter argues <em>Allenby </em>is not good law because <em>Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. 504, 524 [112 S.Ct. 2608, 2621], held the central inquiry for preemption is whether the state and federal statutes have the same predicate duty. Cotter contends Proposition 65 and the FHSA have the same \u201cpredicate duty\u201d: the legal duty to warn of toxic dangers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">Cotter, however, does not consider the recent decision of <em>Medtronic, </em>which explained the predicate duty analysis does not apply when the federal statute merely requires a general duty to inform users and purchasers of potentially dangerous items. (_U.S____[116 S.Ct. 2240, 2258].) When the predicate for the plaintiff\u2019s claims is the general duty to inform users and purchasers of potentially dangerous items and the federal government has not implemented or enforced specific federal requirements, general obligations imposed by the state do not threaten the federal requirements. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-12\">Indeed a recent Ninth Circuit opinion, relying on the analysis of <em>Medtronic, </em>held the MDA does not preempt Proposition 65 warnings<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>dental amalgam.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(Stratton, supra, </em>92 F.3d 807, 810.) \u201cProposition 65 is a state law of general applicability which was <em>not </em>enacted \u2018with respect to\u2019 medical devices.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 813.) Rather, \u201cProposition 65 applies to <em>all </em>products and services that pose a health risk to the public.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court concluded: \u201cThus, we hold that the consumer warning requirement under California\u2019s Proposition 65 is not \u2018specific\u2019 enough to trigger preemption because it is \u2018not the kind[] of requirement^ that Congress and the FDA feared would impede the ability of federal regulators to implement and enforce specific federal requirements.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">Following both <em>Medtronic </em>and <em>Stratton, </em>the \u201cpredicate duty\u201d analysis for preemption does not apply when both the federal and state statutes require a general warning for a variety of products and do not target specific products. As noted above, Proposition 65 is a general statute which applies to all products and services posing a health risk. Similarly, the FHSA is a general statute which requires warnings on labels for substances it determines are hazardous. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261.) A \u201c \u2018hazardous substance\u2019 \u201d includes: \u201cAny substance or mixture of substances which (i) is toxic, (ii) is corrosive, (iii) is an irritant, (iv) is a strong sensitizer, (v) is flammable or combustible, or (vi) generates pressure through decomposition, heat, or other means, if such substance or mixture of substances may cause substantial personal injury or substantial illness during or as a proximate result of any customary or reasonably foreseeable handling or use, including reasonably foreseeable ingestion by children.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261(f)(1)(A).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">Given the generality of Proposition 65 and the FHSA, Cotter\u2019s criticism of <em>Allenby </em>for failing to consider the statutes\u2019 predicate duty has no merit. Unlike the Smoking Act in <em>Cipollone, </em>which provided requirements for a particular product and specified the exact wording for the warning, the requirements of the FHSA apply to a variety of products in numerous industries. In this situation an analysis of the predicate duty becomes meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">(ii) <em>Allenby correctly found point of sale signs are not labels</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">Allenby\u2019s analysis of labels under the FHSA does not contradict the reasoning in either <em>Cipollone </em>or <em>Medtronic.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Our independent examination of Proposition 65 and the FHSA confirms Allenby\u2019s finding on point of sale signs and the FHSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>As with any state law regulating health and safety, we begin by presuming Proposition 65 is not displaced. <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>U.S____ [116 S.Ct. 2240, 2248].) Since the FHSA does have a specific preemption clause, we need to determine \u201cthe domain expressly pre-empted.\u201d <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. 504, 517 [112 S.Ct. 2608, 2618].) We determine this \u201cdomain\u201d by examining the language of the preemption statute, its \u201c \u2018statutory framework,\u2019 \u201d and the \u201cstructure and purpose of the statute as a whole\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>U.S. at p. [116 S.Ct. at p. 2251]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">As already stressed, Congress enacted an explicit preemption provision in the FHSA prohibiting a state to establish a cautionary labeling requirement for hazardous substances covered by the FHSA \u201cunless such cautionary labeling requirement is identical to the labeling requirement\u201d in this act. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261 note.) The act defines label as a \u201cdisplay of written, printed, or graphic matter upon the immediate container of any substance . . . and (2) on all accompanying literature where there are directions for use, written or otherwise.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261(n).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-7\">Congress chose to restrict the definition of a label to include accompanying literature only when that material contains \u201cdirections for use.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261(n).) These words indicate the warning must tell the user how to use the product. This situation resembles the one in <em>Medtronic, </em>where the court refused to interpret \u201crequirement\u201d in the preemption provision of the MDA to mean \u201cremedy\u201d because \u201c. . . if Congress intended to preclude all common-law causes of action, it chose a singularly odd word with which to do it.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>_U.S. _,_ [116 S.Ct. 2240, 2251-2252].) Similarly, if Congress wanted preemption under the FHSA to apply to all accompanying literature with \u201cimplied\u201d directions for use, as Cotter argues, Congress could have specified that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-10\">In addition to examining the language of the FHSA, we must consider Congress\u2019s stated purpose. The FHSA itself does not contain a section setting forth its purpose but Congress enacted the FHSA in 1960 to \u201c \u2018provide nationally uniform requirements for adequate cautionary labeling of packages of hazardous substances which are sold in interstate commerce and are intended or suitable for household use.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Moss </em>v. <em>Parks Corp. </em>(4th Cir. 1993) 985 F.2d 736, 739, citing House Com. on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Federal Hazardous Substances Labeling Act, H.R.Rep. No. 1861, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 2, <em>supra, </em>reprinted in 1960 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, <em>supra, </em>p. 2833.) When Congress amended the FHSA in 1966, the legislative history discussed the impracticality of having the states produce potentially 50 different labels for a particular hazardous substance. <em>(Jenkins </em>v. <em>James B. Day &amp; Co. </em>(1994) 69 Ohio St.3d 541, 545 [634 N.E.2d 998, 1001-1002].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number>To assess Congress\u2019s purpose we must also consider the structure and framework of the FHSA. Following <em>Medtronic, </em>supra,_U.S._,_[116 S.Ct. 2240, 2250], we must interpret the words in the preemption statute narrowly when the federal statute and state statute have general applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">As already stressed, the FHSA is an extremely broad statute. It applies to numerous products in a variety of industries and it does not require specific language on the labels but \u201cmerely requires (1) that labels contain the signal word \u2018warning\u2019 or \u2018caution\u2019 and (2) words which describe the potential hazard.\u201d <em>(Allenby, supra, </em>958 F.2d 941, 950.) Furthermore, the generality of these requirements makes it clear the federal government has not \u201cweighed the competing interests relevant\u201d to the particular hazardous material and has not \u201creached an unambiguous conclusion about how those competing considerations should be resolved in a particular case or set of cases, and implemented that conclusion via a specific mandate on manufacturers or producers\u201d <em>(Medtronic, </em>supra,_U.S.___[1116 S.Ct. 2240, 2258]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">Given the FHSA\u2019s general applicability, point of sale signs are unlikely to interfere with the federal government\u2019s objectives. Point of sale signs obviously do not require manufacturers to develop more than one label for all 50 states. Moreover, point of sale signs allow the state to regulate sales, a distinctively state interest, without imposing additional labeling requirements on packages. Rather than conflicting with the federal government\u2019s objectives, they serve to further the purpose of the FHSA by providing a larger audience with information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">Interpreting Proposition 65\u2019s warnings as \u201cimplied\u201d direction for use to the consumer to take \u201csteps\u201d to \u201creduce exposure,\u201d as Cotter argues, would create an extensive preemption provision under the FHSA. With such a definition, purely informational signs could be considered implied directions for use. For example, signs merely rating material on the product\u2019s appropriateness for minors or adults would constitute labeling. Indeed, price tags could be found to be implied directions for use as one should use expensive items sparingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-9\">We, therefore, conclude <em>Allenby </em>correctly found the FHSA does not preempt Proposition 65 point of sale signs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number>3. <em>Distinguishing FIFRA cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-4\">To support its argument of preemption, Cotter cites numerous FIFRA cases which found FIFRA preempted common law claims based on inadequate point of sale warnings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>(Taylor AG Industries </em>v. <em>Pure-Gro </em>(9th Cir. 1995) 54 F.3d 555, 560 <em>(Taylor AG) Louisiana-Pacific Corp. </em>v. <em>Koppers Co. </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 599 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 257]; <em>Papas </em>v. <em>Upjohn Co. </em>(11th Cir. 1993) 985 F.2d 516.) Although the preemption provision in FIFRA is essentially identical to the one in the FHSA,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that similarity should not obfuscate the differences between the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">Three material differences distinguish FIFRA cases from this case: (1) FIFRA defines a label more expansively than the FHSA; (2) FIFRA is not simply a labeling statute while the FHSA is; and (3) FIFRA cases are predominantly tort common law cases and this is a Proposition 65 enforcement action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">(i) <em>Differences between the statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">FIFRA broadly defines label as the following: \u201cThe term \u2018labeling\u2019 means all labels and all other written, printed, or graphic matter\u2014 [\u00b6 (A) accompanying the pesticide or device at any time; or [\u00b6 (B) to which reference is made on the label or in literature accompanying the pesticide or device, except to current official publications . . . .\u201d (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136(p)(2).) Congress designated matter \u201caccompanying\u201d the product as a label without any further qualification. Consequently, FIFRA cases do not help us determine Congress\u2019s intent when it limited a label under the FHSA to mean accompanying literature providing \u201cdirections for use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-8\">More significantly, when examining the \u201cstatutory framework\u201d of FIFRA, the differences between the two federal statutes are magnified. Rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1390\">*1390</page-number>creating a mere labeling statute, Congress in 1972, \u201ctransformed it [FIFRA] into a comprehensive regulatory statute governing the use and sale of pesticides.\u201d <em>(Louisiana-Pacific Corp. </em>v. <em>Koppers Co., supra, </em>32 Cal.App.4th 599, 603.) One of the cases emphasized by Cotter, <em>Taylor AG, supra, </em>54 F.3d 555, 560, noted the \u201crigorous label-approval process under FIFRA.\u201d The court explained: \u201cAlthough FIFRA does not prescribe the exact contents of labels, manufacturers are not free, ... to create pesticide labels in any manner they choose. Rather, ... the EPA approves each label only after a careful review of the product data and the draft label.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">Given the statutory framework of FIFRA, a broad interpretation of the word \u201clabel\u201d under FIFRA is consistent with <em>Medtronic. </em>Not only does FIFRA define \u201clabel\u201d expansively, but it represents a situation \u201cin which the Federal Government has weighed the competing interests relevant to the particular requirement in question, reached an unambiguous conclusion about how those competing considerations should be resolved in a particular case or set of cases, and implemented that conclusion via a specific mandate on manufacturers or producers\u201d <em>(Medtronic, </em>supra,_U.S----[116 S.Ct. 2240, 2258]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-7\">In contrast, as already stressed, the FHSA does not (1) have a label approval process, (2) specify the wording to be used on the label, or (3) regulate the sale or use of the hazardous products covered by the federal statute. Instead, as the People contend, Congress has left the states free to regulate the sale and use of these hazardous products. The FHSA has remained a labeling statute and the scope of its preemption differs significantly from FIFRA.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, cases interpreting FIFRA have \u201climited relevance\u201d to determinations of preemption and the FHSA. (See <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>James B. Day &amp; Co., supra, </em>634 N.E.2d 998, 1004, fn. 4.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-8\">(ii) <em>Differences between tort actions and state enforcement actions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-9\">An additional reason for contending the FIFRA cases cited by Cotter are irrelevant, according to the People, is because they involve tort claims rather than the state\u2019s enforcement of a statute. In response, Cotter claims FIFRA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1391\">*1391</page-number>tort cases provide an appropriate method of analysis for federal preemption under the FHSA since the basis for requiring a warning under common law and Proposition 65 is the same. Cotter argues \u201c[w]here the reason is the same, the rule should be the same\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3511), and \u201c[t]he law respects form less than substance\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3528).</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-4\">As Cotter asserts, enforcement and common law actions pose the same questions and issues in a determination of the \u201cdomain expressly preempted.\u201d Accordingly, we used <em>Cipollone </em>and Medtronic, actions in tort, to determine the scope of preemption under the FHSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">After determining the preempted domain, the analyses of tort and enforcement actions diverge in a materially significant respect. Once the court determines a common law claim falls within the reach of the preemption clause, the analysis ceases. The federal government\u2019s interest in promoting interstate commerce always trumps the individual\u2019s interests in receiving damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">Unlike a tort action, an enforcement action requires the court to establish whether any method of compliance with the state statute falls outside the scope of the preemption provision. (See <em>Stratton, supra, 92 </em>F.3d 807, 810.) If any method is beyond the reach of the preemption provision, the statute remains valid. The federal statute sets the standards for sufficient warnings (barring any tort claims on this basis), but does not necessarily prohibit the state from requiring warnings consistent with the preemption provision that regulate the use and sale of these products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">Both <em>Allenby, supra, </em>958 F.2d 941, 948 and <em>Taylor AG, supra, </em>54 F.3d 555, 560 acknowledged this distinction when discussing preemption and FIFRA. The Ninth Circuit in <em>Taylor AG </em>rejected the argument \u201cthat liability should be imposed upon the Manufacturers for failure to warn arising from alleged deficiencies in advertisements, point-of-sale warnings, and other materials distributed in connections with a sale.\u201d (54 F.3d at p. 561, fn. omitted.) The court in <em>Taylor AG </em>reconciled its holding with the one in <em>Allenby </em>by explaining the court in <em>Allenby </em>\u201cmerely\u201d held \u201cnon-label warnings were not preempted by FIFRA,\u201d but <em>Allenby </em>admitted \u201c \u2018[t]he argument against product liability suits for inadequate labeling is strong.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Taylor AG, supra, </em>at p. 561, fn. 2, quoting <em>Allenby, supra, </em>at p. 948.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-8\">Cotter claims the two Ninth Circuit cases, <em>Allenby </em>and <em>Taylor AG, </em>are inconsistent, with the latter representing the better law. However, as both the People and the court in <em>Taylor AG </em>point out, the two courts were simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1392\">*1392</page-number>addressing different types of actions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In finding Proposition 65 is not preempted under the FHSA, because point of sale signs are not labels and do not provide \u201cdirections for use,\u201d we are not opening the door to common law tort claims premised on the inadequacy of the product label.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">Finally, Cotter claims tort actions and enforcement actions are the same because a company must pay a penalty when it violates the statute. The penalty, Cotter claims, has the same consequences as an award for damages. This argument, however, ignores the vital distinction between the two. As the People point out, an enforcement action never requires the court to assess the adequacy of the label, while that is the task facing the court in a tort action. In an enforcement action, the court simply looks to see whether the company has complied with the mandate of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">4. <em>The CPSC\u2019s interpretation of \u201clabel\u201d under the FHSA is clearly erroneous</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-7\">Cotter contends the court in <em>Allenby </em>erred by ignoring the CPSC\u2019s conclusion that point of sale signs qualify as a \u201cdirection for use.\u201d In response to a request from the Chemical Specialties Manufacturers Association for an advisory opinion, Clement D. Earhardt III from the Office of General Counsel of the CPSC concluded on March 6, 1991, the following: \u201cA warning that a product can cause cancer or birth defects is not an express direction for use. Nevertheless, it conveys the information that, in using the product, steps should be taken to minimize or eliminate exposure. Stated another way, the warning itself can also serve as a direction for use.\u201d (Advisory Opn. No. 312 (Mar. 6, 1991) p. 3.) The opinion continued: \u201cTherefore, although the warning quoted in your inquiry does not necessarily convey specific actions to be taken in the use of the product, it does convey information about how the product should be used (steps should be taken to reduce exposure). Accordingly, this office views the statement as a direction for use. It follows, therefore, that signs and the like bearing such warnings are \u2018accompanying literature containing directions for use\u2019 and thus are labeling under FHSA \u00a7 2(n).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 4.)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-8\">The People respond that the defendant in <em>Allenby </em>presented this argument and, rather than ignoring it, the court clearly rejected it. Furthermore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number>People contend Advisory Opinion No. 312 is not a long-standing administrative application of the statute and is litigation inspired because it responds to a request during litigation from defense counsel in <em>Allenby. </em>Litigation-inspired opinions have no authority <em>(Bowen </em>v. <em>Georgetown University Hospital </em>(1988) 488 U.S. 204, 212 [109 S.Ct. 468, 473-474, 102 L.Ed.2d 493]), but generally courts have applied this rule only when the administrative agency is a party to the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\">The People also claim letters from the general counsel state the March 6, 1991, advisory opinion \u201cdid not express a direct opinion on preemption. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, according to the People, the letter from general counsel is not entitled to deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">The People\u2019s final argument against deferring to the CPSC\u2019s advisory opinion is the opinion\u2019s interpretation contravenes the language of the statute and regulations. We agree with this assertion and, for the reasons explained fully above, we find the CPSC\u2019s interpretation is \u201c \u2018plainly erroneous\u2019 \u201d and entitled to no deference. <em>(Stinson </em>v. <em>U.S. </em>(1993) 508 U.S. 36 [113 S.Ct. 1913, 1919, 123 L.Ed.2d 598]; <em>Dix </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 442, 460 [279 Cal.Rptr. 834, 807 P.2d 1063]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">For the foregoing reasons we find point of sale signs pursuant to Proposition 65 do not constitute \u201cdirections for use\u201d and are not preempted by the FHSA. We now turn to Cotter\u2019s claim of de facto labeling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">II. <em>Proposition 65 Is Not a De Facto Labeling Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">Even if point of sale signs are not labels, Cotter argues Proposition 65 can only be implemented by placing labels on a package; therefore, in practice, it is a labeling statute and preempted by the FHSA. Since the question of de facto labeling raises an issue of law and material fact, we independently review the evidence submitted to determine whether it raises a triable issue of material fact. <em>(Schrader </em>v. <em>Scott, supra, </em>8 Cal.App.4th 1679, 1684.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-9\">To establish a de facto labeling statute, Cotter must show it can only satisfy the requirements of Proposition 65 by using labels. <em>(Stratton, supra, </em>92 F.3d 807, 810 [to find preemption a party must show all possible methods of complying with Proposition 65 conflict with the FHSA].) Cotter cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1394\">*1394</page-number>establish de facto labeling merely by demonstrating it is difficult or costly to comply. Rather, it must show using point of sale signs is a \u201cphysical impossibility.\u201d (See <em>Allenby, supra, </em>958 F.2d 941, 948-949 [\u201c[F]or purposes of preemption analysis,\u201d the party arguing preemption must show \u201ca physical impossibility of complying\u201d with both Proposition 65 and the federal statute \u201cbefore succeeding on a claim that Proposition 65 is preempted on this theory.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">Cotter cites almost no legal authority to support its contention of de facto labeling, but claims point of sale signs cannot be used because they are ineffective and too expensive to implement. Cotter\u2019s evidence of \u201cphysical impossibility\u201d amounts to little more than submitting a number of conclusions, declarations, and opinions. Interestingly, Cotter fails to explain why, if point of sale signs are so costly and ineffective in communicating a message, manufacturers continue to use them to advertise their goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Cotter first argues the warnings required by Proposition 65 \u201cmust be reasonably calculated, considering the alternative methods available under the circumstances, to make the warning message available to the individual prior to exposure.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 12601, subd. (a).) Point of sale signs, he argues, are less effective than product labels in warning consumers. To support this claim he cites a footnote in <em>King </em>v. <em>E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co. </em>(D.Me. 1992) 806 F.Supp. 1030, 1037, footnote 4, which was later affirmed in an opinion minus the footnote in <em>King </em>v. <em>E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co. </em>(1st Cir. 1993) 996 F.2d 1346. The footnote merely stated \u201c[w]e can see no more effective way to warn potential users of the dangers of a product than by product labels.\u201d <em>(King </em>v. <em>E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co., supra, </em>806 F. Supp. at p. 1037, fn. 4.) This statement does not establish the ineffectiveness of point of sale signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">In addition to failing to demonstrate ineffectiveness, Cotter\u2019s argument is seriously flawed because a manufacturer does not have to use the best warning method to comply with Proposition 65. The court in <em>Ingredient Communication Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lungren </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1480, 1494 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 216] <em>(ICQ </em>confirmed Proposition 65 does not require a manufacturer to use the \u201c \u2018best\u2019 \u201d or most effective method, but merely demands a \u201creasonable\u201d method. Both the court in <em>ICC, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th 1480, 1486 and the safe harbor language set forth in the California Code of Regulations (tit. 22, \u00a7 12601, subd. (b)(1)(B)) approve of point of sale signs as a reasonable method.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>Cotter also claims a manufacturer cannot ensure a retailer will properly post the signs without incurring unacceptable costs to implement the program.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In support of this argument, Cotter stated it sent signs to its California members on March 1988 and January 1990. Moreover, in January 1994, it sent signs again<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and directed the members to place both signs \u201cclose to each of your own paint factory\u2019s products.\u201d Cotter also submitted deposition testimony of several retailers explaining the problems they had complying with the manufacturer\u2019s requests for them to post point of sale warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-4\">To counter Cotter\u2019s argument, AYS identified numerous paint and/or adhesive manufacturers complying with Proposition 65 warning signs. Many True Value Hardware stores did not follow instructions, the People contend, because Cotter did not adequately explain the proper placement of the signs.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The People claim once the retailers received explicit instruction about the appropriate location pursuant to the permanent injunction, the majority of those deposed testified they understood the directions and properly complied.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">In their final argument, the People maintain Cotter cannot argue de facto labeling because it did not attempt to follow the mandate in <em>ICC. </em>The court in <em>ICC </em>stated a manufacturer must adjust the warning system in light of operational experience and new facts when attempting to comply with Proposition 65. <em>(ICC, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th 1480, 1493.) AYS notified Cotter on December 10, 1992, that its stores were not providing warnings for their products containing toluene and Cotter should have taken appropriate steps to remedy the problem. Cotter, the People claim, can exercise a certain level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1396\">*1396</page-number>of control over the True Value Hardware stores because members of the cooperative must agree to observe Cotter\u2019s bylaws, policies, and procedures.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">We find the trial court did not err in finding \u201cProposition 65 does not impose a de facto labeling requirement on Cotter &amp; Company.\u201d Cotter has not established the physical impossibility of meeting Proposition 65 warning requirements with point of sale signs. Cotter may ultimately choose to use a label which complies with both Proposition 65 and the FHSA; however, choosing to use a label does not negate the viability of point of sale signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">The warning requirements of Proposition 65 may be satisfied by point of sale signs which are not \u201cdirections for use\u201d or labels under the FHSA. The FHSA, therefore, does not preempt Proposition 65. Additionally, Cotter has failed to prove it cannot use point of sale signs and has not established it cannot use point of sale signs to satisfy Proposition 65 warning requirements.

Of course, since this case does not involve FIFRA, we do not resolve this question.
