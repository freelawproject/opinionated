Appellant James Hughes Drake challenges orders of the family court awarding child support, attorney fees, and sanctions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Appellant James Hughes Drake (hereafter James) and Miriam J. Drake (hereafter Miriam) were married on November 6, 1945.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Their son, David James Drake (hereafter David), was born on November 8, 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">On March 23, 1960, an interlocutory judgment of divorce concerning James and Miriam\u2019s marriage was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court (No. D566797).) The final decree of divorce was entered on April 13, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">In 1971, David was diagnosed as suffering from chronic schizophrenia, paranoid type. James retired in 1980 and remarried. Beginning in 1983, David lived with Miriam in Houston, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">In 1983, Miriam created the David J. Drake 1983 Tmst (hereafter the tmst) to provide for David after her death. The residual beneficiaries of the tmst were Miriam\u2019s nephews, James R. Adamoli and Mark A. Adamoli, who were also designated the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">In 1988, David, through Miriam, his conservator, entered into a stipulated judgment with James in a civil case (Super. Ct. L.A. County, No. C644371). Under the terms of the judgment, James agreed to pay no less than $1,350 per month in child support and also to apply for Social Security retirement benefits, thereby enabling Miriam to seek federal disability benefits for David.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">On April 28, 1995, Miriam filed an application for an order to show cause for modification of child support and for attorney fees and costs in their divorce case (No. D566797). Miriam\u2019s application sought guideline child support with \u201cadd-ons\u201d pursuant to Family Code sections 4055, 4061, and 4062.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>The application contained the following allegations: After the 1988 stipulated judgment, David continued to suffer from progressive schizophrenia that rendered him unable to care for himself, but Miriam had implemented a beneficial and cost-effective treatment program for David. In 1991, on the advice of David\u2019s psychiatrist, Miriam had moved out of the Houston townhouse owned by James Adamoli that Miriam and David had shared. Due to Miriam\u2019s worsening health, she could no longer tend David, and she had hired a live-in cook and housekeeper to replace her. In addition, James Adamoli, who had lived with Miriam and David, had moved out of the Houston townhouse and could no longer offer cost-free residence there to Miriam and David. These changes had increased the costs of David\u2019s care to $5,584 per month. In 1994, Miriam had paid 68 percent of these costs and James had paid 24 percent, although James\u2019s income was approximately twice as large as Miriam\u2019s income. Miriam requested that the court increase James\u2019s monthly child support payments to between $3,200 and $3,400, and require that James pay her attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">On September 18, 1995, Miriam executed a will containing a \u201cpour over\u201d provision giving the substance of her estate to the trust. James and Mark Adamoli are the will\u2019s executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">On October 23, 1995, Miriam filed an amended request for relief seeking, inter alia, a security order, and a separate hearing on the issue of attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">On November 8, 1995, Miriam died. On November 21, 1995, James and Mark Adamoli applied for an order declaring them to be Miriam\u2019s successors in interest to her action for a modification of the child support order. James filed motions seeking to terminate the governing child support order and the proceedings to modify this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">At hearings in December 1995, the trial court substituted James and Mark Adamoli as Miriam\u2019s successors in interest, denied James\u2019s motion to terminate Miriam\u2019s action, ruled that the Family Code guidelines apply in cases involving adult children, and bifurcated the issue of attorney fees. The trial court made findings based on the guidelines,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but reserved certain issues for later determination, including whether changes in James\u2019s child support obligations should be effective as of the date Miriam filed her application for a modification of the obligation. Finally, the trial court ordered James to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>a total of $3,715 in child support per month on an interim basis pending an assessment of the trust estate, as well as a $30,000 interim award of attorney fees. James appealed from the written orders following these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">On April 5, 1996, the reserved issues concerning Miriam\u2019s petition came on for hearing. The trial court made findings pertinent to the guidelines,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and ordered James to pay a total of $3,670 per month in child support plus an arrearage for the period following May 1, 1995. The trial court also granted a security order requiring James to pledge securities worth $300,000 for David\u2019s benefit, and placing a lien on a parcel of real property owned by James. Finally, the trial court awarded the Adamolis another $10,000 in attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">James filed a motion for reconsideration of the security order. The Adamolis opposed this motion and requested $4,620 in sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">On May 1, 1996, the trial court denied James\u2019s motion for reconsideration and sanctioned James. James appealed from these rulings and the written orders following the April 5 and May 1 hearings. James\u2019s two appeals were subsequently consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">James contends that (1) the Adamolis were improperly deemed Miriam\u2019s successors in interest, (2) he has no obligation to support David, (3) the Family Code guidelines are inapplicable to cases involving adult children, (4) the trial court erred in calculating James\u2019s child support obligation under the guidelines, (5) the security order was an abuse of discretion, (6) the trial court improperly awarded attorney fees against James, (7) the trial court improperly awarded sanctions against James, (8) the retroactivity order was an abuse of discretion, and (9) the trial court improperly filed written orders prepared by the Adamolis that differed from its oral rulings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">\u201c \u2018[T]he trial court\u2019s determination to grant or deny a modification of a support order will ordinarily be upheld on appeal unless an abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>discretion is demonstrated.\u2019 [Citation.] Reversal will be ordered only if prejudicial error is found after examining the record of the proceedings below. [Citation.] However, questions relating to the interpretation of statutes are matters of law for the reviewing court. [Citation.]\u2019\u2019 <em>(County of Tulare </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 847, 850 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 902].)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">To the extent James challenges the trial court\u2019s factual findings, our review follows established principles concerning the existence of substantial evidence in support of the findings. On review for substantial evidence, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and give that party the benefit of every reasonable inference. <em>(In re Marriage of Catalano </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 543, 548 [251 Cal.Rptr. 370].) We accept all evidence favorable to the prevailing party as true and discard contrary evidence. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">\n<em>A. Successors in Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">The threshold issues concern whether Miriam\u2019s action against James to modify the support order abated with her death, and if not, whether the Adamolis were appropriately deemed her successors in interest.  Absent certain exceptions, the only parties to a family law action are the husband and wife. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1211.) Nonetheless, in suitable circumstances, the court may substitute in place of a deceased spouse an appropriate representative of the deceased\u2019s estate. <em>(In re Marriage of Allen </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1227-1228 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 916]; <em>Kinsler </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 808, 812 [175 Cal.Rptr. 564].)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">When the family court expressly reserves jurisdiction over collateral issues such as property rights, spousal support, costs, and attorney fees after rendering judgment dissolving a marriage, the death of a spouse does not abate the action or remove the family court\u2019s jurisdiction to resolve these issues. (See <em>In re Marriage of Allen, supra, </em>8 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1231-1235; see also <em>In re Marriage of Hilke </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 215, 220 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 371, 841 P.2d 891].) In such cases, \u201cthe proper procedure is to substitute the personal representative of the deceased spouse\u2019s estate (or, if none, the spouse\u2019s successor in interest) as a party to the <em>still-pending </em>action ([Code Civ. Proc.,] \u00a7\u00a7 377.31, 377.41), whereupon the reserved issues are properly decided under the Family Code.\u201d (Hogoboom &amp; King, Cal. Practice Guide: Family Law (The Rutter Group 1996) 13:20, p. 3-8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">No California court has addressed whether a successor in interest may step into the shoes of a custodial spouse when the custodial spouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>seeks postjudgment modification of a child support order but dies prior to resolution of the matter. We begin by noting that the 1960 interlocutory judgment of divorce includes a term requiring James to pay $100 per month in child support throughout David\u2019s minority, and that the family court retains jurisdiction to modify such child support orders after entry of a marital status judgment. (See Hogoboom &amp; King, Cal. Practice Guide: Family Law, <em>supra, \u00b6 </em>17:2, p. 17-1.) Furthermore, \u201c[a] pending action or proceeding does not abate by the death of a party if the cause of action survives\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 377.21), and \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided by statute, a cause of action for or against a person is not lost by reason of the person\u2019s death ....\u2019\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 377.20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">No statute provides that Miriam\u2019s cause of action against James is lost by virtue of her death. Moreover, a parent\u2019s statutory duty to support an incapacitated adult child runs to the child (see <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 573, 582, fn. 3 [205 Cal.Rptr. 605]; Fam. Code, \u00a7 3910), although this duty may be enforced by an action initiated by the other parent (see <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 582; Fam. Code, \u00a7 4000.) Because James\u2019s duty is to David, James\u2019s duty of support did not expire with Miriam\u2019s death. (Cf. <em>Chun </em>v. <em>Chun </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 589, 597 [235 Cal.Rptr. 553] [parents\u2019 duty to support disabled adult child \u201cis closely akin to a joint and several obligation\u201d]); <em>In re Marriage of Gregory </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 112, 116-117 [281 Cal.Rptr. 188] [noncustodial parent\u2019s court-ordered duty to support minor child does not terminate when the custodial parent dies].) We therefore conclude that Miriam\u2019s action did not abate with her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The remaining issue is whether the Adamolis were properly deemed Miriam\u2019s successors in interest within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 377.31, which provides that \u201c[o]n motion after the death of a person who commenced an action or proceeding, the court shall allow a pending action or proceeding that does not abate to be continued by the decedent\u2019s personal representative or, if none, by the decedent\u2019s <em>successor in </em>interest.\u201d (Italics added.) For the purposes of section 377.31, \u201c \u2018decedent\u2019s successor in interest\u2019 means the beneficiary of the decedent\u2019s estate or other successor in interest who succeeds to a cause of action or to a particular item of the property that is the subject of a cause of action.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7377.11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Here, Miriam\u2019s application sought child support from James sufficient to sustain the caring environment she had devised for David. Although Miriam brought her action in her own name, David, though not a party, was the real party in interest. (See <em>County of Shasta </em>v. <em>Caruthers </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>1838, 1847-1849 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 18]; <em>Ruddock </em>v. <em>Ohls </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 271, 281 [154 Cal.Rptr. 87] [interpreting prior law]; <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Everett </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 65, 69 [129 Cal.Rptr. 8] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The Adamolis were named the executors and beneficiaries of Miriam\u2019s will and, as trustees of the trust, were expressly charged with maintaining David\u2019s environment after her death, including taking necessary legal action to protect David\u2019s interests.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The terms of the trust clearly indicate that Miriam intended to create an instrument by which she could continue her parental care for David after her death. In view of these facts, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred in determining that the Adamolis were Miriam\u2019s appropriate successors in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">James contends that Miriam\u2019s action abated with her death, citing <em>In re Marriage of Williams </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 507 [161 Cal.Rptr. 808] and <em>In re Marriage of Lisi </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1573 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 623]. However, unlike the present case, the pertinent spouses in <em>Williams </em>and <em>Lisi </em>died before judgment of marriage dissolution. (See <em>In re Marriage of Williams, supra, </em>at p. 509; <em>In re Marriage of Lisi, supra, </em>at p. 1575.)</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">James also contends that the Adamolis could not be deemed Miriam\u2019s successors in interest until probate was completed. However, Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32 requires only that prospective successors certify that \u201c[n]o proceeding is . . . pending <em>in California </em>for the administration of the decedent\u2019s estate,\u201d a claim that was true when the Adamolis sought to become Miriam\u2019s successors in interest. (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">In sum, the trial court did not err in substituting the Adamolis in place of Miriam.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>B. <em>Duty to Support</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">James contends that he has no obligation to support David. In the case of a minor child, it is well established that \u201cparents bear the primary obligation to support their child and . . . resort may be had to the child\u2019s own resources for his basic needs only if the parents are financially unable to fulfill that obligation themselves.\u201d <em>(Armstrong </em>v. <em>Armstrong </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 942, 947 [126 Cal.Rptr. 805, 544 P.2d 941]; see Hogoboom &amp; King, Cal. Practice Guide: Family Law, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 6:411, p. 6-119.)  However, no case has addressed whether under the current statutory scheme, income from a trust established by one parent to support a disabled adult child directly discharges the other parent\u2019s statutory support duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The key issue presented here is whether income from the trust directly discharges James\u2019s support obligation under Family Code section 3910, which provides: \u201cThe father and mother have an equal responsibility to maintain, to the extent of their ability, a child of whatever age who is incapacitated from earning a living and without sufficient means.\u201d Although no court has interpreted the term \u201cwithout sufficient means,\u201d we observe that a parent\u2019s duty to support an adult child does not arise only when the child would otherwise be \u201c \u2018turned into the street\u2019 \u201d <em>(Chun </em>v. <em>Chun, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d at pp. 595-596), and that \u201c[t]he duty to support children of any age is legislatively designed \u2018to protect the public from the burden of supporting a person who has a parent . . . able to support him or her.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Lambe &amp; Meehan </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 388, 393 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 641], quoting <em>Chun </em>v. <em>Chun, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d at p. 594.) We therefore conclude that the question of \u201csufficient means\u201d should be resolved in terms of the likelihood a child will become a public charge. (Cf. <em>Chun </em>v. <em>Chun, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d at pp. 595-596 [Under preguideline law, that a mother fully supports a disabled adult child does not discharge the father\u2019s support duty in view of the statutory purpose \u201cof preventing a disabled person in need from becoming a public charge. [Citation.]\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Here, the record discloses substantial evidence that David is incapacitated and \u201cwithout sufficient means.\u201d There is no dispute that David cannot earn a living. Furthermore, although the evidence is in conflict, there is ample evidence that the trust will run dry long before David dies if the full burden of supporting David falls upon it, raising the prospect that David will become a public charge. Accordingly, the trial court properly concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>David fell within the class of children protected by Family Code section 3910, and that James owed a duty to support David.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">C. <em>Guidelines</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">James contends that the Family Code guidelines (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4050 et seq.) concerning child support are inapplicable in cases involving adult children. Here, the trial court determined James\u2019s total child support obligation pursuant to the guidelines by adding the results of two calculations. First, the trial court calculated James\u2019s basic support obligation by applying the guideline formula found in Family Code section 4055. Second, the trial court calculated James\u2019s share of responsibility for David\u2019s medical expenses and other add-on costs in accordance with Family Code sections 4061 and 4062. The focus of James\u2019s challenge is the guideline formula, although he contends that the guidelines as a whole cannot be applied to adult children.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">The applicability of the guidelines to adult children is an issue of first impression.  \u201cAbsent persuasive precedent on the issue, resolution of the question presented requires this court to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting [the guidelines]. Our analysis follows \u2018accepted rules for statutory construction, including the overriding objective of adherence to the intention of the Legislature [citation] and recognition of the principle that legislative intent is best determined by the language of the statute. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(County of Tulare </em>v. <em>Campbell, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at p. 853.)</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">We observe that Family Code section 4050 expressly provides: \u201cIn adopting the statewide uniform guideline . . . , it is the intention of the Legislature to ensure that this state remains in compliance with federal regulations for child support guidelines.\u201d The governing federal statutes accord each state the option of adopting guidelines and procedures that apply to adult children. (See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(e).) Accordingly, the issue is whether the guidelines encompass adult children.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">In our view, the express language of the pertinent Family Code sections resolves this question. With one exception, the Legislature uses the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>\u201cchild,\u201d rather than \u201cminor child,\u201d throughout these provisions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Family Code section 58 expressly defines the term \u201c \u2018[c]hild for whom support may be ordered\u2019 \u201d to cover a child falling under Family Code section 3910, that is, \u201ca child of whatever age who is incapacitated from earning a living and without sufficient means.\u201d Subdivision (a) of Family Code section 4055, which describes the guideline formula, terms it \u201c[t]he statewide uniform guideline for determining child support orders . . . .\u201d Section 4053 enumerates the principles the courts shall follow in implementing the guidelines, including the principle that \u201c[t]he guideline is intended to be presumptively correct in all cases, and only under special circumstances should child support orders fall below the child support mandated by the guideline formula.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4053, subd. (k).) Section 4057 provides that \u201c[t]he amount of child support established by the formula provided in . . . Section 4055 is presumed to be the correct amount of child support to be ordered,\u201d and that the presumption is rebutted only if the trial court finds by admissible evidence the presence of enumerated factors that render application of the formula \u201cunjust or inappropriate in the particular case . . . .\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4057, subd. (b).) Finally, Family Code section 4074 provides broadly that \u201c[t]his article applies to an award for the support of children, including those awards designated as \u2018family support,\u2019 that contain provisions for the support of children as well as for the support of the spouse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">In enacting most of these provisions, the Legislature also enacted two related provisions that <em>separately </em>establish the duties of a parent to support, respectively, a \u201cminor child\u201d and \u201ca child of whatever age who is incapacitated from earning a living and without sufficient means.\u201d (See Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3900, 3910.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We therefore infer that \u201cthe Legislature was fully aware of the need to differentiate between \u2018minor\u2019 children or \u2018adult\u2019 children . . . where it intended to limit applicability of a particular provision to minor children on the one hand or adult children on the other,\u201d and we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>that the Legislature\u2019s use of the unqualified word \u201cchild\u201d here \u201cmust be deemed to have been a conscious, deliberate choice intended to refer to any child owed a duty of support by a parent.\u201d <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.3d at p. 584.)</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">James contends that Family Code section 3910 displaces the guidelines with respect to adult child support awards, citing the principle that specific statutes prevail over general statutes. We disagree. If James\u2019s reasoning is correct, section 3900, which establishes parental duties of support towards minors, would also displace the guidelines with respect to minor child support awards, rendering the guidelines redundant. We decline to interpret the statutory scheme in a manner that leads to absurd consequences. <em>(County of Tulare </em>v. <em>Campbell, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at p. 853.)</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">James also contends for several reasons that applying the guideline formula to adult children such as David leads to incongruous results.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The common theme of these contentions is that the guideline formula embodies assumptions true of minor children, but not of disabled adult children. Before addressing the details of these contentions, we address their general theme. We recognize that the situations of disabled adult children and their parents may often differ from those typical of minor children and their parents. Furthermore, as we explain below, the guideline formula embodies various assumptions about children and their parents, as well as the Legislature\u2019s intent that the benchmark for the amount of child support should be the parents\u2019 standard of living.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Nonetheless, we do not agree that the guidelines are fatally inflexible with respect to the special circumstances of disabled adult children and their parents. Generally speaking, when any assumption operating through the guideline formula produces an \u201cunjust or inappropriate\u201d result \u201cdue to special circumstances in the particular case,\u201d Family Code section 4057 \u201ceffectively vests trial courts with considerable discretion to approach unique cases on an ad hoc basis. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(County of Lake </em>v. <em>Antoni </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1102, 1106 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 804]; see also <em>Estevez </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 423, 430-431 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 470].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>We therefore conclude that the guidelines permit the trial court to adapt or depart from the formula when warranted by the special circumstances of particular disabled adult children or their parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">James\u2019s first contention is that the guideline formula does not properly take into account the fact that adult children often have sources of support independent of their parents. He contends that the trust income should directly discharge or offset any support duty he has, citing <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Levy </em>(1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 341 [53 Cal.Rptr. 790] and <em>Lakenan </em>v. <em>Lakenan </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 615 [64 Cal.Rptr. 166].</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The general concern raised here is not persuasive.  We are aware that under the guideline formula the child\u2019s own estate, <em>as such, </em>is not a factor in computing the amount of child support owed by a parent. (Hogoboom &amp; King, Cal. Practice Guide: Family Law, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 6:411, p. 6-119.) This feature of the formula reflects \u201cthe legislative intent that children [should] share in the standard of living of both of their parents\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4054, subd. (g); see <em>Estevez </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th at p. 428), and the principle that \u201c[a] parent\u2019s first and principal obligation is to support his or her minor children according to the parent\u2019s circumstances and station in life\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4053, subd. (a)). Nonetheless, in suitable circumstances, the trial court may adjust parental support obligations in light of a child\u2019s independent income. (See Hogoboom &amp; King, <em>supra, </em>ffl 6:411 to 6:415, pp. 6-119 to 6-120.)  Accordingly, when a disabled adult child has independent income or assets, the trial court has the discretion to reduce the formula-calculated amount of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">In the context of this case, we do not discern any error in the manner in which the trial court used the trust income in the guideline formula. The trial court treated the trust as if it were one of David\u2019s parents in the formula calculation, rather than as an independent source of income available to David. In our view, this treatment was warranted by David\u2019s special circumstances. Here, Miriam\u2019s evident intention was that the trust should continue in her place after her death as a form of surrogate mother. The terms of the trust specifically directed the Adamolis to use the trust income to preserve and maintain the environment of care Miriam had designed and implemented for David before her death.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The record discloses ample evidence that James Adamoli had been personally supervising David\u2019s care in a manner similar to Miriam.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">Nor was the result unfair or inappropriate. On the basis of the resulting calculations, the trial court ordered James to pay $3,715 in child support per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>month on an interim basis, and later, $3,670 per month plus an arrearage. These monthly sums constitute between 66 and 70 percent of David\u2019s present monthly expenses, which the record indicates are $5,584 per month. The record also indicates that James\u2019s share of these expenses is roughly equivalent to James\u2019s share of the total net income jointly available to James and the trust (before support).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\"><em>Levy </em>and <em>Lakenan, </em>which predate the current statutory scheme, do not disturb our conclusion on this matter. In <em>Levy, </em>the court held that the trial court could assess income to a disabled adult child from all sources, including the child\u2019s own estate, in determining the father\u2019s child support obligation. <em>(Levy </em>v. <em>Levy, supra, </em>245 Cal.App.2d at pp. 355, 358.) Here, the trial court properly applied the holding in <em>Levy, </em>to the extent it remains viable under the current statutory scheme. In applying the guideline formula, the trial court assessed the income available to David from all sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">In <em>Lakenan, </em>the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in applying income to a minor child flowing from trusts established by a grandparent and an aunt as an offset against a parent\u2019s duty of support. <em>(Lakenan </em>v. <em>Lakenan, supra, </em>256 Cal.App.2d at pp. 621-623.) As we have explained, the trial court did not err in the circumstances of this case in assigning the trust income to the Adamolis\u2019 side of the guideline formula, rather than using it as a direct offset against James\u2019s support obligation. We find no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">James\u2019s second contention is that the guideline formula does not respect the terms of Family Code section 3910 because the formula does not take the totality of a parent\u2019s financial situation into account. Whereas Family Code section 3900 imposes a duty on parents of a minor child \u201cto support their child in the manner suitable to the child\u2019s circumstances,\u201d section 3910 imposes a duty on parents of an adult child \u201cto maintain[] [the child] to the extent of their ability . . . .\u201d James argues that determination of a parent\u2019s ability to pay adult child support requires an assessment of the totality of his or her financial circumstances, citing preguideline case authority concerning minor and adult children.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Again we cannot agree. The present statutory scheme limits the broad discretion accorded the trial court under prior law and channels its remaining discretion within the new statutory parameters. (See <em>In re Marriage of Carter </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1024, 1028 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 1].) With respect to the question concerning ability to pay, section 4053 states that in implementing the guidelines, the courts should adhere to the principle that \u201c[e]ach parent should pay for the support of the children according to his or her ability,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>without distinguishing between minor children and disabled adult children. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4053, subd. (d), italics added.) In view of section 4053 and the sweeping statutory language concerning the presumptive applicability of the guideline formula, we conclude that the Legislature has incorporated the appropriate assessment of ability to pay within the guidelines. As we have explained, the guidelines include an escape clause when this assessment produces an unfair or inappropriate result. No such result was presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">James\u2019s third contention is that the guideline formula is inapplicable to disabled adult children because it incorporates \u201ctime-sharing\u201d as a factor, although many disabled adult children, including David, are not in the custody of either parent. Again, we do not find any fatal inflexibility in the guideline formula concerning adjustments appropriate for cases involving children not under the supervision of either parent. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Moreover, in the circumstances of this case, the trial court did not err in according Miriam and her successors in interest credit for full physical responsibility for David under the guideline formula. \u201cThe time-sharing adjustment is based on the parents\u2019 respective periods of primary physical <em>'responsibility' </em>for the children rather than physical \u2018custody.\u2019 Use of this terminology is purposeful: i.e., to clarify that [section] 4050 et seq. is not intended to alter current child custody law in any manner.\u201d (Hogoboom &amp; King, Cal. Practice Guide: Family Law, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 6:168, p. 6-52.) The record here discloses substantial evidence that Miriam and her successors in interest have had full responsibility for David\u2019s physical situation and care, that James has no physical responsibility for David, and that James visited David only three times between May 1988 and June 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">James\u2019s fourth contention is that application of the guideline formula to disabled adult children precludes the trial court from issuing child support orders binding on both parents, in contravention of <em>Chun </em>v. <em>Chun, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d 589. In <em>Chun, </em>a preguideline case, the court held that the trial court should have ordered both parents to pay support for their disabled adult child, reasoning that the statutory support duty was imposed on both parents and the defendant father had cross-complained for a mutual order. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 592, 597-598.) James attributes the trial court\u2019s failure to issue a mutual support order to its application of the guideline formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">We are not persuaded that <em>Chun </em>poses an issue limited to disabled adult children. Under the present statutory scheme, the issue concerning mutual support orders arises for the duties of support imposed under Family Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>sections 3900 and 3910. These sections state that parents have an \u201cequal responsibility\u201d concerning, respectively, their minor and disabled adult children. Furthermore, Family Code section 3901 expressly states that the duty imposed under section 3900 <em>continues </em>with respect to certain children who have attained the age of 18 (see Fam. Code, \u00a7 3901, subd. (a)), and Family Code section 4001, which applies to actions arising under sections 3901 and 3910, provides that \u201c. . . the court may order <em>either or both </em>parents to pay an amount necessary for the support of the child.\u201d (Italics added.) However, the guideline formula calculates a <em>single </em>sum owed by one parent to the other. (See Hogoboom &amp; King, Cal. Practice Guide: Family Law, <em>supra, </em>^[6:177, p. 6-55.) Thus, sections 3900 and 3901, like section 3910, impose support duties on both parents, but the formula does not place a monetary figure on each parents\u2019 support duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">However, it is unnecessary for us to address this issue or the extent to which the current statutory scheme may abrogate the holding in <em>Chun. </em>Unlike the father in <em>Chun, </em>James did not file a petition for an order against Miriam or the Adamolis. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in failing to make such an order.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">James\u2019s final contentions strike a different theme, namely, that applying the guidelines was inequitable due to circumstances other than David\u2019s status as a disabled adult child. He contends that (1) the guideline-calculated support amount is too high due to James\u2019s \u201cextraordinarily high income\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4057, subd. (b)(3)), (2) the guideline calculations did not take into account that David\u2019s living expenses are lower in Texas, and (3) the guideline calculations did not take into account James\u2019s significant living expenses attributable to his new spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">These contentions do not disturb our conclusion that the trial court properly applied the guidelines. With respect to item (1), as we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>explained, the guideline formula did not produce an unjust or inappropriate result. Finally, on the record before us, we conclude that items (2) and (3) are meritless. (See Fam. Code, \u00a7 4804 [Providing in pertinent part that \u201c[djuties of support arising under the law of this state . . . bind the obligor, present in this state, regardless of the presence or residence of the obligee.\u201d]; <em>Haggard </em>v. <em>Haggard </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1566, 1572 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 638] [absent special circumstances, financial obligations due to new marriage do not rebut presumptive applicability of guideline formula].)</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">In sum, the trial court did not err in determining that the guidelines and guideline formula were applicable in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">D. <em>Guideline Factors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">James contends that in applying the guidelines, the trial court erred in (1) failing to give him a direct credit for the Social Security disability benefits paid to David, and (2) using his present wife\u2019s income figures in the guideline calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">With respect to item (1), the trial court charged the monthly disability benefits of $474 to the Adamolis\u2019 side of the guideline formula, indirectly reducing James\u2019s support obligation, rather than directly crediting these benefits as part of James\u2019s support payments. James does not dispute that the trial court\u2019s use of the disability benefits reduced his formula-calculated support duty from what it would have been had the benefits been disregarded altogether, but he contends that he was entitled to a greater reduction obtainable through a direct credit for these benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">The issue presented concerns Family Code section 4504, which provides that federal disability benefits arising from a noncustodial parent\u2019s retirement are credited against the noncustodial parent\u2019s child support obligations <em>\u201cunless </em>the payments made by the federal government were taken into consideration by the court in determining the amount of support to be paid by the noncustodial parent.\u201d (Italics added.) No case authority has addressed when the trial court may take federal benefits into account when determining child support, in lieu of extending a direct credit for these benefits. However, because \u201c[sjtatutes are to be interpreted to give significance to every word contained therein\u201d <em>(County of Tulare </em>v. <em>Campbell, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at p. 853), we conclude that the matter is consigned to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Here, the trial court charged the benefits to the Adamolis\u2019 side of the guideline formula in the course of making other adjustments to that side of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>the formula favorable to James, including increasing the trust\u2019s income figures by a sum equal to Miriam\u2019s living expenses (as if she were still alive). Furthermore, we observe that under the terms of the 1988 stipulated judgment, Miriam assumed the responsibility of applying for federal disability benefits for David\u2019s benefit. On this record, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">With respect to item (2), the record discloses that the trial court took the income of James\u2019s present wife into account only for the purpose of facilitating an income tax computation. This use of the income figure was proper. (See <em>In re Marriage of Carlsen </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 212, 218-219 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 630]; <em>County of Tulare </em>v. <em>Campbell, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at pp. 854-856.)</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">E. <em>Security Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">James contends that the trial court abused its discretion in issuing the security order. Family Code section 4012 provides that \u201c[u]pon a showing of good cause, the court may order a parent required to make a payment of child support to give reasonable security for the payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Here, the trial court found that (1) the court-ordered support was a charge upon James\u2019s estate, (2) David had an actuarial life expectancy of 37 years, (3) James had transferred some of his separate property to his present wife, and (4) James\u2019s transfers \u201creduces or minimizes his separate estate available to support [David] should [James] predecease his adult disabled child.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court granted a security order requiring James to pledge securities worth $300,000 for David\u2019s benefit, and placing a lien on a parcel of real property owned by James. The order states that James \u201cshall be free to trade, invest, and reinvest within said segregated separate account, and shall be entitled to receive and utilize all interest and dividends produced thereby for his own purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">The key legal issue presented here is whether the court-ordered child support is a charge upon James\u2019s estate. Family Code section 4007 provides: \u201cIf a court orders a person to make specified payments for support of a child during the child\u2019s minority, or until the child is married or otherwise emancipated, or until the death of, or the occurrence of a specified event as to, a child for whom support is authorized under Section 3901 or 3910, the obligation of the person ordered to pay support terminates on the happening of the contingency.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4007, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">No court has interpreted this statute in the context of court-ordered support for disabled adult children. However, in cases involving minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>children, it is settled that, absent the occurrence of a support-ending contingency cited in the pertinent child support order, such \u201csupport survives the death of the noncustodial parent and becomes a charge on his or her estate. [Citations.]\u201d (See <em>In re Marriage of Gregory, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d at p. 115.) Accordingly, we conclude that the support order will be a liability against James\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">James does not dispute that substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s findings concerning James\u2019s transfers of real property to his present wife and David\u2019s life expectancy. There is also no dispute that James was 71 years old when the trial court issued the security order. Furthermore, we observe that the trial court crafted its order so as to limit its effect on James\u2019s income stream. On this record, we do not discern an abuse of discretion with respect to the security order. (See <em>Franklin Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kitchens </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 623, 627-632 [57 Cal.Rptr. 652]; <em>Baylis </em>v. <em>Baylis </em>(1941) 48 Cal.App.2d 674, 679-680 [120 P.2d 89].)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">James challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling on many grounds. First, James contends the security order was unwarranted because James had a history of paying his court-ordered child support payments on time. Here, the trial court found \u201cgood cause\u201d for the security order in James\u2019s property transfers that reduced the prospect his estate could pay his support obligations after his death. The issue thus presented concerns the interpretation of the term \u201cgood cause\u201d within the meaning of Family Code section 4012.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">There is little case law on Family Code section 4012. However, in <em>Franklin Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kitchens, supra, </em>249 Cal.App.2d 623, the court concluded that an ancestor of this provision authorized the trial court to order a father to secure child support payments by carrying a life insurance policy, reasoning that the father\u2019s obligation was a charge against his estate and that he had little property to satisfy this obligation once he died. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 627-632.) Furthermore, we note that in <em>Baylis </em>v. <em>Baylis, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.2d 674, the court affirmed the trial court\u2019s imposition of a lien on a father\u2019s real property to secure child support payment, although there is no indication the father was derelict in making these payments. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 678, 679-680.) We therefore conclude that concerns about the ability of a parent\u2019s estate to pay child support following the parent\u2019s death may constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d to issue a security order.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">To the extent James\u2019s contention challenges the factual basis for the security order, it fails. \u201cWhere the issue on appeal is whether the trial court has abused its discretion, the showing necessary to reverse the trial court is insufficient if it presents facts which merely afford an opportunity for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>different opinion . . . <em>(Winick Corp. </em>v. <em>County Sanitation District No. 2 </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1170, 1176 [230 Cal.Rptr. 289].)</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Second, James contends that the security order was an impermissible attempt to enforce James\u2019s promise to provide for David in his will prior to James\u2019s death, citing <em>In re Marriage of Edwards </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 456 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 138]. The 1960 interlocutory judgment of divorce contains a term requiring James to \u201cexecute a Last Will and Testament which will provide that [David] . . . shall receive from [James] by way of devise or legacy upon [James\u2019s] death property from [James], or over which [James] has a power of appointment, having a value at least equal to that received by any other devisee or legatee described in said Last Will and Testament.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">The trial court\u2019s security order states that it was aware of <em>Edwards </em>and that the order does not rest on James\u2019s promise concerning his will. Upon review, we conclude that the security order does not contravene our decision in <em>Edwards. </em>In <em>Edwards, </em>we held that a contract to make a will cannot be specifically enforced before the promisor\u2019s death. (See 38 Cal.App.4th at pp. 460-462.) By contrast, the security order does not direct James to include any specific terms in his will, but ensures instead that James\u2019s estate will have some assets to meet his court-ordered child support obligation following his death. As we have explained, this obligation survives James\u2019s death. When James dies, his estate will be liable for accrued amounts of child support then owing, and it must continue to pay child support absent a modification of the court order due to changed circumstances. (See <em>In re Marriage of Bertrand </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 437, 439-440 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 151].)</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">Third, James contends that security orders under section 4012 are governed and limited by Family Code section 4550 et seq., which permits the trial court to order that advance deposits of child support be made up to a maximum of $6,000. (See Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4560, 4604, 4614.) We do not agree. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1185, 1188-1190 [267 Cal.Rptr. 519], concluded that the procedures for securing child support by lien and by deposit are distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Fourth, James contends that the security order improperly imposes a conservatorship on his assets without a hearing, citing <em>In re Marriage of Johnson </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 148 [184 Cal.Rptr. 444]. Again, we cannot agree. In <em>Johnson, </em>the court concluded the trial court erred in imposing a lien of indefinite duration on the entirety of the father\u2019s share of the community property due to the father\u2019s drinking problem. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 161-162.) The <em>Johnson </em>court found persuasive the father\u2019s contention that the lien effectively deprived him of any ability to acquire new property or start a new business. (See <em>ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>By contrast, the terms of the security order here have a limited effect on James\u2019s ability to invest and derive income from the pertinent assets. Moreover, when the court ruled, it had before it evidence that James\u2019s assets were valued at approximately $1.5 million, including approximately $790,000 in real and personal property. Thus, there was evidence the award concerned no more than 73 percent of James\u2019s assets, and probably less.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Fifth, James contends that the security order is an impermissible restraint on alienation under Civil Code section 711, which provides that \u201c[conditions restraining alienation, when repugnant to the interest created, are void.\u201d However, section 711 has no application to \u201cdisabling restraints established by express statute . . . .\u201d (4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Real Property, \u00a7 405, p. 593.)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Finally, James contends in conclusory terms that the security order violates his rights to due process and to equal protection of the laws. On this record, we do not discern unfairness, deprivation of procedural rights, or unequal application of the law that rises to a constitutional injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">In sum, the trial court did not err in issuing the security order.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">F. <em>Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">James contends that the trial court erred in awarding Miriam and her successors in interest their attorney fees. Family Code section 2030 provides: \u201cFor services rendered or costs incurred after entry of judgment, the court may award the attorney\u2019s fees and costs reasonably necessary to maintain or defend any subsequent proceeding, and may augment or modify an award so made, including after an appeal has been concluded.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 2030, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">Awards of attorney fees are reviewed for abuse of discretion. (See <em>In re Marriage of Ananeh-Firempong </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 272, 279-280 [268 Cal.Rptr. 83].) Guidance concerning the use of the trial court\u2019s discretion is found in Family Code section 2032, which provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) The court may make an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs under Section 2030 . . . where the making of the award, and the amount of the award, are just and reasonable under the relative circumstances of the respective parties. [\u2018JO (b) In determining what is just and reasonable under the relative circumstances, the court shall take into consideration the need for the award to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>enable each party, to the extent practical, to have sufficient financial resources to present the party\u2019s case adequately .... The fact that the party requesting an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs has resources from which the party could pay the party\u2019s own attorney\u2019s fees and costs is not itself a bar to an order that the other party pay part or all of the fees and costs requested. Financial resources are only one factor for the court to consider in determining how to apportion the overall cost of the litigation equitably between the parties under their relative circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">In view of Family Code section 2032, \u201c[a] <em>disparity </em>in the parties\u2019 respective circumstances may itself demonstrate relative \u2018need\u2019 even though the applicant spouse admittedly has the funds to pay his or her fees.\u201d (Hogoboom &amp; King, Cal. Practice Guide: Family Law, <em>supra, </em>\u00b614:159, p. 14-35, original italics.) In assessing one party\u2019s relative \u201cneed\u201d and the other party\u2019s ability to pay, the court may consider all evidence concerning the parties\u2019 current incomes, assets, and abilities, including investment and income-producing properties. (See <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 14:160.) Furthermore, in determining whether to award attorney fees to one party, the court may also consider the other party\u2019s trial tactics. (See <em>In re Marriage of Dick </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 144, 166-168 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 743] [$750,000 award affirmed under predecessor of section 2032 because the record \u201creveals a case of stunning complexity, occasioned, for the most part, by husband\u2019s intransigence\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">During the December 1995 hearings, the Adamolis requested an interim attorney fee award of at least $35,000.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court awarded the Adamolis a $30,000 interim award of attorney fees \u201cwithout prejudice [and] subject to redecision and correction\u201d upon the Adamolis\u2019 representation that Miriam\u2019s assets were then inaccessible. On April 5, 1996, the issue of attorney fees came on for hearing and final resolution. The Adamolis requested an additional award of $45,000 pursuant to Family Code sections 2030 and 271.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The trial court determined that the prior award was proper, and that the Adamolis were entitled to another $10,000 in attorney fees under section 2030 in view of \u201cthe needs and abilities of both of the parties and the disparity between the estates, both [szc] income and the larger picture of total assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>The trial court\u2019s conclusion concerning James\u2019s assets and income is supported by substantial evidence. The record discloses that James\u2019s assets and monthly gross income are, respectively, $1.5 million and $15,353, whereas after payment of estate taxes, the trust\u2019s assets and monthly gross income are, respectively, $925,000 and $5,985.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">In sum, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">G. <em>Sanctions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">James contends that the trial court erred in awarding sanctions after denying his motion for reconsideration. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, a party seeking reconsideration of a prior ruling upon an alleged different set of facts must \u201cprovide both newly discovered evidence and an explanation for the failure to have produced such evidence earlier. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Robbins </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 313, 317 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 649].) Subdivision (d) of section 1008 provides that \u201c[a] violation of this section may be punished . . . with sanctions as allowed by Section 128.5.\u201d An action or tactic is subject to sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 only if it is in bad faith and is frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay. <em>(Dolan </em>v. <em>Buena Engineers, Inc. </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1500, 1505-1507 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 903].) Sanction awards are reviewed for abuse of discretion. (See <em>Winick Corp. </em>v. <em>County Sanitation District No. 2, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d at p. 1176.)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Here, the trial court awarded sanctions, finding that \u201c. . . [James\u2019s] action of filing a Motion for Reconsideration . . . without showing new or different facts, and without providing any explanation for not having earlier produced the facts proffered . . . constitutes a bad faith tactic which was totally and completely without merit and frivolous within the meaning of [Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5].\u201d The record discloses that James filed his motion one week after the hearing on the security order, alleging as a different set of facts that the security order concerned approximately one-half of his assets. He submitted a declaration from a real estate broker that the affected real property was worth $440,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">On the record before us, we do not discern an abuse of discretion. No credible explanation was offered concerning James\u2019s failure to obtain this evidence earlier. Moreover, because the trial court had before it evidence that the security order touched no more than 73 percent of James\u2019s assets when it issued the security order (see pt. E., <em>ante), </em>the purported newly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>discovered facts were not material to a reconsideration of the ruling. When an action utterly lacks merit, the trial court is entitled to infer that the action was taken in bad faith. <em>(Dolan </em>v. <em>Buena Engineers, Inc., supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at p. 1505.)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">James contends that the sanctions award was improper because section 128.5 is applicable only to \u201cactions or tactics [that] arise from a complaint filed, or a proceeding initiated, on or before December 31, 1994\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 128.5, subd. (b)(1)), and Miriam\u2019s petition was filed in April 1995. However, because the underlying divorce action here was filed in 1960 or earlier, the sanctions award was not barred by the section 128.5 time limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">In sum, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">H. <em>Retroactivity Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">James contends in conclusory terms that the trial court erred in ordering him to pay an arrearage for the period following the filing of Miriam\u2019s petition. Family Code section 4009 provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a]n order for child support may be made retroactive to the date of filing the notice of motion or order to show cause . . . .\u201d We observe that Miriam\u2019s petition alleges that as of the date of the petition, she was bearing a disproportionately large share of David\u2019s expenses, and the record contains substantial evidence to support this allegation. David\u2019s care cost $5,584 per month, of which Miriam had paid approximately 68 percent, even though James\u2019s income was approximately twice as large as Miriam\u2019s income. Accordingly, we conclude that the retroactivity order was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">I. <em>Written Orders</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">Finally, James contends that three of the trial court\u2019s written orders on the aforementioned matters are infirm because they differ from the trial court\u2019s oral rulings. Following the trial court\u2019s rulings at the hearings in December 1995, April 1996, and May 1996, the Adamolis prepared written orders to which James objected. The trial court held hearings on James\u2019s objections to the first two proposed orders and filed them, with some modifications. James did not request a hearing on his objections to the third proposed order, which the trial court filed as prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">The crux of James\u2019s contention is that the trial court improperly allowed the Adamolis to modify the trial court\u2019s original rulings. Our analysis of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>contention follows established principles.  A trial court\u2019s oral ruling on a motion does not become effective until it is filed in writing with the clerk or entered in the minutes. <em>(Pacific Home </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 855, 857 [264 P.2d 544]; <em>Ketscher </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 601, 604 [88 Cal.Rptr. 357]; see 7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Judgment, \u00a7 51, pp. 488-489; <em>id. </em>\u00a7 56, pp. 492-493.) Accordingly, the trial court may properly file a written order differing from its oral rulings when the rulings have not been entered in the minutes of the court. (See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Stein </em>(1956) 145 Cal.App.2d 381, 385 [302 P.2d 403].) Furthermore, when the trial court\u2019s minute order expressly indicates that a written order will be filed, only the written order is the effective order. (See 7 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 56, pp. 492-493; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Nothing in the record before us shows that the trial court\u2019s oral rulings became effective before the relevant written orders were filed. The record does not disclose that the trial court\u2019s oral rulings following the December hearings were entered by minute order. Moreover, the minute orders for the April and May hearings direct the Adamolis to prepare written orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Because only the written orders were effective, the trial court did not err in filing written orders that differed from its earlier oral rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">The trial court\u2019s orders are affirmed. Respondents are to recover their costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Vogel (C. S.), P. J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">On April 18, 1997, the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 11, 1997.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-13\">Because the key parties share a surname, we refer to them by their proper names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b891-9\">The trial court found that James\u2019s gross income was approximately $15,000 per month, applied the trust income to the Adamolis\u2019 side of the guideline calculation, and determined that James\u2019s basic support obligation was $1,924. In addition, the trial court also found that David\u2019s add-on expenses for medical care and treatment totalled $3,582 per month, which it allocated equally between James and the trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b892-10\">At this hearing, the trial court again applied the trust\u2019s income to the Adamolis\u2019 side of the guideline calculation. The trial court found that James\u2019s basic child support obligation was $1,879 per month, and that he was responsible for add-on expenses of $1,791 per month.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b892-11\">We observe that James also contends the trial court erred in resolving the matters before it on the basis of declarations rather than on the basis of oral testimony. Section 2009 of the Code of Civil Procedure accords trial courts discretion to determine an order to show cause upon declarations alone, and to exclude or admit oral testimony. (See <em>Reifler </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 479, 483-485 [114 Cal.Rptr. 356].) Because James did not object to this procedure before the trial court, he has waived this contention of error. (See 9 Wilkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7\u00a7 305-310, pp. 316-321.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Miriam modified the terms of the trust on November 3, 1995, just prior to her death. The amended trust instrument provides that following Miriam\u2019s death, \u201cthe Trustee . . . shall pay to or apply for the benefit of [Miriam\u2019s] son, [David], as much of the income and principal of the Trust as the Trustee, in the Trustee\u2019s discretion, considers necessary for his proper support, care, maintenance, health, and education. The Trustee may also pay or apply income or principal for reasonable legal fees and expenses to pursue any legal action or actions deemed necessary or advisable for the benefit of [David]. Any income of the Trust that is not distributed . . . shall be accumulated and added to the principal.\u201d Furthermore, the modified terms provide that \u201c[i]t is the direction of [Miriam] that, for so long as is reasonably possible, [David] shall be maintained in a living environment the same as or similar to the environment that [Miriam] has provided for him, to wit: his living in a private dwelling place under constant supervision by competent companions.\u201d Finally, the amended terms state that \u201c[i]n making payment or application of principal or income to or for [David], the Trustee shall take into consideration any other resources available to [David], in addition to the income and principal of the Trust Estate, including the resources of [James] . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b897-10\">We observe that this evidence was not before the trial court when it ordered interim child support. Nonetheless, the trial court received this evidence prior to its final ruling on child support. Because the trial court properly awarded child support retroactively (see pt. I., <em>post) </em>and credited James\u2019s interim child support payments against this arrearage, we conclude that any error here was not prejudicial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b898-5\">In section 4053, the Legislature enumerated a set of principles \u201cthe courts shall adhere to\u201d \u201c[i]n implementing the statewide uniform guideline . . . .\u201d All but one principle is couched in terms of the unqualified term \u201cchildren.\u201d The exception is that \u201c[a] parent\u2019s first and principal obligation is to support his or her minor children according to the parent\u2019s circumstances and station in life.\u201d (See Fam.

(See 170 Cal.App.3d at pp. 884-885.)
