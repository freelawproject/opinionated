Resources Code, \u00a7 4511 et seq. as amended; undesignated section references are to that code) generally requires submission of a timber harvest plan (THP), for review by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (department or CDF) and an opportunity for public review and input, before logging operations may be conducted.  Since 1976, the THP process as implemented by regulations promulgated under the Act by the State Board of Forestry (board or BOF) has been certified as the functional equivalent of the environmental impact report (EIR) process which otherwise would be required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA; \u00a7 21000 et seq.). <em>(T.R.E.E.S. </em>v. <em>Department of Forestry &amp; Fire Protection </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1175, 1180 [285 Cal.Rptr. 26].) CDF reviews THP\u2019s to ensure compliance with the Act, its regulations (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7\u00a7 895-1663.9; hereafter cited as rule(s) or forest practice rule(s)) and unsupplanted provisions of CEQA. <em>(Environmental Protection Information Center </em>v. <em>Department of Forestry &amp; Fire Protection </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1011, 1014 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 892] <em>(EPIC).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">But the Act also authorizes BOF to adopt regulations exempting specified activities from the THP process. \u201cUpon determining the exemption is consistent with the purposes of this chapter\u201d (i.e., \u00a7\u00a7 4511-4628), for example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>the board may exempt \u201c[t]he cutting or removal of dead, dying, or diseased trees of any size\u201d (\u00a7 4584, subd. (c)). The board may also define \u201cemergencies\u201d like \u201cthe necessity to harvest to remove fire-killed or damaged timber or insect or disease-infested timber,\u201d which then allows an owner to file with CDF a \u201cdeclaration of emergency\u201d\u2014an \u201c \u2018emergency notice\u2019 . . . that shall allow immediate commencement of timber operations\u201d (\u00a7 4592).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The board has promulgated regulations for both categories. Rule 1038, titled \u201cExemption,\u201d allows the submission of a sworn exemption for harvesting \u201cdead, dying or diseased trees of any size ... in amounts less than 10 percent of the average volume per acre\u201d provided 10 limiting conditions are met.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rule 1052, entitled \u201cEmergency Notice,\u201d requires a sworn declaration of \u201cbona fide emergency\u201d requiring emergency operations. The notice must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>describe specific conditions constituting the emergency, its cause, the \u201creason for immediate commencement,\u201d the scope, manner and dates of intended operations, and other information.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As amended in December 1995, both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>rules give CDF five working days to assess whether a notice (exemption or emergency) is complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The case before us grows out of salvage operations proposed by Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (L-P) in the Greenwood Creek watershed area near the coastal town of Elk, in Mendocino County. In late August 1993, L-P filed (1) an exemption notice (1-93EX-1135 MEN; rule 1038) for 1380 acres, citing a need to salvage dead, dying or diseased trees prompted by \u201cblow down\u201d damage from a windstorm in February of that year, and (2) an emergency notice (1-93EM-043 MEN; rule 1052) for a smaller, 109-acre parcel of more concentrated damage from the same storm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> CDF acknowledged both notices within a week, as L-P continued working with community representatives on local concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">In mid-September, the Elk County Water District and the Greenwood Watershed Association, an affiliate of a nonprofit corporation Redwood Coast Watershed Alliance, filed this action in superior court for writ of mandate and injunctive and declaratory relief. They named CDF as respondent and L-P as real party in interest, but did not name EOF. They alleged CDF had wrongfully failed to (1) deny approval, (2) require a THP to assess significant environmental impacts, and (3) assess whether an exemption or emergency situation existed. One allegation was that \u201cthe Forest Practice Act and Rules regarding exemptions and emergency operations are not the functional equivalent of an EIR.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The court immediately issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) which, given short durations for the exemption and emergency notices, rendered the proposed operations infeasible. A stipulation in September between petitioners and L-P acknowledged this reality and memorialized L-P\u2019s decision not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>to attempt operations under the notices, except for some erosion control work unaffected by the TRO. This development, of course, mooted any need for relief specific to the notices. <em>(Environmental Protection Information Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Maxxam Corp. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1373, 1380 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 665].)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">The matter was heard on the merits in March 1995, by a different judge, and was submitted on arguments and documents, without testimony. In her points and authorities, petitioners\u2019 counsel had argued in part that BOF\u2019s \u201ccurrent rules\u201d were \u201cnot sufficient\u201d and that a court was obliged to strike down regulations which were null and void. When the judge asked whether she was seeking to \u201cinvalidate the current rule[s] ... as being inconsistent with CEQA,\u201d she answered: \u201cYes. And, Your Honor, the Supreme Court just did that in a very related case. . . .\u201d She clarified, \u201cSpecifically, the relief requested is not to invalidate rules,\u201d but conceded, \u201cThat will be the effect, Your Honor. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">By a written decision, the court (1) found BOF an indispensable party whose absence precluded reaching the validity of that agency\u2019s exemption and emergency rules, (2) rejected arguments that CDF had to discretionarily review notices, under either the Forest Practice Act or CEQA, and (3) rejected, as unproved, allegations of irreparable injury and widespread abuse of the notice practice. Petitioners (collectively Elk) appeal the ensuing judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The court correctly ruled BOF an indispensable party. The Act charges BOF with rulemaking authority (\u00a74551), including authority to define the exempt activity (\u00a7 4584) and emergency (\u00a7 4592) categories at issue here; CDF has only enforcement authority (\u00a74119). Any judgm\u00e9nt declaring a BOF exemption or emergency rule invalid would therefore have left the promulgating agency unbound and the affected party, CDF, still charged with the rules\u2019 enforcement. The board was thus an indispensable party (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 389, subd. (a); cf. <em>Save Our Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Diego Unified Port Dist. </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 686, 692-693 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 847]; <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Bodeman </em>(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 833, 839 [222 Cal.Rptr. 435]; <em>Sierra Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 495, 500 [157 Cal.Rptr. 190]), and the court was within its equitable discretion to proceed instead \u201camong the parties before it\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 389, subd. (b)) and not adjudicate the rules\u2019 validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Elk\u2019s only direct retorts are these: (1) the board exists \u201cin the department\u201d (\u00a7 730) and so assertedly need not be separately served; and (2) its counsel represented at the hearing below that a Ms. Bakus, former opposing counsel from the Attorney General\u2019s office, had \u201cindicated\u201d a year earlier \u201cshe would not take the position that the Board was an indispensable party and preferred that we go this way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Neither point is persuasive. Ms. Bakus\u2019s claimed representation was disputed by current opposing counsel at the hearing, who understandably questioned whether counsel for CDF would even have power to bind BOF to such a \u201cwaiver.\u201d Elk also cites us no authority supporting estoppel or any other theory which might overcome the defect. Elk likewise cites no authority holding one agency bound by a ruling affecting another simply because of an organizational relationship found only in code structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Counsel for Elk cites another of her mandamus cases, <em>Sierra Club </em>v. <em>County of Sonoma </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1307 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 473], as authority that one need only name a county to secure review of the acts of the county\u2019s board of supervisors. Even if the analogy fit, however, no such issue was raised or addressed in that opinion, which leaves it without precedential value on the point <em>(Canales </em>v. <em>City of Alviso </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 118, 128, fn. 2 [89 Cal.Rptr. 601, 474 P.2d 417]).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">We, like the trial court, therefore decline to assess the validity of the board\u2019s rules. As a backup position, Elk offers a strategic course correction it also offered below. Elk reasons we can leave BOF\u2019s rules intact\u2014despite their lack of provision for CDF review of impacts, emergencies and exemptions\u2014and impose review requirements judicially, as compelled by CEQA. This proposal has the sour stench of sophistry, for the requested judicial construction would obviously leave the rules functionally invalid. Nevertheless, we proceed briefly to refute the CEQA argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Elk frames its arguments variously, but we distill their essence as follows: (1) CEQA\u2019s provision authorizing the certification of \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d programs (\u00a7 21080.5) mandates public review and comment which the Forest Practice Act, as implemented, lacks; (2) a certified program only supplants select provisions of CEQA, and CEQA\u2019s own exemption and emergency provisions are found in other, unsupplanted sections; (3) the 1976 certification of the Forest Practice Act does not specifically refer to emergencies or exemptions under the Act; (4) those provisions should therefore be deemed \u201cnot a part of the certified regulatory program, but within a class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>of \u2018categorical\u2019 exemptions\u201d governed by CEQA; and (5) this construction better protects the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">CDF and L-P cumulatively offer this analytic framework in response: (1) exempt and emergency operations are not \u201cprojects\u201d within CEQA; (2) if they are, they are not \u201cdiscretionary\u201d ones which CDF must \u201capprove\u201d; (3) they are, in any event, exempt as falling within the certified regulatory program; (4) any challenge to that certification is time-barred; and (5) if CEQA does govern exempt and emergency timber operations, it does not mandate public notice and review, as Elk supposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Leaving some questions aside, we affirm the judgment by holding the exemption and emergency provisions do fall within the certified regulatory program. Because the issues of statutory and regulatory interpretation subsumed within that analysis are purely legal <em>(Simplicity Pattern Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 900, 905 [167 Cal.Rptr. 366, 615 P.2d 555]) and unaffected by any factfinding below, we apply our independent judgment, though noting the trial court correctly reached the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Elk\u2019s point about a certified regulatory program (\u00a7 21080.5) mandating public review and comment which the Forest Practice Act and regulations lack, is unnecessary to address on the merits. Even if Elk were right, the exemption and emergency provisions (\u00a7\u00a7 4584, 4592) and implementing rules were a part of the regulatory program when it was certified under CEQA in January 1976 as functionally equivalent to the EIR process. To argue deficiencies in the program now is to argue them 20 years too late <em>(Laupheimer </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 440, 458-459 [246 Cal.Rptr. 82]; \u00a7 21080.5, subd. (h)(1) [action to attack certification as not in compliance must be brought within 30 days]). Moreover, as already explained (pt. I, <em>ante), </em>Elk cannot attack the rules themselves, as noncomplying, for the additional reason that the promulgating agency, BOF, is not a party here.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Also, this court has recently noted the Legislature\u2019s repeated amendments to the exemption provisions of the Act (\u00a7 4584) \u201cfive separate times [between 1973 and 1994], each time adding new specific exemptions to the general requirement of a THP. . . .\u201d <em>(EPIC, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th 1011, 1015.) The Legislature is presumed to be aware of long-standing administrative practice, and its failure to modify the Act in the ways Elk stresses here indicates acquiescence in that practice as consistent with legislative intent. <em>(Coca-Cola Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd of Equalization </em>(1945) 25 Cal.2d 918, 922 [156 P.2d 1]; <em>Horn </em>v. <em>Swoap </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 375, 382 [116 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>113].) The Act\u2019s emergency provision (\u00a7 4592) has likewise been amended twice (Stats. 1976, ch. 1300, \u00a7 97, pp. 5841-5842; Stats. 1994, ch. 746, \u00a7 4) without pertinent change.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The only question then is whether, as Elk claims, the exemption and emergency provisions fall <em>outside </em>the certified regulatory program. Looking first to the seven-page certification document of January 6, 1976, by the Secretary of Resources, Elk notes the document makes no specific mention of the Forest Practice Act exemption or emergency provisions or implementing rules. We find this unremarkable given the document\u2019s brevity and focus on the specific compliance criteria set out in section 21080.5, which do not specifically address exemptions or emergencies. We are cited no authority demanding specific mention in the certification to qualify for inclusion in a regulatory program. Were that so, most of the THP process would be outside the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Elk\u2019s other argument relies on the continued partial applicability of CEQA following program certification. \u201cUnder the terms of section 21080.5, subdivision (c), . . . certification expressly exempts the timber harvesting plan process from the provisions of chapters 3 and 4 and section 21167 of CEQA. (\u00a7 21080.5, subd. (c).) Chapters 3 and 4 deal, in large part, with the various requirements of an EIR at both the state level (chapter 3) and the local level (chapter 4). Section 21167 sets forth the time within which an action challenging a public agency\u2019s decision under the provisions of CEQA must be filed. [\u00b6| Under the maxim of statutory construction, <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>if exemptions are specified in a statute, we may not imply additional exemptions unless there is a clear legislative intent to the contrary. [Citation.] CEQA is a legislative act, and the Legislature both had and retains the authority to limit the projects to which CEQA applies. It has specified in section 21080 those projects that are categorically exempt from CEQA. (\u00a7 21080, subd. (b)(l)-(16).) Moreover, it has vested in the Secretary of the Resources Agency the authority to identify those projects that do not, as a class, have a significant effect on the environment and which are, as a consequence, exempt from the provisions of CEQA. (\u00a7 21084, subd. (a).) The Legislature has not included timber harvesting operations within any of the classes of projects that are exempt from CEQA under sections 21080 and 21084. We therefore reject [the idea] that timber harvesting is \u2018exempt\u2019 from CEQA. Section 21080.5 compels instead the conclusion that timber harvesting in this state is exempt only from chapters 3 and 4 of CEQA and from section 21167 of that act.\u201d <em>(Sierra Club </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Forestry </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1230-1231 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 19, 876 P.2d 505], fn. omitted <em>(Sierra Club).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Thus authority was found in <em>Sierra Club </em>for CDF to request additional information from a harvester about old-growth-dependent wildlife species within a THP area. While the forest practice rules did not specify such information as among the exclusive criteria for approving a THP (see \u00a7 4582.75), a request for information was not \u201ca <em>criterion </em>for reviewing a [THP],\u201d but \u201cinstead a prerequisite to application of the criteria established by the board, in particular, [a] rule requiring the director to disapprove those plans which do not incorporate procedures to substantially lessen significant adverse impacts on the environment. ([Rule] 898.1, subd. (c)(1).)\u201d <em>(Sierra Club, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th 1215, 1232-1233.) Authority to request the information was found in CEQA\u2019s section 21160 (found in nonexempt chapter 5), which likewise authorized a public agency to require the submission of information needed to determine whether a proposed project might have a significant effect on the environment. (7 Cal.4th at pp. 1231, 1233-1235.)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Elk would extend that rationale here, but there is no direct correlation. No THP is needed, of course, for the exempt and emergency operations at issue here; if CDF \u201cmay,\u201d under CEQA, require information disclosing possible environmental effects (\u00a7 21160), this would hardly create a mandatory duty on the department to do so; Elk\u2019s concern in any event is public notice and comment, and nothing in the Forest Practice Act or rules requires that.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Elk offers an indirect correlation, in this manner: (1) certification leaves the THP process exempt from CEQA\u2019s chapters 3 and 4 relating to EIR\u2019s; (2) CEQA\u2019s provisions for emergency and categorical exemptions from EIR\u2019s (\u00a7\u00a7 21080, 21084) are found in chapter 2.6 (\u00a7 21080 et seq.); (3) the Forest Practice Act exemptions should likewise be considered not part of the exempt regulatory program but controlled by CEQA; and (4) CEQA requires public review for significant environmental effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The reasoning stumbles badly on point (3). Although the provisions for EIR exemptions are found in chapter 2.6 rather than the expressly exempt chapters 3 and 4, it does not follow that THP exemptions are controlled by chapter 2.6. A certification which exempts timber harvesting from the EIR process and substitutes the THP process, as a functional equivalent, exempts by implication those categories of activities which the THP process itself exempts. We also agree with the court below, which noted, \u201c[Elk\u2019s contrary argument] leads to the illogical conclusion that exempt activity involving what is surely considered relatively inconsequential activity is subject to EIR procedures while full scale logging activity is not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Elk relies on a 1985 augmentation of the forest practice rules\u2014chapter 12 entitled \u201cRegulations for the Implementation of [CEQA]\u201d (rule 1660 et <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>seq.)\u2014which created as a categorically exempt activity the \u201cEstablishment, modification, or dissolution of zones of insects, disease, or animal infestation or infection. . . .\u201d (Rule 1662.6, subd. (b).) Noting the rule postdates the 1976 THP-program certification and broadly concerns \u201cProtection of Natural Resources,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Elk contends rule 1662 \u201cencompasses all exemptions subject to this appeal\u201d and thus controls the THP exemptions specified in the Forest Practice Act and brings into play the asserted public review requirements of CEQA.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">We disagree. Elk\u2019s facile logic, while purportedly affecting only \u201cexemptions subject to this appeal,\u201d in fact would apparently reach <em>any </em>exemption, for all of them could be characterized as somehow relating to environmental protection. Indeed, all of the Forest Practice Act itself broadly deals with protection of the environment, as does all of CEQA. We see no indication that chapter 12 of the forest practice rules was meant to swallow up all exemptions of the former act within CEQA\u2019s exemption processes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Next, the \u201cpublic review\u201d assumption (part (4)) of Elk\u2019s rationale is overstated. CEQA guidelines do ask a public agency to scrutinize categorically exempt activities which in unusual circumstances may have significant effects due to considerations like particularly sensitive habit or cumulative impacts. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15300.2; <em>Dunn-Edwards Corp. </em>v. <em>Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 656 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 850].) Elk cites no authority, however, compelling an agency to give notice or hold a public hearing on how it should exercise that discretion, and case law is to the contrary. <em>(Association for Protection etc. Values </em>v. <em>City of Ukiah </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 720, 731-732 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 488].) Similarly, emergency exemptions under CEQA are given agency scrutiny for true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u201cemergency\u201d status, but case law holds the question of adverse impacts irrelevant to that process. <em>(Western Mun. Water Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1104, 1113-1114 [232 Cal.Rptr. 359].)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Finally, Elk\u2019s policy plea\u2014that the environment would be better protected by having public review and input\u2014is appealing but addressed to the wrong forum. The existing certified program, as authorized by the Legislature, does not require it, and \u201c. . . it is the board, and not the court, that establishes forest policy.\u201d <em>(Public Resources Protection Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Forestry &amp; Fire Protection </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 111, 120 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 11, 865 P.2d 728].)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Elk requests we take judicial notice (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 452 &amp; 453) of \u201cfederal documents relating to water quality impacts relative to timber harvesting exemptions and the Elk County Water District . . . .\u201d In fact, these are two letters, one each from the regional administrators of two federal agencies (United States Environmental Protection Agency and United States Deptartment of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service) expressing only general concern over lack of environmental review of possible impacts of exempt or emergency salvage logging on marine habitat generally. Neither letter addresses the proposed timber operations at issue here, and Elk offers no analysis whatsoever to support the propriety of our taking judicial notice, particularly the letters\u2019 relevance and competence as evidence. <em>(Mangini </em>v. <em>R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1057, 1063-1064 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 358, 875 P.2d 73].) We deny the request for those reasons alone. Also, our analysis in part II is the same even if we assume a general risk of significant environmental effects from use of the notice procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">Kline, P. J., and Haerle, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Section 4584 provides in pertinent part: \u201cUpon determining that the exemption is consistent with the purposes of this chapter, the board may exempt from this chapter or portions thereof, any person engaged in forest management whose activities are limited to any of the following: [\u00b6 ...
