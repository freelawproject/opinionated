Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (a)). He also admitted a prior conviction (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)) subject to a court trial on whether the same was a serious felony within the meaning of the three strikes law (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In case No. 96F00759, defendant entered a negotiated plea of no contest to an additional driving under the influence offense with three or more priors within seven years (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (a)). The parties agreed to an aggregate 48-month state prison term in the event the court found the prior in case No. 94F10109 to be a valid strike. The court so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The court sentenced defendant to state prison for an aggregate term of 48 months: the low term of 16 months doubled for 32 months on the violation in case No. 94F10109 and a consecutive one-third the midterm or 8 months doubled for 16 months on the violation in case No. 96F00759.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">In the published part of the opinion, we find the transcript of defendant\u2019s plea supports the court\u2019s finding that the prior conviction for an assault constituted a strike. In the unpublished part of the opinion, we hold that since defendant stipulated to the sentence he received, he is not entitled to a remand to allow the court to exercise its discretion whether or not to strike the strike prior pursuant to section 1385. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">In view of defendant\u2019s contentions, only a brief recitation of the facts of the underlying offense is necessary. On September 3, 1994, defendant tried three or four times to park his car in a parking stall at Southgate Plaza as a security guard watched. The security guard then saw defendant climb into the backseat and hang his head out the opened rear door. Defendant was incoherent and seemed to be intoxicated. After a California Highway Patrol officer confirmed the security guard\u2019s suspicions, the security guard placed defendant under citizen\u2019s arrest for driving under the influence. Defendant\u2019s blood-alcohol content was .15 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The amended information in case No. 94F10109 alleged that defendant suffered a serious felony conviction i.e., \u201cthe crime of assault with a deadly weapon, a felony, in violation of Section 245(a)(1) of the Penal Code,\u201d within the meaning of section 1192.7, subdivision (c), and thus came within the three strikes law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i); 1170.12).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">When defendant entered his plea, he did not dispute that he had suffered a conviction for assault. He claimed that the assault was by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, not one where he personally used a deadly or dangerous weapon. The parties stipulated that the seriousness of the assault would be determined after a court trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The prosecution presented an indeterminate sentence report showing defendant was granted probation for a 1984 conviction for \u201cAssault\u201d under section \u201c245(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The documentation presented also included a reporter\u2019s transcript of defendant\u2019s plea to the assault. The reporter\u2019s transcript contains the following account. The prosecutor stated the factual basis of the plea: \u201cYour Honor, I\u2019m prepared to stipulate that if called upon I could produce the following facts both in a preliminary hearing in this court and at trial in Superior Court: That this Defendant Surinder Singh Sohal was present in a laundromat on Palora Avenue in Yuba City . . . [\u00b6 [o]n August 11th, 1984. Number two, while in that laundromat Mr. Sohal struck Pal, P-a-1, Singh, S-i-n-g-h, Kahlon, K-a-h-l-o-n, with a metal pipe and that the striking was done to the head of Mr. Kahlon; and it was done with enough force to cause great bodily injury.\u201d Defense counsel agreed, stating \u201cthey can produce that evidence.\u201d Immediately thereafter, the court queried, \u201cMr. Sohal, on the charge assault with a deadly weapon on August 11th, do you plead guilty, not guilty or no contest?\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cNo contest and I am guilty.\u201d The accusatory pleading was not included in the prosecutor\u2019s exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">In determining that the assault conviction was a strike, the trial court concluded that the factual basis stated for the plea established that defendant personally used a deadly or dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">On appeal defendant renews his argument that the trial court erroneously considered the transcript of his plea to the assault offense in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>determining that the same was a strike because the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were inadmissible hearsay and further, defendant had not been afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the hearsay declarants.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">A prior conviction within the three strikes law is defined in relevant part and as applicable here as \u201cany offense defined in subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7 as a serious felony in this state.\" (\u00a7667, subd. (d)(1).) Section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23) lists as a serious felony \u201cany felony in which the defendant personally used a dangerous or deadly weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">An assault conviction under section 245, subdivision (a)(1) is not necessarily a serious felony as defined by section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23). An assault conviction based on an assault \u201cby means of force likely to produce great bodily injury\u201d is not one in which defendant \u201cpersonally used a dangerous or deadly weapon.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 911, 914-915 [272 Cal.Rptr. 212].)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 343 [243 Cal.Rptr. 688, 748 P.2d 1150], the Supreme Court concluded that a \u201ccourt may look to the entire record of the conviction\u201d to determine the nature of a prior conviction allegation; but if the record fails to reflect \u201cany of the facts of the offense actually committed, the court will presume that the prior conviction was for the least offense punishable . . . .\u201d (At p. 352.) A reporter\u2019s transcript of a plea is considered part of the \u201crecord of conviction\" as that phrase was used in <em>Guerrero. (People </em>v. <em>Abarca </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1347, 1350 [285 Cal.Rptr. 213].) The prosecution has the burden of proving the prior. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sumstine </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 909, 923 [206 Cal.Rptr. 707, 687 P.2d 904].)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Defendant relies primarily upon <em>Williams </em>to support his claim that the prosecutor\u2019s statement of the factual basis for defendant\u2019s plea constituted inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">In <em>Williams, </em>the only evidence in the record showing the defendant\u2019s personal use of a dangerous or deadly weapon was multiple hearsay contained in the probation report. (222 Cal.App.3d at p. 915.) The appellate court stated, \u201cA major dilemma in considering \u2018the entire record\u2019 in proving an enhancement is that some portions of it, particularly probation reports, contain hearsay statements. Under Evidence Code section 1200 hearsay cannot be admitted into evidence unless it falls within one of the established exceptions to the hearsay rule. [Citation.] The main reasons for excluding hearsay evidence are: \u2018(a) The statements are not made under <em>oath; </em>(b) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>.adverse party has <em>no opportunity to cross-examine </em>the person who made them; and (c) the jury cannot observe his <em>demeanor </em>while making them.\u2019 [Citations.] [\u00b6 However, under Evidence Code section 1220, party admissions are an exception to the hearsay rule. An admission consists of a statement or conduct of a party to the action which is offered against him at the trial. [Citation.] The <em>post-Guerrero </em>cases we have cited implicitly follow this exception to the hearsay rule in sanctioning a sentencing court\u2019s consideration of documents which reflect a defendant\u2019s explicit or implicit concession as to the nature of a prior conviction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 916, original italics.) The <em>Williams </em>court struck a prior conviction enhancement, concluding that a probation report summarizing a sheriff\u2019s statement that the victim had told him that defendant had held a knife to the victim\u2019s back (contradicted by the victim at the preliminary hearing) was \u201cfar too unreliable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 917-918.)</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Defendant misplaces his reliance on <em>Williams. </em>Here, the court relied on the factual basis for the plea as stated by the prosecutor with which defense counsel agreed. The factual basis included the fact that defendant personally used a metal pipe. Defendant entered a plea to \u201cassault with a deadly weapon\u201d not assault \u201cby means of force likely to produce great bodily injury\u201d nor simply \u201cassault as defined in section 245, subdivision (a)(1).\u201d Thus, defendant made an adoptive admission of the truth of the facts underlying the plea on the prior.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In <em>Abarca, </em>the sole evidence that the prior constituted a \u201cserious\u201d felony (neither the change of plea form, sentencing transcript nor abstract of judgment indicated whether burglary involved a residence) was the transcript of the defendant\u2019s plea where defendant admitted, in direct response to court questioning, that he burglarized a residence. Such was sufficient to satisfy <em>Guerrero. (People </em>v. <em>Abarca, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1349-1351; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanchez </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 768, 772-773 [281 Cal.Rptr. 459].)</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Here, the transcript of defendant\u2019s plea is sufficient to satisfy <em>Guerrero. </em>We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Sims, Acting P.
