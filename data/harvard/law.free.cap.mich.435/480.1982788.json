In <em>Sword v Sword, </em>399 Mich 367; 249 NW2d 88 (1976), this Court concluded that in such a civil proceeding there is no right per se to appointed counsel. In light of more recent developments in due process jurisprudence and changes in Michigan statutes governing child support enforcement, we now are persuaded that our holding in <em>Sword </em>must be modified to recognize that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution precludes incarceration of an indigent defendant if he has been denied counsel in a contempt proceeding for failure to pay child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>i</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Plaintiff Marvetta Mead and defendant William Batchlor were divorced April 23, 1976, and the Cass Circuit Court ordered defendant to pay $30 a week as support for his two children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant complied with the order until sometime in 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">On January 27, 1981, the court entered an order which had the effect of assigning $35 per week from defendant\u2019s earnings for child support.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The assignment was effective until July 1985 when defendant was laid off. He continued for a while to make support payments out of his unemployment compensation. However, when his unemployment benefits expired and he did not find another job, defendant and his present wife applied for welfare (general assistance benefits). After June 1986, he and his wife received only welfare in the amount of $235 per month, and defendant paid no child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">On December 2, 1986, the Cass County Friend of the Court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> petitioned on plaintiff\u2019s behalf for an order requiring defendant to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for failure to comply with the court\u2019s child support order. Responding in writing in propria persona, defendant asserted indigency and requested that counsel be appointed to represent him. The court denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>request without a hearing on January 8, 1987. A few days later, on January 12, 1987, the court conducted a show cause hearing, and defendant appeared without counsel. The court questioned defendant about his employment status and receipt of welfare; however, no determination was made concerning defendant\u2019s claim of indigency or his ability to pay the ordered child support. Nevertheless, the court entered an order holding defendant in contempt for \"[fjailure to pay out of currently available resources all or some portion of the amount due,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and directed defendant to pay $30 a week for support and an additional $10 a week to be applied against the arrearage. The order further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">Defendant is placed on two year\u2019s probation and ordered to pay as stated above. Failure to comply, [sic] a Bench Warrant shall issue and Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>shall be arrested and confined to jail for 40 days. He [may] be released on payment of $400.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In the Court of Appeals defendant claimed that the circuit court erred by denying his request for appointed counsel. Two weeks after defendant filed his appeal, the circuit court, upon motion of the Friend of the Court, entered an order reciting that \"the child support shall abate . . . until such time as the Defendant obtains employment or obtains other income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Thereafter, in a brief per curiam opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">Inasmuch as defendant is no longer under the threat of incarceration, we do not believe it appropriate for this Court to address the question of whether defendant was entitled to court-appointed counsel at the contempt proceeding.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">We granted leave to appeal. 430 Mich 890 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Although the facts of this case suggest that the question may be moot, we decline to follow the route taken by the Court of Appeals. Where a court\u2019s adverse judgment may have collateral legal consequences for a defendant, the issue is not necessarily moot. In <em>Sibron v New York, </em>392 US 40; 88 S Ct 1889; 20 L Ed 2d 917 (1968), the United States Supreme Court considered whether the challenge to a criminal conviction was moot where the defendant had already served the imposed sentence. The Court stated that such a challenge is moot \"only if it is shown that there is no possibility that any collateral legal consequences will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>imposed on the basis of the challenged conviction.\u201d 392 US 57.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">In this case, defendant faces possible adverse consequences even though the circuit court has temporarily abated defendant\u2019s obligation to make support payments. The finding of contempt has not been rescinded, and the circuit court, at any time,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> could reinstate its order directing defendant to pay support.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Even if it might be said that the contempt order is no longer valid, defendant faces the possibility of future contempt proceedings. A disposition based on mootness is not required where the underlying conduct is capable of repetition, yet evades review.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Finally, we have granted leave to appeal because the issue raised in this case is of sufficient public importance that a decision on the merits is warranted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">[T]he refusal of a court to decide a moot case or to determine a moot question is not based on lack of jurisdiction to do so ... a court will decide a moot case or determine a moot question where this appears to be in the public interest, as for guidance in future cases. [20 Am Jur 2d, Courts, \u00a7 81, p 443.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>This is not the first time that we have recognized the public-interest exception to the mootness doctrine. See, e.g., <em>Civil Rights Dep\u2019t ex rel Forton v Waterford Twp Dep\u2019t of Parks &amp; Recreation, </em>425 Mich 173; 387 NW2d 821 (1986); <em>Lafayette Dramatic Production v Ferentz, </em>305 Mich 193; 9 NW2d 57 (1943).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">We turn now to the question whether an indigent defendant in a contempt proceeding for failure to pay child support is constitutionally entitled to appointed counsel before he can be incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">It is noted initially that the right to counsel, at public expense if necessary, is well established with respect to proceedings that are criminal in nature. The Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of counsel in criminal prosecutions has been applicable, through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal constitution, in all state felony trials since <em>Gideon v Wainwright, </em>372 US 335; 83 S Ct 792; 9 L Ed 2d 799 (1963), and to indigents who, if they lose, could be incarcerated for petty or misdemeanor offenses since <em>Argersinger v Hamlin, </em>407 US 25; 92 S Ct 2006; 32 L Ed 2d 530 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">When this Court decided <em>Sword, supra, </em>we focused upon the civil nature of such a hearing \u2014 the fact that it is not a criminal proceeding. The <em>Sword </em>ruling also rested on an assessment that a contempt proceeding for nonsupport was not complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">A number of decisions by the United States Supreme Court and federal courts of appeal issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>after <em>Sword </em>prompt us to reexamine the significance of incarceration as a factor in determining whether and when the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that counsel be appointed for an indigent in such a civil proceeding. Moreover, in the light of significant changes since <em>Sword </em>in this state\u2019s statutes governing child support enforcement, we believe a new assessment concerning the complexity of such a proceeding is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\"For all its consequence, 'due process\u2019 has never been, and perhaps can never be, precisely defined. . . . [T]he phrase expresses the requirement of 'fundamental fairness,\u2019 a requirement whose meaning can be as opaque as its importance is lofty.\u201d <em>Lassiter v Durham Co, North Carolina, Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>452 US 18, 24; 101 S Ct 2153; 68 L Ed 2d 640 (1981). Although application of the Due Process Clause is an \"uncertain enterprise,\u201d the Supreme Court has counseled that its meaning in a particular case is discovered \"by first considering any relevant precedents and then by assessing the several interests that are at stake.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">As we read the precedents, even though an indigent defendant in a civil nonsupport proceeding is not entitled to the full panoply of process due a criminal defendant, it does not follow that he can be incarcerated without having had the benefit of counsel simply because the proceeding is considered to be civil in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">In <em>Argersinger, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that absent a knowing and intelligent waiver, a defendant may not be imprisoned, no matter how petty the criminal offense, unless represented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>counsel at trial. The rationale supporting such a rule turned on the deprivation of physical liberty by incarceration, even if it were for only a brief period. 407 US 32-33, 41 (Burger, C.J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The defendant in <em>Scott v Illinois, </em>440 US 367, 373; 99 S Ct 1158; 59 L Ed 2d 383 (1979), was fined $50 for shoplifting, but he was not incarcerated. He claimed nevertheless that he was entitled to appointed counsel because the Sixth Amendment provides that \"[i]n <em>all </em>criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In denying the claim, the Supreme Court de-emphasized the nature of the proceeding and focused instead on actual imprisonment as the dividing line:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">[W]e believe that the central premise of <em>Argersinger </em>\u2014 that actual imprisonment is a penalty different in kind from fines or the mere threat of imprisonment \u2014 is eminently sound and warrants adoption of actual imprisonment as the line defining the constitutional right to appointment of counsel. [440 US 373.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">On several occasions the Supreme Court has found in civil cases that the Due Process Clause requires the appointment of counsel. As in the criminal context, the Court\u2019s focus in these cases has been not on the civil or criminal nature of the proceeding, but rather on whether the proceeding results in deprivation of the defendant\u2019s physical liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">In <em>In re Gault, </em>387 US 1; 87 S Ct 1248; 18 L Ed 2d 527 (1967), a juvenile was committed as a delinquent to a state facility for the period of his minority. Under the state\u2019s laws, the proceeding was considered to be civil in nature. The Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Fourteenth Amendment required the appointment of counsel despite the fact that the proceedings were styled \"civil\u201d and not \"criminal.\u201d The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">A proceeding where the issue is whether the child will be found to be \"delinquent\u201d and subjected to the loss of his liberty for years is comparable in seriousness to a felony prosecution. The juvenile needs the assistance of counsel to cope with problems of law, to make skilled inquiry into the facts, to insist upon regularity of the proceedings, and to ascertain whether he has a defense and to prepare and submit it. The child \"requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 36.][<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The Court\u2019s preeminent focus on a defendant\u2019s liberty interest was also evident in <em>Gagnon v Scarpelli, </em>411 US 778; 93 S Ct 1756; 36 L Ed 2d 656 (1973). There the Court determined that \"as a litigant\u2019s interest in personal liberty diminishes, so does his right to appointed counsel.\u201d <em>Lassiter, </em>452 US 26. The <em>Gagnon </em>Court concluded that a probationer, who retains only a conditional liberty interest, does not have a right per se to appointed counsel in a probation revocation hearing. A similar result was reached in <em>Morrissey v Brewer, </em>408 US 471; 92 S Ct 2593; 33 L Ed 2d 484 (1972), where parole revocation was involved. The Court said, \"[Revocation deprives an individual, not of the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled, but only of the conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special parole restrictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">In <em>Lassiter, </em>the Supreme Court considered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>denial of appointed counsel for a woman whose parental rights were terminated in a North Carolina civil proceeding. In the course of affirming the state\u2019s decision, the Court provided highly significant guideposts for due process determination which must be considered in the context of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The <em>Lassiter </em>Court stated, \"[t]he pre-eminent generalization that emerges from [the] Court\u2019s precedents on an indigent\u2019s right to appointed counsel is that such a right has been recognized to exist only where the indigent may lose his physical liberty if he loses the litigation.\u201d 452 US 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Citing <em>In re Gault, </em>the <em>Lassiter </em>Court emphasized that \"it is the defendant\u2019s interest in personal freedom, and not simply the special Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments right to counsel in criminal cases, which triggers the right to appointed counsel . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>Then, after summarizing its precedents on the right to counsel, the <em>Lassiter </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">In sum, the Court\u2019s precedents speak with one voice about what \"fundamental fairness\u201d has meant when the Court has considered the right to appointed counsel, and <em>we thus draw from them the presumption that an indigent litigant has a right to appointed counsel only when, if he loses, he may be deprived of his physical liberty. </em>It is against this presumption that all the other elements in the due process decision must be measured. [452 US 26-27. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">By its reference to the \"other elements in the due process decision\u201d the Court focused upon the three factors propounded for evaluation in <em>Mathews v Eldridge, </em>424 US 319; 96 S Ct 893; 47 L Ed 2d 18 (1976), viz: \"the private interests at stake, the government\u2019s interest, and the risk that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>procedures used will lead to erroneous decisions.\u201d The <em>Lassiter </em>Court proceeded to \"balance these elements against each other, and then set their net weight in the scales against the presumption that there is a right to appointed counsel only where the indigent, if he is unsuccessful, may lose his personal freedom.\u201d 452 US 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Since the Court concluded that the appointment of counsel was not required on the facts in <em>Lassiter, </em>it has been suggested that much of its analysis is dicta.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, it is difficult to ignore the guideposts and formula for due process decision which were set forth, as well as the clear indication that if the indigent\u2019s liberty interest had been at stake in <em>Lassiter, </em>she would have been entitled to appointed counsel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">While not bound, we are influenced, of course, by decisions of the United States Courts of Appeals, particularly on a point of federal constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>tional law with regard to which the United States Supreme Court has not ruled directly. Our review indicates that every federal circuit court of appeals confronting the issue now before us has concluded that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment at least requires that an indigent defendant in a nonsupport proce\u00e9ding may not be incarcerated if he has been denied the assistance of counsel. <em>Sevier v Turner, </em>742 F2d 262 (CA 6, 1984) (en banc); <em>Walker v McLain, </em>768 F2d 1181 (CA 10, 1985); <em>Ridgeway v Baker, </em>720 F2d 1409 (CA 5, 1983); <em>Henkel v Bradshaw, </em>483 F2d 1386 (CA 9, 1973) (in dicta). See also <em>Nordgren v Mitchell, </em>716 F2d 1335 (CA 10, 1983) (a paternity action).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">We note also that the federal district courts uniformly have reached a similar result. <em>McKinstry v Genesee Co Circuit Judges, </em>669 F Supp 801 (ED Mich, 1987); <em>Johnson v Zurz, </em>596 F Supp 39 (ND Ohio, 1984); <em>Lake v Speziale, </em>580 F Supp 1318 (D Conn, 1984); <em>Young v Whitworth, </em>522 F Supp 759 (SD Ohio, 1981); <em>Mastin v Fellerhoff, </em>526 F Supp 969 (SD Ohio, 1981). See also <em>Cobb v Green, </em>574 F Supp 256 (WD Mich, 1983), vacated on grounds of abstention, 611 F Supp 873 (WD Mich, 1985) .</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The analysis provided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>focuses on the significance of incarceration in such a determination, is generally representative of the reasoning adopted by most of the federal courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">It would be absurd to distinguish criminal and civil incarceration; from the perspective of the person incarcerated, the jail is just as bleak no matter which label is used. In addition, the line between criminal and civil contempt is a fine one, and is rarely as clear as the state would have us believe.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] The right to counsel, as an aspect of due process, turns not on whether a proceeding may be characterized as \"criminal\u201d or \"civil,\u201d but on whether the proceeding may result in a deprivation of liberty. <em>[Walker v McLain, </em>768 F2d 1183. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Likewise, a large majority of the state courts which have confronted the issue have determined that, absent a valid waiver, an indigent defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>is entitled to counsel in such a proceeding before he can be incarcerated. The rationale expressed by the Maryland Supreme Court in <em>Rutherford v Rutherford, </em>296 Md 347, 360-361; 464 A2d 228 (1983) , is typical:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">A defendant\u2019s actual incarceration in a jail, as a result of a proceeding at which he was unrepresented by counsel and did not knowingly and intelligently waive the right to counsel, is fundamentally unfair. As repeatedly pointed out in criminal and civil cases, it is the fact of incarceration, and not the label placed upon the proceeding, which requires the appointment of counsel for indigents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Accord <em>Padilla v Padilla, </em>645 P2d 1327 (Colo App, 1982); <em>Dube v Lopes, </em>40 Conn 111; 481 A2d 1293 (1984) ; <em>McNabb v Osmundson, </em>315 NW2d 9 (Iowa, 1982); <em>In re Marriage of Stariha, </em>509 NE2d 1117 (Ind App, 1987); <em>Cox v Slama, </em>355 NW2d 401 (Minn, 1984); <em>Hunt v Moreland, </em>697 SW2d 326 (Mo App, 1985); <em>New York v Lobenthal, </em>129 AD2d 28; 518 NYS2d 928 (1987).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Although the Michigan experience with respect to an indigent\u2019s right to counsel in civil cases has been limited, it is noteworthy that this Court has recognized such a right in other contexts. In <em>Artibee v Cheboygan Circuit Judge, </em>397 Mich 54; 243 NW2d 248 (1976), a case decided prior to <em>Sword, we </em>ruled that an indigent defendant in a paternity action is entitled to appointed counsel, even though the proceeding is civil in nature. Describing such an action as \"quasi-criminal,\u201d we stated that \"[t]he interests of the individuals affected are substantial, and the nature of the proceedings is sufficiently complex so as to require counsel to insure a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Three years after <em>Sword, </em>this Court was confronted with the question whether an indigent defendant is entitled to appointed counsel in a civil contempt proceeding for refusing to testify before a grand jury. In <em>People v David Johnson, </em>407 Mich 134, 148; 283 NW2d 632 (1979), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>concluded that the appointment of counsel was required \"pursuant to the Due Process Clause, for an indigent witness in [civil] contempt proceedings which may result in incarceration.\u201d In both <em>Artibee </em>and <em>David Johnson, </em>this Court focused primarily on the deprivation of liberty and the complexity of the proceeding, rather than on the civil or criminal nature of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">To the extent that <em>Sword </em>turned on the civil-criminal dichotomy, it might now be regarded as an anomaly. Upon the basis of our review of the federal and state precedents, we find it well established that the due process right to appointed counsel is triggered by an indigent\u2019s fundamental interest in physical liberty, and not by the civil or criminal nature of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Although the <em>Sword </em>opinion does not refer to <em>Mathews v Eldridge, supra, </em>it appears that its principles were considered and applied. With a view toward weighing them anew, we look again at the <em>Eldridge </em>factors<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> as they apply in a nonsupport contempt proceeding wherein the defendant claims indigency and faces the prospect of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">It is axiomatic that the liberty interest of every citizen \u2014 the right to personal, physical freedom \u2014 is of paramount importance under the constitution. As the United States Supreme Court has observed, \"[T]he prospect of imprisonment for however short a time will seldom be viewed by the accused as a trivial or \u2019petty\u2019 matter and may well result in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>quite serious repercussions affecting his career and his reputation.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">From time to time it is suggested that the defendant in a civil nonsupport contempt proceeding has only a conditional liberty interest, akin perhaps to the probationer or parolee in <em>Gagnon </em>and <em>Morrissey. </em>The argument goes that because the civil contempt order contains a purge clause, the contemnor holds \"the keys to the jailhouse door . . . .\u201d The faulty reasoning behind such an argument, as it applies to an indigent, was well explained in <em>Walker v McLain, supra </em>at 1184:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">It is true that the defendant\u2019s right to appointed counsel diminishes as his interest in personal liberty diminishes. <em>Lassiter, </em>452 US 26 ... . However, petitioner\u2019s liberty interest cannot truly be viewed as conditional. If petitioner is truly indigent, his liberty interest is no more conditional than if he were serving a criminal sentence; he does not have the keys to the prison door if he cannot afford the price. The fact that he should not have been jailed if he is truly indigent only highlights the need for counsel, for the assistance of a lawyer would have greatly aided him in establishing his indigency and ensuring that he was not improperly incarcerated. The argument that the petitioner has the keys to the jailhouse door does not apply to diminish petitioner\u2019s liberty interest. [768 F2d 1184.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Furthermore, the risk of error in nonsupport proceedings, leading to the deprivation of physical liberty, has increased significantly since our decision in <em>Sword </em>due to changes in the Michigan statutes governing enforcement of child support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">In <em>Sword, </em>we focused on the relatively informal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>uncomplicated nature of the typical nonsupport civil proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">[T]he judge in most cases questions the parties in a relatively informal hearing. The Friend of the Court is usually not an attorney nor represented by an attorney. The door is always open to counsel of named plaintiff and/or defendant. The facts establishing the arrearage are bookkeeping matters and rarely are subject to substantial dispute. Inquiry concerning defendant\u2019s ability to pay, reasons for the arrearage and mitigating circumstances normally are not complicated. [399 Mich 382.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">However, amendments adopted by the Legislature in 1982 included a statutory presumption that every defendant in such a proceeding has the ability to pay four weeks of child support:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">The court may find a payer in contempt if the court finds that the payer is in arrears and if the court is satisfied that the payer has the capacity to pay out of currently available resources . ... <em>In the absence of proofs to the contrary introduced by the payer, the court shall presume that the payer has currently available resources equal to 4 weeks of payments under the support order. </em>[MCL 552.633; MSA 25,164(33).

Absent presentation of sufficient evidence to overcome the statutory presumption, as in this case, the court may consider it unnecessary to make an independent determination of the defendant\u2019s present ability to comply with the order to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Moreover, the 1982 amendments include a proviso that incarceration shall be ordered \"only if other remedies appear unlikely to correct the payer\u2019s failure or refusal to pay support.\u201d MCL 552.637(1); MSA 25.164(37)(1). Thus, whether the defendant goes to jail may depend upon his ability to effectively persuade the court that an alternate remedy exists.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">At least when he is faced with the loss of physical liberty, an indigent needs an attorney to advise him about the meaning and requirements of applicable laws and to raise proofs and defenses in his behalf.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In addition, since the state\u2019s representative at such a hearing is well versed in the laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>relating to child support, fundamental fairness requires that the indigent who faces incarceration should also have qualified representation. See <em>Bowerman v McDonald, </em>431 Mich 1, 12; 427 NW2d 477 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Against the strong, fundamental interest of the indigent in his physical liberty, and the risk of erroneous deprivation of his liberty, we must balance the government\u2019s interests. Where contempt proceedings for nonpayment of child support are concerned, the state has two principal interests at stake. First, the state seeks to assure that each child receives proper financial support.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> When an obligated parent with the ability to do so fails to support a dependent child, the cost of support falls upon the state. Second, the state seeks to avoid administrative expenses, including fees for appointed attorneys, to the extent possible consistent with constitutional and statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In assessing the government\u2019s interests, it is noteworthy that since <em>Sword, </em>changes in Michigan\u2019s child support laws have significantly enhanced the state\u2019s ability to enforce support orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>by means other than incarceration. The alternatives were few when <em>Sword </em>was decided. However, today a variety of effective means are available to compel compliance \u2014 if the defendant has the ability to pay \u2014 e.g., income withholding,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> federal tax intercept,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> state tax intercept,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> establishing a lien against an individual\u2019s real or personal property<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> or requiring a hearing in front of a referee.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Indeed, when methods other than incarceration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>are used, there is reason to believe that regular child support payments are more likely to continue.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Furthermore, we have not been convinced that the financial burden which the government must bear by providing counsel in cases where an indigent is to be incarcerated outweighs the fundamental physical liberty interest of the indigent defendant and the risk of erroneous deprivation of his liberty. In response to our invitation, excellent briefs amici curiae were provided in this appeal by representatives of affected governmental units. However, they were unable to demonstrate that the administrative costs involved, when placed on the <em>Eldridge </em>scale, would be so burdensome as to outweigh the other interests at stake.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In its amicus curiae brief, the Association for Michigan Counties argues that the cost of providing counsel in <em>all </em>child support hearings would be significant. We do not disagree. However, our ruling today does not require the appointment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>counsel in all such proceedings. We hold only that an indigent defendant may not be incarcerated if he has been denied counsel in a contempt proceeding for nonsupport.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In light of the constitutional limitation that we are required to recognize today, it is anticipated that methods other than incarceration will be scrupulously employed to the extent possible. We expect strict compliance with MCL 552.637; MSA 25.164(37), which directs that incarceration shall not be ordered if any other remedy can be effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Considering also that the appointment of attorneys in some cases will save the government jail housing costs, the record and briefs made available in this case leave one to speculate whether a cost increase or a cost saving will be the ultimate result.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In any event, when the net weight of the <em>Eldridge </em>factors is balanced against the <em>Lassiter </em>presumption, it is clear that due process requires the result we reach today.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Accordingly, we hold that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment precludes incarceration of an indigent defendant in a contempt proceeding for nonpayment of child support if the indigent has been denied the assistance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>counsel.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We overrule <em>Sword v Sword </em>only to the extent that it can be read to be inconsistent with this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In any contempt proceeding for nonsupport, the court should assess the likelihood that the defendant may be incarcerated, and particularly in light of MCL 552.637; MSA 25.164(37), which requires the use of other remedies to the extent possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">We endorse this statement by Justice Levin in <em>Sword:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">Whenever it is proposed to jail a person for nonsupport a stenographic record is required and there should be careful inquiry focusing on his present ability to pay. . . .

The <em>Hicks </em>Court did remand the case for a determination of whether a nonsupport proceeding under California law is civil or criminal. However, the right to counsel was not at issue. Rather, the <em>Hicks </em>Court was concerned with the validity of a statutory presumption and its relation to the appropriate standard of proof in such a proceeding. While a statutory presumption may be valid and applicable in a civil proceeding, <em>Hicks </em>underscores that such a presumption cannot be substituted for proof beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Courts traditionally have looked to whether the proceeding is civil or criminal in determining whether criminal procedural rights (e.g., proof beyond a reasonable doubt) are due a particular defendant. However, as this Court noted in <em>Bowerman </em>v <em>McDonald, </em>431 Mich 1, 13; 427 NW2d 477 (1988), the right of an indigent to counsel is a \"particular and clearly demarcated right\u201d separate from the full panoply of criminal procedural rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b594-9\"> The issue was not before the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <em>Mann v Hendrian, </em>871 F2d 51 (CA 7, 1989), wherein it was decided that the plaintiff in a 42 USC \u00cd983 suit did not have standing to seek an order requiring the defendant state judge to advise the plaintiff of a right to counsel in future contempt proceedings which might be brought against the plaintiff for failure to pay child support. In the underlying contempt proceeding, the plaintiff was jailed for sixty days by an order which contained no purge clause, and for that reason the court of appeals recognized that the proceeding was criminal in nature, not civ\u00fc. Although in obiter dicta the court expressed some disagreement with reasoning set forth in <em>Walker v McLain, </em>we do not read its <em>Mann </em>decision as being inconsistent with our holding today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b595-7\"> As the United States Supreme Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">The critical feature that determines whether the remedy is civil or criminal in nature is . . . whether the contemnor can avoid the sentence imposed on him, or purge himself of it, by complying with the terms of the original order. <em>[Hicks, </em>n 13 <em>supra </em>at 635, n 7.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">Clearly, it was intended that the Michigan statutory procedure authorizing incarceration for child nonsupport should be regarded as civil in nature.

Moreover, under <em>Hicks, </em>n 13 <em>supra, </em>the statutory presumption in MCL 552.633; MSA 25.164(33) that a defendant has currently available resources equal to four weeks of payment under the support order could not be applied except in a civil proceeding.
