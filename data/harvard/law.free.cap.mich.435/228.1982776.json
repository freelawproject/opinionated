Kelley, </em>Attorney General, <em>Louis J. Caruso, </em>Solicitor General, <em>John D. O\u2019Hair, </em>Prosecuting Attorney, and <em>Timothy A.

We hold that a defendant charged under a statute which provides for imposition of an enhanced sentence on an individual previously convicted of an offense under the same statute is not entitled to notice within fourteen days of arraignment of the prosecutor\u2019s intent to seek sentence enhancement or to a separate proceeding on the question whether he has previously been convicted of a narcotics offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">The questions presented in this case are: 1) did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>the Legislature intend to require a supplementary information and a separate fact-finding proceeding under this statute, and, 2) if not, does the legislative scheme offend the constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Despite recent modification of sentence enhancement provisions, the Legislature has not granted defendants who are subsequent offenders under the same statute a right to early notice of sentence enhancement. Nor has it provided for a separate proceeding to determine the question of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction of a drug offense. The sentence enhancement provision is a legislative authorization for judges to tailor punishment to the criminal on the basis of an objective factor, i.e., a prior conviction under the same statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The Legislature has long provided that where a prosecutor intends to proceed under the habitual offender act, a separate charge must be filed, the defendant is entitled to a full jury trial, and the defendant\u2019s prior convictions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The habitual offender statutes are considered alternate sentencing provisions rather than penalty-enhancement provisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">In creating a sentence enhancement provision in the controlled substance act, the Legislature took a factor, the defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions, a traditional consideration in determining a defendant\u2019s sentence, and authorized a weight to be given that factor, i.e., not more than twice the term authorized.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The statute is directed to facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>which relate to the criminal, not to the crime, and nothing in the act suggests a proceeding other than that comporting with the fundamental due process requirement that a sentence must be based on accurate information and a defendant have a reasonable opportunity at sentencing to challenge such information.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">By contrast, in situations in which the state creates a statutory scheme and elements of an offense, due process requires both notice of the charge and proof by the prosecutor of each element beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 US 358; 90 S Ct 1068; 25 L Ed 2d 368 (1970). Conversely, a state may define the elements of an offense, and due process does not require the state to satisfy the reasonable-doubt standard as to facts not included in the statutory definition of an offense, so long as the definition does not offend a deeply rooted principle of justice. <em>Patterson v New York, </em>432 US 197; 97 S Ct 2319; 53 L Ed 2d 281 (1977). Thus, due process does not require the state to proceed by notice of a separate charge, the right to trial by jury, and proof beyond a reasonable doubt wherever sentence enhancement is authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Due process does not require the prosecutor to charge the prior drug conviction in the information in order for the defendant\u2019s sentence to be enhanced on the basis of the prior conviction because the prior offense is not an element of a separate charge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor is the defendant entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>a trial-type procedure regarding the use of the defendant\u2019s prior drug convictions for sentencing purposes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">In the instant case, the court informed the defendant prior to sentencing of the increased penalty for a second offense, the defendant had the opportunity at sentencing to contest the accuracy of the information included in the presentence report, and the accuracy of the information was admitted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Where the statute does not contemplate a separate trial-type proceeding but, rather, provides for sentence enhancement, due process requires a reasonable opportunity to challenge the accuracy of the information relied on in passing sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the defendant did not challenge the fact that he was a second offender, the Court of Appeals erred in vacating his sentence and remanding the case for resentencing. Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the sentence imposed by the trial judge is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"AkQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\">On February 25, 1985, law enforcement personnel raided the defendant\u2019s house and seized a small amount of cocaine and more than $30,000 in cash. The defendant was charged with possession with intent to deliver less than fifty grams of cocaine. MCL 333.7401(1) and (2)(a)(iv); MSA 14.15(7401)(1) and (2)(a)(iv). The maximum sentence for this offense is twenty years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">On July 12, 1985, the defendant was arraigned in Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court, and on September 12, 1985, the prosecutor filed a written notice<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of his intent to seek an enhanced (doubled) sentence pursuant to MCL 333.7413(2); MSA 14.15(7413X2).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The defendant was convicted by a jury of possession with intent to deliver less than fifty grams of cocaine, and on January 31, 1986, was sentenced to a maximum of forty years in prison.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although advised at sentencing that the court was relying on the defendant\u2019s prior conviction for possession of heroin, neither the defendant nor counsel contested the accuracy of the prior conviction, and counsel confirmed that the presentence report was accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">On March 7, 1986, the defendant moved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>vacate the sentence on the basis that the defendant\u2019s prior drug conviction was not charged in either the information or a supplemental information <em>and </em>that the prosecutor had not proven that the defendant was a recidivist drug offender. The defendant relied on <em>People v Stout, </em>116 Mich App 726, 735; 323 NW2d 532 (1982), in which the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">In our view the quoted language from <em>[People </em>v] <em>Urynowicz </em>[412 Mich 137; 312 NW2d 625 (1981)] makes clear that a subsequent drug offender\u2019s sentence may not be enhanced unless the prior drug offense is charged in either the information or a supplemental, information <em>and </em>the prosecutor proves that the defendant is a recidivist drug offender. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The sentencing judge believed the Court of Appeals erred in <em>Stout, </em>but also that, under <em>Stout, </em>the notice filed was sufficient because the defendant received the notice and had not contested his conviction on the underlying charge. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">In an unpublished per curiam opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction but remanded the case for sentencing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals agreed with the defendant that the prosecution must charge the defendant as an habitual offender before his sentence could be enhanced under MCL 333.7413, 769.10(l)(c), 769.13; MSA 14.15(7413), 28.1082(l)(c), 28.1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Relying on our decisions regarding proceedings under the habitual criminal act, the Court held that the prosecutor must file a supplemental information not more than fourteen days after a defendant is arraigned in circuit court unless the prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>cutor is unaware of any prior felony record until after conviction or the delay in filing the information is due to the need to verify out-of-state felony convictions based on the record of a defendant\u2019s prior arrests. <em>People v Shelton, </em>412 Mich 565; 315 NW2d 537 (1982), reh den 413 Mich 1108 (1982). As these exceptions were not applicable, the Court of Appeals vacated the defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> solely oh defendant\u2019s charge of possession with intent to deliver cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The prosecution contends that earlier decisions of this Court imposed procedural requirements in the sentence enhancement context that the Legislature never intended.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>People v Urynowicz, supra, People v Wright, </em>405 Mich 832; 275 NW2d 1 (1979), and <em>People v Lester, </em>417 Mich 927; 330 NW2d 854 (1983). The prosecutor further submits that the recent ruling of the United States Supreme Court in <em>McMillan v Pennsylvania, </em>477 US 79; 106 S Ct 2411; 91 L Ed 2d 67 (1986), provides a justification for reconsideration regarding the issue what procedures are required under due process when the court enhances a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to MCL 333.7413(2); MSA 14.15(7413)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The defendant claims that the prior drug offense must be charged in either the information or a supplemental information, and that the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>must prove that the defendant is a recidivist drug offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The issue presented is whether the sentence provision of the controlled substance act, authorizing an enhanced penalty for a defendant previously convicted of a like offense, offends due process by failing to provide prior notice of intent to enhance or a separate adversarial proceeding to establish <em>proof </em>of the prior conviction. <em>People v Stout, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">It is well settled that in a criminal trial, the defendant\u2019s conviction must rest on evidence which proves \"beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and includes the right to a trial by jury,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> a public trial, counsel, confrontation of adverse witnesses, and a fair and speedy trial. The most fundamental of these safeguards in a criminal proceeding is the right to a trial by jury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Duncan v Louisiana, </em>391 US 145, 158, n 30; 88 S Ct 1444; 20 L Ed 2d 491 (1968); <em>Baldwin v New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number><em>York, </em>399 US 66, 72; 90 S Ct 1886; 26 L Ed 2d 437 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">By contrast, the due process right at a typical sentencing hearing is the right to be sentenced on the basis of accurate information. Trial-type procedures are not required. <em>Williams v New York, 337 </em>US 241; 69 S Ct 1079; 93 L Ed 1337 (1949).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In <em>Williams, </em>the United States Supreme Court rejected a claim that the defendant was denied the opportunity to confront and examine his accusers by the trial court\u2019s reliance on the presentence investigation as the basis for its sentence. <em>Id., </em>p 244. The Court held the procedure did not violate due process<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and identified a distinction between guilt determination and sentencing, observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">In addition to the historical basis for different evidentiary rules governing trial and sentencing procedures there are sound practical reasons for the distinction. . . . [B]efore verdict the issue is whether a defendant is guilty of having engaged in certain criminal conduct of which he has been specifically accused. Rules of evidence have been fashioned for criminal trials which narrowly confine the trial contest to evidence that is strictly relevant to the particular offense charged. ... A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>sentencing judge, however, is not confined to the narrow issue of guilt. . . . Highly relevant \u2014 if not essential \u2014 to his selection of an appropriate sentence is the possession of the fullest information possible concerning the defendant\u2019s life and characteristics. <em>[Id., </em>pp 246-247.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The Court concluded that the \"due process clause should not be treated as a device for freezing the evidentiary procedure of sentencing in the mold of trial procedure.\u201d <em>Id,, </em>p 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Decisions following <em>Williams </em>supported traditional individualized sentencing on the basis of a broad inquiry.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Court held that while information obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s right to counsel<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> could not be considered, a sentencing judge might permissibly take into account a defendant\u2019s trial conduct<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and the defendant\u2019s refusal to cooperate with law enforcement officials.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The basic tenor of these cases is that an individualized sentence can be based on any relevant and reliable information, and that, while normal sentencing proceedings are not immune from due process attacks, only minimal due process protections are required in those proceedings. <em>United States v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>Davis, </em>710 F2d 104 (CA 3, 1983), cert den 464 US 1001 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">However, the Supreme Court has required additional procedural safeguards to satisfy due process requirements in situations in which a court seeks to impose additional penalties on a defendant pursuant to a finding of fact equivalent to invoking a new charge.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Specht v Patterson, </em>386 US 605; 87 S Ct 1209; 18 L Ed 2d 326 (1967). In <em>Specht, </em>the defendant was convicted under one Colorado statute for indecent liberties which carried a maximum sentence of ten years.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>p 607. Thereafter, the defendant was sentenced under a different act<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> for a sentence of one day to life without full notice or a hearing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The Court noted that the act made one conviction the basis for invoking a separate proceeding under the sex offenders act, thus requiring a determination that constituted \"a new finding of fact.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 608. As such, the defendant was entitled to the \" 'full panoply of the relevant protections which due process guarantees in state criminal proceedings ... all those safeguards which are fundamental rights and essential to a fair trial ....\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 609-610, citing <em>Gerchman v Maroney, </em>355 F2d 302, 312 (CA 3, 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Subsequent to the <em>Specht </em>decision, in 1970, the United States Supreme Court declared that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Due Process Clause \"protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>In re Winship, supra, </em>p 364. Five years later in <em>Mullaney v Wilbur, </em>421 US 684; 95 S Ct 1881; 44 L Ed 2d 508 (1975), the Court held that Maine\u2019s homicide statute impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant on the issue of heat of passion on sudden provocation. Justice Powell observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">[I]f <em>Winship </em>were limited to those facts that constitute a crime as defined by state law, a State could undermine many of the interests that decision sought to protect without effecting any substantive change in its law. It would only be necessary to redefine the elements that constitute different crimes, characterizing them as factors that bear solely on the extent of punishment. <em>[Id., </em>p 698.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">However, in <em>Riviera v Delaware, </em>429 US 877; 97 S Ct 226; 50 L Ed 2d 160 (1976), the Court confirmed that it remained constitutional to burden the defendant with proving the insanity defense, and also held that the state could place the burden of proving a new affirmative defense, extreme emotional disturbance, on the defendant when the affirmative defense did \"not serve to negative any facts of the crime which the State is to prove in order to convict of murder.\u201d <em>Patterson v New York, supra, </em>p 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">While <em>Winship </em>and <em>Specht </em>establish that a Legislature is not wholly free to define elements of an offense as factors bearing only on punishment, it is clear that the limitation is a narrow exception to the deference accorded a state\u2019s administration of justice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Traditionally, due process has required that only the most basic procedural safeguards be observed; more subtle balancing of society\u2019s interests against those of the accused have been left to the legislative branch. <em>[Patterson v New York, supra, </em>p 210.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">In <em>McMillan, supra, </em>p 86, the Court recently has reaffirmed the state\u2019s ability to pursue \"its chosen course in the area of defining crimes and proscribing penalties.\u201d The Court rejected a due process challenge to a state statute that provided for imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence where a sentencing judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence that an individual convicted of an offense \"visibly] possessed] a firearm\u201d during its commission.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">While declining to define the express parameters of the state\u2019s authority to define the elements of an offense, the Court observed that <em>Patterson </em>had rejected the claim that whenever a state linked the severity of punishment to the presence or absence of an identified fact, <em>McMillan, supra, </em>p 84, the state must prove that fact beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court further distinguished <em>Specht </em>on the basis that in <em>Specht </em>the defendant was confronted with a \"radically different situation\u201d from the usual sentencing proceeding. The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">The Pennsylvania Legislature did not change the definition of any existing offense. It simply took one factor that has always been considered by sentencing courts to bear on punishment \u2014 the instrumentality used in committing a violent felony \u2014and dictated the precise weight to be given that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>factor if the instrumentality is a firearm. Pennsylvania\u2019s decision to do so has not transformed against its will a sentencing factor into an \"element\u201d of some hypothetical \"offense.\u201d <em>[Id., </em>pp 89-90.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Of significance to the language in <em>Stout, supra, </em>that the prosecution <em>prove </em>the factor that authorizes enhancement, the Court also observed that \"Sentencing courts have traditionally heard evidence and found facts without any prescribed burdens of proof at all,\u201d <em>McMillan, supra, </em>p 91, and noted \"embracing . . . the clear-and-convincing standard here would significantly alter criminal sentencing, for we see no way to distinguish the visible possession finding at issue here from a host of other express or implied findings sentencing judges typically make on the way to passing sentence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 92, n 8.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The second-offender provision with which we here deal likewise neither seeks to impose additional penalties on the basis of a finding of fact equivalent to a new charge, <em>Specht, </em>nor changes the definition of an existing offense, <em>Winship. </em>It simply takes one factor that has historically been of paramount importance in imposing an appropriate sentence, a previous conviction for a like offense, and authorizes an increased penalty. Therefore, due process neither compels a separate charge nor imposes trial-type evidentiary burdens on the sentencing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">In the present case, the Court of Appeals va<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>cated the defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded to the lower court for resentencing on the basis that the defendant did not receive sufficient notice of the prosecutor\u2019s intent to seek enhanced sentencing. However, we recognize the existence of precedent from this Court that suggests that it is error for a trial court to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence under the controlled substance act unless a defendant is charged as a second or subsequent offender, as required under the habitual offender act.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Despite the fact that in <em>Oyler v Boles, </em>368 US 448, 452; 82 S Ct 501; 7 L Ed 2d 446 (1962), the United States Supreme Court held that due process required reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard relative to a recidivist charge, but not notice prior to trial on the underlying offense,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> this Court, citing <em>Oyler, </em>thereafter held that the prosecutor separately, or coincidentally, must charge the defendant as an habitual offender prior to trial on the underlying substantive offense.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>People v Wright, </em>405 Mich 832; 275 NW2d 1 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The apparent purpose of requiring the information to be filed is to provide the accused notice, at an early stage of the proceedings, of the potential consequences should the accused be convicted of the underlying offense. <em>People v Shelton, supra, </em>p 569. In <em>Shelton, </em>the Court defined \"promptly\u201d as not more than fourteen days after the individual the prosecutor elects to charge as an habitual offender is arraigned in circuit court on the underlying felony (or before trial if the defendant is tried within the fourteen-day period).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">It is clear from a reading of <em>Oyler </em>and <em>McMillan </em>that <em>Shelton </em>is distinguishable, and that due process does not require the filing of a separate charge pursuant to a statute that does not create a new offense but simply authorizes the sentencing court to enhance the sentence.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The prosecutor is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>not required to charge the prior conviction in the information because it is not an element of a new charge, separate from the offense for which the defendant is presently charged. Instead, the prior conviction is a factor which the judge may consider when imposing the sentence. See <em>People v Mellor, </em>302 Mich 537; 5 NW2d 455 (1942).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Where, as here, the factor, a prior conviction, has not historically been considered an element of the crime, is objectively ascertainable, and carries little risk of erroneous determination, and there is no indication that the Legislature is seeking to avoid the procedural protections of Winship,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>process requires neither the filing of a separate charge nor adversarial proceedings at sentencing.

I also agree that neither the federal nor the state constitutional guarantees of due process<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> require that defendant\u2019s prior conviction be treated as a new crime that must be separately charged and proven at a separate trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">However, I do not join the lead opinion\u2019s suggestion that no additional procedural protections are required under the Due Process Clause in a case, like this one, in which a factual finding at sentencing, unrelated to the proof establishing a defendant\u2019s underlying conviction, doubles the maximum sentence to which the defendant is exposed. As I interpret <em>Specht v Patterson, </em>386 US 605, 610; 87 S Ct 1209; 18 L Ed 2d 326 (1967), and <em>McMillan v Pennsylvania, </em>477 US 79; 106 S Ct 2411; 91 L Ed 2d 67 (1986), before an enhanced penalty under \u00a7 7413(2) may be imposed, a defendant is entitled to contest his alleged prior-offender status at an adversarial hearing where the prosecution carries the burden of proving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>sentence-enhancing fact by at least a preponderance of the evidence, and where the defendant has the right to be represented by counsel, to present evidence, and to confront and cross-examine any witnesses against him. This hearing need not be conducted whenever a defendant is sentenced under \u00a77413(2), but may be conditioned upon the defendant\u2019s choice to contest the existence of his prior conviction. Still, the defendant\u2019s decision not to contest, but to admit a prior conviction and waive these safeguards must be preceded by adequate notice so that the decision is knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Nevertheless, even though the record permits an inference of inadequate notice and unintelligent waiver, this defendant simply has not raised such a claim. The defendant has never suggested that he or his counsel had inadequate time or information to prepare to contest his alleged prior conviction. Nor did he or his counsel request a continuance for that purpose either when the sentencing judge questioned defense counsel about the accuracy of the allegations in the presentence report, which included reference to defendant\u2019s prior drug conviction, or when the enhancement issue was subsequently raised by the judge. Defendant has never, even in this Court, claimed that he did not commit the prior offense or that the prior conviction is somehow invalid. He claims only that the absence of a separate charge and accompanying proof of his prior conviction requires his enhanced sentence to be vacated, and does not demand an opportunity to contest his prior conviction on remand. Absent either a claim by the defendant that his admission of his prior conviction was not knowing or voluntary, or a showing of prejudice,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>conclude that there is no statutory or constitutional basis for vacating defendant\u2019s sentence and join the result reached by the majority.</p>\n<judges id=\"b354-4\">Archer, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b354-5\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsHr\"><em>(to affirm). </em>Eason was charged with possession with intent to deliver less than 50 grams of a mixture containing cocaine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The prosecutor did not charge Eason as a repeat offender in the information charging the current offense, nor did the prosecutor file a supplemental information within fourteen days after Eason\u2019s arraignment. Eason was convicted as charged. On the basis of a prior drug-related conviction, Eason was sentenced to imprisonment for twenty to forty years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed Eason\u2019s conviction but concluded that the procedures applicable under the habitual offender provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> also apply where the prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>cutor seeks sentence enhancement under the controlled substances article. Since the prosecutor had not filed a supplemental information charging Ea-son as a repeat offender within fourteen days after Eason\u2019s arraignment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as required in habitual offender proceedings, the Court vacated Eason\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The majority holds that the procedures applicable to sentence enhancement under the habitual offender provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure do not apply to sentence enhancement under the controlled substances article. The majority goes on to hold that the \"procedures\u201d in the instant case were not violative of the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">I agree with the majority that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require the prosecutor to notify a defendant before trial on the current offense that, if he is convicted of that offense, he is subject to sentence enhancement on the basis of a prior conviction of a similar offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">I would hold that the procedures applicable under the habitual offender provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure apply to sentence enhancement under the controlled substances article. I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>because that Court correctly applied this Court\u2019s decisions concerning the requisite procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Under both the controlled substances article of the Public Health Code and its predecessor, the Controlled Substances Act, this Court has required the prosecutor to charge the defendant as a second or subsequent offender when seeking sentence enhancement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The only decision of this Court concerning the procedures to be followed when the\u2019 prosecutor sought sentence enhancement under the Controlled Substances Act is <em>People v Wright, </em>405 Mich 832; 275 NW2d 1 (1979). There, the defendant was charged with delivery of cocaine<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and conspiracy to deliver cocaine.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The prosecutor did not charge Wright as a second offender.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Wright was convicted as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Wright argued on appeal that he had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>denied reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard as guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The basis for Wright\u2019s claim was that at his arraignment he had been <em>misled regarding the maximum possible sentences,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and that at the sentencing hearing he was not given an adequate opportunity to <em>explain </em>his prior drug-related conviction. Wright\u2019s due process claim was <em>not based on the prosecutor\u2019s failure to inform him before trial </em>of the most recent offenses of the possibility of sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">This Court issued a peremptory order vacating Wright\u2019s sentences, and remanded the case for resentencing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">The sentencing court improperly imposed double sentence pursuant to MCL 335.348; MSA 18.1070(48). <em>Oyler v Boles, </em>368 US 448; 82 S Ct 501; 7 L Ed 2d 446 (1962). See MCL 769.10; MSA 28.1082, as amended by 1978 PA 77.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In <em>Oyler v Boles, </em>cited by this Court in <em>Wright, </em>the United States Supreme Court said that \"a defendant must receive reasonable notice <em>and </em>an opportunity to be <em>heard </em>relative to [a] recidivist charge,\u201d but that \"due process does <em>not </em>require that notice be given prior to the trial on the substantive offense.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The majority suggests that the reference to <em>Oyler </em>in <em>Wright </em>is evidence that this Court decided <em>Wright </em>on the basis of a mistaken belief that the Due Process Clause required notice of the possibility of sentence enhancement <em>before trial of the current offense, </em>and that <em>Wright </em>was therefore wrongly decided.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The suggestion that this Court in <em>Wright </em>misunderstood the United States Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Oyler </em>is unsupported by the language of the order in <em>Wright</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and (see n 11 and the accompanying text) by the contentions of the parties. There is evidence that the Court understood the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The Controlled Substances Act was repealed in 1978 and the Public Health Code was simultane<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>ously enacted. The controlled substances article<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the Public Health Code does not specify procedures to be followed when the prosecutor seeks sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The procedural requirements for sentence enhancement under the new law were first addressed in <em>People v Stout, </em>116 Mich App 726; 323 NW2d 532 (1982). Stout was charged with possession of less than 50 grams of cocaine,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and possession of marihuana.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The prosecutor filed a supplemental information charging Stout under the habitual offender provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Stout was convicted as charged. The trial court dismissed the supplemental information, and sentenced Stout for the cocaine conviction pursuant to the repeat offender provision of the controlled substances article.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Stout argued on appeal that his sentence should be vacated because he was not given notice of the repeat offender charge and because there was no hearing or trial concerning his prior drug-related convictions. The Court of Appeals agreed. Relying primarily on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>People v Urynowicz, </em>412 Mich 137; 312 NW2d 625 (1981) (per curiam),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals said:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>In our view . . . <em>Urynowicz </em>makes clear that a subsequent drug offender\u2019s sentence may not be enhanced unless the prior drug offense is charged in either the information or a supplemental information <em>and </em>the prosecutor proves that the defendant is a recidivist drug offender. <em>[Stout, supra, </em>p 735. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Since the trial court dismissed the supplemental information charging Stout under the habitual offender provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the prosecutor had not proved Stout\u2019s prior drug-related convictions, the Court of Appeals held that sentence enhancement was improper.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">This Court has twice vacated sentences enhanced under the controlled substances article because the defendant was not charged as a second or subsequent offender. <em>People v Lester, </em>417 Mich 927; 330 NW2d 854 (1983); <em>People v Cobb, </em>422 Mich 901; 367 NW2d 335 (1985). In these cases, unlike <em>Wright, supra, </em>the Court\u2019s orders mention the prosecutor\u2019s failure to charge the defendant as a repeat offender as the basis for holding that sentence enhancement was improper.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">The Court\u2019s decisions applying the sentence enhancement provisions for repeat drug offenders are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>in a long line of decisions of this Court in which the prosecutor has <em>always </em>been required \u2014 absent unusual circumstances not present in the instant case<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u2014 to notify the defendant before trial of the current offense that, if he is convicted, he will be subject to sentence enhancement on the basis of a prior conviction. The Court has imposed this requirement without regard to whether a particular statute that authorizes sentence enhancement specifies the procedures to be followed when the prosecutor seeks an enhanced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The Michigan liquor law authorized sentence enhancement for a second or subsequent conviction without specifying the procedures to be followed when the prosecutor sought sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">In <em>People v Ancksornby, </em>231 Mich 271; 203 NW 864 (1925), the defendant was charged with unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor and with selling and furnishing as a first offender. Ancksornby pled guilty to the information and, on the basis of an alleged post-plea acknowledgment of a prior conviction under the liquor law, the trial court imposed an enhanced sentence.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Ancksornby appealed on the ground that an enhanced sentence could not be imposed because the prosecutor had not charged him as a second offender. <em>The prosecutor confessed error.</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This Court held that Ancksornby\u2019s sentence was excessive and illegal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">The trial judge was in error. He sentenced the defendant for an offense of which he had not been convicted. The statute provides an increased punishment for a second or subsequent offense, but it must be charged as such in the information. That was not done in this case. <em>[Id., </em>p 272.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In <em>People v McDonald, </em>233 Mich 98; 206 NW 516 (1925), the defendant was charged in the complaint and the information with unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor as a second offense. McDonald was tried, convicted and sentenced accordingly. At the preliminary examination, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ever, the prosecutor did not offer evidence concerning McDonald\u2019s prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The Court said that \"[t]he information must contain an averment of former conviction ... to justify a conviction and sentence therefor.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Although the former conviction was alleged in the information, \"[a]s there was no proof of a former conviction submitted on the examination had, the averment thereof should have been stricken from the information and the objection of the defendant to the introduction [at the trial] of proof thereunder sustained.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>McDonald </em>was followed in <em>People v Van Vorce, </em>240 Mich 75, 78; 215 NW 5 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Referring to <em>Ancksomby, McDonald, </em>and <em>Van Vorce, </em>the majority says that the \"better construction\u201d of those decisions is that \"the Court construed the legislation in question as necessarily requiring a separate information filed to provide the opportunity for a preliminary examination for the defendant and to provide the circuit court with jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The majority also appears to suggest that a first offense was a misdemeanor, while a second or subsequent offense was a felony, and that the distinction is somehow significant.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Anck</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>sornby, McDonald, </em>and <em>Van Vorce </em>is unpersuasive. The assertion that the prosecutor was required to file a separate information to provide the defendant with an opportunity for a preliminary examination ignores that when the Court decided those cases, a defendant who was accused of violating the liquor law was entitled to a preliminary examination and was subject to circuit court jurisdiction <em>without regard </em>to whether he was charged as a first or repeat offender.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The majority is again incorrect when it asserts that in the liquor law cases a first offense was a misdemeanor while a second or subsequent offense was a felony. When the liquor law was initially enacted, a first offense was indeed a misdemean- or.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> By the time the Court decided <em>Aneksornby, McDonald, </em>and <em>Van Vorce, </em>however, the Legislature had amended the liquor law to make a first offense a felony.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In any event, the misdemeanor/ felony distinction \u2014 now determinative of whether a preliminary examination is required<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and the jurisdictions of the district and circuit courts<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>was not determinative when the Court decided those cases.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Another statutory scheme that authorizes sentence enhancement for a second or subsequent conviction without specifying the procedures to be followed when the prosecutor seeks sentence enhancement concerns driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">l</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The Attorney General issued an opinion in 1940 concerning the proper practice when prosecuting a person who had previously been convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The Attorney General said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">We feel that the proper procedure to be followed in cases of this nature is to <em>charge </em>the offender with a second or subsequent offense <em>in the original </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>complaint, have a preliminary examination </em>before the proper magistrate, and in the event that the magistrate finds probable cause, have the accused bound over to the circuit court to stand trial.

The trial court denied Bosca\u2019s motion. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that \"before a defendant\u2019s punishment for the current offense can be enlarged, the earlier conviction must be charged and proved.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The Court of Appeals has followed <em>Bosca,</em><footnotemark><em>40</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and this Court has expressly approved its holding and rationale.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The majority cites <em>People v Mellor, </em>302 Mich 537; 5 NW2d 455 (1942), a case involving a second conviction of drunk driving, in support of its argument that a prosecutor is not required to charge a prior conviction because an earlier conviction is merely a factor for the judge to consider in sentencing and not an element of a new charge.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The defendant in <em>Mellor </em>was charged,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> convicted, and sentenced<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> as a second offender. On appeal, Mellor argued that the prior conviction and the current <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>offense should have been set forth in <em>separate counts </em>of the information.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The Court rejected Mellor\u2019s contention and said that it was not error to allege both the current offense and the prior conviction in the <em>same count.</em><footnotemark><em>46</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Court did <em>not </em>say that there was no need to charge a defendant as a second offender\u2014 Mellor had been so charged.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The majority appears to attempt to distinguish drunk driving from the case at hand on the basis that a prior conviction is an \"element\u201d of a repeat drunk driving offense because a first offense is a misdemeanor whereas a subsequent offense may be a felony.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>When the Court decided <em>Mellor </em>and the Attorney General issued his opinion, a second or subsequent conviction of drunk driving was a misdemeanor.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> When the Court of Appeals decided Bosca, a second conviction was a misdemeanor and a third or subsequent conviction within a ten-year period was, indeed, a felony.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Thus, when the defendant in <em>Bosca </em>was charged as a second offender,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> he was charged with committing a misdemeanor, not a felony. The premise of the majority\u2019s analysis \u2014 that a subsequent offense is a felony and the prior offense was a misdemeanor \u2014 is thus factually incorrect. In all events, the prior conviction is no more an \"element\u201d when it constitutes a misdemeanor than when it constitutes a felony.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The majority also says that the \"better construction\u201d of the drunk driving laws is that \"the Court construed the legislation in question as necessarily requiring a separate information filed to provide the opportunity for a preliminary examination for the defendant and to provide the circuit court with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark>1 acknowledge that the difference in the maximum sentence between a first and subsequent conviction of drunk driving is determinative of a defendant\u2019s entitlement to a preliminary examination and of the jurisdictions of the justice of the peace and circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The jurisdictional significance of the availability of an enhanced sentence was indeed one basis for the Attorney General\u2019s opinion in 1940.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> It was not, however, the only basis for the Attorney General\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Nor was it a basis of the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Bosca.</em><footnotemark><em>56</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Still another statutory scheme that authorizes sentence enhancement for a second or subsequent conviction without specifying the procedures to be followed when the prosecutor seeks sentence enhancement is found in the provisions of the Penal Code concerning criminal sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">This Court construed those provisions in <em>People v Urynowicz, </em>412 Mich 137; 312 NW2d 625 (1981) (per curiam). The information charged Urynowicz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>with first-degree criminal sexual conduct.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> He pled guilty in exchange for the dismissal of a supplemental information that had been filed under the habitual offender provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The basis of the habitual offender charge was a prior conviction of gross indecency.

It attributes to the Legislature an intention to provide a defendant facing a possible five- or ten-year increase in the maximum sentence with early <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>notice of that possibility, but not a defendant facing the possibility of mandatory imprisonment for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The majority\u2019s construction thus attributes to the Legislature a purpose to act in disregard of the conception that the quantity and quality of needed procedural safeguards should be in direct relation to the severity of the possible penalty.

The United States Constitution arguably would permit the Legislature to act in such a manner.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> When the Legislature disagrees with decisions of the Court, it often amends the statutes to correct the perceived error.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> The Legislature has not done so in this case.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">In not expressly requiring the prosecutor to charge the defendant as a repeat offender, the sentence enhancement provision of the controlled substances article is similar to the sentence enhancement provisions for second or subsequent convictions of criminal sexual conduct, driving under the influence of alcohol, and violation of the liquor law. <em>And in every single case in which the question was raised, this Court has held, or has expressly approved a decision of the Court of Appeals which held, that the prosecutor must charge the defendant as a repeat offender when seeking sentence enhancement.</em><footnotemark><em>113</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">This Court has, on several occasions, endorsed the view expressed by Justice Brand\u00e9is in his dissenting opinion in <em>Burnet v Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co, </em>285 US 393, 406; 52 S Ct 443; 76 L Ed 815 (1932), where he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\"><em>Stare decisis </em>is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.

It does, however, mean that the Court should not do so lightly.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s attempt to portray this Court\u2019s precedents as wrongly decided is inadequate. That effort is founded on unsupportable characterizations of the Court\u2019s decisions. The majority does not claim that the long-established rule has led to unjust results. Nor can the majority relieve itself of the burden of justifying a rejection of settled law by \"distinguishing\u201d the prior cases.

It is said that since the Legislature \"required\u201d the prosecutor to charge a defendant as a repeat offender under the habitual offender provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>sions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the failure to restate a similar requirement in the sentence enhancement provision of the controlled substances article evidences an intention to deny to repeat drug offenders the procedural safeguards that are afforded to other recidivists.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">It is again relevant that this Court has always required the prosecutor to charge the defendant as a repeat offender even when such a requirement was not mandated by the literal language of the statute authorizing sentence enhancement. Given this longstanding and unbroken rule, there was no reason for the Legislature to set forth in the controlled substances article a requirement that the prosecutor charge the defendant as a repeat offender. The Legislature\u2019s \"omission\u201d amounted to nothing more than a failure to restate a proposition that had always been thought obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">It is also relevant that the requirement that a prosecutor give early notice of the possibility of sentence enhancement to a defendant in an habitual offender proceeding is the product of this Court\u2019s construction of the applicable statutes and of the exercise of its supervisory authority over the courts of this state.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> The literal language of the habitual offender provisions no more requires early notice than does the literal language of the other sentence enhancement statutes where the Court has imposed a similar requirement. In this respect, <em>there is no difference between the literal language of the various statutes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The majority\u2019s argument is based on the \"theory\u201d that the Legislature acted with a selective memory.

In <em>McDonald,</em><footnotemark><em>119</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court held that the information must contain an allegation of prior conviction even though the statute authorizing sentence enhancement did not expressly so require, and in support of the rule there announced cited decisions involving sentence enhancement statutes that expressly required the prosecutor to charge the defendant as a repeat offender.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> So too in <em>Urynowicz,</em><footnotemark><em>121</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and so too in the Attorney General\u2019s opinion concerning second or subsequent con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>victions of drunk driving.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> The \"verbal difference argument\u201d was the basis of <em>People v McFadden, </em>73 Mich App 232; 251 NW2d 297 (1977), which was in turn the basis of the Court of Appeals decisions in <em>Wright</em><footnotemark><em>123</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and Urynowicz,<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> decisions which were reversed by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In sum, the basis for the majority\u2019s assertion concerning legislative intent is a distinction that has never before been thought significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The majority would reject the longstanding and unbroken rule that the prosecutor must charge the defendant as a repeat offender whenever sentence enhancement is sought on the basis of a prior conviction. It is a rule that until today was thought to be obvious \u2014 so obvious that the prosecutor in <em>Ancksornby </em>confessed error for failing to charge the defendant as a second offender,<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> the prosecutor in <em>Urynowicz </em>advanced this rule before the Court,<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> and the Attorney General adopted the rule in his 1940 opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">When the unsupportable characterizations and unpersuasive distinctions of the Court\u2019s precedents are \"set aside,\u201d<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> the only basis for the majority\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>abandonment of the longstanding and unbroken rule that the prosecutor must charge the defendant as a repeat offender is that this practice is not required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">This Court has not said that notice of the possibility of sentence enhancement before trial on the current offense was mandated by the United States Constitution. That such notice is not mandated by the United States Constitution is <em>not a reason </em>for abandoning precedent requiring the prosecutor to give early notice of the possibility of sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Enough prologue. Correct analysis should begin with the Code of Criminal Procedure, enacted in 1927,<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> by which the Legislature adopted a new sentence enhancement scheme for habitual offenders. The prior statute expressly required the prosecutor to charge the defendant as an habitual offender.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> The Code of Criminal Procedure ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>pressly provides that it is not always necessary to charge the defendant as an habitual offender in the information charging the current offense.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> The Code, rather, authorized the commencement of a separate sentence enhancement proceeding after conviction of the charged offense if \"at any time after conviction ... it shall appear that a person convicted of a felony has previously been convicted of crimes . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>131</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In <em>People v Judge of Recorder's Court, </em>251 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>626; 232 NW 402 (1930), decided three years after passage of the Code,<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> the prosecutor filed a supplemental information charging John Figgins as an habitual offender after he had been convicted of the charged offense. The trial court ruled that Figgins was entitled to a preliminary examination respecting the allegation of prior conviction. The prosecutor petitioned this Court for the issuance of a writ of mandamus to compel the trial court to vacate its order regarding the preliminary examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">This Court held that in light of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it was no longer necessary to conduct a preliminary examination concerning the allegation of prior conviction. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\"><em>Prior to the criminal code [1927 PA 175], there was no provision in the law for an independent trial to determine the fact of a prior conviction. It was tried out in the trial for the subsequent offense. It was necessary to charge it in the complaint and warrant and prove it on the examination and trial unless examination </em>was <em>waived. Otherwise the court was without jurisdiction to consider it in imposing sentence. But [1927 PA 175, ch IX, \u00a713], authorizes an independent trial of that question on the \u00f1ling of a supplemental information after conviction and sentence for the subsequent offense. . . . </em>The purpose of an examination is to determine if a crime has been committed and if there is probable cause for believing the accused party committed it. If no crime is charged, an examination is not required. In <em>People v Palm, </em>245 Mich 396 [223 NW 67 (1929)], it was held that a supplemental information, filed after conviction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>alleging a prior conviction, does not charge any crime. <em>[Id., </em>p 627. Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>133</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The Court\u2019s statements indicate that it was not until the enactment of the Code of Criminal Procedure that a trial court had the authority to impose an enhanced sentence where the prosecutor did not proceed from the commencement of the prosecution<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> against the defendant as a repeat offender.<footnotemark>135</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The lack of jurisdiction, adverted to in <em>Judge of Recorder\u2019s Court </em>and remedied in part by the enactment of the Code of Criminal Procedure, could be distinguished from a prosecution under the controlled substances article on the basis that the pre-Code habitual offender provisions expressly required the prosecutor to charge the defendant as a repeat offender,<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> while the controlled substances article does not prescribe any particular procedure to be followed when seeking sentence enhancement for a second or subsequent drug-related conviction. In other words, the jurisdictional problem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>with imposing an enhanced sentence where the prosecutor has not proceeded from the commencement of the prosecution against the defendant as a repeat offender could be viewed as being limited to situations where the Legislature has affirmatively required that the prosecutor charge previous convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Such a narrow reading of this Court\u2019s precedents concerning the jurisdiction of trial courts to impose enhanced sentences is, again, negatived by other decisions of this Court applying statutes that did not specify any particular procedures to be followed when seeking sentence enhancement on the basis of a prior conviction, as in <em>People v </em>McDonald, 233 Mich 98; 206 NW 516 (1925), where the Court held that \"[t]he information must contain an averment of former conviction, and there must be proof on the trial to maintain it, to justify a conviction and sentence therefor.\u201d<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">The violation complained of is aggravated by the fact of his former conviction. He is thereby subjected to an enhanced penalty. The purpose of averring and proving it is to <em>give the court jurisdiction </em>to impose it. <em>[Id., </em>p 103. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The jurisdictional significance of proceeding from the commencement of prosecution against the defendant as a repeat offender \u2014 even where the statute authorizing sentence enhancement did not expressly so require \u2014 was confirmed in <em>In re Brazel, </em>293 Mich 632; 292 NW 664 (1940), where this Court compared the pre-Code habitual of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>fender provisions and the liquor law provisions that were applied in <em>McDonald.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The Court first noted the statement in <em>People v Campbell, </em>173 Mich 381, 386; 139 NW 24 (1912), that charging the defendant as a repeat offender was necessary to give the trial court the authority to sentence the defendant as an habitual offender. The Court then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">It will be noted that [the habitual offender provisions] contained the express mandate that the prior convictions be alleged in the indictment on which conviction of any offense is had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">This was not true of the prohibition law of 1917, as amended, which contained certain provisions in respect to increased punishment for second and subsequent offenses. Attention is called to [1917 PA 338], <em>where it will be noted that there was no provision requiring the prior convictions to be alleged in the indictment. However, this court held that in order to confer jurisdiction the information must include allegations which specify the prior convictions and that a respondent under such circumstances was entitled to a preliminary examinations[</em><footnotemark><em>138</em></footnotemark><em>] [Brazel, </em>p 639. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">In speaking of \"jurisdiction,\u201d the Court was not referring to the respective jurisdictions of the circuit court and of the justice of the peace.<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> When the Court decided the liquor law cases, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>circuit court had jurisdiction over both a first and subsequent offense.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The Court\u2019s references to \"jurisdiction\u201d were references to the authority of a court \u2014 any court\u2014 to impose an enhanced sentence on the basis of a prior conviction. Before enactment of the Code of Criminal Procedure, without regard to whether the particular sentence enhancement statute expressly required the prosecutor to charge the defendant as a repeat offender, a trial court possessed the authority to impose an enhanced sentence only where the prosecutor had proceeded from the commencement of prosecution against the defendant as a repeat offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">It is against this historical background that the Court should consider the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the procedural safeguards applicable under the habitual offender provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure do not apply where sentence enhancement is sought under the controlled substances article of the Public Health Code.<footnotemark>141</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Rather than disregard this Court\u2019s precedents concerning the authority of the trial court to impose an enhanced sentence and rather than hold that the trial court in this case did not have the authority to impose an enhanced sentence because the prosecutor did not proceed from the <em>commencement of prosecution </em>against the defendant as a repeat offender, I would hold that the procedures applicable under the habitual offender provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure also apply where the prosecutor seeks an enhanced sentence pursuant to the provisions of the controlled substances article.<footnotemark>142</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">I would thus hold that it is <em>not </em>necessary for the defendant to have been charged in the complaint and warrant as a repeat offender <em>or </em>that some evidence respecting the prior conviction be presented at the preliminary examination. It is necessary, where the prosecutor knows of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction before trial on the most recent offense, that the prosecutor file a supplemental information charging the defendant as a repeat offender within fourteen days of the arraignment or before trial if the defendant is tried within that fourteen-day period.<footnotemark>143</footnotemark> Where the prosecutor does not learn of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction until after the defendant is convicted of the most recent offense, the prosecutor may commence a postconviction proceeding to seek an enhanced sentence.<footnotemark>144</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">I acknowledge that the habitual offender provisions now state that where the defendant\u2019s most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>recent conviction is a \"major controlled substance offense,\u201d the defendant \"shall be punished as provided by\u201d the controlled substances article of the Public Health Code.<footnotemark>145</footnotemark> I would construe those provisions as evidencing a legislative intent to assure that the quantity and quality of a defendant\u2019s punishment \u2014 as distinguished from the procedures to be utilized in administering that punishment\u2014 are governed by the controlled substances laws and not by the general habitual offender provisions. In this regard, it is significant that the Legislature first \"excluded\u201d major controlled substance offenses from the habitual offender provisions at the same time it first adopted mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for controlled substance offenses.<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> In contrast, the sentencing provisions for habitual offenders are discretionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The prosecutor in this case did not file a supplemental information charging Eason as a repeat drug offender within fourteen days of Eason\u2019s arraignment. The Court of Appeals concluded that the exceptions to the fourteen-day rule were not applicable.
