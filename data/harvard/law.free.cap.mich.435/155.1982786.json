We hold that when a plaintiff has entered into a settlement agreement tender of consideration recited in the agreement must occur not only -within a reasonable time after execution of the agreement, but in all cases prior to or simultaneously with the commencement of any proceeding raising a legal claim in contravention of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">On November 16, 1983, plaintiff resigned as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>personnel director of Cranbrook Educational Community. In connection with her termination, plaintiff signed a document entitled \"Release of Claims.\u201d The release is dated November 16, 1983, and reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">For and in consideration of Cranbrook Educational Community\u2019s (Cranbrook) acceptance of the voluntary resignation of Judith Stefanac (Stefanac) and Cranbrook\u2019s further agreement to pay Stefanac for two weeks, less applicable state and federal withholding taxes, Stefanac, for herself, her heirs, administrators and executors, does hereby fully and forever release, acquit and discharge Cranbrook, its agents, servants and representatives, of and from any and all claims, demands, actions and causes of action of every kind, nature and description which Stefanac may have had, may now have or may hereafter have by reason of any matter, cause, act or omission arising out of or in connection with Stefanac\u2019s employment with and/or resignation from Cranbrook.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">After signing the release plaintiff received a check from defendant for $2,090.65. The check was purportedly intended to be payment for four weeks accrued vacation time and two weeks\u2019 severance pay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Plaintiff filed suit against Cranbrook on August 9, 1984, alleging wrongful discharge, sex discrimination, and termination in violation of public policy. Subsequently, defendant filed a motion for accelerated judgment, arguing that the release barred plaintiff\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In response, plaintiff filed an affidavit challenging the validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>of the release. The parties agreed that plaintiff's affidavit raised a question of fact, and therefore the motion was denied without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Following a discovery period of one year, defendant again moved for dismissal of the action on the grounds that the release barred suit. Defendant also argued at this point, that plaintiff\u2019s failure to tender the consideration received in exchange for the release prevented her from now attempting to rescind the agreement. Defendant\u2019s position was based on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Leahan v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>420 Mich 108; 359 NW2d 524 (1984).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff conceded that <em>Leahan </em>merely reaffirmed the law as it had existed in the past, but asserted that the facts of <em>Leahan </em>differed from the instant case. Further, plaintiff maintained that the release was void for lack of consideration and that she was entitled to all money received as a result of her termination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court interpreted <em>Leahan </em>as dispositive of the issue and granted defendant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Three weeks later, plaintiff filed a motion for rehearing. On rehearing, plaintiff sought the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>court\u2019s consent to tender the disputed consideration and, following tender of the money, the opportunity to refile her suit against defendant. This is the first indication that plaintiff was willing to repay the consideration recited in the release. The trial judge affirmed the previous ruling, dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Plaintiff appealed as of right, raising two issues. Plaintiff continued to argue that she was entitled to all the money received and therefore that tender was not required in order to maintain the action. Alternatively, plaintiff argued that her offer to tender back the disputed consideration was within a reasonable time under the circumstances of the case. Basing its analysis on an examination of <em>Leahan, </em>the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">[T]he consequence of the <em>Leahan </em>decision is that if a release recites that consideration was paid and <em>if money was in fact paid, </em>a plaintiff may not argue that the money was not actually consideration, regardless of any evidence to that effect. That seems to be what <em>Leahan </em>holds. If not, we believe it is up to the Supreme Court to say so. Consequently, we affirm.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">However, the Court of Appeals did not directly address plaintiff\u2019s alternate argument that tender of the disputed consideration occurred within a reasonable time. Consequently, we issued an order vacating the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remanded the case for consideration of the second issue raised by plaintiff. 428 Mich 903 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">On remand, the Court of Appeals ruled that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s offer to tender back the disputed con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>sideration was within a reasonable time.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court instructed the trial judge to issue an order which would allow plaintiff thirty days to make restitution to the defendant. Further, the trial court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">If such restitution is made, trial shall be had on the merits, including determination of the validity of the release. If such restitution is not made, judgment may enter for defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">Nothing in this opinion is intended to preclude the trial judge from making appropriate findings of fact after trial, including resolution of how much, if any, of the monies paid plaintiff were in consideration of the release.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 430 Mich 892 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">It is a well-settled principle of Michigan law that settlement agreements are binding until rescinded for cause. Further, tender of consideration received is a condition precedent to the right to repudiate a contract of settlement. See, generally, <em>Randall v Port Huron, St C &amp; M C R Co, </em>215 Mich 413; 184 NW 435 (1921); <em>Kirl v Zinner, </em>274 Mich 331; 264 NW 391 (1936); <em>Leahan v Stroh Brewery Co, supra. </em>The policy consideration underlying the general rule is that the law favors settlements. A party entering into a settlement agreement, offering adequate consideration, is entitled to rely on the terms of the agreement. The rationale for the rule was explained further by this Court in <em>Kirl v </em>Zinner:___</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>A compromise and release is not to be confused with the law of contract, in which equivalents are exchanged, for the very essence of a release is to avoid litigation, even at the expense of strict right. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">It is a general and salutary rule that one repudiating or seeking to avoid a compromise settlement or release, and thereby revert to the original right of action, must place the other party <em>in statu quo, </em>otherwise the very fact of payment, in consideration of the compromise or release, will likely operate as a confession of liability. [274 Mich 334-335. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Plaintiff asserts that she should be excepted from this rule because the release was void and not merely voidable. The validity of the release was challenged by plaintiff on the grounds that it lacked consideration and was procured under duress and fraud. Specifically plaintiff asserts that defendant misrepresented the terms of the agreement. Moreover she asserts that defendant knew that plaintiff was legally entitled to the money she received, that she needed the money to support her family, and that defendant waved the checks at her refusing to give plaintiff any funds unless she signed the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Plaintiff contends that although the release recites that consideration was received, she in fact did not get anything in exchange for signing the settlement agreement. Therefore tender was not necessary prior to filing suit because \"there is nothing to be returned to restore the status quo ante.\u201d However, plaintiff admits that she signed the release and that she received four checks. Subsequently she endorsed and cashed the checks received.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">We start with the presumption that the plaintiff</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>executed the release knowingly<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that the recited consideration was received.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Porth v Cadillac Motor Car Co, </em>198 Mich 501; 165 NW 698 (1917). <em>Kirl v Zinner, supra. </em>The plaintiff has the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the release is unfair or incorrect on its face. <em>Id. </em>Even in light of these presumptions and the plaintiff\u2019s burden, the plaintiff must tender the recited consideration before there is a right to repudiate the release. <em>Id. </em>The only recognized exceptions in Michigan are a waiver of the plaintiff\u2019s duty by the defendant<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and fraud in the execution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Plaintiff has not raised either exception and thus is not relieved of the duty to tender the consideration recited in the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Our reports are replete with authority that negate plaintiff\u2019s contentions. In <em>Niederhauser v Detroit Citizens\u2019 St R Co, </em>131 Mich 550, 552; 91 NW 1028 (1902), we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">The law is well settled that, if one seeks to rescind a settlement on the ground of fraud or mistake, he must, after discovering the fraud, place the other party <em>in statu quo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">In <em>Randall, supra </em>at 420, Justice Stone wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\"While there is still some real conflict in the cases as to whether or not there has to be a tender of the amount received when it is sought to set a release aside on the ground of fraud, by the weight of authority the cases divide themselves into two classes, first, where the fraud goes to inducing the injured party to sign a release, the effect of which he understands. And, second, where that fraud is in inducing him to sign a release under the belief that he was signing something else. I am satisfied that Michigan has recognized this distinction and has held, in the cases already cited, that where the fraud goes to inducing the injured party to sign a release, tender of the amount received has to be made within a reasonable length of time after discovery of the fraud. In other words, if a party claims that he was induced, through fraud, to enter into the contract, in order to rescind that contract, he must put the parties <em>in statu quo. </em>That is, he must return the money that he received, and ask to have the contract or agreement or release set aside on the ground that he entered into it through fraud.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Similarly in <em>Kirl v Zinner, supra </em>at 335, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">\"Where a party to a compromise desires to set aside or avoid the same and to be remitted to his original rights, he must place the other party <em>in statu quo </em>by returning or tendering the return of whatever has been received by him under such compromise, in case it is of any value, and so far as possible any right lost by the other party because thereof. This rule obtains even though the contract was induced by the fraud or false representations of the other party, or was obtained under duress, or was made under a mistake of fact or as to the law; and until this is done the settlement will constitute a good defense. By electing to retain the property, a party must be held to be bound by the settlement. The rule applies to actions <em>ex contractu </em>as well as <em>ex delicto.\u201d </em>12 CJ, p 355, \u00a7 57.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Our most recent pronouncement in this area is <em>Leahan v Stroh Brewery Co, supra, </em>which is in accord with this case and supports our holding. In <em>Leahan, </em>we upheld the lower court\u2019s rejection of plaintiff\u2019s challenge of a release executed in connection with his resignation from Stroh Brewery Company. Mr. Leahan filed a complaint against the defendant, alleging age discrimination and breach of employment contract. The defendant raised as a defense the language in the plaintiff\u2019s resignation letter which released the defendant of further liability. In response, the plaintiff claimed that the release was voidable because of duress and lack of consideration. As in this case, Mr. Leahan did not claim that he did not receive anything in exchange for the release. Rather, he claimed that the money he received was not consideration, but instead was representative of some other benefit that he was entitled to under the agreement. Our holding in <em>Leahan </em>reflects our position in this case that the consideration recited in the release must be tendered before the plaintiff can maintain an action for claims arising out of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s allegations of fraud are insufficient to bring her claim within the fraud in the execution exception. Plaintiff admits that she read and executed the release agreement. She was the personnel director of the institution and, in fact, had dealt with similar release agreements in other employment termination situations. Thus, we can impute to her full understanding of the terms and conditions of the agreement. Additionally, defendant has not at any time during the trial court proceedings waived plaintiff\u2019s obligation to tender the consideration recited in the release agreement. Finally, plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the release was void because it lacked consideration is directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>contrary to the express language of the release. Thus, plaintiff is not relieved of her duty to tender the consideration she received.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The dissent raises the question whether tender is a precondition to an action in equity based on the rule announced by this Court in <em>Style v Greenslade, </em>364 Mich 679, 683; 112 NW2d 92 (1961). In <em>Style </em>we held that \"[i]f the release is upheld in the chancery proceeding, that should end the matter. If the release is held invalid, plaintiff may then proceed with her law action involving questions of negligence and damages.\u201d On this authority the dissent would remand the case allowing Stefanac to amend her complaint to seek cancellation of the release <em>(post, </em>p 210, Levin, J., dissenting) even though plaintiff has not requested such relief. Albeit it was at this Court\u2019s initiative in <em>Style, supra, </em>p 683, that the case be \"remanded and further proceedings therein enjoined until plaintiff may bring and have determined an appropriate chancery action,\u201d we read <em>Style </em>not as authorizing a similar disposition in the instant case but as precedent that a plaintiff seeking to avoid a release may first seek equitable relief.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">However, the record shows no effort on the part of plaintiff in the instant case, at the time of bringing suit, to raise an issue as to the validity of the release executed in conjunction with her resignation. Rather, plaintiff merely ignored the existence and terms of the agreement and filed an action in contravention of the agreement, while at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>the same time retaining the benefit derived from the agreement. Plaintiff did not challenge the validity of the release until after defendant had raised it as a defense barring plaintiff\u2019s action at law..</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Conversely, defendant has continued to maintain that plaintiff\u2019s action is barred by the existence of the release executed by plaintiff.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although defendant did not specifically raise nontender as a defense until more than one year had passed after the commencement of the action, we find it sufficient that defendant relied on the binding nature of the agreement as an affirmative defense to the action.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Whether the tender rule announced today would preclude a plaintiff from bringing an action seeking solely equitable relief is beyond the scope of this Court\u2019s limited grant order and, given the facts of this case, such an analysis goes beyond what is necessary to resolve this dispute. Accordingly, we find it unnecessary to rule on the continued legitimacy of <em>Style </em>in view of the fact that the consolidation of the chancery court with courts of law<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> no longer requires that a plaintiff bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>separate actions in equity and law. We make no further ruling on whether a plaintiff who, under <em>Style, </em>decides to file a separate equitable action, would later be precluded from bringing an action at law by the mandatory joinder rule,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel. However, the tender rule set forth here requires that whenever a legal claim is raised in contravention of a settlement agreement, even if joined with an equitable claim, tender is a precondition. Anything less would nullify the purpose of the tender rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The dissent\u2019s alternative argument that there will be no unjust enrichment in allowing plaintiff to proceed with her actions as filed is equally without merit. The dissent asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">[T]his Court should provide Stefanac an opportunity to prove her claim that she could not obtain amounts admittedly due her without signing the release, and that the two weeks\u2019 pay, recited as consideration in the release, was, as she asserts, owed as an additional two weeks\u2019 vacation pay. <em>[Post, </em>p 196, Levin, J., dissenting.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">However, the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>she received was money already owed her is merely a restatement of the claim that the release is invalid because it lacked consideration. Further, plaintiff\u2019s actions of endorsing the check clearly marked as representing \"severance pay\u201d are contrary to her assertions in this action. Absent an appropriate proceeding to determine the validity of the release, we do not find it necessary to extend our review beyond the writings offered in support of defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In this regard, the dissent draws an analogy to an accord and satisfaction. An accord is a contract whereby the obligee agrees to discharge a preexisting duty in exchange for some substituted performance. (See 2 Restatement Contracts, 2d, \u00a7 281, pp 381-382). If any conclusion is to be drawn from such an analogy, it must be that plaintiff\u2019s actions amount to a satisfaction. By cashing the checks, plaintiff accepted defendant\u2019s substituted performance and discharged any further duty owed. <em>(Id., </em>see also 1 Restatement Contracts, 2d, \u00a769[2], p 164).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Finally, the dissent contends that our reading of <em>Leahan </em>\"contradicts] a universal tenet of the law of contracts that the parol evidence rule does not prevent a showing that there has been nonpayment/failure of consideration\u201d <em>(Post, </em>p 206, Levin, J., dissenting). Properly understood, the tender rule is not a rule of evidence but rather is a rule of procedure. We do not contest the dissent\u2019s enunciation of the principles encompassing the parol evidence rule. However, until plaintiff either challenges the validity of the release on equitable grounds or preserves the right to challenge or rescind the release by tendering the consideration recited in the release prior to or simultaneously with bringing suit, the parol evidence rule has no application. Parol evidence is admissible to explain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>the terms of the contract and has application only after the terms of the agreement have been challenged. We observe that plaintiff is not claiming that she did not receive <em>any money </em>as a result of executing the release agreement. We also note that plaintiff is not merely asserting a claim for an additional two weeks\u2019 pay.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Rather, plaintiff\u2019s actions amount to an attempted rescission of the agreement rather than an action whereby plaintiff seeks to enforce the terms of the release.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Having set forth the general rule that a plaintiff has a duty to tender the consideration recited in a release, we turn next to the question of the period of time during which the tender must take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">There are a line of cases that have addressed the question what is a reasonable time within which plaintiff can repudiate and tender other than by filing a lawsuit. The earliest case dealing with this question is <em>Bertha v Regal Motor Car Co, </em>180 Mich 51; 146 NW 389 (1914), in which the plaintiff suffered an eye injury. Following medical treatment he was informed that he would recover his eyesight in approximately seven weeks. The plaintiff entered into a settlement agreement releasing the defendant of all claims for damages resulting from the injury. Subsequently, the plaintiff learned that the doctors had misrepresented the extent of his injury. \u201dHe immediately caused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>sum of $110, with interest, to be tendered back to defendant company. Through its president this tender was refused, and suit was at once instituted.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 54. The defendant pled the release as a defense, and the circuit court directed a verdict in its favor. The <em>Bertha </em>Court reversed the verdict in favor of the defendant, holding that the plaintiff had properly repudiated the settlement agreement and that the defendant\u2019s actions in refusing to accept tender and paying for the plaintiff\u2019s medical treatment amounted to an adoption and ratification of the doctors\u2019 misrepresentation of the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">This Court relied on <em>Bertha </em>in <em>Burns v Reading Estate, </em>188 Mich 591; 155 NW 479 (1915), holding that a plaintiff must tender restitution promptly and without unreasonable delay upon discovery of the fraud or he will be held to have ratified the release. The Court found that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to rescind by refunding the contract consideration for a period of eighteen months was an unreasonable delay. \"His long acquiescence and failure to complain promptly, <em>as was his duty </em>on discovery of the true conditions operated, as a matter of law, ... to reaffirm the contract of settlement which has now become a bar to the prosecution of his stated original cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 604 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><em>Randall v Railway Co, supra, </em>is also instructive on this issue. This Court made three specific findings in <em>Randall. </em>First, the Court adhered to the general principle that a settlement agreement was binding \"until rescission by repudiation and ten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>der.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 423. Then the Court stated that tender was a prerequisite to the right to repudiate and that the commencement of a lawsuit is not a proper means to repudiate a settlement. Finally, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">It is finally contended by appellant that, if any tender was necessary, the tender made on the trial was sufficient. We think not, for the reasons stated and for the further reason that the tender was not made within a reasonable time. The long period of delay from the date of settlement to date of tender at the trial, of two and a quarter years, cannot be said to be a reasonable time as matter of law. [Id. at 424. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The rule that is derived from the foregoing analysis is that tender must occur within a reasonable time after the plaintiff learns of the grounds upon which the release and settlement could be repudiated. What is reasonable under the circumstances is a matter of discretion for the trial court. Thus in this case, had Ms. Stefanac made an offer of tender within the eight-month period between the execution of the release and the filing of suit, the issue of the reasonableness of her action would have been a matter of discretion for the trial court. However, the trial court had no occasion to rule on this issue because instead of repudiating the release agreement plaintiff proceeded to file suit in contravention of the terms of the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Independent of the issue what constitutes a reasonable time within which to repudiate a settlement is the question whether tender is permissible after commencement of an action in contravention of an agreement. Prior to this action, the issue was not squarely before the Court. The cases which have factually disallowed tender after the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>mencement of an action have not always clearly identified the rationale behind such action.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It has not been clear in those cases whether the litigation was barred because tender did not occur within a reasonable time or whether it was the lawsuit itself that prevented the plaintiff from asserting a claim. However, we find the rule to be that in order to preserve the right to challenge or rescind a release agreement, tender must occur prior to or simultaneous with the filing of a suit alleging a cause of action arising out of the release agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Plaintiff relies on <em>Carey v </em>Levy, 329 Mich 458; 45 NW2d 352 (1951), and <em>McDonald v Zinn Drywall, </em>134 Mich App 270; 350 NW2d 864 (1984), which in turn relies on <em>Carey, </em>to support her argument that the tender in this case, after the commencement of suit, was within a reasonable time. Plaintiff further argues that what constitutes a reasonable time must be determined case by case. We. disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In <em>Carey, </em>the plaintiff brought suit to recover damages as a result of an automobile accident. As a defense, the defendant offered the release executed by the parties. The trial court conditionally dismissed the action, allowing the plaintiff a forty-day grace period within which to make restitution. The plaintiff refused to comply with the order and then appealed. The only question at issue on appeal was whether the plaintiff had an obligation to tender any consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The Court adopted in its rationale, without reference to the grace period, the general proposition that the plaintiff had an obligation to tender the consideration:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Unless we hold in accord with the foregoing authorities, <em>we permit plaintiffs to retain the money they received from defendants, notwithstanding they would withhold from defendants the consideration for which the money was paid to plaintiffs </em>\u2014 i.e., <em>the release from liability and from the annoyance and expense of litigation. </em>\"If that (claimed loss of memory) disposes of the matter a safe retreat is open to parties to a settlement, for it shows an easy way to avoid a release.\u201d <em>Kirl v Zinner, supra. </em>And further, it would materially tend to discourage settlements between parties involved in this type of cases, if the settlement could be avoided without restitution. Why should one pay a substantial sum for his release from an asserted liability, if he knows that the opposite party by merely advancing a claim of mental incompetency may disavow his release and bring suit without first placing the defendant <em>in statu </em>quo? See \"Restitution and Unjust Enrichment,\u201d 46 Am Jur, p 99.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">\"The requirement that the other party to the transaction should be placed in his original position exists to prevent enrichment by the rescinding party at the expense of the other.\u201d Restatement of the Law, Restitution, ch 2, \u00a765e. <em>[Id. </em>at 464-465.

The issue of the grace period was simply not before the Court. The defendant\u2019s failure to object to the trial court\u2019s order amounted to a waiver of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">We hold as a matter of law that a plaintiff must, in all cases where a legal claim is raised in contravention of an agreement, tender the consideration recited in the agreement prior to or simultaneously with the filing of suit. To allow a grace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>period for tender after the commencement of a lawsuit would undermine the very rule announced by this Court in <em>Carey. </em>Although seemingly harsh, we find that this rule is necessary in order to preserve the stability of release agreements. As we have previously stated, a defendant is entitled to rely on the binding nature of the agreement. The very essence of a release and settlement is to avoid litigation. The plaintiff is not entitled to retain the benefit of an agreement and at the same time bring suit in contravention of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The indispensable ingredient for the utility of agreements is the principle of enforceability. The uniqueness of an agreement not to sue is that it is an agreement not to enforce other rights \u2014 an agreement to forbear enforcement. In an increasingly litigious society, the utility of such an agreement takes on increasing importance, both for overburdened courts and for economic vitality. However, when the very instrument that is intended to insure forbearance of litigation itself fosters a separate layer of litigation that is intended to resuscitate the litigability of the matter that was the subject of the settlement, enforceability (judicial scrutiny) can be defeating of the very stability the contractual instrument is intended to foster. The tender rule, therefore, is of more than historical significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Certainly no legal instrument can be totally isolated from judicial review but in order to raise a legal claim beyond the terms of the agreement a plaintiff must tender. When a contract not to sue recites consideration and there is no allegation of fraud in the execution, the tender rule provides a fair and necessary check against the instability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>contracts not to sue. To hold otherwise would undermine the principle of the enforceability of contracts in the broadest sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Plaintiff brought suit on August 9, 1984, and it was not until more than a year later that plaintiff manifested an intention to tender the disputed consideration. We hold that plaintiff is not entitled to commence suit in contravention of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s claim with prejudice is reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b278-7\">Riley, C.J., and Cavanagh, Boyle, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\"> The plaintiff had also received separate checks for refunded retirement contributions and travel expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-10\"> Defendant\u2019s motion was filed on September 4, 1984.

The check was itemized by defendant to be four weeks of accrued vacation pay and two weeks\u2019 severance pay.

Rather, the money received was for six weeks\u2019 vacation pay to which plaintiff was entitled. Defendant contends that the policies of the institution prohibit an employee from accruing more than four weeks of vacation time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\">We are not persuaded by plaintiff\u2019s argument that defendant had the burden of raising the tender issue at the time of the first motion. It is sufficient that defendant raised the release as a defense. See MCR 2.116(C)(7). This is especially significant in light of the fact that <em>Leahan </em>was not decided until three months after the ruling on defendant\u2019s first motion.

This Court is thus obliged to proceed on the assumptions, absent judicial determination at the trial level to the contrary, both that the release was in fact obtained by fraud or duress and that Cranbrook did indeed owe Stefanac two weeks\u2019 vacation pay not paid to her when the release was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">It appears, however, from the majority and concurring opinions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the disposition by the Court of this appeal is in part based on inferences that the majority has taken upon itself to draw without any issue in that regard having been raised in the motion for summary disposition or otherwise at the trial level.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The majority\u2019s disposition barring Stefanac from obtaining judicial determinations on the merits is hypertechnical. It exalts form over substance to require tender before commencement of an action to set aside a release when it is apparent that the defendant would not have accepted the tender if it had been made promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Courts generally excuse tender of consideration where tender would be futile.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Surely it would not be seriously contended that Cranbrook would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>accepted $1,042.31 from Stefanac, and thereby agreed to set aside the release, had that amount been tendered before this action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Nor was Cranbrook prejudiced by the delay in tender.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The majority\u2019s reading of <em>Leahan v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>420 Mich 108; 359 NW2d 524 (1984),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is incorrect, and contradicts a well-established tenet of the law of contracts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Parol evidence is always admissible to show that a statement in a document is not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Although the release recites the payment of two weeks\u2019 pay as consideration (severance pay), Stefanac is not precluded from contending that nothing was actually paid as severance pay because Cranbrook owed her as vacation pay the amount, $1,042.31, purported to have been paid as consideration. And, thus, no separate consideration was actually paid for the release of her underlying claims. And, therefore, because $1,042.31 is owing to her as vacation pay, she need not return the $1,042.31 if the release were to be set aside for fraud or duress. And, accordingly, there was no need to <em>tender </em>the $1,042.31 to protect against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>unjust enrichment of Stefanac should she prevail on her claim that the release should be so set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The question whether a release without consideration is <em>valid </em>and the question whether recited consideration must in all events be <em>tendered </em>\u00e1re different questions. The question presented is not whether the release is valid or there must be consideration, but whether whatever is recited as consideration must, whatever the facts and circumstances, be tendered before suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">I will concede, arguendo, that a release may in some circumstances be valid although no monetary consideration was paid.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It does not follow that whatever is recited as consideration must be tendered before suit. The recital of payment may be false. The payee may be entitled to retain the amount paid if the release is set aside because the amount paid belongs in all events to the payee and was not paid as separate consideration for the release of the payee\u2019s underlying claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">There is ample, well-established authority that tender before suit is not required where the creditor (Stefanac) claims both that the release is invalid or otherwise does not bar the action and that the amount recited as consideration is, in all events, owing to the creditor (Stefanac) by the debtor (Cranbrook). <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This exception is based on the reason for requiring tender, avoidance of the unjust enrichment of the plaintiff that would result if he were permitted to retain, after a release is set aside, consideration paid therefor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Where the plaintiff claims, and the court finds, that he would be entitled to retain the recited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>consideration after the release is set aside because the amount recited as consideration for the release represents in fact money that accrued and was owing to the plaintiff separate and apart from the claims that were settled by the release and that no consideration was in fact paid to settle those claims, tender is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">What motivates Cranbrook\u2019s legal argument is not so much a desire to prevent prejudice to Cranbrook resulting from delay in tender or to prevent unjust enrichment of Stefanac resulting from retention of the $1,042.31, as it is a desire to convert the law of tender into a jurisdictional requirement \u2014 a new statute of limitation of sorts, in addition to the one that protects against stale claims \u2014 that bars the costly litigation of potentially embarrassing claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Cranbrook contends that rigid enforcement of the tender rule will reduce the proliferation of unjustifiable wrongful discharge litigation. The majority apparently agrees, stating that releases, because they are contracts to discourage litigation, should not themselves become the breeding ground for further litigation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The tender rule is, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>majority, a means of discouraging litigation of the validity of a release.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The purpose of the tender rule is not, however, to provide a \"fair and necessary check against the instability of contracts,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but rather to provide a check against the unjust enrichment of the rescinding party that would result if the rescinding party were allowed to retain the benefits of the contract he attacks.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The majority, in stating that tender is a precondition to suit \"whenever a legal claim is raised in contravention of settlement agreement, even if joined with an equitable claim,\u201d ignores not only the unjust enrichment rationale for the tender rule, but also a critical difference between an action in equity to set aside a release and an action on a \"law\u201d count in disaffirmance of the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The factual dispute in an action to set aside a release does not involve the merits of plaintiff\u2019s underlying claim against the defendant that were resolved by the release if it is valid. It is only if and when the release is set aside that the plaintiff should be able to put the defendant to the expense of defending against the underlying claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">I agree with the majority that the \"very essence\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> of a release and settlement is to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>litigation \u2014 litigation concerning the settlement of the <em>underlying claims, </em>not litigation of the validity of the release itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The rule in equity<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> permitting a plaintiff to maintain an action to set aside a release without tender of consideration paid for the release does not put the defendant to the \"annoyance and expense of litigation\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> of claims discharged by the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The consideration paid by a defendant to a plaintiff at the time a release is signed protects only against litigation of the underlying claims, and is not paid to secure, and cannot provide protection<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> against, litigation of a claim that the release was procured by fraud or duress. The consideration does not protect, in the words of the majority, the \"very instrument that is intended to ensure forbearance of litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A08\">Since the consideration paid for the release does not protect against litigation of a claim that the release is invalid, the consideration need not be returned as a precondition to an attack on the validity of the release itself as distinguished from litigation of the underlying claims. To be sure, if the release is found to be invalid, the consideration paid to protect against litigation of the underlying claims must most certainly then be returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>before the plaintiff may be permitted to proceed with litigation of underlying claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Stefanac was employed for more than two years as personnel director of Cranbrook, a private school located in a northwest Detroit suburb. Stefanac, on deposition, testified that on the morning of November 16, 1983, she was advised by her supervisor, Robert Kipp, that her employment was terminated. Later that day, William Powell, a Cranbrook administrator, entered her office and presented a release form. According to Stefanac, Powell waved several checks in front of her, but did not allow her to examine them. Stefanac believed the checks to be payroll and expense reimbursement checks. Stefanac testified that she asked Powell if he was implying that she would not receive the checks unless she signed the release and that Powell responded, \"you\u2019ve never been a dumb person.\u201d Explaining that she needed the checks to support her children, Stefanac said that she was signing the release under duress.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Cranbrook\u2019s account of the events on the day Stefanac\u2019s employment was terminated is significantly different.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Stefanac commenced this action alleging that she had performed her job dutifully and faithfully and that her discharge violated Cranbrook\u2019s policy or practice of terminating employees only for major failures in professional conduct. She further alleged that she had been discriminated against on the basis of her sex<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and that terminating her employment violated public policy.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Three checks were delivered to Stefanac after she signed the release. Two were for amounts owed her for travel reimbursement and retirement contribution.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The third was designated as four weeks\u2019 vacation pay and two weeks\u2019 severance pay.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The third check is in issue. Cranbrook contends that at the time it terminated Stefanac\u2019s employment, it owed her four weeks\u2019 vacation pay, and that the two weeks\u2019 pay, designated on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>voucher accompanying the check as severance pay, was the two weeks\u2019 pay ($1,042.31) recited as consideration in the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Stefanac asserts that, at the time her employment was terminated, Cranbrook owed her at least six weeks\u2019 vacation pay.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Thus, when Cranbrook paid her six weeks\u2019 pay, it paid her only the vacation pay it owed her and did not pay her the two weeks\u2019 pay recited as consideration in the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">I share the majority\u2019s concern with protecting the integrity of <em>settlements. </em>It is, however, surely at least debatable whether the law should characterize as a settlement what occurred at Cranbrook on the day Stefanac was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Stefanac claims that a few hours after her discharge \u2014 before she had asserted a claim of any kind against Cranbrook \u2014 a Cranbrook official confronted her with a release form and led her to believe that the only way she could take home checks for amounts admittedly owed her was to sign the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">A release is valid only if it is fairly and knowingly made,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and is invalid if entered into as a result of duress<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> or fraud.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Parol evidence is admissible to show duress<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> or fraud.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The question whether Stefanac, in fact and law, suffered duress or was induced by fraud to enter into the release has not been briefed or argued.

The opening line states, \"For and in consideration of Cranbrook Educational Community\u2019s (Cranbrook) acceptance of the <em>voluntary </em>resignation of Judith Stefanac . . . .\u201d Stefanac did not voluntarily resign from Cranbrook. Her employment was involuntarily terminated.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">It would seem that a writing, prepared by Cranbrook, that begins with a knowingly false recital of fact warrants close scrutiny rather than the reverence with which the majority vests this writing. Cranbrook\u2019s reliance on a writing prepared by it containing statements of fact known to have been false when made is a further reason to allow Stefanac the opportunity to show that other statements of the writing, including the recital of consideration and the disclaimer of duress, were also untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">It was not Stefanac who, armed with claims against her employer, negotiated with Cranbrook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>and ultimately accepted two weeks\u2019 pay in full settlement. It was, rather, Cranbrook that sought out Stefanac only a few hours after the termination of her employment. Cranbrook confronted Stefanac with the writing before she had time to overcome the stress she claimed she experienced as a result of her discharge from employment, or time to consider possible courses or causes of action or to consult with a lawyer to frame a strategy for bartering for her claims.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">[T]he very fact of \"haste,\u201d when coupled with nominal payment, is a potent factor courts take into account when cases like this arrive before them. <em>[Hall v Strom Construction Co, </em>368 Mich 253, 261; 118 NW2d 281 (1962).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Cranbrook\u2019s conduct might be found by the trier of fact, were this Court to allow the factual issues to be decided on the merits, to be comparable to a preemptive strike by an insurer who obtains a \"rush release\u201d from an injured person shortly after an accident.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"AR6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Cranbrook acted on the advice of counsel.

The court said that the plaintiffs were presented with an all- or-nothing choice; they were told that if they did not resign during the meeting they would leave the meeting with absolutely nothing. Holding that under Pennsylvania law, the conditions under which the men signed the releases might constitute duress, the court denied the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The law does indeed favor compromise and settlement. It also recognizes, I agree, that persons often face difficult choices, and that they should be held to their agreements.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> But it is the courts\u2019 role to enforce compromises, not to create them.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> This Court invades the province of the trier of fact in finding that what occurred at Cranbrook on the day Stefanac\u2019s employment was terminated constituted a \"settlement\u201d or a \"compromise.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Stefanac testified that she was offered a choice of either signing away her claims against Cranbrook in exchange for two weeks\u2019 pay or forgoing receipt at that time of amounts that Cranbrook conceded it owed her for vacation pay, expense reimbursement, retirement contribution and wages. If those were in fact the circumstances, the release no more represented an accord or settlement and has no more validity than if she had signed under threat of physical harm. The law does not permit an employer to withhold the payment of wages and other amounts due an employee to coerce the employee into releasing claims against the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">If there was no accord or settlement, if the release has no validity, cashing the check that included the two weeks\u2019 pay was not a satisfaction.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Had Cranbrook paid Stefanac the amounts it admittedly owed her and, after checks therefor had been delivered, offered Stefanac two weeks\u2019 pay in exchange for a release of any and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>possible claims,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and had Stefanac signed the release and then accepted the check, a different question would be presented. Stefanac would then have been free to accept or reject the offer of two weeks\u2019 pay in exchange for the release of all claims without forgoing the receipt of money admittedly owing.

That tends to support, somewhat, Stefanac\u2019s assertion that she could not obtain the four weeks\u2019 vacation pay unless she signed the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Be that as it may, this Court should provide Stefanac an opportunity to prove her claim that she could not obtain amounts admittedly due her without signing the release, and that the two weeks\u2019 pay, recited as consideration in the release, was, as she asserts, owed as an additional two weeks\u2019 vacation pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">The general rule is, indeed, that a person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>claims that <em>he has rescinded </em>a contract cannot retain consideration received under the contract, and must tender recited consideration before commencing an action in disaffirmance of the contract.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The rule is an expression of the principle that \"you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The reason for requiring tender is to prevent unjust enrichment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">\"The requirement that the other party to the transaction should be placed in his original position exists to prevent enrichment by the rescinding party at the expense of the other.\u201d <em>[Carey v Levy, </em>329 Mich 458, 465; 45 NW2d 352 (1951), quoting Restatement Restitution, ch 2, \u00a7 65e.][<footnotemark>46</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The commentary provides, however: \"[T]he reason for the [tender] rule limits it.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The commentary elaborates that tender is not required where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the rescinding party was entitled \"to retain what the other gave\u201d as consideration.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">That statement in the commentary is based on the reason for requiring tender, to prevent unjust enrichment.

In <em>Fritz, </em>the plaintiff-seller of corn, brought an action to recover the unpaid balance on a contract from Marantette, the defendant-purchaser. The defendant said that the corn was inferior, that the plaintiff had agreed to a deduction from the contract price, and that the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of the check endorsed \"corn contract paid in full\u201d for the reduced price constituted an accord and satisfaction. The plaintiff crossed out the endorsement before depositing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>check.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The plaintiff did not return the proceeds of the check before commencing an action for the unpaid balance. This Court, observing that \"whether a particular set of facts amounts to an accord and satisfaction is generally a question of fact for the fact-finder,\u201d held that the trial court did not err in allowing the case to go to the jury.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In <em>Urben, </em>an employee sued his former employer. This Court held that the question whether there was an accord and satisfaction is a question of fact.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> It does not appear that the final paycheck, claimed by the defendant to have been paid in full consideration of all claims, was tendered before suit. In <em>Sall v Luxenberg, </em>302 So 2d 167 (Fla, 1974), the court said that the principle requiring tender would not be applied on the record in that case because \"the consideration for the release which would determine the amount of tender is presently in dispute.\u201d_</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>Fritz </em>and <em>Urben </em>recognize that, notwithstanding that a check contains words of release, where there is a dispute whether the money received by the plaintiff constituted payment of a liquidated debt owed by the defendant, the question what debts were settled by the payment cannot be determined as a matter of law.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> <em>Sail </em>indicates that where there is a dispute, tender is not a prerequisite to commencement of an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The legal issue, obfuscated by the polarized employer versus employee posture in which the issue arrives for decision, might be clearer if the plaintiff were a businessman and not an employee claiming wrongful discharge. And the businessman asserted in his complaint, with apparent plausibility, that he had sold merchandise for $25,000 to a defendant who turned out to be a deadbeat, and that defendant deadbeat had strong-armed plaintiff businessman into accepting $10,000 and signing a release of the remaining $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">I doubt that this Court would require the businessman to run the risk of returning the $10,000 to defendant deadbeat as a precondition to commencing an action for the $15,000, even though defendant deadbeat responded to plaintiff\u2019s complaint by denying that he owed the $15,000 or the $10,000, denying that he was a deadbeat or that he had strong-armed the plaintiff, and by imploring this Court to underscore the importance of encouraging and protecting settlements and the sanctity of written documents by requiring the return of the $10,000 as a precondition to suit for the $15,000, trusting deadbeat to be found and to pay a judgment should the Court ultimately find for the plaintiff.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">The majority extends <em>Leahan </em>beyond the scope of the decision in that case and, in so doing, ignores a well-recognized exception to the parol evidence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The Court of Appeals and now the majority in this Court, reading <em>Leahan </em>out of context,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> interpret it as setting forth some sort of parol evidence rule. They erroneously read <em>Leahan </em>as precluding Stefanac from proving by extrinsic evidence, before being required to tender, that, if the release were set aside, she would be entitled nevertheless to retain the consideration recited in the release because Cranbrook owes her that amount as vacation pay and, thus, there is no need to tender that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>amount before suit to guard against unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Leahan argued that the language of the letter he signed supported his claim that the consideration recited in the letter was paid solely in exchange for future performance by Leahan of \"specific tasks and obligations\u201d and that no consideration was paid for the release of the claims he sought to assert in the lawsuit. The Court looked at the language of the letter and ruled, as a matter of construction of the language, that the recited consideration was paid in exchange for release of the claims there described as well as for the \"specific tasks and obligations\u201d undertaken by Leahan.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The Court in <em>Leahan </em>thus merely resolved a dispute concerning how the language of the letter should be construed.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The Court held only that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Leahan had not established that the consideration was paid solely in exchange for the \"specific tasks and obligations\u201d and not for the release of the claims in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">If <em>Leahan </em>were read as barring evidence that recitation of payment of consideration was untrue, and thus no consideration was received, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number><em>Leahan </em>would contradict a universal tenet of the law of contracts that the parol evidence rule does not prevent a showing that there has been nonpayment/failure of consideration:<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">The vast majority of cases have held that it may be shown that the consideration has not been paid and that no other consideration has been given.

Nor has she contended that this Court should apply in the instant case the rule developed in courts of equity that tender is not required where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>an action for cancellation of a release is commenced in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">I could nevertheless join in such a disposition of this case. Such a disposition is precedentially supported by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Style </em>where the Court acted on its own initiative. Alternatively, this Court could appropriately require further briefing of whether the <em>Style </em>disposition \u2014 remanding to add a count seeking cancellation and trial by the court<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> \u2014 should be ordered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"Akm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The Court is so smitten with the importance of tender, that, without briefing, argument, or citation of authority, it appears to substitute a new gatekeeping rationale \u2014 protection of \"settlements\u201d \u2014for the well- and long-established avoidance-of-unjust-enrichment rationale of the tender requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">[T]he tender rule set forth here requires that whenever a legal claim is raised in contravention of a settlement agreement, <em>even if joined with an equitable claim, </em>tender is a precondition. <em>Anything less would nullify the purpose of the tender rule.

The only purpose heretofore recognized by this or any other court is avoidance of the unjust enrichment that would result if the plaintiff could keep separate consideration paid for a release after it is set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Many leading authorities agree that, after the abolition of the procedural distinction between law and equity so that a trial court can, whatever the form of action or relief sought, indisputably enter a conditional judgment, there is no need to require tender as a precondition to commencing an action brought in disaffirmance of a release to guard against the unjust enrichment of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">No authority was found resurrecting tender, on a gatekeeping rationale, as an absolute precondition to suit. It appears that Michigan, if it persists in the obiter dictum announced by the majority today without briefing, argument, or citation of authority, will be alone in requiring tender on a gatekeeping rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Modern procedural reforms,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> in conjunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>with the consolidation in one court of jurisdiction of both equitable and law claims, eliminate the necessity of tender as a prerequisite to commencement of an action seeking <em>to obtain rescission. </em>Under unified proceedings, a court may enter a judgment conditioning rescission on the return of consideration received by the plaintiff, thus effectuating the purpose of the tender rule, the avoidance of unjust enrichment of the rescinding party:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">In equity, his [the rescinding party\u2019s] failure to make such an offer [to return what he has received] before commencing a suit for rescission did not preclude relief.

In a court of general jurisdiction, having both law and equity powers, if the court can work out the problem of mutual restitution in one action it can do so in another, and it should make no difference that in an earlier period one was a suit in equity while the other was an action at law.

We all agree that a plaintiff should not be permitted to proceed in an action in disaffirmance of a release unless and until he tenders consideration paid for the release of the underlying claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Recognizing, now that the procedural distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>between law and equity has been abolished, that tender before suit is no longer a precondition to <em>commencement </em>of an action would not mean that a plaintiff may put the defendant to the expense of defending against the plaintiff\u2019s claims on the merits of the underlying controversy before returning consideration in fact paid to avoid incurring that very expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">A person who has signed a release who wishes to commence an action in disaffirmance of the release should be required to include in his complaint a separate count seeking to set aside the release.

If the release is found to be valid, the plaintiff\u2019s action would be dismissed and the defendant would have prevailed before any discovery on the meritorious questions in the underlying controversy.

If so, a court would presumably so adjudicate were there a hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">To be sure, there is considerable unjustified, costly litigation brought by disgruntled employees who should have been discharged by forbearing and indulgent employers long before they were in fact discharged. Unjustified litigation is a pall, manipulated by far too many plaintiffs and defendants and their advocates, that both hampers the administration of justice and undermines public confidence in the courts. It is a pall that preceded the burgeoning wrongful discharge litigation industry.

She was the personnel director of the institution and, in fact, had dealt with similar release agreements in other employment termination situations. Thus, we can impute to her full understanding of the terms and conditions of the agreement. [Ante, p 167.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">Stefanac\u2019s knowledge of the terms of the release does not negate her claim that her signature was obtained by fraud or duress. A person who signs in response to a perfectly clear threat acts knowingly. The signer could resist the threat and suffer the consequences, economic, physical or other. Signing to avoid suffering the consequences is a volitional act in the sense that the signer could accept the consequences of not signing, but is not voluntary in the legal sense of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">The concurring opinion goes a step further in factual assessment, a task ordinarily left to the trier of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Lastly, I disagree with the dissent on one point. I do not believe the plaintiff was coerced into signing the release. The plaintiff\u2019s failure to question the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s offer of alleged consideration reflects negligence, not on the part of the defendant, but on the part of the plaintiff. The dissent presumes that the immediacy of the defendant\u2019s request that plaintiff sign a release agreement necessarily intimated that the defendant prohibited the plaintiff from retaining an attorney. I disagree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-a\">The implicit alleged threat, \"sign now or forego your money,\u201d still carried with it the notion that the plaintiff should have been, with or without an attorney, concerned or at least hesitant about signing away her right to sue <em>at any price, </em>especially if she felt she had been wronged in her dismissal. Therefore, in my view, there was no actionable coercion in this case. <em>[Post, </em>p 227.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK0\">The view expressed in the concurring opinion suggests that as the seriousness of the threat escalates, the person threatened is less justified, and more negligent, in signing. It was for the trier of fact to decide whether the threat was real or not, and of such immediacy that Stefanac\u2019s signature was obtained by fraud or duress. A person not easily intimidated might reject outright a threat. The trier of fact might conclude, however, that a reasonable person in Stefanac\u2019s position might respond to the threat by thinking twice about <em>not </em>signing the release, and, as a consequence, relinquishing or delaying receipt of monies owing to her. In other words, the trier might find that Stefanac did not act unjustifiably in reacting to the threat by thinking first about the consequences of noncompliance and, only after receipt of the money concededly due her, about the rights she lost by signing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\"> Cranbrook moved in September, 1984, a month after this action was commenced, for summary disposition on the basis of the release. Stefanac responded that the release was invalid because of fraud, duress, and lack of consideration. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">More than a year later, in November, 1985, Cranbrook again moved for summary disposition, alleging for the first time that Stefanac had failed to tender the consideration recited in the release. Stefanac responded that she should be excused from tendering because she had not in fact received any consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">The circuit court, relying on <em>Leahan v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>420 Mich 108; 359 NW2d 524 (1984), decided by this Court in December, 1984, ruled that Stefanac\u2019s failure to tender the consideration recited in the release required the dismissal of her complaint. The Court of Appeals, also relying on <em>Leahan, </em>affirmed the decision of the trial court, and did not reach the question whether Stefanac should have been provided an opportunity, after Cranbrook raised the tender issue, to tender the $1,042.31 before her complaint was dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b280-11\"> Stefanac offered to tender the $1,042.31 three weeks later.

The Court of Appeals, on remand, held that, under the circumstances, Stefanac\u2019s tender had been made within a reasonable time, and remanded the case to the circuit court for reinstatement if tender were made within thirty days of the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">Stefanac deposited the $1,042.31 with the circuit court on January 29, 1988, two weeks after the circuit court entered an order reinstating her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">This Court first denied, and on reconsideration granted, Cranbrook\u2019s application for leave to appeal, and stayed proceedings in the circuit court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b281-9\"> See n 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\"> 5 Corbin, Contracts, ch 61, \u00a7 1116, p 627; <em>Duncombe v Tromble, </em>219 Mich 8; 188 NW 267 (1922); <em>Lackovic v Campbell, </em>225 Mich 1; 194 NW 789 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">In <em>Burns v Misura, </em>228 Mich 152, 155; 199 NW 606 (1924), this Court, quoting <em>Rhines v Skinner Packing Co, </em>108 Neb 105, 110; 187 NW 874 (1922), said that where \" 'a timely, perfect tender in every respect would have been unavailing [and] [i]t would have been rejected and the attitude of the defendant so shows,\u2019\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s failure to tender should not preclude recovery in a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">Stefanac\u2019s lawyer has not contended, however, that since tender assuredly would have been refused, it was not required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b282-10\"> Since Cranbrook did not reuse the tender issue until more than a year etfter this action was commenced, the only prejudice that Cranbrook could have suffered as a result of the delay in tender weis the expense of litigation sustained during the three-week interval between the time that it raised the tender issue and the time the circuit court decided it.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">Cranbrook\u2019s counsel may not have had the temerity to raise the tender issue because it was so clear that Cranbrook would not have accepted a tender of $1,042.31 had it been earlier offered.

The uniqueness of an agreement not to sue is that it is an agreement not to enforce other rights \u2014an agreement to forbear enforcement. In an increasingly litigious society, the utility of such an agreement takes on increasing importance, both for overburdened courts and for economic vitality. However, when the very instrument that is intended to insure forbearance of litigation itself fosters a separate layer of litigation that is intended to resuscitate the litigability of the matter that was the subject of the settlement, enforceability (judicial scrutiny) can be defeating of the very stability the contractual instrument is intended to foster. The tender rule, therefore, is of more than historical significance. <em>[Ante, </em>p 177.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b285-9\"> Ante, pp 177-178.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"AO\"> See n 47 and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b285-11\"> We hold as a matter of law that a plaintiff must, in all cases where a legal claim is raised in contravention of an agreement, tender the consideration recited in the agreement prior to or simultaneously with the filing of suit.

In December, 1978, Leahan was summarily discharged and presented with a letter of resignation which had been prepared by Stroh and its legal counsel. Leahan was not allowed to consult with counsel and was told that he must sign the document or suffer the loss of all compensation and benefits. Leahan signed the letter that included a general release of all claims against Stroh. The letter promised Leahan sizeable benefits. The release stated that if Leahan performed duties requested by Stroh\u2019s president and refrained from employment elsewhere, he would be continued at his base salary of $10,355 per month until March, 1979, that Leahan would serve as consultant to Stroh for $93,195, and that Leahan\u2019s medical coverage and his membership at the Detroit Athletic Club would be continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The final paragraph of the letter stated that \"[i]n <em>further consideration of the foregoing,\u201d </em>Leahan would discharge Stroh from all claims and actions.

Stroh noted that Leahan had failed to tender the consideration supporting the release.

It calls up the application of sound judicial discretion with no constitutional right of sequence of trial or jury trial involved; whenever the jurisdiction of equity is unquestioned, as here in <em>Wolf.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">It may be that Michigan does not share the federal preference for jury trials voiced in <em>Beacon Theatres </em>and <em>Dairy Queen. </em>In <em>Brown v Kalamazoo Circuit Judge, </em>75 Mich 274, 284; 42 NW 827 (1889), this Court rejected as unconstitutional a statute that would have extended the right to jury trial to actions traditionally equitable, and said that \"[t]he right to have equity controversies dealt with by equitable methods is as sacred as the right of trial by jury.\u201d In Michigan, thus, it may be that there is a constitutional right to a <em>nonjury </em>trial on issues of fact in actions sounding in equity. See note, <em>The right to non-jury trial, </em>74 Harv LR 1176, 1190 (1961), and 2 Honigman &amp; Hawkins, <em>supra, </em>pp 449-450.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Finally, as was noted in <em>Farwell v Neal, </em>40 Mich App 351, 353; 198 NW2d 801 (1972), \"[t]he <em>Style </em>decision . . . has yet to become the subject of 'scrutinous re-examination\u2019 by our Supreme Court . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"76\">\n<p id=\"b315-8\"> The distinctions between law and equity proceedings shall, as far as practicable, be abolished.

I write separately, however, to lend a slightly different perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Unlike the dissent, I believe this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Leahan v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>420 Mich 108; 359 NW2d 524 (1984), offered a sound and consistent method through which persons perceiving themselves to be aggrieved by signed release agreements could repudiate. I further believe the rule is applicable to the case at bar. However, in my view, the <em>Leahan </em>rule in its present state is neither complete nor fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">In instances where there is a <em>bona \u00f1de, good-faith </em>dispute regarding whether consideration recited in the \"expressed language of the release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>agreement\u201d <em>actually </em>amounted to that which is defined \"consideration,\u201d the rule in <em>Leahan </em>is unworkable. Accordingly, I agree that \" 'Where, aside from the transaction, the person seeking restitution would be entitled to retain what the other gave as the result of the agreement, the transaction does not enrich him even though he retains such things, nor does it diminish the net assets of the other ....\u2019\u201d See <em>ante, </em>p 198, n 48, citing Restatement Restitution, ch 2, \u00a765e; see also <em>Carey v Levy, </em>329 Mich 458, 465; 45 NW2d 352 (1951). The practical purpose of the \"tender first\u201d rule is to ensure that the party challenging the validity of the release form receives no unjust enrichment in receiving monies exchanged. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Clearly, a plaintiff who contests the sufficiency of the consideration supporting a release agreement should be allowed to withhold tender of such alleged consideration until there is a judicial determination that consideration was in fact paid. If it is found that the consideration was paid, then the plaintiff should be required to tender that amount. However, if the court determines that the amount paid to the plaintiff for the release was already owed to the plaintiff, then the plaintiff should be allowed to retain that amount and proceed with any legal action. See, generally, <em>ante, </em>pp 196-202, part hi.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The nature and depth of the rights sacrificed at the signing of a release or settlement agreement are of such stature that a mere, hollow \"recitation of consideration\u201d should not be considered as a sufficient basis for the exchange. Indeed, the <em>sufficiency </em>of consideration, in this context, should be foremost in the construction, execution, and review of the activities surrounding release and settlement agreements. Any endeavor to balance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>the equities involved in the relinquishment of clearly defined rights demands, above all, fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">In my view, the majority fails in its attempt to justify the harshness and inflexibility of the <em>Leahan </em>\"tender back\u201d rule with its assertion that parties contesting the fact and existence of consideration in this context should, prior to instituting an action on the propriety of their own dismissal, bring an action for rescission of the release agreement in equity. For then, the majority states, the issue whether valid consideration supported the agreement can be decided preceding the institution of a wrongful discharge suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In my view, however, even in the case that the validity of the release agreement is not challenged preceding the filing of legal claims, there is no justice in maintaining a rule that blindly demands \"tender back,\u201d even when tender, absolutely, should not be required. See Williston, Contracts (3d ed), \u00a7 1530, p 646; 76 CJS, Release, \u00a7 37, p 666. It is the iron-clad feature of the rule that sits at the center of this dispute. The \"tender back\u201d rule simply cannot in fairness be properly applied, in every case, unless there is, in addition to equitable rescission, some internal method by which the sufficiency of that which must be tendered back, i.e., the consideration itself, can be \"checked\u201d as well. Hence, Justice Levin\u2019s proposed rule, which merely reflects the standardization of Restatement Restitution, ch 2, \u00a765, comment e, provides the fairest solution of all.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In the present case, the plaintiff was unquestionably owed her earned wages, as well as four weeks of accrued vacation pay. Thus, she was not unjustly enriched in the receipt of these. However, because there is a factual dispute regarding whether additional vacation pay was owed, I believe, any amount over that which was concededly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number><em>owed </em>to the plaintiff should, indeed, be tendered to the defendant within a reasonable time following the resolution of this question of fact by the trial court. Accordingly, I would urge that the plaintiff be allowed to amend her complaint to request rescission of the release agreement. See <em>Style v Greenslade, </em>364 Mich 679; 112 NW2d 92 (1961); <em>McDonald v Zinn Drywall, </em>134 Mich App 270, 277; 350 NW2d 864 (1984); <em>Carey, supra </em>at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Lastly, I disagree with the dissent on one point. I do not believe the plaintiff was coerced into signing the release. The plaintiff\u2019s failure to question the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s offer of alleged consideration reflects negligence, not on the part of the defendant, but on the part of the plaintiff. The dissent presumes that the immediacy of the defendant\u2019s request that plaintiff sign a release agreement necessarily intimated that the defendant prohibited the plaintiff from retaining an attorney. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The implicit alleged threat, \"sign now or forego your money,\u201d still carried with it the notion that the plaintiff should have been, with or wdthout an attorney, concerned or at least hesitant about signing away her right to sue <em>at any price, </em>especially if she felt she had been wronged in her dismissal. Therefore, in my view, there was no actionable coercion in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
