The defendant, American Universal Insurance Company, insured Lichon\u2019s business against the risk of fire loss. The building housing Denny\u2019s Party Store caught fire in December, 1984, resulting in partial damage to the business. In January, 1985, as Denny\u2019s was preparing to reopen, a second fire destroyed the entire building, causing the total loss of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Lichon filed claims for the fire damage. When nearly a year had passed without a positive response from the insurance company, he filed this suit, seeking to recover his losses under the terms of his insurance policy. Within seven months after the suit was filed, the parties were able to come to a settlement agreement. Approximately five weeks later, but before American Universal paid the agreed sum, Lichon was charged with burning real property, MCL 750.73; MSA 28.268. The state accused Mr. Lichon of setting both fires.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Lichon eventually entered a plea of nolo contendere to the lesser charge of attempted burning of real property. He was convicted and sentenced to one year in the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">In this civil action, American Universal filed a motion for summary disposition under MCR</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>2.116(C)(7)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (10),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> contending that Lichon\u2019s nolo contendere plea and conviction prevented him from recovering on the insurance contract. The insurance company argued that Lichon was barred from recovery under the contract\u2019s antifraud exclusionary clause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The company argued that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. American Universal argued that it was entitled to judgment under MCR 2.116(C)(7), because Lichon was collaterally estopped by his conviction from disputing his role in setting the fires, and under MCR 2.116(0(10) because principles of equity es-topped Lichon from raising any issue of fact regarding his role in the arson. American Universal argued that Lichon was unable to rebut its affirmative defense of arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The circuit court granted defendant\u2019s motion under MCR 2.116(0(10) and entered judgment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>its favor. The Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We granted leave to appeal<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and we hereby reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">We begin our analysis by acknowledging a fundamental principle which presents the background for this case: A wrongdoer should never profit from crime. <em>Budwit v Herr, </em>339 Mich 265; 63 NW2d 841 (1954). It is axiomatic that a person who owns insured property and causes it to burn is not entitled to collect the insurance proceeds. See also <em>Walz v Peninsular Fire Ins Co, </em>221 Mich 326; 191 NW 230 (1922); <em>Eagle, Star &amp; British Dominions Ins Co v Heller, </em>149 Va 82, 111; 140 SE 314 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">This axiom holds true for two reasons. First, the language of standard business insurance policies, including the policy of insurance issued on Mr. Lichon\u2019s property, prevents recovery for damages caused by an insured\u2019s criminal acts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Second, it is untenable on public policy grounds to allow a person to profit from such a fraud. As the Supreme Court of Virginia in <em>Eagle, Star, supra, </em>p 111, so eloquently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">To permit a recovery under a policy of fire insurance by one who has been convicted of burning the property insured, would be to disregard the contract, be illogical, would discredit the administration of justice, defy public policy and shock the most unenlightened conscience. To sustain such a judgment would be to encourage and give support to the current thoughtless and carping criticism of legal procedure, and to justify the gibe that the administration of the law is the only remaining legalized</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>To say that an arsonist should not profit from his crime, however, does not answer the question at the heart of this case, the question how a court may properly determine that a litigant is, in fact, an arsonist.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Under review is the trial court\u2019s order granting American Universal\u2019s motion for summary judgment under MCR 2.116(0(10). A motion for summary disposition under that court rule tests the factual sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The trial court cannot grant the defendant\u2019s motion unless it is impossible to support the plaintiff\u2019s claim at trial because of some deficiency that cannot be overcome. See <em>Rizzo v Kretschmer, </em>389 Mich 363, 372; 207 NW2d 316 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The trial court granted judgment for American Universal, stating \"that the theory of equitable estoppel should be applied in this case.\u201d The trial court held that Lichon was equitably estopped from disclaiming responsibility for the fires that burned his store because he pled nolo contendere to attempted burning of real property. In effect, the court reasoned that, since Lichon was estopped by his plea and conviction from disclaiming responsibility for the fires, he would be unable to present any facts at trial that would overcome American Universal\u2019s affirmative defense. The court further supported its holding on the public policy grounds that one should not profit from wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Our review of this case requires us to determine whether the trial court was correct in ruling that Lichon was unable, because of his nolo contendere plea and conviction, to raise a question of material fact regarding his role in setting the fires that burned his business. The trial court was correct only if Lichon is estopped, either by general principles of equity or principles of collateral estoppel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>from denying responsibility for the fires after his nolo contendere plea and conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">We hold that the trial court erred. We do not believe Lichon was estopped from disclaiming any role in setting the fires. Neither do we believe that Lichon\u2019s nolo contendere plea-based conviction collaterally estopped him from presenting evidence at trial in an attempt to disprove his responsibility in starting the fires. His denial of responsibility, therefore, raises a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary disposition under MCR 2.116(0(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The plaintiff is not precluded from litigating the issue whether he burned his business because his nolo contendere plea to a charge of attempted burning of real property is not an admission of guilt that can be used against him in subsequent civil or criminal litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Equitable estoppel \" 'arises when one by his acts, representations, or admissions, or by his silence when he ought to speak out, intentionally or through culpable negligence induces another to believe certain facts to exist and such other rightfully relies and acts on such belief, so that he will be prejudiced if the former is permitted to deny the existence of such facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fleckenstein v Citizens Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>326 Mich 591, 599-600; 40 NW2d 733 (1950). Therefore, Lichon is estopped from denying he set the fires only if he explicitly or tacitly, intentionally or negligently, admitted his guilt in such a way as to induce his insurance company\u2019s justified and detrimental reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>This case does not present a situation where the doctrine of \"equitable estoppel,\u201d strictly defined, applies. American Universal did not detrimentally rely upon Lichon\u2019s nolo contendere plea in such a way that principles of equitable estoppel would prevent Lichon from contesting his responsibility for setting the fires that destroyed his business. Equitable estoppel enables a party to avoid litigating, in a second proceeding, claims which are plainly inconsistent with those litigated in a prior proceeding. However, \"[b]ecause the doctrine is intended to ensure fair dealing between the parties, the courts will apply the doctrine only if the party asserting the estoppel was a party in the prior proceeding and if that party has detrimentally relied upon his opponent\u2019s prior position.\u201d <em>Edwards v Aetna Life Ins Co, </em>690 F2d 595, 598 (CA 6, 1982). See also <em>Davis v Wakelee, </em>156 US 680, 689; 15 S Ct 555; 39 L Ed 578 (1895). Because American Universal was not a party to Lichon\u2019s criminal prosecution, it cannot rely on the doctrine of equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">It is possible that the trial court intended to rely, not on \"equitable estoppel,\u201d but on the doctrine of \"judicial estoppel\u201d or estoppel by pleading. Under this doctrine, a party who has successfully and unequivocally asserted a position in a prior proceeding is estopped from asserting an inconsistent position in a subsequent proceeding. <em>Edwards, supra </em>at 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Under the doctrine of judicial estoppel, Lichon is prevented from denying responsibility in setting the fires in this civil trial only if such a position is inconsistent with the position he adopted in his criminal case. In other words, he would be judicially estopped in the civil trial from asserting his innocence in burning his business if such a position is inconsistent with his earlier plea of nolo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>contendere. The two claims are inconsistent only if we interpret the nolo contendere plea as an admission of guilt that can be held against Lichon in this subsequent litigation. However, the very nature of a nolo contendere plea, as it has been defined by the courts and in the Rules of Evidence, dictates that the plea cannot be held against the plaintiff as an admission of responsibility in subsequent litigation. Therefore, Lichon is not judicially estopped from contesting his responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Until recently, Michigan law did not recognize the plea of nolo contendere. See, e.g., <em>People v Franchi, </em>3 Mich App 511; 142 NW2d 881 (1966). By 1969 PA 334, the Legislature amended MCL 767.37; MSA 28.977 to recognize the authority of the courts to accept pleas of nolo contendere. This statute, however, does not define the nature of the plea, its evidentiary value, or operative effect in subsequent litigation. To determine these, therefore, we must look to our Rules of Evidence and the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The primary purpose of a plea of nolo contendere is to avoid potential future repercussions which would be caused by the admission of liability, particularly the repercussions in potential future civil litigation. <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>395 Mich 96, 134; 235 NW2d 132 (1975), cert den 429 US 1108 (1977). A nolo contendere plea does not admit guilt, it merely communicates to the court that the criminal defendant does not wish to contest the state\u2019s accusations and will acquiesce in the imposition of punishment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To the extent a nolo contendere plea is an implicit admission of guilt, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>such an admission only for the purposes of the criminal proceeding in which the plea is entered. Thus, Lichon\u2019s plea acts as an admission to the circuit court only that he attempted to burn his business.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Under Michigan Rules of Evidence 410 and 803(22), the trial court erred when it considered Lichon\u2019s nolo contendere plea as judicially estopping him from contesting responsibility for the fires. These rules indicate that nolo contendere pleas are neither explicit nor implicit admissions of guilt that can be used against a pleader in subsequent litigation. MRE 410 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">Except as otherwise provided in this rule, evidence of a plea of guilty, later withdrawn, or a plea of nolo contendere, or of an offer to plead guilty or nolo contendere to the crime charged or any other crime, or of statements made in connection with any of the foregoing pleas or offers, <em>is not admissible </em>in any civil or criminal proceeding against the person who made the plea or offer. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">MRE 803(22) states that, in terms of the evidence rules regarding hearsay, evidence that is not excluded, even where the declarant is available as a witness, is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">[e]vidence of a final judgment, entered after a tried or upon a plea of guilty <em>(but not upon a plea of nolo </em>contendere), adjudging a person guilty of a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year, to prove any fact essential to sustain the judgment, but not including, when offered by the state in a criminal prosecution for purposes other than impeachment, judgments against persons other than the accused. The pendency of an appeal may be shown but does not affect admissibility. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Rule 410, therefore, prevente the trial court from giving estoppel effect to Lichon\u2019s nolo contendere plea, since such pleas are \"not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding against the person who made the plea . . . Rule 803(22) likewise prevents the court from treating Lichon\u2019s conviction based on the nolo contendere plea as substantive evidence of his role in starting the fires.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The advisory committee notes accompanying each of the federal counterparts to these rules illustrate why the plaintiff\u2019s nolo contendere plea does not estop him from litigating his responsibility for setting the fires. The notes accompanying FRE 803(22) indicate that, notwithstanding the hearsay rule, FRE 803(22) allows the admission of criminal convictions as substantive, <em>but not preclusive, </em>evidence in subsequent litigation. The note is careful to mention, however, that judgments of conviction based upon pleas of nolo contendere are inadmissible to prove the fact of a party\u2019s guilt of the crime of which that party was convicted. \"This position is consistent with the treatment of nolo pleas in Rule 410 . . . .\u201d Advisory Committee Notes to FRE 803(22).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The notes accompanying FRE 410 state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">Pleas of nolo contendere are recognized by Rule 11 of the [Federal] Rules of Criminal Procedure, although the law of numerous States is to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>contrary. The present rule gives effect to the principal traditional characteristic of the nolo plea, i.e., avoiding the admission of guilt which is inherent in pleas of guilty. This position is consistent with the construction of Section 5 of the Clayton Act, 15 USC 16(a), recognizing the inconclusive and compromise nature of judgments based on nolo pleas. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\">Exclusion of offers to plead guilty or nolo has as its purpose the promotion of disposition of criminal cases by compromise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The policies behind the recognition of the plea of nolo contendere indicate the reasons why such a plea does not preclude a party from denying culpability in subsequent litigation. First, MRE 410 and 803(22) recognize that a plea of nolo contendere does not of necessity establish a party\u2019s guilt because of the \"inconclusive and compromise nature of judgments based on nolo pleas.\u201d Advisory committee notes to FRE 410. These rules recognize that there are some situations in which a criminal defendant will find it preferable to accept a light punishment offered by the prosecution in exchange for a nolo contendere plea, rather than to face far worse consequences both in terms of criminal punishment and civil liability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Second, and more importantly, by allowing a criminal defendant to enter a plea that is not admissible against him in a future criminal or civil action, the court rules and the Rules of Evidence facilitate plea bargaining and the concomitant speedy resolution of criminal cases. See advisory committee notes to FRE 410. These policies are as applicable in situations where the individual who pleas nolo contendere is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>a plaintiff in subsequent litigation as in those where that person is a defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <em>United States v Williams, </em>642 F2d 136, 139 (CA 5, 1981), accurately summed up the definition and effect of a nolo contendere plea when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">A plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>performs a specific function. As a statement of the defendant for which he may, in another proceeding or on another occasion be called upon to account, it admits nothing. It is the same as a plea of not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, <em>Pleas of Guilty </em>(Approved Draft 1968), \u00a7 1.1(a), pp 14-15, which we cited in <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Lewis, </em>389 Mich 668, 679; 209 NW2d 203 (1973), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">\"Although some minor variations are to be found from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, in most states the nolo plea has the following significance: (1) <em>Unlike the plea of guilty, a plea of nolo contendere may not be put into evidence in a subsequent civil action as proof of the fact that the defendant committed the offense to which he entered the plea.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>As the author of \"one leading text\u201d relied upon by the dissent<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">It has long been established in the federal courts that the plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>\"does not create an estoppel, but ... is an admission [of guilt] for the purposes of the case\u201d in which the plea is made. In any subsequent action, whether arising out of the same facts or not, neither the <em>nolo </em>plea nor the conviction based on the plea may be admitted as either an admission or proof of guilt. [2 Weinstein &amp; Berger, Evidence, \u00b6 410[06], pp 410-44 to 410-45. Citing <em>Hudson v United States, </em>272 US 451, 455; 47 S Ct 127; 71 L Ed 347 (1926).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">We agree that the plaintiff\u2019s nolo contendere plea to the charge of attempted burning of real property admitted nothing in this proceeding. The trial court erred by holding that this plea precluded Lichon from litigating the issue of his responsibility in causing the fires.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Our holding is further supported by the recent Court of Appeals decision in <em>Ramon v Farm Bureau Ins Co, </em>184 Mich App 54; 457 NW2d 90 (1990). The <em>Ramon </em>panel specifically adopted the \"well-reasoned dissent\u201d of Judge Sawyer in this case, 173 Mich App 182. <em>Ramon </em>rejected the analysis of the Court of Appeals panel presently under review, stating that \"[allowing a trial court to use a nolo contendere plea in deciding a motion for summary disposition in a related civil action renders use of this plea in a criminal proceeding meaningless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">We recognize the force of the arguments made by the Court of Appeals and the dissent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>public policy should prohibit a party from relying on a nolo contendere plea in a case where that party is a plaintiff. However, neither MRE 410 nor MRE 803(22) makes such a distinction. We read MRE 410 to mean that a plea of nolo contendere may not be introduced against the party who entered that plea, irrespective of whether that party is a plaintiff or a defendant in subsequent litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">The language of MRE 410 states that a nolo contendere plea is not admissible \"in any civil or criminal proceeding against the person who made the plea . . . .\u201d The dissent argues that the word \"against\u201d modifies the word \"proceeding\u201d and not the word \"person,\u201d thus indicating that nolo contendere pleas are admissible in proceedings brought \"by\u201d the pleader. While this novel interpretation is not directly contradicted by the language of the rule, we are unpersuaded that this interpretation is correct. Our interpretation is supported by the history of the federal rule, the language of which was altered in 1980 in order to foreclose the sort of interpretation as that offered by the defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The advisory committee notes accompanying this amendment state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">\"The phrase fin any civil or criminal proceeding\u2019 has been moved from its present position, following the word 'against,\u2019 for purposes of clarity. An ambiguity presently exists because the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>'against\u2019 may be read as referring either to the kind of proceeding in which the evidence is offered or the purpose for which it is offered. <em>The change makes it clear that the later construction is correct.\u201d </em>[Saltzburg &amp; Redden, Federal Rules of Evidence Manual (3d ed), Rule 410, Advisory Committee Notes, p 211. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The advisory committee notes thus make it clear that the original language of FRE 410 was not intended to qualify the admission of a nolo contendere plea upon the type of proceeding in which it is offered, but, rather, on the purpose for which that evidence is offered. Because the language of Michigan\u2019s rule is taken directly from the federal rule, we are persuaded by this interpretation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The dissent\u2019s reading of the rule would also lead to nonsensical results. The policies advanced by the dissent in support of its reading are not promoted by conditioning admissibility of nolo contendere pleas on whether the pleader is a plaintiff or a defendant in a subsequent proceeding. Take, for example, a situation where an insurer pays its insured for fire damages and the insured later pleads nolo contendere to a charge of burning the insured property. If the insurer then sued for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>restitution of the policy proceeds, that action would be a \"proceeding against\u201d the insured. Under the dissent\u2019s analysis, MRE 410 would prevent the insurer from using the insured\u2019s plea against the insured. However, the use to which the insurer wishes to put the plea is indistinguishable from the use the trial court made of Lichon\u2019s plea. Restricting the application of MRE 410 to cases in which a nolo contendere pleader is a defendant would lead to anomalous results. The distinction the dissent makes is a distinction based on the use a party makes of a nolo contendere plea, not on the status of the pleader in subsequent litigation. The language of MRE 410, however, does not make such a distinction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Pleas of <em>nolo contendere </em>or <em>non vult, </em>in jurisdictions where allowed, are generally regarded as inadmissible [as admissions], and in fact that attribute is a principal reason for their employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Furthermore, if MRE 410 is applied as the dissent suggests it would certainly have to be applied in cases in which civil plaintiffs made and later withdrew guilty pleas or offered guilty pleas which were rejected. For instance, if, instead of pleading nolo contendere, Lichon made an offer to plead guilty that the prosecutor rejected and Lichon was acquitted after a trial, his plea offer would be admissible under the dissent\u2019s interpretation. Surely, that result is not intended by MRE 410, though the rule\u2019s language, given the dissent\u2019s reading, would dictate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">We agree with the dissenting Judge Sawyer\u2019s argument in the Court of Appeals that the trial court was incorrect in stating that Lichon used his plea here as a \"sword\u201d rather than as a \"shield.\u201d 173 Mich App 178, 183; 433 NW2d 394 (1988). American Universal raised the issue of the nolo contendere plea and conviction as establishing conclusively its affirmative defense of arson. Lichon\u2019s reliance on MRE 410 in this litigation is in response to that affirmative defense. Lichon is not using his plea to prove American Universal\u2019s lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>bility. He argues only that the nolo contendere plea may not be used against him to defeat his claim. Lichon is therefore still using rule 410 as a shield.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Preventing American Universal from asserting Lichon\u2019s nolo contendere plea as conclusively establishing an affirmative defense is not the equivalent of granting judgment for Lichon on the basis of the plea. American Universal has ample opportunity at trial to prove, through evidence other than Lichon\u2019s plea, that Lichon had some part in starting the fires.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">We further note that the stated policies behind MRE 410 and 803(22) dictate their application in all proceedings, whether the individual who pled nolo contendere in the earlier criminal case is subsequently a plaintiff or a defendant. It is possible that public policy might supersede these interests. The public interest might be served better by a rule that prevents an individual who pled nolo contendere to criminal charges from excluding evidence of that plea in an action in which the pleader seeks to establish some entitlement arising out of the crime of which the pleader was convicted. Such a rule, however, would be different from current rules 410 and 803(22), because it would not involve withdrawn pleas or rejected offers to plead, it would require different language, and it would be based on different considerations. Such a change in the law would be more properly accomplished through our administrative powers to amend the Rules of Evidence, because the administrative process gives us greater opportunity to deliberate the effects of such a change and to gather input from the public, the bench, and the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Defendant urges that, even if plaintiff\u2019s <em>plea </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>does not bar his recovery in this action, the <em>conviction </em>based on that plea does. Although the trial court did not specifically base its decision on a collateral estoppel theory, it did note in its written opinion, \"Plaintiff cannot be allowed to deny in this case what he has been convicted of in a criminal case based on the same events as in the case at bar.\u201d We disagree.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">American Universal\u2019s claim relies on principles of issue preclusion, an aspect of collateral estoppel. The insurance company contends that Lichon\u2019s culpability for setting the fires was determined by the judgment of conviction in the criminal action brought against plaintiff. That issue being determined, American Universal argues, Lichon is precluded from relitigating it. American Universal\u2019s argument fails, however, because it ignores two elements of collateral estoppel doctrine: the requirement that there be mutuality of estoppel and that the issue foreclosed actually be litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The doctrine of mutuality of estoppel requires that in order for a party to estop an adversary from relitigating an issue that party must also have been a party, or a privy to a party, in the previous action. In other words, \" '[t]he estoppel is mutual if the one taking advantage of the earlier adjudication would have been bound by it, had it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>gone against him.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Howell v Vito\u2019s Trucking &amp; Excavating Co, </em>386 Mich 37, 43; 191 NW2d 313 (1971). Although there is a trend in modern law to abolish the requirement of mutuality,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> this Court reaffirmed its commitment to that doctrine in 1971 in <em>Howell. </em>Mutuality of estoppel remains the law in this jurisdiction and bars American Universal from using Lichon\u2019s criminal conviction to settle an issue in this civil case, since the insurance company was not a party to the criminal case and would not have been bound by an acquittal had one resulted.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Collateral estoppel is also unavailable to American Universal because the issue whether plaintiff set the fires was never actually litigated. Under 1 Restatement Judgments, 2d, \u00a7 27, p 250, collateral estoppel applies \"[w]hen an issue of fact or law is <em>actually litigated </em>and determined by a valid and final judgment . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Comment e to this section clarifies this rule: \"A judgment is not conclusive in a subsequent action as to issues which might have been but were not litigated and determined in the prior action.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 256.

Section 85(2)(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">(2) A judgment in favor of the prosecuting authority is preclusive in favor of a third person in a civil action:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">(a) Against the defendant in the criminal prosecution ....

Accordingly, the rule of this Section does not apply where the criminal judgment was based on a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>or a plea of guilty. A plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>by definition obviates actual adjudication and under prevailing interpretation is not an admission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">The taking of Lichon\u2019s nolo contendere plea cannot be considered \"actual litigation,\u201d at least not in terms of collateral estoppel jurisprudence. The essence of a nolo contendere plea is in its name, \"nolo contendere,\u201d or, \"I will not contest it.\u201d If the charges are uncontested, they are necessarily unlitigated. Neither can we accurately say that the procedures followed by the judge in establishing a factual basis for taking a nolo contendere plea<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> constitute \"actual litigation.\u201d We recognized this fact in the <em>Guilty Plea Cases, supra, </em>where we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>quoted the dissenting opinion of Judge Levin in <em>People v Coates, </em>32 Mich App 52, 70; 188 NW2d 265 (1971): \" 'Direct questioning of the defendant is informative . . .

Comment e of 1 Restatement Judgments, 2d, \u00a7 27, p 257, further indicates that \"[i]n the case of a judgment entered by confession, consent, or default, none of the issues is actually litigated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In <em>Imperial Kosher Catering v Travelers Indemnity Co, 73 </em>Mich App 543; 252 NW2d 509 (1977), the Court of Appeals affirmed a grant of summary disposition in favor of the defendant where the defendant established that the sole stockholders of the plaintiff corporation had been convicted by a jury of setting fire to the insured property. The primary distinction between <em>Imperial Catering </em>and the case at hand is the difference between a conviction based on a jury verdict and a conviction based on a nolo contendere plea. In the first instance, the issue of the insured\u2019s responsibility for setting the fire actually had been litigated; it was thus arguably appropriate to give the judgment preclusive effect. In this case, principles of collateral estoppel permit the plaintiff to contest defendant\u2019s claim that the plaintiff set the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Were <em>Imperial Catering </em>applicable to this case, we would still decline to follow its reasoning. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>While we make no comment today on the soundness of that case\u2019s result, we note the inadequacy of its reasoning in that it gives preclusive effect to a criminal conviction without regard to the absence of mutuality of estoppel.

Under rules 801 and 803(22), American Universal is precluded from asserting that Lichon\u2019s plea-based conviction establishes the truth of its charge that Lichon played a role in starting the fires. Therefore, as an equitable matter, the fact of Lichon\u2019s conviction cannot estop him from contesting American Universal\u2019s assertion.

There are several well-established exceptions to the mutuality requirement, such as when an indemnitor seeks to assert in its defense a judgment in favor of its indemnitee, or where a master defends by asserting a judgment for a servant. See <em>Braxton v Litchalk, </em>55 Mich App 708; 223 NW2d 316 (1974); <em>Darin &amp; Armstrong v Ben Agree Co, </em>88 Mich App 128; 276 NW2d 869 (1979), lv den 406 Mich 1007 (1979).

The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit recently decided that the federal rule, FRE 410, even as amended in 1980, does not protect a defendant who has pleaded nolo contendere when he becomes the plaintiff in a civil suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In <em>Walker v Schaeffer, </em>854 F2d 138 (CA 6, 1988), two persons were arrested for disorderly conduct and reckless driving, and pleaded nolo contendere. Later, under 42 USC 1983 they brought a civil action against the police officers, alleging false arrest. The court ruled that the plaintiffs were estopped from making such a claim in the subsequent civil action. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">We do not consider our conclusion to be barred by Fed R Evid 410, which provides that evidence of \"a plea of nolo contendere\u201d is not, \"in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the defendant who made the plea.\u201d This case does not present the kind of situation contemplated by Rule 410: the use of a nolo contendere plea against the pleader in a subsequent civil or criminal action in which he is the <em>defendant. </em>... In this case, on the other hand, the persons who entered prior no-contest pleas are now plaintiffs in a civil action. Accordingly, use of the no-contest plea for estoppel purposes is not \"against the defendant\u201d within the meaning of Fed R Evid 410.

Rule 410 was intended to protect a criminal defendant\u2019s use of the nolo contendere plea to defend himself from future civil <em>liability. </em>We decline to interpret the rule so as to allow the former defendants to use the plea offensively, in order to obtain damages, after having admitted facts which would indicate no civil liability .... <em>[Id., </em>p 143.

As the authors of one leading text have explained, \"the fact that a defendant has pleaded guilty or <em>nolo contendere </em>is convincing evidence of guilt.\u201d 2 Weinstein &amp; Berger, Evidence, \u00b6 410[03], p 410-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>The same authors also state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\">The relevancy aspect of the plea is based upon the hypothesis that \"If a man pleads (or offers to plead) guilty, he probably believes he has done the acts required to make him guilty; and if he has this belief, he probably did the acts.\u201d The probative force of this line of proof is high despite the fact that the plea may have been due to other reasons . . . such as . . . desire to compromise to avoid the embarrassment of prosecution, or the like. Since a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>may not be accepted \"without first . . . addressing the defendant personally [and] determining that the plea is voluntary . . .\u201d and people who think themselves innocent usually plead not guilty, a plea of <em>nolo </em>also could be found by a juror to have substantial probative force. <em>[Id., </em>p 410-25.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Exclusionary rules, such as MRE 410, which make relevant evidence inadmissable, should be narrowly drawn and strictly construed so as to apply only when the exclusion of relevant evidence will serve an overriding public interest that transcends \"the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth.\u201d <em>Elkins v United States, </em>364 US 206, 234; 80 S Ct 1437; 4 L Ed 2d 1669 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">A public interest can be identified which provides some justification for the existence of the nolo contendere plea. However, the ranking of that interest on a scale of comparison with the truth-seeking function is probably reflected by the fact, already noted, that the nolo contendere plea was not even recognized in Michigan until 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Apparently, the policy objective which underlies recognition of nolo contendere and this exclusionary rule is the conservation of judicial and prosecutorial resources through the promotion of plea bargaining. As Professor McCormick has noted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>\"Effective criminal law administration in many localities would hardly be possible if a large proportion of the charges were not disposed of by compromise.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, to the extent that plea bargaining is condoned, it is viewed by many, in and out of the legal profession, as a necessary evil that should be carefully limited and scrutinized. Surely, the promotion of plea bargaining is not a public interest so overriding and paramount as to compel a strained construction of this exclusionary rule \u2014 a construction which actually aids the criminal defendant if he seeks to profit from his crime.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The line which should be drawn in this case is not new to the law. Historically, evidence of a criminal conviction, plea-based or otherwise, was inadmissible in a subsequent civil suit. However, a distinction was made between civil proceedings brought <em>against </em>the criminal defendant and those brought <em>by him </em>to take advantage of his criminal act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the latter situation, courts have almost universally admitted evidence of the conviction in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the civil suit.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Virginia Supreme Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">To permit a recovery under a policy of fire insurance by one who has been convicted of burning the property insured, would be to disregard the contract, be illogical, would discredit the administration of justice, defy public policy and shock the most unenlightened conscience. To sustain such a judgment would be to encourage and give support to the current thoughtless and carping criticisms of the legal procedure, and to justify the gibe that the administration of the law is the only remaining legalized lottery. <em>[Eagle, Star &amp; British Dominions Ins Co v Heller, </em>149 Va 82, 111; 140 SE 314, 323 (1927).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">In light of that distinction drawn at common law, it is reasonable to believe that this Court intended to draw a similar line when, in 1978, it adopted MRE 410 and used the words which plainly limit the evidentiary protection given a nolo contendere pleader to \"any civil or criminal <em>proceeding against </em>the person who made the plea . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>When a criminal defendant is allowed to plead nolo contendere, he not only avoids the time and expense of trial, but he avoids making embarrassing admissions in public. In this case, the plea bargain went further: the prosecutor reduced the charge to attempted arson, he agreed to make no comment on the sentence, and he agreed to take no action to revoke Lichen\u2019s license to practice pharmacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">But, of course, the major concession extended to a person who pleads nolo contendere is protection from use of the plea in a civil proceeding brought against him by others who seek to impose liability for damages arising out of the criminal activity of which he is convicted. The policy justification underlying MRE 410 must be stretched very far to make such protection available to a nolo contendere pleader.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">I find no basis in policy or the plain language of MRE 410 to justify the majority\u2019s expansive interpretation which stretches the rule much further and turns it into an offensive weapon in the hands of one who has been convicted of a serious crime.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b542-7\">Riley, C.J., concurred with Griffin, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b542-8\">Boyle, J., concurred only in the result re\u00e1ched by Griffin, J._</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-5\"> MCL 750.73; MSA 28.268.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b533-6\"> At Lichon\u2019s preliminary examination, two alleged co-conspirators testified.

A trial court is required by MCR 6.302(D)(2Xa) to state on the record \"why a plea of nolo contendere is appropriate\u201d before it can be accepted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\"> Generally, a judgment of conviction is considered to be hearsay when introduced in collateral proceedings, and at early common law, convictions were usually held inadmissible. However, in analyzing exceptions to the hearsay rule, McCormick observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">There is ... a growing tendency to admit a prior conviction for a serious criminal offense in a subsequent civil action. . . . <em>The tendency is most noticeable when the judgment is offered in a subsequent civil case in which the convicted defendant seeks affirmatively to benefft from his criminal offense, for example, a convicted arsonist sues to recover upon his ffre insurance policy. </em>[McCormick, n 9, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 318, pp 894-895. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b541-7\"> See <em>Connecticut Fire Ins Co v Ferrara, </em>277 F2d 388 (CA 8, 1960), and the cases cited therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\"> The majority points also to MRE 803(22), which recites that the hearsay rule does not exclude evidence of \"a final judgment, entered after a trial or upon a plea of guilty (but not upon a plea of nolo contendere), adjudging a person guilty of a crime . . . .\u201d In construing the hearsay rule, it is reasonable to surmise that the exclusion of nolo contendere-based convictions as hearsay is to be treated in a manner consistent with the construction given to MRE 410. In other words, the purpose underlying MRE 803(22) is enforcement of the exclusionary policy reflected in MRE 410. See 4 Weinstein &amp; Berger, Evidence, \u00b6 803(22)[01], p 803-354 (exclusion under FRE 803[22] is consistent with exclusion under FRE 410); and McCormick, n 9 <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 318, p 893 (admissibility of nolo contendere pleas under the hearsay exception would negate their inadmissibility in subsequent proceedings). Accordingly, to the extent that evidence of a nolo contendere plea is considered admissible under MRE 410 when a pleader becomes the plaintiff in a subsequent civil suit, there is no sound policy or logic which would require rote exclusion under MRE 803(22).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\"> While recognizing \"the force\u201d of the argument \"that public policy should prohibit a party from relying on a nolo contendere plea in a case where that party is a plaintiff\u201d (ante, pp 422-423), the majority suggests that our construction could lead to \"nonsensical results\u201d in future hypothetical cases that are not before us. (Ante, p 424.) Since the policy is sound and our construction makes sense in this case, it ought to be applied in this case. Concerns about its possible application in future hypothetical cases can, and should, be addressed by this Court by simply amending the rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
