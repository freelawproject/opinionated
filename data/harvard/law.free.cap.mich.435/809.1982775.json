The plant was intended to be used exclusively for gas produced from Leonard Field. In 1984, Michigan Consolidated sold its interest in the plant to defendant Gout, doing business as Lakeville Gas Associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">The township subsequently filed this lawsuit as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>a result of defendant\u2019s attempt to construct a pipeline for the purpose of processing gas from outside Leonard Field. Defendant complied with state and federal regulations, obtaining all the permits necessary to construct the pipeline. The complaint asserts, inter alia, that defendant\u2019s actions violated its zoning ordinance and special use permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint was dismissed on the grounds that the Supervisor of Wells had exclusive jurisdiction and that this type of zoning could not be accomplished by contract. The Court of Appeals affirmed these findings, but remanded the case on other grounds. 171 Mich App 122; 429 NW2d 612 (1988). Plaintiff appealed in this Court, and, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, we reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals in an opinion per curiam. 432 Mich 627; 443 NW2d 139 (1989). Defendant filed a motion for rehearing, and we subsequently vacated our opinion and granted leave to appeal. 433 Mich 1201; 444 NW2d 528 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">The issue before us is one of statutory construction, specifically, whether or not processing plants and pipelines fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supervisor of Wells pursuant to MCL 125.271; MSA 5.2963d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>After entertaining oral argument, and given further consideration, we are convinced that the rule set forth in our earlier opinion is the correct result.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">The Township Rural Zoning Act (trza) is an enabling statute which gives authority to a municipality to regulate land use. The statute is a broad grant of authority with one limitation: the Supervisor of Wells has exclusive jurisdiction to regulate and control the drilling, completion, and operation of \"oil or gas wells.\u201d The statute is clear and unambiguous and accordingly must be applied as written. We hold that the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supervisor of Wells applies only to oil and gas wells and does not extend to all aspects of the production process. The legislative intent is clear from the language of the statute, and drawing distinctions on such matters is clearly a legislative and not a judicial function.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">We find unconvincing the defendant\u2019s arguments that the Legislature intended to vest in the Supervisor of Wells, through the oil, gas and minerals act (ogma),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> regulatory control over the entire oil and gas industry. First we note that the brief filed on behalf of the Department of Natural Resources concedes that this legislative scheme does not evidence any intent for the Supervisor of Wells to have absolute regulatory power over all phases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>the industry. Second, the Legislature specifically referred to the ogma and only \u201cjurisdiction relative to wells\u201d when it enacted the trza. Finally, defendant\u2019s argument is unpersuasive because the regulation of wells is only excluded as to townships. There is no limitation in the city or village zoning act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This enabling act is substantially the same as the trza, granting to the individual municipality the authority to regulate land use and structures consistent with the needs of its citizenry regarding energy and other natural resources generally and without limitation. Implicit in the preclusion of township zoning \"relative to wells\u201d is that without the language zoning jurisdiction would extend to such activity and in fact does so in the other municipal zoning enabling act.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Defendant relies on the principles enumerated in <em>People v Llewellyn, </em>401 Mich 314; 257 NW2d 902 (1977), to support its claim of intent by the state to occupy the entire regulatory field.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-7\">A municipality is precluded from enacting an ordinance if 1) the ordinance is in direct conflict with the state statutory scheme, or 2) if the state statutory scheme pre-empts the ordinance by occu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>pying the field of regulation which the municipality seeks to enter, to the exclusion of the ordinance, even where there is no direct conflict between the two schemes of regulation. <em>[Id. </em>at 322.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Because there is no express intent to preempt local regulation, except as to the zoning of wells, we must determine if the Legislature has by implication preempted all local regulation of the oil and gas industry. We hold that no such intent is evidenced in the legislative scheme. To ascertain legislative intent we look to the purposes of the statutes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The purposes of the separate regulatory acts do not conflict, nor do they suggest that uniformity is necessary to effectuate these distinct legislative goals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The duty of the Supervisor of Wells to prevent waste as set forth in the ogma clearly differentiates between the supervisor\u2019s role at each phase of the production of natural resources. We find this action by the Legislature to denote an apparent distinction when the term \"wells\u201d was used in the trza.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The defendant\u2019s expansive view of the preemptive language in the trza to include all aspects of the production process is also not supported by the claim that uniformity is necessary because of permit requirements before transporting and processing oil and gas. The permits defendant received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>were not issued by the Supervisor of Wells, but rather were acquired from the dnr and Michigan Public Service Commission pursuant to other regulatory authority. Further, they were issued for only a limited purpose. We find defendant\u2019s assertion that merely because it was required to obtain permits that have a limited purpose it should be allowed to bypass municipal regulation lacking in authority and merit. Only in very rare instances will a permit issued for one purpose obviate local zoning laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">For these reasons and those initially set forth in our opinion, we reverse the ruling of the Court of Appeals. The case is remanded to the Oakland Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We again instruct the trial court that on remand it \"shall reconsider its determination that this case involved impermissible 'contract zoning.\u2019 If the circuit court adheres to that determination, it shall provide findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of that determination.\u201d 432 Mich 637.</p>\n<judges id=\"b916-6\">Riley, C.J., and Cavanagh, Boyle, Archer, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-8\"> The township board of an organized township in this state may provide by zoning ordinance for the regulation of land development and the establishment of districts in the portions of the township outside the limits of cities and villages which regulate the use of land and structures; to meet the needs of the state\u2019s citizens for food, fiber, <em>energy, and other natural resources, </em>places of residence, recreation, <em>industry, trade, </em>service, and other uses of land; to insure that use of the land shall be situated in appropriate locations and relationships; to limit the inappropriate overcrowding of land and congestion of population, transportation systems, and other public facilities; to facilitate adequate and efficient provision for transportation systems, sewage disposal, water, energy, education, recreation, and other public service and facility requirements; and to promote public health, safety, and welfare. ...

As mentioned earlier in this brief, the permits were not issued by the Supervisor of Wells and were not directly related to gas processing. Contrary to the impression left by Lakeville, the Supervisor of Wells did not seek to assert exclusive regulation over the location, construction or operation of this plant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-15\">It is urged that this Court hold that the trza did not preclude the township from reasonable regulation of the location and duration of a gas processing plant where such regulation was not shown to regulate or control the operation of oil and gas wells or to interfere with the authority vested in the Supervisor of Wells or the Michigan Public Service Commission.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b919-6\"> The Attorney General states in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-7\">While there may have been an implicit 1973 understanding that the processing plant was intended for Leonard Gas Field natural gas, such an understanding is not in the record and an examination of the Agreements entered as exhibits (Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s Exhibits 1 and 4) do not on their face appear to indicate any prohibition by the township upon the use of the processing plant for non-Leonard Gas Field natural gas as a condition of the special use permit. Further, there has been no evidence presented which would establish that the Leonard Gas Field is now or soon to be depleted where such could entail a phase-out or imminent dismantling and restriction of the operation of the plant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-8\">Reversal is warranted only if the trial court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Odette v Liquor Control Comm, </em>171 Mich App 137, 140-141; 429 NW2d 814 (1988); <em>Smith v Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual Ins Co, </em>101 Mich App 78, 86; 300 NW2d 457 (1980), lv den 411 Mich 873 (1981).
