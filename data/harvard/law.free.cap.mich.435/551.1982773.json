Fourteen installments were unpaid when she died in March, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The inheritance tax examiner, in accordance with the Department of Treasury\u2019s eleven-year practice of not seeking to tax state lottery proceeds, did not include the lottery proceeds in the December, 1981, calculation of the inheritance tax. The tax was redetermined in April, 1986, after a September, 1983, Department of Treasury decision to seek to collect inheritance tax on the transfer of the right to receive future installments of a decedent\u2019s lottery winnings. The additional tax sought to be imposed is $13,527.70.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The probate court ruled that state lottery proceeds were not, before the 1988 repeal of the statutory provision exempting state lottery proceeds from the imposition of tax, subject to inheritance tax.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1988 PA 516. The Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>reversed, stating that the exemption was for a \"direct\u201d tax on property and did not apply to a tax on the privilege of transferring or receiving property by inheritance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The United States Supreme Court held in 1900 that legislation exempting securities issued by the United States government from taxation did not exempt the securities from federal estate or state inheritance taxation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> State court cases generally adopt the analysis employed by the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Judicial opinions so holding draw a distinction, adopted by the Court of Appeals and in the dissenting opinion, between a \"direct\u201d and an \"indirect\u201d tax, and distinguish between a direct tax on property or income and a tax on the \"privilege\u201d of transferring or receiving property, and sometimes explain their results by characterizing an estate or inheritance tax as an excise tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The courts so holding also invoke, as did the Court of Appeals and the dissent, rules of construction disfavoring exemption from taxation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The most telling rule of construction, however, is often a court\u2019s teleological assessment of the consequences of one construction as opposed to another, as appears from the seminal decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Plummer v Coler, </em>178 US 115, 138; 20 S Ct 829; 44 L Ed 998 (1900), where an underlying policy is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">It is often impracticable to secure from living persons their fair share of contribution to maintain the administration of the State, and such [inheritance tax] laws seem intended to enable to secure payment from the estate of the citizen when his final account is settled with the State. <em>Nor can it be readily supposed that such obligations can be evaded or defeated by the particular form in which the property of the decedent was invested. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Were the United States Supreme Court to have held that United States government securities were exempt from estate and inheritance taxation, persons whose wealth is in liquid form \u2014 cash, checking, or savings accounts, or marketable securities \u2014 could, in anticipation of death, have invested the bulk of their fortunes in tax-exempt United States government securities and thereby avoided all estate and inheritance taxation of wealth in that form. The Court undoubtedly cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>rectly assessed the matter in concluding that the Congress did not intend such a result when it exempted United States government securities from taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The policy concern identified in <em>Plummer </em>does not obtain where lottery proceeds are involved. While a lottery winner expends money in purchasing lottery tickets, there is no \"investment\u201d or transfer of wealth, in the sense referred to in <em>Plummer, </em>in purchasing a lottery ticket, and no need, by judicial construction, to guard against avoidance, beyond the policy of the statute, of estate and inheritance tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">I acknowledge that <em>United States Trust Co v Helvering, </em>307 US 57; 59 S Ct 692; 83 L Ed 1104 (1939), cannot be explained on the policy basis suggested. There the exemption was of life insurance proceeds, apparently payable ex gratia, by the United States to veterans of World War I. The Court observed that the rule distinguishing between a direct and indirect tax, and the excise distinction, had been well established, before enactment of the legislation providing the life insurance benefit, since 1900 when <em>Plummer </em>was decided.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">This Court has not heretofore considered the question dealt with in <em>Plummer. </em>There is no decision of this Court holding that a legislative exemption from taxation applies only to direct taxes, or that an indirect or excise tax on the right or privilege of transferring or receiving property is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>not included within an exemption from taxation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There not having been a ruling by this Court establishing the law in Michigan, the department\u2019s eleven-year practice of exempting lottery proceeds from inheritance tax on the basis of a ruling by the Attorney General takes on, in our opinion, decisive significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The letter, dated October 5, 1977, advising of the first, contemporaneous construction of the lottery tax exemption from taxation, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">The Attorney General\u2019s Department, Revenue and Collections Division, Mr. Richard R. Roesch Assistant in Charge, has ruled that lottery winnings are not subject to any Michigan tax <em>which, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number><em>of course, includes inheritance tax. </em>[Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">In 1983, the department announced that it would no longer adhere to that ruling. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">This Court has held that \"the construction placed upon a statute by the agency legislatively chosen to administer it is entitled to great weight.\u201d <em>Davis v River Rouge Bd of Ed, </em>406 Mich 486, 490; 280 NW2d 453 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">A leading treatise on statutory construction states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">Interpretations and application of regulations by officers, administrative agencies, departmental heads and others officially charged with the duty of administering and enforcing a statute have great weight in determining the operation of a statute. <em>The greatest weight attaches to an admin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number><em>istrative interpretation in favor of parties who have reasonably relied upon it. </em>[2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a749.05, p 362.

Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">In holding that promissory notes were not debentures within the meaning of a statute that imposed a stamp tax on \"all bonds debentures, or certificates of indebtedness issued by any corporation,\u201d the United States Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\"><em>Against the Treasury\u2019s prior longstanding and consistent administrative interpretation its more recent ad hoc contention as to how the statute should be construed cannot stand.

The Court there noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">[f]or almost 50 years after the Act\u2019s passage, it was generally assumed that this [the provision of the Housing Act of 1937 exempting project notes from all taxation imposed by the United States] exempted the Notes from federal income tax, but not from federal estate tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The unbroken assumption regarding the construction of the exemption in <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>thus the opposite of that operating in <em>Jandorf\u2019s Estate </em>and in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">For over a decade, the department construed \u00a7 34 of the Lottery Act as exempting state lottery prize proceeds from inheritance taxation. Persons who bought lottery tickets during the regime when the department and field examiners were administering the inheritance tax law as exempting lottery proceeds from inheritance tax should be accorded the benefit of the first, contemporaneous construction of the law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">It has been held that an administrative agency having interpretive authority may reverse its interpretation of a statute, but that its new interpretation applies only prospectively.

The proceeds of the lottery prize that they receive and may retain free of tax will have been reduced by $13,527.70 whether called an income, an excise, a privilege, a transfer, or an inheritance tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">In sum, the Lottery Act provides that no state tax \"of <em>any kind whatsoever\u201d </em>shall be imposed on the proceeds of a state lottery prize. The inheritance tax is, in terms, a tax, and it cannot seriously be suggested that it is not a tax.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is a tax even if it is an excise tax, an indirect tax, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>transfer tax, a privilege tax, and not simply, as the Legislature called it, an inheritance tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">This tax is measured by the present value, at the time of death, of the unpaid \"proceeds\u201d of the lottery prize. The first, contemporaneous construction by the state that the inheritance tax is a tax within the meaning of \u00a7 34 of the Lottery Act was, for reasons earlier stated, an entirely plausible and defensible construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The Department of Treasury should be held to be bound by the first, contemporaneous construction by the state, at least with regard to the estates of persons who purchased lottery tickets before September 14, 1983, when the department advised inheritance tax field examiners of a \"new development.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b664-7\">Brickley, Cavanagh, and Archer, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-15\"> Section 1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-16\">A tax shall be and is hereby imposed upon the transfer of any property, real or personal, of the value of $100.00 or over, or of any interest therein or income therefrom, in trust or otherwise, to persons or corporations, not exempt by law in this state from taxation on real or personal property ....

In each of the cited cases there was clearly a debatable question concerning the meaning of the words chosen to express the exemption from taxation. Acknowledging that there is rarely if ever such clarity in expression as might justify the use of the \"plain meaning\u201d shibboleth, the words \"taxes of any kind whatsoever\u201d are at least, in terms, unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">In <em>Michigan Baptist Homes, </em>the question was whether a licensed home for the aged was within an exemption from ad valorem property taxation for charitable or benevolent purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-15\">In <em>Ladies Literary Club, </em>the question was whether the club was exempt from ad valorem property taxation as an educational institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-16\">In <em>Detroit Commercial College, </em>the question was whether the Detroit Commercial College was an educational institution within an exemption from ad valorem property taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-17\">In <em>St Joseph\u2019s Church, </em>the question was whether vacant land adjoining a parsonage was \"occupied as such\u201d within the meaning of an exemption from ad valorem property taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"APD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>In <em>Edison, </em>the question was whether the construction of a highway was \"industrial processing\u201d within the meaning of a use tax exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">In <em>Romeo Homes, Inc, </em>the question was whether prefabricated homes were within a use tax exemption for materials affixed and made a structural part of real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">In <em>Smith Estate, </em>the question was whether the natural child of the <em>adopted </em>daughter of the decedent was a \"lineal decedent\u201d within the meaning of the inheritance tax law.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">In Town <em>&amp; Country Dodge, </em>the question was whether monies returned to an automobile dealer as a portion of the finance charge was interest income within the meaning of the Single Business Tax Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b657-10\"> Moreover, a Department of Treasury regulation restated the <em>Plummer </em>rationale.

The only exemption referred to in <em>In re Fish Estate </em>is a $50,000 exemption from the federal estate tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">The statement in In re <em>Fish Estate, supra, </em>pp 373-374, that the inheritance tax is not \"a tax upon property,\u201d and that the \"right of transmission of property\u201d and \"to receive property\u201d upon death \"are not inherent rights, but are privileges which may be taxed by a privilege tax,\u201d may be black letter law. D\u2019Amico\u2019s estate does not challenge the power of the state to impose a tax on the value of property or a privilege tax on the transfer or receipt of property. It claims rather that the Legislature, when it enacted that no tax \"of any kind whatsoever\u201d shall be imposed upon the proceeds of a state lottery prize, expressly chose not to exercise that power and not to impose the inheritance tax in respect to such proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">The statements in <em>In re Fish Estate </em>do not concern or address the question presented, whether the language of the Lottery Act, barring the imposition of \"any tax whatsoever,\u201d bars imposition of the inheritance tax in the instant case.

In this appeal the issue is whether the state inheritance tax is applicable to the transfer at death of the right to receive future installments of Michigan lottery winnings. We conclude that imposition of the tax is required by statute, and therefore we would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">During her lifetime Rose D\u2019Amico won the state lottery. As a result of her good fortune, she became entitled to receive $1 million, payable in twenty annual installments of $50,000 each. When she died on March 13,1981, fourteen of the installments remained unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>A controversy concerning the last will and testament of Rose D\u2019Amico was settled by agreement, and the residue of her estate, including her entitlement to the future lottery installments, was assigned to six named individuals by the Kent Probate Court. There remains, however, the question whether the inheritance tax is applicable to this transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">At first, the Michigan Department of Treasury computed the inheritance tax to be assessed without reference to the lottery winnings. Later, however, the department made a redetermination and applied the tax to the value at death of the right to receive the future installments. It was determined that the future installments, which aggregated $700,000, had a discounted value at death of $299,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Petitioners, on behalf of the estate, challenged the redetermination, claiming that the lottery winnings were exempt from the inheritance tax by virtue of \u00a7 34 of the Lottery Act which then provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">No state or local taxes of any kind whatsoever shall be imposed upon the proceeds from a prize awarded by the state lottery. [MCL 432.34; MSA 18.969(34).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">The probate judge agreed with petitioners and ruled that the tax did not apply. He stated, however, that \"[t]his matter undoubtedly will be appealed ... as this Court feels it should . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"APs\">On appeal, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reasoning that the inheritance tax statute does not impose a tax upon the \u201dpro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>ceeds,\u201d or the property itself, but rather it imposes a tax</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\">upon the <em>transfer </em>of any property, real or personal, of the value of $100.00 or over ... to persons . . . not exempt by law in this state from taxation ...

Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The majority concluded that petitioners had failed to establish \"clearly and unambiguously, beyond doubt or cavil\u201d the claim of the estate to an exemption from the inheritance tax. 171 Mich App 296, 302; 429 NW2d 659 (1988). We granted leave to appeal. 432 Mich 920 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">As a general rule, exemptions from taxation are not favored. <em>Michigan Baptist Homes &amp; Development Co v Ann Arbor, </em>396 Mich 660, 669-670; 242 NW2d 749 (1976); <em>Edison v Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>362 Mich 158, 162; 106 NW2d 802 (1961); <em>Romeo Homes, Inc v Revenue Comm\u2019r, </em>361 Mich 128, 137; 105 NW2d 186 (1960). It is a well-settled principle that a tax exemption must be clearly and unequivocally established by the party seeking the favored position. <em>In re Smith Estate, </em>343 Mich 291; 72 NW2d 287 (1955); see also <em>Town &amp; Country Dodge, Inc v Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>420 Mich 226, 243; 362 NW2d 618 (1984). Thus, statutory tax exemptions are to be strictly construed against the party claiming the exemption. <em>Ladies Literary Club v Grand Rapids, </em>409 Mich 748, 753; 298 NW2d 422 (1980); <em>Town &amp; Country Dodge, Inc v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, supra </em>at 242-243.

Taxation, like rain, falls on all alike. True, there are, in any taxing act, certain exceptions, certain favored classes, who escape the yoke. But one claiming the unique and favored position must establish his right thereto beyond doubt or cavil. <em>[In re Smith Estate, supra </em>at 297.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Therefore, in the present case, petitioners face a heavy burden if they are to establish that the transfer in question is exempt from the inheritance tax. An exemption will not be inferred from language of a statute if the words admit of any other reasonable construction. <em>Detroit v Detroit Commercial College, </em>322 Mich 142, 148; 33 NW2d 737 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">As we see it, the case before us turns on whether the inheritance tax imposed amounts to a tax on the <em>proceeds </em>of a lottery prize or a tax on the <em>transfer </em>of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">The statute upon which petitioners rely, by its terms, provides only for an exemption from <em>direct </em>taxation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Again, \u00a7 34 of the Lottery Act provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>No state or local taxes of any kind whatsoever shall be imposed upon the <em>proceeds </em>from a prize awarded by the state lottery. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">It has long been recognized in this state that the inheritance tax is not a direct tax on property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As this Court stated many years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-7\">[T]he State inheritance tax is [not] a tax upon property, although the value of property is used to fix the measure of the tax .... The right of transmission of property from the dead to the living, the right of the living to receive property from the dead, are not inherent rights, but are privileges which may be taxed by a privilege tax. <em>[In re Fish Estate, </em>219 Mich 369, 373-374; 189 NW 177 (1922).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">See also <em>Union Trust Co v Wayne Probate Judge, </em>125 Mich 487, 493; 84 NW 1101 (1901) (the inheritance tax act \"as a whole, indicates its character to be a succession or privilege tax, and not a tax upon property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">The distinction recognized by this Court between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>a direct tax on property and a tax on the privilege of transferring property at death accords with the rule in a majority of jurisdictions. See anno: <em>Statutory provision that speci\u00f1ed fund or property shall be \"exempt from taxation,\u201d \"exempt from any tax,\u201d or the like, as exempting such property from estate or succession taxes, </em>47 ALR2d 999, \u00a7 3, p 1003.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, in the absence of statutory language which specifically provides an exemption from the inheritance tax, most jurisdictions have held that an exemption will not be implied. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that an estate or inheritance tax is not a direct tax upon property. In <em>Plummer v Coler, </em>178 US 115, 134-135; 20 S Ct 829; 44 L Ed 998 (1900), the Court declared that a legacy of United States bonds was not exempt from a state\u2019s inheritance tax even though Congress had declared by statute that United States bonds were to be \"exempt from taxation <em>in any form </em>by or under state . . . authority . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Court reasoned that an inheritance tax is not a tax upon the bonds themselves, but instead is a tax upon the right to transfer or receive the bonds at death.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In <em>United States Trust Co v Helvering, </em>307 US 57, 58; 59 S Ct 692; 83 L Ed 1104 (1939), the Supreme Court held that the proceeds of war-risk insurance were subject to the federal estate tax despite a statutory provision that such proceeds \" 'shall be exempt from all taxation.\u2019 \u201d The Court stated:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>An estate tax is not levied upon the property of which an estate is composed. It is an excise imposed upon the transfer of or shifting in relationships to property at death. . . . [T]he taxing power was . . . exercised upon \"the transfer of property procured through expenditures by the decedent with the purpose, effected at his death, of having it pass to another.\u201d [307 US 60.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">More recently, in <em>United States v Wells Fargo Bank, </em>485 US 351; 108 S Ct 1179; 99 L Ed 2d 368 (1988), the Supreme Court held that obligations (project notes) of state and local public housing agencies were not exempt from federal estate taxes despite an enactment by Congress which declared that such obligations \"shall be exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United States . . . .\u201d 42 USC 1437i(b). The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">Well before the Housing Act was passed, an exemption of property from all taxation had an understood meaning: the property was exempt from <em>direct </em>taxation, but certain privileges of ownership, such as the right to transfer the property, could be taxed. Underlying this doctrine is the distinction between an excise tax, which is levied upon the use or transfer of property even though it might be measured by the property\u2019s value, and a tax levied upon the property itself. The former has historically been permitted even where the latter has been constitutionally or statutorily forbidden. [485 US 355. Emphasis in original, citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Although, the wording of \u00a7 34 makes clear that the Legislature intended to preclude any tax whatsoever \"upon the proceeds\u201d of a lottery prize, it cannot be said with a certainty \"beyond doubt or cavil\u201d that the Legislature also intended to preclude any tax \"upon <em>the </em>transfer\u201d at death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>entitlement to a lottery prize. See <em>In re Fish Estate, supra. </em>\"[I]n all cases of doubt as to the legislative intention . . . the presumption is in favor of the taxing power, and the burden is on the claimant to establish clearly his right to exemption.\u201d <em>St Joseph\u2019s Church v Detroit, </em>189 Mich 408, 414; 155 NW 588 (1915). In the present case, petitioners fail to cite any legislative history to support their assertion that the Legislature intended to preclude a tax upon the transfer at death of a lottery prize. The rule to be applied under such circumstances was summarized by Justice Cooley in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">\"An intention on the part of the legislature to grant an exemption from the taxing power of the state will never be implied from language which will admit of any other reasonable construction. Such an intention must be expressed in clear and unmistakable terms, or must appear by necessary implication from the language used, for it is a well-settled principle that, when a special privilege or exemption is claimed under a statute ... it is to be construed strictly against the [claimant] and in favor of the public. This principle applies with peculiar force to a claim of exemption from taxation. Exemptions are never presumed, the burden is on a claimant to establish clearly his right to exemption, and an alleged grant of exemption will be strictly construed and cannot be made out by inference or implication but must be beyond reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>[Ladies Literary Club v Grand Rapids, supra </em>at 754 (quoting 2 Cooley, Taxation [4th ed], \u00a7 672, pp 1403-1404).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Because petitioners have not sustained their burden of establishing an exemption, we would hold that the transfer at death of decedent\u2019s entitlement to future lottery payments is subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the state inheritance tax.

Students of law agree that the State has the right to declare an escheat of <em>all </em>the property of a decedent, and therefore, as the price of allowing a legatee, devisee or heir to inherit, it may appropriate to itself any portion of the property which it chooses to exact. Whether this appropriation be designated an inheritance tax, an estate tax, a succession tax, a death duty, or otherwise howsoever, it is not, in its essence, a tax on the decedent\u2019s property or any component part of it, or on the transaction of transferring it . . . but an excise on the privilege of inheritance. It is really not a tax at all in the ordinary meaning of the word, but rather a distributive share of the estate which the State retains for itself.
