The Court of Appeals relied on our decision in <em>Roy v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>428 Mich 330; 408 NW2d 783 (1987), to affirm summary disposition in the defendant\u2019s favor. We hold that governmental immunity does not bar the cause of action set forth in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The plaintiff alleged he suffered injuries from a bicycle accident on September 10, 1985. The plaintiff apparently went for a ride that evening on his fourteen-speed racing bicycle. He traveled on the west shoulder of State Highway M-35 in Ford River Township, Delta County, at approximately twenty-seven miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s bicycle struck a pothole, and rider and bicycle overturned. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged a litany of injuries resulting from the accident, including head and back injuries, a broken collar bone, and broken ribs.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The plaintiff filed a complaint in the Court of Claims, alleging that the state had ownership, jurisdiction, and responsibility for the maintenance of highway M-35, and charging that the state had failed to inspect, repair, and warn users of defects in the bicycle path. The complaint further alleged that these negligent acts and omissions constituted the proximate cause of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">The Highway Department moved for summary disposition asserting governmental immunity and citing our decision in <em>Roy v Dep\u2019t of Transporta</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>tion </em>in support. It contended that, consistent with <em>Roy, </em>its duty to maintain highways did not extend to bicycle paths. The Court of Claims agreed with defendant\u2019s arguments and granted summary disposition. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision without further analysis, agreeing \"that summary disposition was proper in light of our Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Roy v Dep\u2019t of Transportation </em>. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The plaintiff submitted a photograph of the accident scene with his brief, indicating a pothole located within two white lines. The lines demark a bicycle path running parallel to and seemingly between the traveled portion of the highway and its paved shoulder. The defendants have not contested the accuracy of this photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Because this case was decided on summary disposition, we agree with the defendant that \"the only facts before the Court are those allegations as set forth in the Complaint.\u201d The plaintiff alleged in his complaint that he was injured on a \"designated bicycle path on the west shoulder of said highway . . . .\u201d Our analysis, therefore, is based on the assumption that the bicycle path at issue comprised part of the inner portion of the shoulder closest to the roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">The defendant argues that nonmotorists are not protected parties under \u00a72 of the governmental immunity act and that such protection is afforded only to \"vehicular travel.\u201d The defendant notes that the Motor Vehicle Code defines vehicles as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>motor vehicles. Hence a bicyclist must be excluded from protection under \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">We think a straightforward reading of the statute clearly and adequately refutes the defendant\u2019s assertions. The statute extends the immunity exception to \"[a]ny <em>person </em>sustaining bodily injury or damage to his property . . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The plaintiff certainly qualifies as one to whom the duty to maintain safe highways extends and the waiver of immunity applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">However, the \"vehicular travel\u201d language of \u00a7 2 seized upon by the defendant clearly does not limit the class of travelers who may recover damages for injuries due to defects on the improved portion. The words \"designed for vehicular travel\u201d describe and define the \"improved portion of the highway\u201d to which the duty of the governmental agency \"to keep any highway under its jurisdiction . . . safe and fit for travel\u201d applies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Defendant also contends that exception to immunity under \u00a72 does not extend to the instant case. In defendant\u2019s view, the path was not de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>signed for \"vehicular travel\u201d because the shoulder of the road exists solely for \"emergency accommodation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In <em>Roy, supra, </em>we held that bicycle paths <em>adjacent </em>to, but not a part of, a highway did not comprise part of the improved portion designed for vehicular traffic and hence did not remove governmental immunity from suit. We concluded in <em>Roy:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">[T]he exception to immunity found in \u00a7 2 of the governmental immunity act does not apply to bicycle paths. The [highway exception to immunity] does not apply to an \"installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d A bicycle path is not designed for vehicular travel, in the common sense of \"vehicular\u201d as relating to motor vehicle. [428 Mich 340.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">We further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">[T]he statute does not offer general protection to pedestrians or motorists without regard to location. The statute announces a duty to repair and maintain the highway so that the improved portion designed for vehicular travel is reasonably safe and convenient for public travel. The criterion used by the Legislature was not based on the class of travelers, but the road on which they travel. [428 Mich 341.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">The trial court and Court of Appeals erred in granting summary disposition in this case on the basis of <em>Roy. </em>In the instant case, unlike <em>Roy, </em>the plaintiff has alleged the bicycle path and the location of the defect occurred on the shoulder of the highway immediately adjacent to its regularly traveled portion. The defect here did not occur on an installation, as in <em>Roy, </em>separated and \"de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>tached\u201d from the improved portion. The allegedly defective bicycle path in this case unquestionably comprised part of the highway. \" 'Shoulder\u2019 means that portion of a <em>highway </em>. . . .\u201d MCL 257.1501(k); MSA 9.3200(l)(k). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Neither the defendants nor the dissent contends that this paved shoulder is not part of the improved portion of the highway. However, they do contend that the highway\u2019s shoulder does not comprise that part of the improved portion of the highway \"designed for vehicular travel.\u201d Framed this way, the crucial issue involves whether the paved shoulder of the road is \"designed for vehicular travel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The dissent cites <em>Goodrich v Kalamazoo, </em>304 Mich 442; 8 NW2d 130 (1943), a case decided under a predecessor statute in support of the argument that the Legislature in enacting \u00a72 of the current statute did not intend the shoulder of the road to be excepted from the statute\u2019s general grant of immunity. <em>Goodrich </em>concerned a fourteen-foot-wide paved road bounded by approximately \"three-foot\u201d wide \"dirt and gravel\u201d shoulders. The plaintiff struck a tree that was \"about 30 inches from the edge of the pavement\u201d and therefore a part of the shoulder of the road. <em>Id. </em>at 444. Since the dirt and gravel shoulder was only approximately three feet in width and apparently had at least one tree growing on it, it is not surprising that the court found the shoulder not to be a part of the \" 'traveled\u2019 portion of the road.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">We would not disagree that a three-foot-wide dirt and gravel shoulder adorned with an occasional tree is not \"designed for vehicular travel\u201d under today\u2019s statute or any statute. As in <em>Goodrich, </em>we would probably conclude that such a shoulder was also not part of the \"improved por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>tion\u201d of the highway.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Similarly, it does not seem surprising that when the Court of Appeals began analyzing shoulder-accident cases under our current immunity exception statute, it made no reference to <em>Goodrich.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">In <em>Johnson v Michigan, </em>32 Mich App 37; 188 NW2d 33 (1971), lv den 385 Mich 762 (1971), the Court of Appeals observed correctly we think, that the shoulder from which the plaintiff was returning to the traveled portion of the road, like shoulders generally, was \"designed for vehicular traffic although not of the same character as vehicular traffic on the paved portion of the highway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39. Other Court of Appeals panels, without exception, have followed that precedent. See <em>Van Liere v State Hwy Dep't </em>59 Mich App 133; 229 NW2d 369 (1975), and <em>McKee v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>132 Mich App 714; 349 NW2d 798 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The dissent accurately points out that the Legislature has been quick to correct the result of Court of Appeals decisions that have extended the \u00a72 exception to governmental immunity. We find it persuasive that the Legislature has not included in those correcting amendments the result of an uninterrupted line of cases extending from 1971 that conclude that a shoulder is designed for vehicular travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The dissent points to \u00a759a of the Michigan Vehicle Code, which describes the shoulder of the road, as \"not designed for vehicular travel but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>maintained for temporary accommodation of disabled or stopped vehicles . . . MCL 257.59a; MSA 9.1859(1). <em>Post, </em>p 321. That the Legislature did not in our view intend this to be a definition of vehicular travel under \u00a7 2 of the governmental immunity act is made evident by another section of the Motor Vehicle Code which states: \"'Shoulder\u2019 means that portion of a highway or street on either side of the roadway which is normally snowplowed for the safety and convenience of <em>vehicular traffic.\u201d </em>MCL 257.1501(k); MSA 9.3200(l)(k). (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Moreover the contention that the Legislature did not intend to include highway shoulders under the \u00a7 2 exception has an obvious flaw: it flies in the face of common experience. Any motorist who has ever experienced a highway emergency understands that shoulders are essential to a safe modern highway. To get on or off a shoulder to stop, park, or leave standing a vehicle, motorists must travel on the shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">At the high speeds of modern vehicles, such an endeavor often results in significant travel, \"in the ordinary sense,\u201d on the shoulder of a highway. Indeed, it seems quite extraordinary, if not fictional, to assume that vehicles do not travel on shoulders or that shoulders are not designed for vehicular travel, albeit of a temporary sort.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">More technically, the Motor Vehicle Code is quite precise in its definitions. It defines <em>roadway </em>quite narrowly as \"that portion of a highway improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel.\u201d MCL 257.55; MSA 9.1855. On the other hand, it defines \"[h]ighway or street ... [as the] <em>entire width </em>between the boundary lines of every way publicly maintained when any part thereof is open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel.\u201d MCL 257.20; MSA 9.1820, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>MCL 257.64; MSA 9.1864. (Emphasis supplied.) If the Legislature had intended liability for the failure to maintain safe <em>roadways </em>only, it seems the Legislature would have done just that. It did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The conclusion that shoulders do not comprise part of a highway\u2019s improved portion, taken to its logical extreme, could lead to illogical results. Such outcomes seem incongruous with a statute that plainly commands highway authorities to safely repair and maintain highways for public travel. Such outcomes surely do not \"clearly express[] [the] intent of the Legislature . . . .\u201d Post, p 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Finally, not only did <em>Roy </em>concern a bicycle path that was separate and apart from the roadway and the shoulder of the highway, but it concerned a path on which motor vehicles would have no occasion to enter for any reason. Furthermore, our analysis of <em>Roy </em>supports the different result in this case. In concluding our analysis in <em>Roy, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">This interpretation fits within each of the interpretative clues identified above. It satisfies the express wording of \u00a7 2 which limits the duty created there to less than the full highway. It does not frustrate the policy announced in other statutes of protecting bicyclists by requiring them to use bicycle paths, where provided, in preference to roads, <em>because bicycles on bicycle paths are not exposed to the hazards which arise from mixing bicycle and vehicular means of travel. [Id. </em>at 341. Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">The \"mixing bicycle and vehicular means of travel\u201d is precisely what has occurred here. The white lines in this case drawn along the border of the road may have been designed to confine bicycle travel, but could not possibly have been designed to prohibit vehicular travel consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>shoulder\u2019s statutory purpose of accommodating disabled vehicles.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Because the plaintiff is one of the \"class of travelers\u201d included in \u00a7 2 and because the area of the road designated for bicycle travel comprised part of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel as defined in that statute, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the Court of Claims for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-7\">Levin, Cavanagh, and Archer, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b417-8\">Boyle, J., concurred in the result only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-10\"> MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">Each governmental agency having jurisdiction over any highway shall maintain the highway in reasonable repair so that it is reasonably safe and convenient for public travel.

The duty of the state and the county road commissions to repair and maintain highways, and the liability therefor, shall extend only to the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel and shall not include sidewalks, crosswalks or any other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\"> MCL 257.79; MSA 9.1879 defines a vehicle as \"every device . . . excepting devices exclusively moved by human power . . . .\u201d MCL 257.4; MSA 9.1804 defines a bicycle as a \"device propelled by human power . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\"> Similarly, and contrary to dicta in <em>Roux v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>169 Mich App 582; 426 NW2d 714 (1988), the language and purpose of the highway immunity statute implies that the standard of care imposed on highway authorities applies to persons and not the vehicles in which they travel. It allows recovery to \"[a]ny person sustaining bodily injury or damage to his property\u201d and requires maintenance of highways \"reasonably safe and convenient for public travel.\u201d Therefore, although the exception to immunity limits the duty of the state to \"the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel,\u201d the standard of care allows a cause of action for persons \u2014 both motorists and nonmotorists \u2014 entitled to travel on the improved portion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\"> We distinguished <em>Goodrich </em>in <em>Ballinger v Smith, </em>328 Mich 23, 27-33; 43 NW2d 49 (1950), a case interpreting a statute requiring parked vehicles to display lamps on a highway. We held in <em>Ballinger </em>that the duty to display lamps on the highway encompassed a vehicle parked on a shoulder \"intended for the use of vehicular traffic in an ordinary and reasonable manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32. The Court rejected <em>Goodrich </em>as controlling, noting that the \"fact that [a tree thirty inches from the edge of the pavement] was left in [that] position necessarily leads to the conclusion that the place it occupied was not designed or maintained for traffic.\u201d <em>Ballinger, supra </em>at 32-33.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b417-11\"> We think this question would be closer if the bike path had been on the outer fringes of the shoulder, thereby making vehicular travel thereon unlikely, especially if the shoulder was wide enough to accommodate both an automobile and the bike path.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b417-9\">Griffin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACg\">(dissenting). Recently, we emphasized again in <em>Scheurman v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>434 Mich 619; 456 NW2d 66 (1990), that the duty and liability created by \u00a7 2, the highway exception to the governmental immunity act, <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> extends <em>\"only </em>to the improved <em>portion </em>of the highway <em>designed for vehicular travel </em>and shall <em>not </em>include sidewalks, crosswalks or any other installation <em>outside </em>of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">In this appeal, we are called upon to decide whether a bicycle path, contiguous to the main traveled portion of a highway and separating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>portion of the highway from its shoulder, is within the \"improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d Because a strict construction of the highway exception is required, not only by the plain language of the statute but also by the clearly expressed intent of the Legislature as well as the prior decisions of this Court, I must dissent from the majority\u2019s holding which expands the reach of liability beyond the \"improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Repeatedly, this Court has stressed that the governmental immunity act is a \"broad grant of immunity\u201d with \"four narrowly drawn statutory exceptions . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the Legislature adopted the definition of \"governmental function\u201d set forth in <em>Ross v Consumers Power (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567, 594, n 5; 363 NW2d 641 (1984), \"the Legislature put its imprimatur on the <em>broad </em>scope of immunity . . . and, by implication, the <em>narrow </em>scope of the exception.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As Chief Justice Riley reiterated most recently in <em>Scheurman, </em>\u00a72 is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\"narrowly drawn exception to a broad grant of immunity,\u201d and as such</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">there must be strict compliance with the conditions and restrictions of the statute. No action may be maintained under the highway exception unless it is clearly within the scope and meaning of the statute. <em>[Id., </em>p 630. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In its opinion today, the majority broadly interprets the phrase \"improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel\u201d to encompass a bicycle path as part of the shoulder of the highway and cites several Court of Appeals decisions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> issued prior to our opinion in <em>Roy v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>428 Mich 330; 408 NW2d 783 (1987).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">As I see it, the plain wording of \u00a7 2, the highway exception, as well as this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Roy, </em>compel the conclusion that the shoulder of a highway is not designed for vehicular travel; rather, it is designed for the temporary accommodation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>disabled or stopped vehicles. While the word \"highway\u201d includes that portion of the highway referred to as the \"shoulder,\u201d the language of \u00a7 2, so carefully and deliberately chosen by the Legislature, makes very clear that the duty and liability imposed by this statutory exception is limited, and does not reach across the full breadth of the highway. It extends only to a <em>portion </em>of the highway \u2014 that portion \"designed for vehicular travel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In determining that the bicycle path in <em>Roy </em>was not within the highway exception, this Court relied on indications in the governmental immunity act that \"the Legislature intended to use applicable terms in that act with the same meaning as they have in . . . the Motor Vehicle Code.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 338. For example, the <em>Roy </em>Court pointed to \u00a7 5 of the governmental immunity act which specifically incorporates by reference certain definitions provided in the Motor Vehicle Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">After noting that both acts employ the term \"vehicular travel,\u201d and after reviewing the common usage and definitions in the Motor Vehicle Code of such words as \"highway\u201d and \"vehicle,\u201d the <em>Roy </em>Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">The careful tailoring of terms in the governmental immunity act to the definitions in the Motor Vehicle Code convinces us that the Legislature intended these terms of the governmental immunity act to be understood in light of the definitions of the Motor Vehicle Code. <em>[Id. </em>at 340.][<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Applying definitions found, in the Motor Vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Code, this Court concluded in <em>Roy </em>that a bicycle is not a \"vehicle,\u201d and that a \"bicycle path is not designed for vehicular travel\u201d within the meaning of the governmental immunity act. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In light of our decision in <em>Roy, </em>it could hardly be said in this case that the bicycle path, as such, comes within the scope of the highway exception. However, the majority seeks to avoid the <em>Roy </em>holding by focusing instead upon the allegation in plaintiff\u2019s complaint that he was injured on a \" 'designated bicycle path <em>on the west shoulder of said highway.\u2019 </em>\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Until today this Court has never held that the shoulder is within the \"improved portion of the highway <em>designed for vehicular travel.\u201d </em>Such a construction ignores the teaching of <em>Roy </em>that, absent a valid reason, the definitions provided in the Motor Vehicle Code are to be used in construing the highway exception to governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The term \"shoulder\u201d is defined in the Motor Vehicle Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">\"Shoulder\u201d means that portion of the highway contiguous to the roadway generally extending the contour of the roadway, <em>not designed for vehicular travel </em>but maintained for the <em>temporary accommodation of disabled or stopped vehicles </em>otherwise permitted on the roadway. [MCL 257.59a; MSA 9.1859(1). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Obviously, this definition of \"shoulder\u201d requires the conclusion that the \"improved portion of the highway <em>designed for vehicular travel\u201d </em>does <em>not </em>include the shoulder. Because it is designed only for \"temporary accommodation,\u201d rather than \"vehicular travel,\u201d the duty and liability imposed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>the highway exception do not extend to the shoulder.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">This interpretation is consistent with other provisions of the Motor Vehicle Code. For example, it provides that the driver of a vehicle \"shall drive the vehicle upon the right half of the roadway,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that a driver who overtakes or passes another vehicle \"upon the right by driving off the pavement or main-traveled portion of the roadway\u201d is responsible for a civil infraction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Moreover, the Motor Vehicle Code makes it unlawful, outside the limits of any city or village, for a vehicle to \"be stopped, parked, or left standing, attended or unattended, upon the paved or main traveled part of a highway, when it is possible to stop, park, or to leave the vehicle off the paved or main traveled part of the highway.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Needless to say, the words \"stop, park, or to leave\u201d standing are not the equivalent of \"travel.\u201d In construing a statute, words and phrases are to be given their ordinary and common-sense meaning.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>In the ordinary sense, a shoulder is <em>not </em>designed for <em>travel; </em>it is designed for <em>interruption </em>of travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Finally, it cannot be overlooked that this Court has previously ruled that the shoulder of a highway is not designed for vehicular travel. In <em>Goodrich v Kalamazoo Co, </em>304 Mich 442; 8 NW2d 130 (1943), the plaintiff was injured when his motor vehicle left the main traveled portion of the highway and struck a tree located within the shoulder. Referring to the statute then in effect, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">The responsibility of the defendant ... is only that the highway be kept \"reasonably safe and convenient for public travel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">It is quite uniformly held that the above-noted duty . . . applies to the <em>traveled portion </em>of the road and <em>not to the entire width of the highway.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">The shoulder of the road has been held not to be a part of the \"wrought\u201d or \"traveled\u201d portion of the road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">It is not within the statutory duty of the [defendant] to maintain shoulders of improved . . . highways so that such shoulders will be \"reasonably safe and convenient for public travel\u201d in the same sense that the [defendant] is required to so maintain the paved or improved portion which is designed for ordinary or normal travel. Instead the shoulders are constructed and maintained for other and restricted uses; and the requisite condition of maintenance varies accordingly. <em>[Id. </em>at 445-448. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">To be sure, the language of the governing statute at the time of <em>Goodrich </em>varied from the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ute in effect today. However, the authority of <em>Goodrich </em>is all the more persuasive because legislative changes made since then have moved in the direction of narrowing and limiting the scope of the duty.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Prior to enactment of the governmental immunity act, 1964 PA 170, the duty required of governmental units applied broadly and without qualification to \"roads\u201d and \"public highways.\u201d The duty then imposed was not expressly limited, as it is now, to the \"improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d As we recognized in <em>Roy, </em>the obvious purpose of the Legislature in choosing the words in the current highway exception, was to \"focus on a more tightly drawn duty reflected in the departure . . . from the more in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>elusive tone of predecessor legislation.\u201d <em>Roy, supra </em>at 341.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Furthermore, since the Legislature is presumed to know the existing law when it enacts or amends a statute,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> it is significant that the Legislature, subsequent to <em>Goodrich, </em>narrowed the scope of the duty from \"highway\u201d to that \"portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d In light of this Court\u2019s determination in <em>Goodrich </em>that shoulders are not designed for vehicular travel, the adoption subsequently of such limiting language lends strong support to the conclusion that the Legislature intended to exclude the shoulder of a highway from the scope of the duty imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Clearly, under <em>Roy, </em>a bicycle path, in and of itself, is not within the highway exception. The majority\u2019s sole basis for distinguishing <em>Roy </em>is that in this case the bicycle path is part of the highway\u2019s shoulder. However, under the instruction of <em>Roy </em>that the highway exception is to be read in light of definitions supplied by the Motor Vehicle Code, it is clear that the shoulder is <em>not </em>within the scope of that portion of the highway \"designed for vehicular travel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-12\"> MCL 691.1401 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.996(101) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b417-13\"> MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\"><em> Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567, 618; 363 NW2d 641 (1984).

See, e.g., <em>Moerman v Kalamazoo Co Rd Comm, </em>129 Mich App 584; 341 NW2d 829 (1983), and <em>Carney v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>145 Mich App 690; 378 NW2d 574 (1985) (holding that there is a duty to maintain a tree along the road if the tree is positioned so that the average vehicle could strike the tree without any of its wheels leaving the shoulder); <em>McMillan v State Hwy Comm, </em>130 Mich App 630; 344 NW2d 26 (1983), and <em>Davis v Chrysler Corp, </em>151 Mich App 463; 391 NW2d 376 (1986) (holding that there is a duty to maintain a utility pole located on or in proximity to the traveled portion of a highway). Prior to the enactment of 1986 PA 175, the term \"highway,\u201d for purposes of the governmental tort liability act, was defined as \"every public highway, road and street which is open for public travel and shall include bridges, sidewalks, crosswalks and culverts on any highway. The term 'highway\u2019 shall not be deemed to include alleys.\u201d MCL 691.1401; MSA 3.996(101). The definition, as amended, now provides in part: \"The term 'highway\u2019 does not include alleys, <em>trees, </em>and <em>utility poles.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b420-10\"><em> </em>MCL 257.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 9.1801 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b420-11\"> In a footnote the Court stated, \"Terms not under consideration in this opinion might not have been subject to the same legislative intent.\u201d <em>Id., </em>n 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b421-10\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 310.

In <em>Scheurman v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>434 Mich 619, 631; 456 NW2d 66 (1990), we interpreted \u00a7 2 of the governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>immunity act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and stated the \" 'improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel\u2019 refers only to the traveled portion, paved or unpaved, of the roadbed actually designed for public vehicular travel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">I agree with Justice Griffin that a plain reading of the definition of \"shoulder\u201d in the Motor Vehicle Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> precludes the extension of the government\u2019s duty to road shoulders pursuant to \u00a7 2. However, I also believe that the definition of \"shoulder\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the Motor Vehicle Code is logically inconsistent and does not comport with the realities of highway driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">There can be no doubt that, to a limited extent, shoulders are designed and used for vehicular travel. Shoulders have to accommodate vehicles in emergency situations. To reach the shoulder and come to a stop, a vehicle necessarily has to \"travel\u201d on the shoulder. Also, vehicles may have to attain a high rate of speed on road shoulders in order to ease back into trafile. Furthermore, many highways and roads, such as the highway in this case, have paved shoulders. The fact that a shoulder is paved lends support to the idea that shoulders are designed to accommodate limited vehicular travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Thus, I would urge the Legislature to amend the definition of \"shoulder\u201d in the Motor Vehicle Code, or create a new definition for the governmental immunity act. I ask the Legislature to recognize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>that road shoulders do accommodate vehicular travel. Though a shoulder is not a main traveled lane, the government should be responsible for maintaining a shoulder reasonably safe for its intended use. Such a definition would be consistent with this Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a72 in <em>Scheurman.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\"> MCL 691.1401 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.996(101) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b426-8\"> MCL 257.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 9.1801 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AXu\"> MCL 257.59a; MSA 9.1859(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">\"Shoulder\u201d means that portion of the highway contiguous to the roadway generally extending the contour of the roadway, <em>not designed for vehicular travel </em>but maintained for the temporary accommodation of disabled or stopped vehicles otherwise permitted on the roadway.
