The court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction. After our decision in <em>People v Collier, </em>426 Mich 23; 393 NW2d 346 (1986), we remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of that decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On remand, the Court of Appeals adhered to its previous position, again concluding that <em>Bobo </em>required reversal and opining that <em>Collier </em>was inapplicable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Despite the fact that over the years the issue whether <em>Bobo </em>correctly construes the requirement of the Fifth Amendment and if not, whether the Michigan Constitution requires a higher standard has spawned a degree of conflict and confusion in the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and despite the fact that the precise issue before us has produced a conflict in the Court of Appeals with regard , to whether <em>People v Collier </em>or <em>Bobo </em>applies to prior inconsistent statements,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Justice Levin asserts it is not necessary in this case to reach the Fifth Amendment issue or to address the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">In <em>Jenkins v Anderson, </em>447 US 231; 100 S Ct 2124; 65 L Ed 2d 86 (1980),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court held that the use of prearrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>silence for impeachment purposes did not violate the Fifth Amendment. Moreover, regardless of whether this case involved a situation in which the defendant\u2019s silence was used to impeach or one where the defendant made statements to the police, omitting some material facts, the critical events took place prearrest and pre-Miranda<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and thus there could be no due process claim that the state unfairly used defendant\u2019s silence or omission against him at trial in violation of the implicit assurance in <em>Miranda </em>that silence will not be penalized. <em>Doyle v Ohio, </em>426 US 610; 96 S Ct 2240; 49 L Ed 2d 91 (1976).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">We hold that the use for impeachment purposes of a defendant\u2019s prior statement, including omissions, given during contact with the police, prior to arrest or accusation, does not violate the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>dant\u2019s constitutional rights as guaranteed under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments or the Michigan Constitution. Indeed, long before <em>Jenkins v Anderson, </em>the United States Supreme Court had held the Fifth Amendment was not violated by impeachment of a testifying defendant with voluntarily given prior inconsistent statements. <em>Harris v New York, </em>401 US 222; 91 S Ct 643; 28 L Ed 2d 1 (1971). The use of a defendant\u2019s prearrest, preMiranda \"statements\u201d for impeachment purposes is one of relevancy, an evidentiary matter.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The threshold inquiry is whether this evidence makes \"the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d MRE 401. See <em>Collier, supra, </em>p 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">This analysis is consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Jenkins. </em>There the Court emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-7\">[i]mpeachment follows the defendant\u2019s own decision to cast aside his cloak of silence and advances the truth-finding function of the criminal trial. . . . Common law traditionally has allowed witnesses to be impeached by their previous failure to state a fact in circumstances in which that fact naturally would have been asserted. 3A J. Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 1042, p 1056 (Chadbourn rev 1970). Each jurisdiction may formulate its own rules of evidence to determine when prior silence [or statements, including omissions] is so inconsistent with present statements that impeachment by reference to such silence [or statements] is probative [of defendant\u2019s credibility]. <em>[Id., </em>pp 238-239.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">The statement of a party opponent is defined as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>an oral or written assertion or nonverbal conduct, MRE 801(d)(2). For impeachment purposes, the failure to assert a material fact when formerly narrating on the matter now dealt with amounts to an assertion, or statement, of the nonexistence of the fact.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, as an evidentiary matter, omissions from an affirmative voluntary response to questions about the same subject matter testified to at trial do not constitute \"silence.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rather, they are \"prior inconsistent statements,\u201d and can be used to impeach testimony at trial in which the witness admitted the fact\u2019s existence. As the <em>Jenkins </em>Court noted, the \"[u]se of such impeachment on cross-examination allows prosecutors to test the credibility of witnesses by asking them to explain prior inconsistent statements and acts.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 238.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>As stated above, when an individual has not opted to remain silent, but has made affirmative responses to questions about the same subject matter testified to at trial, omissions from the statements do not constitute silence. The omission is nonverbal conduct that is to be considered an assertion of the nonexistence of the fact testified to at trial if a rational juror could draw an inference of inconsistency. To be sure, the witness may explain the omission by a desire not to implicate himself or because of a lapse of memory. Such explanations, however, do not remove the relevance of the inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">On this record, however, the majority is persuaded that evidentiary error, if any, was not prejudicial to the defendant. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">On December 11, 1983, a fire destroyed a bar that the defendant owned and managed adjacent to the motel in which he and a woman companion lived. After almost six months of investigation, the defendant was charged with burning real property and burning insured property.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">At trial the expert fire investigator\u2019s testimony revealed that the fire had been set intentionally by spreading kerosene throughout the bar. In addition, having found the bar locked at the time of the fire, the investigator concluded the fire was set by someone with a key to the bar. Only five people had keys to the bar, the defendant, his live-in girl friend and business partner, the bartender on duty that night, a friend who had borrowed defendant\u2019s car, and a waitress.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">The waitress testified for the prosecution that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>about three months prior to the actual fire, the defendant and she had discussed burning down the bar, the details of how he wanted the fire to be set, and how defendant wanted the scene to appear to investigators. She also testified that defendant asked her if she knew anyone that would burn the bar and that he could pay $500 for the fire to be set after he received the insurance money. She stated that she told the defendant she would talk to her brother and that when she approached her brother about this he told her to stay out of it and to tell the defendant that it cost $5,000, more than defendant, wished to pay. When she relayed the message to defendant, she said he told her to forget it.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">When defendant Cetlinski took the stand, in exculpation on direct examination, he stated while looking at the jury that he had discussed burning the bar with the waitress \"as a joke.\u201d Further, he stated that it was she who first brought up the idea, that it was her idea to check on what the cost would be, and that after about a week she told defendant her brother said he knew someone who would burn the bar if the defendant wanted it done.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although stating he only had joked with the waitress about burning the bar, the defendant testified that he later discussed the conversation with his girl friend and business partner, and that he agreed with her that it would be wrong. He then stated that he told his girl friend that \"[W]e\u2019re going to go talk to [her] and tell her we don\u2019t want it burned. I told her [the waitress] two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>or three days in a row I don\u2019t want it burned .... I says, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">This testimony served not only to rebut the waitress\u2019 testimony, but to suggest that she committed the arson and that defendant himself had nothing to do with the burning of the bar. Other proofs showed that she was one of four people who had keys to the bar and that she was present at the time of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The defendant also described being awakened by the police at his motel room next to the bar on the night of the fire, and stated he answered what the Court of Appeals characterized as \"general investigation questions\u201d at that time, as well as at various times during the course of the investigation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is undisputed that defendant gave generally exculpatory statements to the police during this period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">During cross-examination, the defendant testified that after the waitress suggested she knew someone who could burn the bar and that it could be made to look like a robbery, he had had a second conversation with her about a week after the first one, and it was at that time that she talked about price. Then, after1 his testimony established the fact that after the fire the bar looked exactly as the waitress had testified that she and the defendant had discussed it should look, the prosecutor asked the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-9\"><em>Q. </em>Mr. Cetlinski, after the fire when you saw these things out there, why didn\u2019t you tell the police about this conversation [the waitress] had had with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-10\"><em>A. </em>Because it was just . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">Defense counsel objected and, after the jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>removed, moved for a mistrial on the basis that the prosecutor\u2019s question infringed upon defendant\u2019s constitutional right to refrain from incriminating himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">In response, the prosecutor argued that the defendant took the stand, testified, gave numerous voluntary statements to the police officers concerning the fire and its possible origin, and, thus, that the state had the right to inquire why defendant never told police about the conversation with the waitress. The trial judge recessed until the following morning and instructed the attorneys to research the law and that he would make a ruling at that time. The following day the court determined that on the basis of the fact that defendant talked freely to the police there was no issue of silence in the case and denied defense counsel\u2019s motion for mistrial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">The prosecutor was permitted to resume questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-8\"><em>Q. </em>Mr. Cetlinski, during the course of the investigation of this fire at your bar, you talked to the police officers a number of times; isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-9\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-10\"><em>Q. </em>Different officers at different times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-11\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-12\"><em>Q. </em>During any of the course [sic] of those conversations with those officers, did you ever mention to them this conversation you had with [the waitress]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-13\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-14\"><em>Q. </em>You didn\u2019t tell them about that at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-15\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-16\"><em>Q. </em>Why didn\u2019t you tell them about that at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number><em>A. </em>I didn\u2019t \u2014 I forgot about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">The prosecutor never again raised the issue with the defendant or any other witness, or made reference during closing argument to defendant\u2019s failure to tell police of the conversation with his employee.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Defense counsel argued during closing argument that the prosecutor\u2019s question regarding the defendant\u2019s failure to tell police about the conversation was unfair because there was no claim that defendant failed to answer all of the questions during the investigation or that he ever lied to anyone. Further, defense counsel noted that even if the waitress\u2019 version of the conversation was correct \u201cshe had all kind [sic] of motivation [to lie] including her fight with [the defendant\u2019s girl friend\u2019s] son . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">At the conclusion of the four-day trial, the defendant was convicted by a jury of burning insured property, MCL 750.75; MSA 28.270. On March 7, 1985, the defendant was sentenced to five years probation, with the first year to be served in the Lenawee County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">On initial appeal, the Court of Appeals held that the cross-examination by the prosecutor regarding the defendant\u2019s \u201cpre-arrest\u201d failure to tell the investigating officer, \u201cat the scene\u201d \u201cimmediately after he and [his companion] were awakened,\u201d about his prior conversation violated \"defendant\u2019s constitutional right against self-incrimination\u201d under the rule of <em>Bobo.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Although noting \u201cPobo had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>been appropriately limited and defined in recent decisions of this court ... in the light of subsequent decisions of the United States Supreme Court,\u201d the panel concluded nonetheless that <em>Bobo </em>required reversal.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">After this Court held in <em>Collier </em>that impeachment with \"prearrest silence\u201d was not constitutionally precluded, <em>Cetlinski </em>was remanded to the Court of Appeals. On remand, the Court of Appeals again reversed on the basis of <em>Bobo. </em>It distinguished <em>Collier </em>on the ground that Collier was cross-examined regarding his failure to report to the police, prior to any contact with the police, a crime of which he had allegedly been the victim. The panel interpreted <em>Collier </em>only as limiting the <em>Bobo </em>holding</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-7\">\"to those situations where the state seeks to impeach a defendant with his silence maintained <em>during contact with police officers. </em>Here, the prosecutor impeached defendant regarding his failure to report a robbery to the police. <em>There was no questioning or mention of defendant\u2019s silence at or after his contact with the police.\u201d </em>[Citing <em>Collier, supra, </em>p 31. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Therefore, because \"defendant [Cetlinski] was in contact with the police, and the police were ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>tioning him during their investigation,\u201d the panel concluded <em>Collier </em>did not require a different result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Thus, the Court of Appeals, <em>post-Collier, </em>erroneously held that <em>Bobo </em>prevents impeachment of a testifying defendant with a prior inconsistent statement made voluntarily to the police prior to arrest and during general investigatory questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">The decision in <em>People v Cetlinski </em>is evidence that this Court must respond to the issues the Court of Appeals has identified and the parties have briefed and argued, and speak to an issue which has been the subject of a sixteen-year effort by the trial and appellate judges of this state: to understand and apply this Court\u2019s pronouncements in <em>Bobo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Understanding and analysis of the <em>Bobo </em>issue requires that we initially explain the facts, holding, and dicta of <em>Bobo, </em>and that we then acknowledge federal authority which casts doubt on the Fifth Amendment rationale of that opinion. The Court in <em>People v Bobo, supra, </em>pp 359-361, opined that the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution precluded any reference to a defendant\u2019s silence under any circumstances during a trial:<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-9\">We will not condone conduct which directly or indirectly restricts the exercise of the constitutional right to remain silent in the face of accusation. \u201dNonutteranees\u201d are not statements. The fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>that a witness did not make a statement may be shown only to contradict his assertion that he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-5\">What concerned the parties and what prompted our grant of leave was the propriety of using the fact of defendant\u2019s silence either as evidence of guilt or for the purpose of impeachment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-6\">Whether his [defendant\u2019s] silence was prior to or at the time of arrest makes little difference \u2014 the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to remain silent is constant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-7\">It is unimportant whether the accuser be a police officer or not. Manifestly whenever a person is stopped for interrogation by the police, whether technically under arrest or not, the Fifth Amendment guarantees that his silence may not be used against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">Although the factual context of the holding in <em>Bobo </em>was the prosecutor\u2019s use of the defendant\u2019s prearrest silence during contact with a police officer to impeach the defendant\u2019s exculpatory testimony at trial, the Court of Appeals subsequently applied the rationale of <em>Bobo </em>to both pre- and postarrest silence, to substantive and impeachment use of \"silence,\u201d and to contact with police officers or citizens.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">This Court\u2019s first consideration of the question whether the federal or the state constitution governs the permissible use of a criminal defendant\u2019s silence came thirteen years after <em>Bobo </em>and after a substantial body of federal precedent had construed the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>People v Collier, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number><em>supra. </em>In <em>People v Collier, </em>we held that neither the Fifth Amendment nor the Michigan Constitution precluded the use of prearrest silence for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The Court recognized that the United States Supreme Court had held that the Fifth Amendment did not preclude cross-examination of a testifying defendant with prearrest silence, <em>Jenkins v Anderson, supra, </em>and declined to find a violation of either due process or self-incrimination protection under the Michigan Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-7\">For us to find that this case invokes the Michigan Constitution would require us to differ with the <em>Jenkins </em>majority\u2019s analysis in a prearrest silence impeachment situation involving a factual setting less favorable to the defendant than that in <em>Jenkins. </em>Not only is there no federal Fifth Amendment precedent for such a finding, we are also aware of no other state that has taken such a step in the interpretation of its own self-incrimination provision. We have been offered no satisfactory arguments why we should be the first to use our own constitution to so enlarge upon existing Fifth Amendment jurisprudence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-8\">We conclude that to the extent <em>Bobo </em>is viable it is confined to impeachment for and comment on silence <em>at the time of arrest in the face of accusation. [Collier, supra, </em>pp 38-39. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">In <em>Collier, </em>we concluded that the issue of prearrest silence is one of relevancy and that the Court of Appeals had erroneously construed <em>Bobo. </em>However, while our holding in <em>Collier </em>limited <em>Bobo </em>to impeachment for and comment on silence at the time of arrest in the face of accusation, this Court did not overrule <em>Bobo, </em>but rather found <em>Bobo </em>inapplicable on the facts. Thus, a continuing question exists with regard to whether <em>Bobo </em>is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>understood and applied consistent with intervening developments in Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Indeed, confusion regarding this question may actually have increased since <em>Collier. </em>Prior to <em>Collier, </em>a substantial number of panels of the Court of Appeals had recognized a distinction between the use of silence for impeachment and impeachment with prior prearrest statements inconsistent with trial testimony, and held that <em>Bobo </em>was inapplicable to prearrest statements.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals panel in the case at bar characterized the prosecutor\u2019s reference to defendant\u2019s prior pretrial statements, including omissions, as <em>Bobo </em>\"silence\u201d and thus is convincing contemporary evidence of the need for further clarification of this area of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\"><em>People v Cetlinski </em>is the only case before us in which this Court has asked the Court of Appeals to redetermine the admissibility of a defendant\u2019s statements, including omissions, in light of the limitation of <em>Bobo </em>set forth in <em>People v Collier.</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Court of Appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis of its finding that the use at trial of the defendant\u2019s prearrest, <em>pre-Miranda </em>\"silence\u201d for impeachment purposes was improper under the rule of <em>Bobo.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>At the outset, it must be recognized that the Court of Appeals erred in characterizing and analyzing the issue under a constitutional approach. As stated above, there was no constitutional error. The issue involved is cross-examination designed to test the veracity of in-court assertions by comparison with out-of-court statements, including omissions, and is properly analyzed under an evidentiary approach only. Because the broad <em>Bobo </em>rationale arguably supports the Court of Appeals mischaracterization of the question, we again observe, as we did in <em>Collier, supra, </em>that, in light of both pre- and <em>post-Bobo </em>decisions of the United States Supreme Court, it is clear that the Fifth Amendment rationale no longer supports the <em>Bobo </em>rationale. Thus, no error of federal constitutional law occurred. Because the Court of Appeals finding of error under <em>Bobo </em>is sustainable only if the Michigan Constitution requires a higher standard, we also address that issue.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Consistent with our rationale in <em>Collier, </em>we conclude that an evidentiary approach to the use of a defendant\u2019s prearrest, <em>pre-Miranda </em>statements, including omissions, will adequately protect the policy interest in foreclosing the factfinder from unfair inferences of guilt. We therefore construe <em>Bobo </em>as being coextensive with the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the due process analysis of <em>Doyle v Ohio, </em>426 US <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>610; 96 S Ct 2240; 49 L Ed 2d 91 (1976).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The use of a defendant\u2019s silence during contact with the police that does not occur \"at the time of arrest in the face of accusation,\u201d <em>Collier, </em>p 39, for impeachment purposes does not violate the Fifth Amendment or the Michigan Constitution.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\"><em>People v Collier </em>adopted the evidentiary rule that nonverbal conduct by a defendant, a failure to come forward, is relevant and probative for impeachment purposes when the court determines that it would have been \"natural\u201d for the person to have come forward with the exculpatory information under the circumstances.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Because a defendant has no duty to come forward, the Court observed that his failure to do so was so ambiguous that it did not in and of itself allow a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>judge to conclude that it amounted to an assertion of the nonexistence of the fact testified to. Thus, where the prosecutor\u2019s theory of impeachment is that the defendant is not telling the truth because he did not come forward and offer what he now testifies to, we held that a trial court properly permits impeachment if it would have been natural and expected for the defendant to come forward with the story he relates during trial.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In doing so, we necessarily concluded that the mere failure to come forward did not permit a rational juror to draw an inference as to credibility. We also necessarily recognized that nonverbal conduct, the failure to come forward, could be conduct inconsistent with trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">The issue in this case concerns the permissibility of cross-examination about defendant\u2019s statements, including omissions, in light of the fact that the defendant voluntarily gave those statements to the police during a six-month investigation. A majority of the justices are persuaded that the record is insufficient to permit us to determine whether there was evidentiary error<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> because the record was developed <em>pre-Collier </em>and thus failed to address factors later made critical under the evidentiary analysis enunciated in <em>Collier. </em>Therefore, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>might remand for development of an evidentiary record were we not also persuaded that error, if any, was not prejudicial to the defendant.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The jury had before it both the waitress\u2019 and Cetlinski\u2019s version of their conversations about burning Cetlinski\u2019s business. The challenged questioning by the prosecution played a very small role in the defendant\u2019s trial, and the other evidence presented at trial was more than sufficient to allow the jury to find Cetlinski guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Furthermore, it was only the defense counsel who raised the issue of the defendant\u2019s failure to inform the police of these conversations in closing argument. Thus, we are persuaded error, if any, did not prejudice Cetlinski\u2019s defense or affect the outcome in this case.

Absent a factual finding whether the warnings were given and if so, when defendant received them, he asserts there cannot be an accurate determination whether the impeachment use of Cetlinski\u2019s prearrest silence violated the Due Process Clause. However, in <em>Fletcher v Weir, </em>455 US 603; 102 S Ct 1309; 71 L Ed 2d 490 (1982), the United States Supreme Court made such a determination in a postarrest situation, holding that there was no due process violation in the prosecutor\u2019s use of a defendant\u2019s postarrest silence for impeachment purposes, and clarifying that <em>Doyle </em>is applicable only if the issue involves <em>post-Miranda </em>silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">The <em>Fletcher </em>Court did not base its decision on a factual finding that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not given. Rather it stated that the record was unclear whether the defendant had received such warnings and noted that \"[t]he significant difference between the present case and <em>Doyle </em>is that the record does not indicate that respondent Weir received any <em>Miranda </em>warnings during the period in which he remained silent immediately after his arrest.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">In <em>Doyle, </em>the Court held the impeachment use of a defendant\u2019s post-<em>Miranda </em>silence violated the Due Process Clause because the defendant had relied on the implicit governmental assurance in the <em>Miranda </em>warnings that his silence would not be used against him. Absent evidence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings in the record, there simply is no <em>Doyle </em>error. This was true in <em>Fletcher </em>and is true in <em>Cetlinski </em>also.

The Court of Appeals initial decision was issued before this Court limited the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number><em>Bobo </em>in <em>People v Collier. </em>On remand, the Court of Appeals concluded that the limitation of <em>Bobo </em>adopted in <em>Collier </em>was not applicable.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals determined on remand that the instant case was controlled by <em>Bobo, </em>not by <em>Collier. </em>There was still no reason for the Court of Appeals to base its decision on the receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">A claim of <em>Doyle </em>error <em>may </em>properly be rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>on the basis of the inadequacy of the record.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Alternatively, an appellate court <em>may </em>properly remand<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> to provide the defendant an opportunity to develop a factual record that would substantiate a <em>Doyle </em>claim.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">A defendant should not be denied an opportunity to develop an evidentiary record that would substantiate a claim of <em>Doyle </em>error on the basis of a \"failure\u201d to develop such a record where the trial occurred before this Court\u2019s declaration in the instant case that Michigan law is coextensive with the minimal requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Neither the prosecutor nor the defendant can properly be held accountable for a failure to develop an evidentiary record in conformity with subsequent developments in Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Since the Court chooses to hold litigants strictly liable for their lack of prescience, the Court should at least be consistent. It is remarkable that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>Court is willing \u2014 although unnecessary for decision, we all agree \u2014 to march up the mountain, consider, and then march down the mountain to reject on the merits a claim of <em>Doyle </em>error, but is unwilling to continue its trek and address the evidentiary admissibility of the challenged testimony \"because the record was developed preCollier and thus failed to address factors later made critical under the evidentiary analysis enunciated in <em>Collier\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The concerns so expressed by the majority are equally applicable to the inadequacy of the record regarding the receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">To be sure, the record as it now stands tends to support the contention that the cross-examination was not <em>Doyle </em>error.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> But the record as it now stands similarly tends to support the contention that the challenged testimony was inadmissible under an evidentiary analysis.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Because the Court has decided to treat the instant case as not involving <em>post-Miranda </em>\"silence,\u201d we agree that the Court is not called on to decide the applicability of <em>Doyle </em>to the \"partially silent\u201d defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">The impeachment use of a defendant\u2019s pretrial silence raises important issues under conventional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>evidence law. Evidence of a defendant\u2019s silence is <em>not </em>automatically admissible because the United States Constitution does not bar its introduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The majority recognizes that an evidentiary analysis applies when it is sought to use a defendant\u2019s silence for impeachment.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Indeed, this Court remanded this very case for reconsideration in light of <em>Collier</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The majority avoids addressing the merits of the evidentiary question in the instant case on the basis that any error does not require reversal of Cetlinski\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">The majority says, and we agree, that \"the record is insufficient to permit us to determine whether there was evidentiary error because the record was developed <em>pre-Collier </em>and thus failed to address factors later made critical under the evidentiary analysis enunciated in <em>Collier\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">Ordinarily, we would not fault the majority\u2019s reticence. A definitive pronouncement on the evidentiary question is, we all agree, unnecessary for decision in the instant case. However, in light of the majority\u2019s decision to utilize this case as a platform for the issuance of \"definitive\u201d pronouncements on other aspects of substantive law, the majority might more properly go on to say whether the challenged testimony was admissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>under an evidentiary analysis, a question that must be answered whenever the prosecutor seeks to elicit a defendant\u2019s pretrial silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The majority asserts that it is further limiting, actually eliminating, <em>Bobo </em>to rectify confusion and uncertainty.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> In the process, it has put in question, if not eliminated, much of the Michigan case law concerning the admissibility of silence. Instead of clarity and certainty, the majority leaves a vacuum in the wake of today\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">To be admissible, evidence must be \"relevant\u201d in that it \"makes 'the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u2019 \u2019,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> There are accordingly two components of \"relevance,\u201d and if either is not present, the evidence is not admissible. The evidence must be probative,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> and it must be material.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">Although there are a number of means by which a witness\u2019 testimony may be impeached, the impeachment use of \"silence\u201d is customarily justified on the basis that the \"silence\u201d amounts to a prior inconsistent statement. Where this is the theory of impeachment, evidence of a defendant\u2019s \"silence\u201d \u2014standing alone or in conjunction with other evidence \u2014 is not admissible unless it tends to prove that the defendant by his silence made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>\"statement.\u201d Once it has been determined that the silence tends to prove the defendant made a \"statement,\u201d it is necessary to determine whether the defendant\u2019s \"statement\u201d is material in that it is sufficiently inconsistent with his trial testimony to shed light on the credibility of that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">It is the probativeness prong that raises the most troublesome questions when a defendant\u2019s \"silence\u201d is used for impeachment purposes. A defendant\u2019s \"silence\u201d does not necessarily mean anything. There will often be a large number of possible explanations for a defendant\u2019s failure to provide information.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">To be admissible as a prior inconsistent statement, it must be possible to conclude with some degree of certainty that a likely explanation for the defendant\u2019s \"silence\u201d \u2014 among the many available explanations \u2014 is that the defendant did not assert a particular fact to which he testified at trial because that fact did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Stated differently, if there is no reason to expect a person to have asserted a fact if the fact did exist and no reason to expect a person to have asserted the fact if the fact did not exist, evidence of the person\u2019s failure to assert the fact does not tend to prove the fact did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">In <em>Collier, </em>this Court held that the impeachment use of a defendant\u2019s \"prearrest silence\u201d does not violate the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Michigan Constitution, Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>Court limited <em>Bobo </em>to \"those situations where the state seeks to impeach a defendant with his silence maintained during contact with police officers.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The Court did not stop there. Rather, it discussed and developed an analytical framework for determining the admissibility of prearrest silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\"><em>Collier </em>involved the impeachment use of a defendant\u2019s prearrest failure to come forward and inform the police that he had been the victim of an armed robbery.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The Court held that Collier\u2019s failure to report the crime was admissible to impeach his trial testimony because, under the circumstances related by him, it would have been natural to report the crime.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Since it would have been natural for Collier to have come forward, his failure to do so had probative value to impeach his testimony that he was the victim of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">In <em>Collier, </em>the defendant\u2019s testimony was impeached with his failure to seek out the police and inform them that he had been the victim of a crime. Cetlinski\u2019s testimony was impeached with his failure to volunteer information that would have tended to incriminate him with respect to the crime being investigated. The only apparent differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>ence between <em>Collier </em>and the instant case is that Cetlinski appears to have made some statements to law enforcement personnel, whereas Collier made no statements (i.e., he failed to come forward).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Another analytical framework was applied in <em>People v Cole, </em>411 Mich 483; 307 NW2d 687 (1981). Cole was charged with assault with intent to commit murder. She told the police that when she shot the victim, she believed he was attempting to arm himself with a metal dog stake. On direct examination, however, Cole testified that she thought the victim was attempting to arm himself with a gun. The prosecutor cross-examined Cole with respect to her prior inconsistent statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">This Court held that \"the cross-examination of the defendant with regard to her prior inconsistent statement was permissible.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The Court distinguished <em>Bobo </em>on the ground that Cole \"had made a statement which <em>con\u00f1icted </em>with her testimony at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The Court also quoted from <em>Anderson v Charles, </em>447 US 404; 100 S Ct 2180; 65 L Ed 2d 222 (1980), where the United States Supreme Court \u2014 holding that the impeachment use of a defendant\u2019s prior inconsistent statement does not violate the rule stated in <em>Doyle </em>\u2014 said that \" '[a]s to the subject matter of his statements, the defendant has not remained silent at all.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">In <em>Cole, </em>the defendant\u2019s testimony was impeached with a prior statement that was actually inconsistent with her trial testimony. Cetlinski\u2019s testimony was not impeached with a prior statement that was actually inconsistent with his trial testimony. His testimony was impeached with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number><em>failure </em>to make a statement about the conversation with Rodriquez.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">Although Cetlinski did not make a statement that was actually inconsistent with his trial testimony, that does not render <em>Cole </em>inapplicable. Similarly, although Cetlinski made statements to law enforcement personnel, that does not render <em>Collier </em>inapplicable. Rather, <em>Cole </em>and <em>Collier </em>occupy two ends of a continuum. Whether a given case is more like <em>Cole </em>or more like <em>Collier </em>will depend on the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The majority says that \"omissions from an affirmative voluntary response to questions about the same subject matter testified to at trial do not constitute 'silence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> We agree that whether the defendant made prior statements concerning \"the same subject matter\u201d as his testimony may be an important factor in determining the admissibility of the defendant\u2019s failure to mention the facts to which he testifies at trial. The difficulty lies in determining whether a pretrial \"statement\u201d concerns \"the same subject matter\u201d as subsequent trial testimony.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The majority also says that \"the failure to assert a material fact when formerly narrating on the matter now dealt with amounts to an assertion, or statement, of the nonexistence of the fact.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Although some of the authority cited by the majority does not appear to support the proposition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>which it is cited,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> we agree that whether the defendant has formerly narrated on the same subject as his trial testimony may be an important factor in determining the admissibility of his failure to mention a fact to which he testifies at trial. The difficulty, again, lies in determining whether a pretrial \"statement\u201d amounts to a \"narration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A0D\">There are no bright-line rules for determining the admissibility of a defendant\u2019s failure to volunteer information during a pretrial statement. The primary consideration is whether there is a basis on which it can be said with a reasonable degree of certainty that the defendant\u2019s failure to volunteer information is probative with respect to some fact that tends to impeach his trial testimony. The defendant\u2019s \"silence\u201d must have an assertive quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Two attributes of a defendant\u2019s pretrial statements may be germane to this inquiry: the \"quantity\u201d of the statements, and their \"quality.\u201d The more a defendant said about a given subject \u2014 the more his statements purported to be a complete description of a given event \u2014 the greater is the likelihood that the defendant\u2019s failure to volunteer particular information is probative. Likewise, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>more narrowly a defendant confines the subject matter of his statements, the greater is the likelihood that his failure to mention a fact related to that narrow subject matter is probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">If evidentiary error would require reversal of Cetlinski\u2019s conviction, it would indeed be appropriate to remand \"because the record was developed <em>pre-Collier </em>and thus failed to address factors later made critical under the evidentiary analysis enunciated in <em>Collier.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>50</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\"For the benefit of the bench and bar,\u201d we consider, in light of the demise of <em>Bobo, </em>the admissibility of Cetlinski\u2019s failure during discussions with police and fire officials to mention his conversation with Rodriquez.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">On the present record, we would hold that Cetlinski\u2019s failure to mention the conversation did not have probative value because it would not have been natural for Cetlinski to have volunteered the information.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> We would hold, in agreement with the Court of Appeals, that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination was improper.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">The present record contains nothing more than general testimony that Cetlinski engaged in conversations with police and fire investigators. There is little specific evidence about Cetlinski\u2019s statements during those discussions. There is no evidence that Cetlinski was asked a question, or volunteered information, regarding any conversation with Rodriquez. Nor is there any evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>that Cetlinski was asked a question that would call on him to mention the disputed conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">On this record, the probative value of Cetlinski\u2019s failure to mention the conversation with Rodriquez is not enhanced by his pretrial statements. This case presents a situation like that in <em>Collier </em>where the defendant\u2019s failure to come forward with information \u2014 not prior \"statements, including omissions\u201d \u2014 was the basis for the prosecutor\u2019s impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Cetlinski first spoke with law enforcement personnel while his bar was still ablaze. During this questioning, Trooper Bowman asked Cetlinski whether he had insurance on the bar and whether he was behind on his taxes or other payments. Under the circumstances, it would not have been natural for Cetlinski to spontaneously assert that \"five or six months ago I asked someone to look into hiring an arsonist to burn my bar, but I was only joking.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Cetlinski\u2019s \"exculpatory\u201d version of the conversation with Rodriquez was highly incriminatory. An innocent person is no more likely to volunteer self-incriminating information than a guilty person. Cetlinski\u2019s failure to mention the conversation had little or no probative value with respect to whether the conversation actually occurred as described in his testimony.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b883-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>On this record, to suggest otherwise would be tantamount to holding that all persons \u2014 innocent and guilty \u2014 have a duty to volunteer self-incriminating information. Such a holding would be contrary to the decisions of this Court. Long ago, the Court concluded that a person was not under a moral or legal obligation to deny an incriminatory accusation made by an ordinary citizen.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Likewise, a person does not have an affirmative duty to volunteer self-incriminating information to a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The majority in effect overrules <em>People v Bobo </em>by holding that this Court\u2019s decision in that case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>henceforth to be construed coextensively with the minimal requirements of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">The decision in <em>Bobo </em>was based on constitutional, evidentiary, <em>and </em>natural law concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">With respect to the federal constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, the Court said that \"whenever a person is stopped for interrogation by the police, whether technically under arrest or not, the Fifth Amendment guarantees that his silence may not be used against him.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> We agree that United States Supreme Court decisions since <em>Bobo </em>establish that this was an overly broad statement, or prediction, of the extent to which the United States Constitution protects a defendant from the evidentiary use of his pretrial silence.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\"><em>Bobo </em>also relied, however, on this Court\u2019s pre<em>Miranda </em>decision in <em>People v Bigge, </em>288 Mich 417; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>285 NW 5 (1939), There, the Court found error requiring reversal in the prosecutor\u2019s reference to Bigge\u2019s failure to deny an incriminatory accusation made in his presence.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The Court ruled that evidence of an incriminatory accusation made in a defendant\u2019s presence and his failure to deny the accusation is not admissible as substantive evidence of guilt.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\"><em>Bobo </em>also was predicated on evidentiary principles. The Court in effect said that evidence of a defendant\u2019s pretrial silence is not admissible as a prior inconsistent statement or as the admission of a party-opponent.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The Court thus appears to have concluded that silence is not an assertion that the events did not occur in the manner in which the defendant later testified.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The Court also drew upon nonlegal, yet authoritative, texts. The Court observed that the rule against the evidentiary use of a defendant\u2019s silence \" 'has higher sanction than mere judicial precedent,\u2019 \u201d and illustrated by quoting from the New Testament.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>The rule stated in <em>Bobo </em>thus had a number of doctrinal sources. One of those sources was indeed the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. In light of the <em>post-Bobo </em>decisions of the United States Supreme Court, it is clear that the Fifth Amendment rationale no longer supports the rule stated in <em>Bobo.</em><footnotemark><em>63</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">The majority overrules <em>Bobo </em>in response to these developments in Fifth Amendment jurisprudence. Overruling <em>Bobo </em>is not, however, the correct response.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">The invalidation of one of the several rationales for the rdecision in <em>Bobo </em>does not justify the elimination without further explanation of the rule there stated. The majority does not explain why the other bases of the <em>Bobo </em>decision were incorrect or insufficient to support the rule stated in <em>Bobo.</em><footnotemark><em>64</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">The majority\u2019s decision implicates a wide array of issues not presently before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">The instant cases do <em>not </em>involve:</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">\u2014the <em>substantive </em>use of a defendant\u2019s failure to come forward and provide information to the police^<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number><em>\u2014the substantive or impeachment </em>use of a defendant\u2019s total silence, or failure to answer particular questions, during prearrest investigative contacts with the polic\u00e9;<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">\u2014the <em>substantive </em>use of a defendant\u2019s failure to make particular assertions during prearrest investigative contacts with the police;<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">\u2014the <em>substantive or impeachment </em>use of a defendant\u2019s total silence, failure to answer particular questions, or failure to make particular assertions, after the defendant has been arrested <em>but before </em>he has received the <em>Miranda </em>warnings;</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\"><em>\u2014the substantive or impeachment </em>use of a defendant\u2019s postarrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>failure to make particular assertions;<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> and</p>\n<p id=\"AJz\">\u2014the <em>impeachment </em>use of a defendant\u2019s post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>failure to answer particular questions.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">By failing expressly to reserve these issues, the majority\u2019s opinion could be read as obiter dictum on a scale not seen since Bobo.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Issues not truly before the Court are better left unanswered until they are presented in the context of actual cases. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Many of those issues are presented in cases now being held in abeyance.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">By in effect overruling <em>Bobo, </em>the majority effectively eliminates much of the case law regarding the admissibility of a defendant\u2019s silence. Although the majority says that an evidentiary analysis must be applied when determining the admissibility of a defendant\u2019s pretrial silence,<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> the majority nonetheless chooses not to apply an evidentiary analysis in <em>this </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Nevertheless, trial judges and the Court of Appeals are obliged to carefully examine the evidentiary admissibility of a defendant\u2019s pretrial silence because whether or not the United States Constitution is implicated, a defendant\u2019s silence is <em>not </em>generally admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">To suggest otherwise would be a significant step toward a transformation of the criminal justice system. It is fundamental that our legal system is adversarial, not inquisitorial. In a criminal prosecution, the state must prove its case and overcome the presumption of innocence without involuntary assistance from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">When a person is questioned during a police investigation, he has the choice of volunteering information and answering questions, or of remaining silent.

It is not unconstitutional for the state to require an individual to waive his right to testify as the price for not using against him at trial evidence that he could not avoid giving in the first place.
