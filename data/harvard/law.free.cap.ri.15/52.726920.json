Stat. R. I. cap. 230, \u00a7 22, as broad enough to include counsel fees as well as the ordinary costs of suit and other expenses of making the partition. We think the construction correct, the phrase being used to denote, not simply the costs of suit, but the costs of partition itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">\n<em>Motion granted and decree entered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
