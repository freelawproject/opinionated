I. cap. 80, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, for nuisance in keeping a grog-shop, etc., in North Kingstown. The case comes up from the Court of Common Pleas by bill of exceptions, which sets forth that upon the trial five witnesses for the State, against the defendant\u2019s objection, \u201ctestified of and concerning the repu-' tation of said defendant\u2019s premises, and the speech of the people concerning said premises, as a place where intoxicating liquors were sold and kept for sale.\u201d The testimony was admitted under cap. 80, \u00a7 3, which provides that \u201cit shall not be necessary to prove an actual sale of intoxicating liquors in any building, place, or tenement, in order to establish the character of such premises as a common nuisance, but the notorious character of any such premises shall be evidence . . . that such premises are nuisances.\u201d . . . The defendant contends that the witnesses ought not to have been permitted to testify, because their testimony was not as to the \u201c notorious character,\u201d but as to the reputation, of the premises complained of. Doubtless there is a distinction, observed by careful writers, between character and reputation; \u201c character,\u201d where the distinction is observed, signifying the reality, and \u201c reputation \u201d merely what is reported, or understood from report, to be the reality about a person or thing. The word \u201c character,\u201d however, is often used as synonymous with, and in the sense of, \u201creputation.\u201d We think it is clearly so used in \u00a7 3. The word is used twice in \u00a7 3, first in its more proper sense, and secondly \u25a0 as synonymous with \u201creputation.\u201d To hold that the word has the same sense in both instances would be to hold that the General Assembly has enacted the self-evident proposition that \u201c the notorious character of the premises \u201d shall be evidence of their character. To interpret the word as used in \u00a7 3 the second time, as synonymous with \u201c reputation,\u201d does not render \u00a7 3 unconstitutional within either <em>State </em>v. Kartz, 13 R. I. 528, or <em>State </em>v. <em>Bes</em>wick, 13 R. I. 211. The fault of the provision condemned in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kartz </em>was, that it made mere reputation criminal, and so exposed a man to punishment as a criminal for what other people said about him. The fault of the provision condemned in <em>State </em>v. <em>Beswiek </em>was, that it made reputation <em>prim\u00e1 facie </em>evidence, and thus made it the duty of the jury to convict on such evidence, if unrebutted, whether satisfied by it of the guilt of the accused or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>not. Section 3, as we interpret it, simply makes the reputation of a place evidence of its character, but it leaves the jury free to find the accused guilty or not, according as they are satisfied of his guilt or not by the evidence. We see no reason to think that such an enactment is unconstitutional.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AmL\"><em>Samuel P. </em>Colt, Attorney-General, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AJg\"><em>Elisha C. </em>Clarice, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
