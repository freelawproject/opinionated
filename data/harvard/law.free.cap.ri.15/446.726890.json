The action was brought in the Court of Common Pleas, and.there tried to tbe court, jury trial being waived. At tbe trial the plaintiff put in evidence tbe records of district meetings held April 23, 1885, at which tbe tax was voted, and August 25,1885, and by adjournment September 4, 1885, at which latter meeting tbe plaintiff was appointed collector; also the notices under which said meetings were held. The plaintiff further put in evidence tbe record of a meeting of tbe school committee of tbe town of Little Compton, at which the tax voted by the district was approved by the committee ; and also a record of assessment by the assessors of taxes, showing the amounts assessed against the defendant and others, The plaintiff also submitted oral testimony to show that notices were given by the assessors of tbe assessments, and wben arid bow tbey were given, and for other purposes. The defendant admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>that notices of the district meetings of April 23, August 25, and September 4 were posted in due time, and at the same places as the assessors\u2019 notices were posted. The defendant did not offer any testimony, but at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony asked the court to rule that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, and to enter judgment for the defendant, because, besides other reasons specifically alleged, the evidence failed to show any legal tax in the district, or any cause of action against the defendant. The court refused so to rule, and entered judgment for the plaintiff. The defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The notice under which the meeting of April 23 was held stated that one of the objects of the meeting was \u201c to decide what amount of money shall be raised by tax,\u201d but nothing more in regard to the tax. The defendant objects that the notice was defective, because it did not state what the tax was for. We do not think the objection is valid. The record shows that the meeting was an annual meeting, which is by statute a meeting held every year, in April, \u201c for choice of officers, and for the transaction of any other business relating to schools,\u201d of which no other notice is required than notice \u201c of the time and place.\u201d It is only when the meeting is special that \u201c the object \u201d is required to be inserted in the notice. Pub. Stat. R. I. cap. 52, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The records of the district meetings of April 23 and August 25 do not set forth how, when, and where the notices of the meeting were'given, nor that the meetings were \u201cduly or legally notified,\u201d which the statute declares shall be <em>prim\u00e9 facie- </em>evidence that the notices were given as the law requires. Pub. Stat. R. I. cap. 58, \u00a7 11. The records simply state that the meetings were held \u201c according to notice.\u201d This does not answer the requirement of the statute. But, as is before stated, the defendant admitted that the notices were posted in due time, and at the same places as the assessors\u2019 notices. The oral testimony goes to show that the assessors\u2019 notices were posted in three places in the district which were as public as any three places in the district, to wit, one on the school-house, one on a building formerly used as a grain building, and the third on a board six feet long and ten inches wide, fastened in or against the roadside wall, facing the road, at the south end of the -district. The defendant contends that the third notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>was not posted in a \u201c public place \u201d within the meaning of the statute, cap. 52, \u00a7 5, because the place was not safe as well as public, inasmuch as the board, being movable, might be thrown down or carried away, so that the notice was not likely to remain to be read for five days. We do not think that we can so decide as a matter of law. A notice so posted in a quiet, rural district would seldom be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The defendant contends that the tax is invalid under Pub. Stat. R. I. cap. 51, \u00a7 4, because it was voted April 23, 1885, and approved by the school committee of Little Compton, June 13,1885. whereas the amount should have been approved before the district voted it. Section 4 reads as follows, to wit: \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">\u201c Every such district may raise money by tax on the ratable property of the district, to support public schools and to carry\u2019out the purposes given them by any of the provisions of this .title: <em>provided </em>that the amount of the tax shall be approved by the school committee of the town.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">In <em>Holt\u2019s </em>Appeal, 5 R. I. 603, decided in 1858, Chief Justice Ames expressed the opinion that the section requires that the amount of the tax \u201c shall be <em>first </em>approved by a school committee as a condition of the right to raise it.\u201d In that case, however, the amount of the tax had been increased after approval before it was voted, and as increased it had never been approved. The commissioner decided that it was invalid because as increased it had never been approved. The question on appeal was whether the decision of the commissioner was correct, and Chief Justic\u00e9 Ames, in expressing the opinion aforesaid, went, farther than he needed to go. We are informed by the school commissioner that the opinion has not been followed, but that it has been the general practice, both before and since the opinion, for the school committees to give their approval after the tax has been voted. It will be observed that the appeal was not to the Supreme Court, but to Chief Justice Ames as a single justice, and it is therefore not entitled to the same weight as if it were the considerate judgment of the full bench. The opinion on this point was given without reasons, and without reference to other statutory provisions which seem to imply or assume that the approval may follow the vote, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>see cap. 54, \u00a7 4,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and cap. 58, \u00a7 5,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and apparently as a matter of first impression. We have come to the conclusion that the construction which has prevailed as a general practice is both reasonable and natural and supported by other provisions, and that it should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">We do not think the objection to the copy of the record of approval because not duly certified, or to the sufficiency of the vote of approval as too indefinite, can be sustained. The certificate appears to be in due form. The vote of approval was adopted June 13, 1885, and purports to approve \u201cthe tax of $750 on District No. 3,\u201d and $750 is the amount of the tax voted at the meeting of District No. 3, April 23, 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The defendant contends that the tax is invalid because it does \u2022not appear that it was raised for the support of public schools, or to carry out the powers given to the district. We think that the objection cannot be raised in this proceeding, but that, under cap. 58, \u00a7 5, the defendant having omitted to appeal, such an objection is nd longer open. \u2022 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The meeting of August 25 was a special, meeting, and therefore a notice of the object of it was necessary. The notice given was that the meeting would be held for \u201c the purpose of taking action in regard to the collection of the tax already assessed.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>defendant contends that the notice was too inexplicit to warrant the election of a collector. We do not think so. The statute provides two modes for the collection of a tax. The district can either commit the collection to the collector of town taxes, or elect a collector of its own, as it shall deem best. The notice was so worded as to enable the district to proceed at once to determine the mode, and adopt the appropriate measures to carry it into effect. Doubtless the notice might with advantage have been more explicit, but it is not the policy of the law to be very exacting with such bodies. The language used by Chief Justice Parker in <em>Welles </em>v. <em>Battelle, </em>11 Mass. 477, 481, is particularly apposite. \u201c Too much strictness in subjects of this nature,\u201d he remarks, \u201cwould throw the whole body politic into confusion, for it cannot be expected that in all the corporations persons will be every year selected who are capable of performing their duty with the exactness which would be useful and convenient.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AhSg\"><em>Ziba O. </em>Slocum, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AXR\"><em>B.
