L. D. Millard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The bill further sets forth, that the complainant has frequently requested the defendant to convey to him one undivided quarter part of the lot, and that the defendant has neglected and refused to do so; and further, that the defendant has advertised the whole of the lot for sale at public auction. The bill prays for an injunction restraining the sale, and for a decree directing the defendant to convey to the complainant one undivided quarter part of the lot. The defendant demurs to the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">The question upon the case stated by the bill is, whether the complainant is entitled to a conveyance of an undivided quarter of the lot, or only to one quarter part of the proceeds resulting from the sale of the lot, the lot being sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">As we understand tbe bill, the complainant claims simply by virtue of the memorandum above set forth, and his right depends upon the construction to be given to the memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">We think it is very clear that the meaning of the memorandum is that the defendant shall continue to hold the land and sell it for the mutual benefit of himself and the complainant, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>complainant shall have only his quarter of the proceeds. 'The language is that the money is received, not for an undivided.quarter part of the lot, but for an undivided quarter interest, and the subsequent part of the memorandum, particularly the words \u201c agreeing to pay over to him. \u201d . . . \u201c one quarter of the net proceeds \u201d . . . \u201c whenever I may make sale,\u201d makes it evident that the complainant was to receive, his interest only after the sale of the entire estate in the land. Such sale could only be made by the defendant in case be retained the whole title.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aopk\"><em>Simon S. Lapham Joseph S. Q.
