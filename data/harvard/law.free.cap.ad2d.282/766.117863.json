In any event, those remarks were either fair comment on the evidence, permissive rhetorical comment, responsive to the defendant\u2019s summation <em>(see, People v Ashwal, </em>39 NY2d 105; <em>People v Thompson, </em>271 AD2d 555; <em>People v Zephir, </em>226 AD2d 408), or not so prejudicial as to constitute reversible error in light of the curative instructions given by the court and the overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt <em>(see, People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230). Bracken, P. J., Florio, Schmidt and Adams, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
