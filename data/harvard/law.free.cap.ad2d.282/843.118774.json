He remains incarcerated, however, because in 1992 he was convicted of promoting prison contraband in the first degree and sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 3 to 6 years to run consecutive to the sentences he was then serving. In October 1999, respondent denied petitioner\u2019s application for parole release. Supreme Court dismissed the CPLR article 78 proceeding to review that determination and we affirm.</p><p id=\"b880-4\">The record reveals that in denying petitioner\u2019s request for parole release, respondent considered the relevant factors, including the serious and violent nature of his crimes, his poor institutional record and the denial of an earned eligibility certificate. In light of petitioner\u2019s failure to demonstrate that respondent\u2019s determination was affected by a \u201c \u2018showing of irrationality bordering on impropriety\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Silmon v Travis, </em>95 NY2d 470, 476, quoting <em>Matter of Russo v New York State Bd. of Parole, </em>50 NY2d 69, 77), we find no reason to disturb the discretionary determination that petitioner was not an acceptable candidate for parole release (see, <em>Matter of Serna v New York State Div. of Parole, </em>279 AD2d 684). Petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions have been reviewed and found to be without merit.</p><p id=\"b880-5\">Mercure, J. P., Peters, Spain, Mugglin and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, without costs.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
