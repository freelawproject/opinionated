One of the prominent issues presented is the proper application of the recent decision in <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The motions are Granted in Part and Denied in Part for the reasons stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-12\">STATEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-13\">Taking all well-pled facts as true, the complaints establish the following. Defendants are producers of graphics processing units, or GPUs, used in many types of consumer electronics. Defendant Nvidia Corporation, a Delaware corporation, has its headquarters in Santa Clara (DPC \u00b6 17).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant ATI Technologies, Inc., is a business entity organized under the laws of Canada <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6 18). Defendant Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., a Delaware corporation, has its principal place of business in Sunnyvale <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6 19). On July 24, 2006, AMD and ATI announced a plan for AMD to acquire ATI. The deal closed on October 25, 2006 <em>(ibid,.). </em>The acquisition was financed through approximately two billion dollars in debt, as well as 56 million shares of AMD stock <em>(ibid.). </em>Direct and indirect purchasers allege that AMD assumed ATI\u2019s existing liabilities pursuant to the acquisition and, as a result, AMD is liable for ATI\u2019s conduct <em>(ibid., </em>IPC \u00b6 41).</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-17\">Direct-purchaser plaintiffs are individuals and businesses who allege that they purchased GPUs directly from defendants or their co-conspirators (DPC \u00b6\u00b6 12-15). Indirect-purchaser plaintiffs, in contrast, allege that they purchased defendants\u2019 GPUs indirectly, <em>i.e., </em>through intermediaries, with some of them alleging that they purchased the graphics card itself, while others allege that they purchased computers containing defendants\u2019 products (IPC \u00b6\u00b6 10-38). Indirect purchaser plaintiffs reside in the following states: Michigan, Florida, California, New York, South Dakota, Minnesota, Arizona, Wisconsin, Kansas, Washington D.C., Oregon, Vermont, and New Mexico <em>(ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-18\">GPUs are dedicated graphics-rendering devices for computers, workstations, servers, game consoles, and mobile devices such as personal digital assistants and cellular phones (DPC \u00b6 8). GPUs process and display computer graphics, including graphics for three-dimensional and video applications <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6 9). Defendants sell GPUs to original equipment manufacturers, original design manufacturers, and directly through retail channels. Plaintiffs allege that even when incorporated into computers, a GPU is a physically discrete component that does not undergo any significant alterations (IPC \u00b6 49). It can be physically unplugged from the computer\u2019s motherboard <em>(ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>Looking at the market for GPUs, plaintiffs allege that Nvidia has a 53% share of the market, while ATI has a 47% share of the market <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6 54). Both Nvidia and ATI are \u201cfabless\u201d semiconductor companies that license the actual production of graphics cards to independent manufacturers <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6 55). They then sell the products under their own brand names. Plaintiffs allege that the market for GPUs has been characterized by price stability and upward pricing trends since at least 2002, while most consumer electronics are characterized by downward pricing trends <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6 56). Direct purchasers allege that the price of the primary components for defendants\u2019 products' \u2014 semiconductors and random-access memory \u2014 has been declining in recent years (DPC \u00b6 95). Additionally, there is alleged excess capacity in the GPU market <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6 96).</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">GPU design and production is a highly complex and expensive line of business requiring large amounts of labor and capital for research and development <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6 45, IPC \u00b6 71). Numerous incidents can delay, halt, or speed up the research and development process (IPC \u00b6 72, DPC \u00b6 46). Plaintiffs allege that in a competitive market, firms would rush to release next-generation products ahead of competitors to capture sales and market share (IPC \u00b6 72, DPC \u00b6 46). According to plaintiffs, the exact opposite has been occurring. Instead of rushing new products to market at the lowest possible prices, ATI and Nvi-dia have been releasing products at approximately the same times and at similar price points (IPC \u00b6 73, DPC \u00b6 48).</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">Plaintiffs allege that ATI, AMD, and Nvidia have conspired to fix prices and to coordinate the release of new like products. Purportedly, ATI and Nvidia held a series of secret meetings and communications during which they restrained trade by: (1) agreeing to reduce competition with each other to maintain and increase their margins; (2) agreeing to fix prices; and (3) coordinating the timing of the release of similar products into the market (DPC \u00b6 32). Plaintiffs allege that executives and employees from ATI and Nvidia attended some of the same industry meetings and conferences. Shortly after attending those conferences, plaintiffs contend, the companies released new products at nearly the same times and at the same price points. Specifics surrounding the agreement, however, are not alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-7\">Plaintiffs allege that ATI and Nvidia slowed the pace of research and development and innovation starting in the spring of 2003. Notably absent from the complaints are contentions of defendants\u2019 behavior <em>before </em>the alleged conspiracy commenced. Plaintiffs make the following allegations in support of their contention that defendants had an agreement to restrain trade:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-8\">\u2022 2002: Members of PCI-SIG (Peripheral Component Interconnect Special Interest Group, a standard-setting organization dealing with high performance data transfer), which included both ATI and Nvidia, met to discuss implementation of PCI standard. \u201cThis meeting provided opportunities for representatives of ATI, Nvidia, and/or AMD to conspire about the introduction and pricing of GPUs and the graphics cards in which they are used\u201d (IPC \u00b6 78).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-9\">\u2022 March 2003: ATI\u2019s Radeon 9800 was announced to go on sale \u201cpriced <em>around $400,\u201d </em>Nvidia FX 5800 GPU also announced in March, was \u201cpriced <em>at $400 </em>as well\u201d (IPC \u00b6 58).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-10\">\u2022 March 4-8 2003: Khronos Group (of which ATI, Nvidia, and AMD were members) sponsored the Game Developers Conference in San Jose (IPC \u00b6 80). \u201cExecutives of ATI and Nvidia attended the Game Developer\u2019s Conference\u201d (DPC \u00b6 52).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>\u2022April 2003: ATI announced that its Radeon 9600 \u201cwould be priced <em>around $200. </em>\u201d Also Nvidia announced that its GeForce 5600 \u201cwould appear in stores in April of 2003, priced at $200 as well\u201d (IPC \u00b6 59).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-5\">\u2022 Spring 2003: Representatives of ATI and Nvidia secretly met to slow the pace for releasing products (IPC \u00b6 75).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-6\">\u2022June 2-3, 2003: \u201cMeeting involving PCI-SIG members\u201d at PCI-SIG conference in San Jose.

The GPU market itself started to show upward pricing trends even though the price of consumer electronics generally showed a downward trend. Plaintiffs conclude that ATI and Nvidia forged an agreement to fix prices. In support, they allege that ATI and Nvi-dia\u2019s employees attended the same trade shows and industry meetings which gave them the opportunity to meet and to conspire. Contrary to their individual economic interests, ATI and Nvidia began to delay introduction of their new products. They also released products at approximately the same times and at approximately the same prices, allegedly releasing like products within weeks or within one to three months of one another. In concluso-ry manner, plaintiffs allege that this was unprecedented in the industry. As a result, plaintiffs and other putative class members have paid super-competitive prices for GPUs and consumer electronics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-17\">On November 30, 2006, AMD and Nvi-dia both announced that they had received subpoenas from the San Francisco Office of the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice in connection with an investigation regarding GPUs and graphics cards (DPC \u00b6\u00b6 35-36). In an SEC filing, AMD confirmed that the investigation was criminal in nature <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6 38). To date, neither company has publicly denied allegations of antitrust violations, stated that the investigation has no basis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>or revealed that it has conducted an internal investigation <em>{id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 3\u00a3M=0).</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">The first of these civil antitrust actions was filed on December 4, 2006. Many others quickly followed. A majority of the complaints were filed by indirect purchasers of GPUs or computers containing GPUs; the remainder were filed by direct purchasers. By order of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, a number of these actions were consolidated for pretrial purposes on April 18, 2007, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1407. Other tag-along actions have been transferred and consolidated into this multi-district litigation proceeding since then.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">An initial case management conference was held on May 24, 2007. Plaintiffs agreed to refile and consolidate their complaints and submit to this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction, thus avoiding the necessity of sending any cases back to their \u201chome\u201d districts. An order dated May 30, 2007, appointed interim class counsel for the indirect-purchaser and direct-purchaser plaintiffs. Defendants\u2019 motion for a stay of discovery was filed on June 7, 2007, and consolidated complaints for both the direct and indirect purchasers were filed on June 14, 2007. The direct purchasers plead a claim for violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1. They ask for an injunction under the Clayton Act, treble damages, and the costs of suit. The indirect purchasers plead the following claims: (1) violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act seeking an injunction; (2) violation of California\u2019s Cartwright Act; (3) violation of California Business and Professions Code \u00a7 17200; (4) violations of the antitrust laws of various other states; (5) violations of the consumer protection and unfair competition laws of various other states; and (6) unjust enrichment and disgorgement of profits. On July 24, 2007, an order issued staying discovery pending the outcome of these motions to dismiss. The dismissal motions were filed on July 16, 2007. A hearing was held on September 20, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of the claims alleged in the complaint. \u201cWhile a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiffs obligation to provide the \u2018grounds\u2019 of his \u2018entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

However, conclusory allegations of law and unwarranted inferences are insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\u201d <em>Epstein v. Wash. Energy Co., </em>83 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th Cir.1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-11\">Defendants have filed three motions to dismiss. <em>First, </em>all defendants move to dismiss direct purchasers\u2019 complaint. <em>Second, </em>all defendants move to dismiss indirect purchasers\u2019 complaint. <em>Finally, </em>defendant AMD moves to dismiss on the ground that it cannot be held liable for ATI\u2019s conduct either before or after the acquisition.

Legal Standard Under <em>Twombly.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-14\">Defendants argue that <em>Twombly </em>requires that this action be dismissed because plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of conspiracy are simply too conclusory to state a claim. In the <em>Twombly </em>decision, the Supreme Court discussed pleading standards for an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>titrust conspiracy claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1. It reiterated that under Rule 8(a)(2), only a short and plain statement of the plaintiffs entitlement to relief is necessary. 127 S.Ct. at 1964. It also acknowledged that \u201ca plaintiffs obligation to provide the \u2018grounds\u2019 of his \u2018entitle[ment] to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1964-1965 (citing <em>Papasan v. Attain, </em>478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S.Ct. 2932, 92 L.Ed.2d 209 (1986)). The decision went on to criticize a common interpretation of the hoary \u201cno set of facts\u201d language from <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). <em>Twombly </em>noted that \u201c[o]n such a focused and literal reading of Conley\u2019s \u2018no set of facts,\u2019 a wholly conclusory statement of claim would survive a motion to dismiss whenever the pleadings left open the possibility that a plaintiff might later establish some \u2018set of [undisclosed] facts\u2019 to support recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">The <em>Tivombly </em>plaintiffs pleaded an antitrust claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act by alleging parallel conduct. The Supreme Court noted that parallel behavior among firms is certainly admissible as circumstantial evidence of agreement in the trial or summary-judgment context, but even conscious parallel behavior is not, by itself,' unlawful. <em>Id. </em>at 1964. Its past holdings indicated that mere parallel conduct was not sufficient to entitle a plaintiff to a directed verdict, and similarly, at the summary-judgment stage, the plaintiffs evidence \u201cmust tend to rule out the possibility that the defendants were acting independently.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Theatre Enterprises Inc. v. Paramount Film Distributing Corp., </em>346 U.S. 537, 540, 74 S.Ct. 257, 98 L.Ed. 273 (1954); <em>Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986)). As for the pleading standard on a motion to dismiss, the Supreme Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-7\">In applying these general standards to a \u00a7 1 claim, we hold that stating such a claim requires a complaint with enough factual matter(taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made. Asking for plausible grounds to infer an agreement does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement .... It makes sense to say, therefore, that an allegation of parallel conduct and a bare assertion of conspiracy will not suffice. Without more, parallel conduct does not suggest conspiracy, and a conclusory allegation of agreement at some unidentified point does not supply facts adequate to show illegality. Hence, when allegations of parallel conduct are set out in order to make a \u00a7 1 claim, they must be placed in a context that raises a suggestion of a preceding agreement, not merely parallel conduct that could just as well be independent action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1965-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-9\">The decision also reiterated that allegations of conspiracy were not subject to Rule 9(b)\u2019s more exacting pleading standard. Such' allegations are governed by Rule 8. <em>Id. </em>at 1973, n. 14. The requirement under <em>Twombly </em>is only that the allegations be sufficiently particularized to \u201crender plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to relief plausible.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Accordingly, to survive a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff would have to allege more than mere instances of parallel conduct coupled with bare assertions of agreement at some unspecified time. <em>Twombly </em>did, however, note that \u201ccomplex and historically unprecedented changes in pricing structure made at the very same time by multiple competitors, and made for no oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>er discernible reason would support a plausible inference of conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1965, n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">B. Allegations of Conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\"><em>Twombly </em>concerned incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) that were granted localized monopolies over regional local telephone service. As of 1996, the government no longer supported such monopolies and mandated that each ILEC share its network with other customers. The upshot of the <em>Twombly </em>complaint was that the ILECs engaged in parallel conduct to prevent competition from competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) and that the ILECs agreed not to compete with one another. The <em>Twombly </em>plaintiffs alleged that agreement could be inferred from the ILECs\u2019 failure to pursue certain business opportunities. <em>Id. </em>at 1961-63. The Supreme Court noted that the ILECs\u2019 actions were just as consistent with preserving their own markets in a natural manner as they were with an unlawful agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 1971. Each ILEC would have its own, individual incentives to keep CLECs out of their respective markets absent conspiracy with other ILECs. In particular, the decision noted that firms cannot be expected to enter every market available to them that an outside observer might consider profitable. <em>Id. </em>at 1972 (citing Ar-eeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <em>Antitrust Law, </em>\u00b6 307d, at 155 (Supp.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">Here, the upshot of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is that sometime between late 2002 and early 2003, Nvidia and ATI formed an agreement not to compete with one another. The agreement manifested itself in defendants\u2019 slowing the progress of research and development and releasing new products at the same times and at the same price points. Plaintiffs allege that the conspiracy developed at or some time around meetings of trade associations attended by defendants. As evidence of agreement, plaintiffs allege that parallel-pricing behavior between the two firms occurred shortly after the meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-9\">At least two courts have addressed such allegations after the <em>Twombly </em>decision. In <em>In re OSB Antitrust Litigation, </em>2007 WL 2253419 (E.D.Pa. Aug. 3, 2007), the plaintiffs made allegations of price fixing in the market for oriented-strand board. The plaintiffs alleged both that the market was highly concentrated and that the conspiracy was maintained through secret meetings and a bi-weekly published price list. <em>Id. </em>at *4. Judge Paul Diamond held the parallel conduct by itself could have been the defendants\u2019 natural reactions to conditions in the oriented-strand board market. When combined with the plaintiffs\u2019 explicit allegations that the defendants discussed price fixing at industry events and enforced the agreement through a published price list, however, it was sufficient to sustain a claim under Twombly. <em>Id. </em>at *6. Similarly, in <em>In re Rubber Chemicals Antitrust Litigation, </em>504 F.Supp.2d 777, 790 (N.D.Cal.2007), Judge Martin Jenkins of this district held that allegations of meetings at trade shows that detailed who was present at the meetings and how they were involved in fixing prices were sufficient to allege a conspiracy when coupled with parallel pricing. Furthermore, there were allegations of certain individuals\u2019 involvement in the price-fixing meetings and the steps taken to fix prices and enforce the agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 790.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>C. Parallel Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">Here, both direct and indirect plaintiffs allege that the conspiracy began at sometime late in 2002. The companies belonged to some of the same trade associations and standard-setting organizations. ATI and Nvidia\u2019s employees and executives allegedly attended their meetings at the same time. Plaintiffs do not, however, allege which persons from the companies attended or what their titles were. No details are given concerning the alleged agreement.. Plaintiffs allege that \u201c[i]n the spring and summer of 2003, pursuant to the conspiracy herein alleged, ATI and Nvidia slowed the pace at which they released new GPU products and coordinated the pricing of these new products\u201d (DPC \u00b6 49). Significantly, however, this is the only statement that plaintiffs make regarding defendants\u2019 behavior before the conspiracy allegedly began.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">Plaintiffs have pleaded several instances of parallel pricing and parallel releases of products. They allege the following products were released at approximately the same times and at the same prices:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-7\">\u2022ATI announced that its Radeon 9800 would be released in March 2003 \u201cpriced around $400,\u201d and Nvidia announced that its FX 5800 would be released in March 2003, \u201cpriced at $400 as well\u201d (IPC \u00b6 58).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-8\">\u2022 In April 2003, \u201cit was announced\u201d that ATI\u2019s Radeon 9600 would be \u201cpriced around $200,\u201d and Nvidia announced that its FX 5600 would appear in April of 2003, \u201cpriced at $200 as well\u201d <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6 59).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-9\">\u2022 Nvidia announced in October 2003 that it was postponing introduction of its NV40 graphics technology. \u201cAt the same time,\u201d ATI announced the delay of its comparable R400 technology (DPC \u00b6 56).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-13\">\u2022 Nvidia released its GeForce 6800 GT and ATI released its Radeon X800 Pro \u201cwithin just a few weeks of each other in April and May of 2004.\u201d \u201cThis was the first time in history that Nvidia and ATI had ever released next-generation competing technologies so close to one another\u201d <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 61-62).

The allegations of parallel conduct, however, are not so convincing as plaintiffs contend. For instance, as stated under the last bullet point, both defendants allegedly released products in September 2006 \u2014 but with a difference in price of twenty dollars. Plaintiffs urge that other products were simultaneously released, but they actually pleaded that the products were only released within the same month. In other instances, such as the Nvidia GeForce 6200 GT and the ATI Radeon 9550, products were released within <em>three </em>months of one another. The complaints are often less than clear about when the products were actually released. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of parallel conduct could possibly be indicative of a conspiracy but fall short of unusual, lockstep pricing behavior. We must remember that competitive market forces will tend to drive the prices of like goods to the same level, so like prices on like products are not, standing alone, sufficient to implicate price-fixing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations also fail to show that this behavior was \u201chistorically unprecedented\u201d because they make scant allegations of pricing behavior that came <em>before </em>the alleged conspiracy. Releasing products within three months, or even within the same month, may have been the standard industry practice. Indeed, defendants suggest innocent reasons why Nvidia and ATI would release their like products at roughly the same times. As even plaintiffs allege, the majority of GPUs are incorporated into other electronics. At the hearing, defendants argued that their product releases were governed by the OEMs\u2019 product cycles. Relying on their Form lOKs, defendants claim to have sold to the same OEMs, so naturally, one would expect their product releases to have happened close in time. Because, however, this Form 10K material is extraneous to the complaint and the Form lOKs were not cited therein, the specifics in any Form lOKs may not be considered. Nonetheless, the general point is so well known that it will be considered, namely that OEMs often do dictate the timing and specifications of the next round of chips needed for their own new products, so the vendors competing to supply the new chips will tend to introduce them at or about the same time and with the same OEM-required features. This characteristic of the chip industry is an independent innocent explanation for parallel conduct of chip makers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">Defendants also contend that producers of GPUs, much like other producers of electronics, are subject to a certain cycle in releasing products. Each has its own independent reasons to delay release of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>new product. To maximize revenue, they may delay the release of new products to exact the most revenue out of older products, with the delay lasting until their hands are forced by the competition. As plaintiffs themselves plead, the release of new GPU technology can render earlier technology obsolete (IPC \u00b6 81).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">In short, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of parallel conduct are consistent with conspiracy but they are equally consistent with lawful conduct. Accordingly, under <em>Twombly, </em>plaintiffs have not pleaded facts that would move their allegations from merely possible to plausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">D. Direct Allegations of Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">Plaintiffs argue at length that their allegations are distinguishable from <em>Twombly </em>because they have directly alleged an agreement. Plaintiffs overplay their hand. The sum of their allegations of agreement is that executives from ATI and Nvidia attended the same conferences and trade meetings. Attendance at industry trade shows and events is presumed legitimate and is not a basis from which to infer a conspiracy, without more. <em>In re Citric Acid Litig., </em>191 F.3d 1090, 1098 (9th Cir.1999). Moreover, even where some competitors have admitted to meeting to fix prices at or near trade shows and conferences, it is not reasonable to infer that another competitor in attendance at the same meeting had done likewise. <em>Id. </em>at 1097. Defendants point out that there are no allegations that representatives from ATI and Nvidia actually met or spoke with one another during those widely-attended conferences. Here, plaintiffs have pleaded no facts indicating that defendants\u2019 attendance at trade shows and conferences was part of a conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-10\">Plaintiffs do attempt to correlate the trade shows to the release of products at certain price points, implying that defendants must have met and made the decisions to do so. The upshot of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations is that defendants attended a certain meeting which gave them an \u201copportunity\u201d to meet secretly. Shortly thereafter, both companies released new products at similar prices (DPC \u00b6\u00b6 52-55). Missing, however, is any specific allegation that defendants\u2019 representatives actually met to fix prices. Moreover, plaintiffs allege that defendants attended up to nine of the same trade events in the same year. Plaintiffs allege that two or three products were released in tandem in those years. It is almost axiomatic that a product release would fall within a few months of one trade meeting or another, there having been so many of them. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are just as consistent with coincidence as they are with conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>This is not to say that to survive a motion to dismiss, plaintiffs must plead specific back-room meetings between specific actors at which specific decisions were made. Nor is this order imposing the stricter pleading standard set forth in Rule 9(b) to allegations of conspiracy. The <em>Twombly </em>decision reiterated that allegations of antitrust conspiracy are governed by Rule 8, and not the heightened standard of Rule 9(b). The Supreme Court\u2019s concern in that instance was that the allegations were insufficiently particularized to \u201crender plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to relief plausible.\u201d 127 S.Ct. at 1973, n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-3\">Plaintiffs allege in conclusory fashion that defendants fixed prices pursuant to an agreement, but that allegation is simply too conclusory to show a plausible entitlement to relief. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Twombly, </em>\u201cparallel conduct does not suggest conspiracy, and a conclusory allegation of agreement at some unidentified point does not supply facts adequate to show illegality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1966. Plaintiffs have not pleaded that defendants ever met and agreed to fix prices; they plead at most that defendants had the opportunity to do so because they attended many of the same meetings. They then attempt to correlate the release of products with those meetings. Given the sheer number of meetings attended by both defendants, every product release will follow on the heels of a meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">Plaintiffs also contend that defendants have erred in mincing their allegations too finely. Instead of separately looking at their allegations of parallel pricing and agreement, they should be analyzed as a whole. Even doing so, plaintiffs have not pleaded a claim for antitrust conspiracy. They have failed to make well-pled allegations that, taken true, tend to raise a \u201creasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1965. At most, they have suggested that defendants\u2019 employees and executives attended the same meetings, and thereafter, defendants engaged in parallel behavior that could be explained by each firm acting in their own self-interest. As demonstrated above, their allegations of parallel behavior do not go nearly so far as they contend in their briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">In support of their allegations, plaintiffs point out that the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice has served defendants with subpoenas and is conducting a grand jury investigation. The investigation, however, carries no weight in pleading an antitrust conspiracy claim. It is unknown whether the investigation will result in indictments or nothing at all. Because of the grand jury\u2019s secrecy requirement, the scope of the investigation is pure speculation. It may be broader or narrower than the allegations at issue. Moreover, if the Department of Justice made a decision <em>not </em>to prosecute, that decision would not be binding on plaintiffs. The grand jury investigation is a non-factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">Although the existing allegations fall short, <em>Twombly </em>may light the way for an amended pleading, at least if counsel can deliver on the amendments promised at the hearing. <em>Twombly </em>held that \u201ccomplex and historically unprecedented changes in pricing structure made at the very same time by multiple competitors, and made for no other discernible reason would support a plausible inference of conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1965, n. 4. Although the complaints are replete with allegations about defendants\u2019 pricing behavior <em>after </em>the conspiracy allegedly began, they say next to nothing about defendants\u2019 pricing behavior <em>before </em>the conspiracy began. Plaintiffs\u2019 conclusory allegation that the changes in pricing were unprecedented is insufficient because on these facts, no before-and-after comparison of pricing behavior can take place. At the hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>this motion, counsel stated that they could make stronger \u201cbefore\u201d allegations, evidently drawn from publicly available trade journals and public filings, so as to spell out such \u201cunprecedented changes.\u201d Accordingly, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss direct-purchaser plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is Granted, but an avenue for seeking leave to amend will be described below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">2. Motion to Dismiss Indirect Purchasers\u2019 Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Turning to the indirect purchasers\u2019 claims, this order has already held that these allegations of a price-fixing conspiracy are insufficient to state a claim under Rule 8(a)(2). Federal pleading standards govern in federal court, even as to state claims. <em>See AlliedSignal, Inc. v. City of Phoenix, </em>182 F.3d 692, 696 (9th Cir.1999). Since plaintiffs\u2019 federal and state-law antitrust claims are predicated on the same allegations of conspiracy, they likewise are insufficient to state a claim for conspiracy. Accordingly, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is Granted with respect to the federal and state antitrust claims, including the claim asserted on behalf of a purported nationwide class under California\u2019s Cartwright Act. This order now addresses defendants\u2019 standing arguments and plaintiffs\u2019 state-law consumer-protection claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">A. State Antitrust Laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">The Supreme Court has held that indirect purchasers may not sue for money damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Act (with rare exceptions). <em>Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 720, 730, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977). Thus, there is virtually no monetary federal antitrust remedy for indirect purchasers. After the <em>Illinois Brick </em>decision, some states passed statutes expressly allowing indirect purchasers to recover damages for antitrust violations under state law. <em>See, e.g., </em>Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 16720. Since our indirect purchasers are barred from asserting federal claims for monetary relief, they mainly rely on the law of those states that have repealed <em>Illinois Brick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">In moving to dismiss indirect purchasers\u2019 state-law antitrust claims, defendants argue that plaintiffs who purchased finished computers, as opposed to GPUs or graphics cards, do not have standing and that claims brought in states where no named plaintiff resides should be eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-11\">\n<em>(1) Standing.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-12\">The argument is that those who purchased products containing GPUs, instead of purchasing GPUs themselves, have injuries that are simply too remote to support antitrust standing. <em>Federal </em>antitrust standing is determined by the five^part test set forth in <em>Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, </em>459 U.S. 519, 536-39, 103 S.Ct. 897, 74 L.Ed.2d 723 (1983). The factors to consider are: (1) whether the alleged conspirators intended to injure plaintiffs; (2) the directness or indirectness of the asserted injury; (3) the character of the claimed damages (including risk of duplicative recovery, complexity of apportionment and speculative nature of damages); (4) the existence of more direct victims; and (5) the nature of plaintiffs\u2019 claimed injury and whether it was a participant in the relevant market.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-13\">As noted, <em>Associated General Contractors </em>arose under the federal Clayton Act. It is far from clear that <em>Associated General Contractors </em>should be automatically read into the substantive antitrust law of each and every state. To be sure, some states, such as West Virginia, have so-called harmonization provisions that incorporate federal interpretations of similar federal antitrust statutes into state statutes. W. Va.Code \u00a7 47-18-16. Some fed-era:! courts have applied <em>Associated Gener</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number><em>al Contractors </em>to limit the standing of indirect purchasers under state law. <em>See, e.g., In re DRAM Antitrust Litig., </em>516 F.Supp.2d 1072, 1089-90 (N.D.Cal.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">On the other hand, a recent decision by the Supreme Court of Minnesota held that <em>Associated General Contractors </em>did <em>not </em>apply to claims brought under that state\u2019s law, so it did not govern standing. <em>Lorix v. Crompton, </em>736 N.W.2d 619, 627-28 (Minn. Aug.2, 2007). Other courts have found conflicts between <em>Associated General Contractors </em>and state-law provisions. <em>See D.R. Ward Const. Co. v. Rohm &amp; Haas, Co., </em>470 F.Supp.2d 485, 500-02 (E.D.Pa.2006) (Davis, J.) (finding that Vermont\u2019s harmonization provision did not require it to adopt all federal antitrust precedent and casting doubt on whether <em>AGC </em>applied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">Standing under each state\u2019s antitrust statute is a matter of that state\u2019s law. It would be wrong for a district judge, in <em>ipse dixit </em>style, to bypass all state legislatures and all state appellate courts and to pronounce a blanket and nationwide revision of all state antitrust laws. The rule urged by the defense may (or may not) be sound policy but that is a matter for the state policy makers to decide, not for a federal judge to impose by fiat. This order\u2019s rejection of the blanket nationwide proposal is without prejudice to a later state-by-state analysis of the extent to which <em>Associated General Contractors </em>has actually been adopted by state officials. It is worth stating that under Rule 23, this would be a formidable challenge and, along with other state-by-state dissections of local law, militate against the predominance of common issues and against manageability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">\n<em>(2) Claims Under Non-California Law In States Where No Named Plaintiff Resides.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-9\">Defendants move to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 state-law antitrust claims under the laws of Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Dakota, Tennessee, and West Virginia because no named plaintiff resides in those states. Each claim under each state statute must be analyzed separately. A class cannot assert a claim on behalf of an individual that they cannot represent. <em>In re Terazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., </em>160 F.Supp.2d 1365, 1371 (S.D.Fla.2001). Plaintiffs argue that the standing issue should be postponed until class certification. The Ninth Circuit, however, has held that standing can be addressed before class certification where, as here, the court is not considering a global class settlement. <em>Easter v. Am. West Fin., </em>381 F.3d 948, 962 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., </em>527 U.S. 815, 119 S.Ct. 2295, 144 L.Ed.2d 715 (1999), did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>not require considering class certification before standing). Accordingly, no named plaintiff has standing to bring antitrust claims in those states, and defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss those claims will be Granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">Defendants present similar arguments with respect to claims under the consumer-protection laws of those same states. Again, there is no named plaintiff from those states who has suffered injury as a result of defendants\u2019 conduct, so those claims must be dismissed. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is Granted as to plaintiffs claims under the consumer-protection laws of Arkansas, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and West Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">B. Nationwide Class Under California Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">Indirect plaintiffs also purport to bring claims on behalf of a nationwide class under California\u2019s Cartwright Act and California\u2019s Business and Professions Code \u00a7 17200. Defendants in effect move to strike all references to a nationwide class in these claims because extraterritorial application of California\u2019s antitrust law would violate due process. For a nationwide class to invoke the law of a particular state, the chosen state\u2019s law must both (1) not conflict with the law of another jurisdiction that has an interest in the case, and (2) have a significant contact or significant aggregation of contacts to claims asserted by each member of the plaintiff class to insure that the choice of the forum state\u2019s law is not arbitrary or unfair. <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, </em>472 U.S. 797, 821-22, 105 S.Ct. 2965, 86 L.Ed.2d 628 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">\n<em>(1) Con\u00f1ict of Law.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">As stated, after the <em>Illinois Brick </em>decision, some states, including California, passed statutes that expressly permitted indirect purchasers- to recover damages for antitrust violations under state law, repealing <em>Illinois </em>Brick\u2019s holding. <em>See, e.g., </em>Cal. Bus. <em>&amp; </em>Prof.Code \u00a7 16720. Other states have declined to do so. In those states, indirect purchasers are barred from bringing antitrust claims, other than for injunc-tive relief. Defendants contend that applying the law of California to a nationwide class would squarely conflict with the laws of these states. Here, allowing a nationwide class based on California antitrust law would allow residents of some states who abide by <em>Illinois Brick </em>to have claims where their respective state governments have declined to allow them. Plaintiffs attempt to harmonize the conflict by saying that California merely confers an additional right on purchasers to sue for damages. This order holds that there is a conflict between the two camps, each camp having come out in opposite ways on the repealer issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-11\">Plaintiffs characterize this issue as a mere choice-of-law issue under California law. The <em>Shutts </em>test, however, deals with whether the application of a certain state\u2019s law to a nationwide class violates due process and the full faith and credit clause, while a choice-of-law analysis is a noncon-stitutional question under the common law of the state, here California. <em>Shutts </em>cannot be swept under the rug. Nonetheless, California\u2019s choice-of-law test also happens to consider whether there is a conflict between the law of California and the laws of other states. Here, the conflict looms large. Again, some states allow their citizens to sue for antitrust injuries as indirect purchasers (like California) and some do not. Each state had the ability to repeal <em>Illinois Brick </em>as to its local law. Some chose yes. Some chose no. Plaintiffs have not shown that California has a greater interest in applying its law than other states. Any Cartwright Act class would, at most, have to be limited to states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>with laws like California\u2019s law. If and when class certification is on the table, the multiplicity of issues in working through the fifty state laws will also weigh in the analysis. <em>See Kakani v. Oracle, </em>2007 WL 1793774, *8 (N.D.Cal. June 19, 2007) (Als-up, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">\n<em>(2) Significant Contacts.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">Next under <em>Shutts </em>is the question of significant contacts. Defendants point out that not all plaintiffs have alleged that they bought graphics cards in California, or that defendants produced graphics cards in California, or even that the alleged secret meetings between defendants\u2019 representatives took place in California. This is so. Plaintiffs reply, however, that conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy took place in California. Nvidia is allegedly headquartered in California. ATI has at least some business operations here in California. Representatives from both companies attended meetings in California, or so it is alleged. It remains, however, that plaintiffs have never alleged the specific locations of any of the meetings between defendants. Moreover, ATI is organized in Canada and has its headquarters there. Even if there was no conflict in applying California law to states without <em>Illinois Brick </em>repealer statutes, plaintiffs have <em>not </em>pleaded or otherwise shown sufficient contacts to warrant the application of California law to other states.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">Even where substantial contacts to the forum state have been pled, courts have declined to apply a single state\u2019s laws to a nationwide antitrust class. <em>In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., </em>221 F.R.D. 260, 276-77 (D.Mass.2004) (Young, J.). In <em>In re Relafen Antitrust Litigation, </em>the plaintiffs attempted to apply Pennsylvania law to a nationwide class because the company producing the drug was headquartered in Pennsylvania and the product was sold and distributed from that state. <em>Relafen </em>noted that because \u201cthe primary aim of antitrust and consumer protection laws generally\u2014 and those of indirect purchaser states particularly \u2014 is compensating consumers, not policing corporate conduct,\u201d the court determined that the more significant factor was the location of the injury, or where the plaintiff was located when the injury occurred from purchasing the products. Most of the sales happened outside Pennsylvania, so the court declined to apply Pennsylvania law to out-of-state sales. <em>Id. </em>at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">The <em>Relafen </em>decision seems persuasive. It is hard to see why the laws of other states should be tossed overboard and their residents remitted to California law for transactions that, for individual consumers, are local in nature. Plaintiffs contend that this issue should not be decided at this time. Specifically, they point to <em>In re Intel Corp. Microprocessor Antitrust Litig., </em>496 F.Supp.2d 404, 418 (D.Del.2007) (Farnan, J.), in support. That decision left the issue of whether California\u2019s unfair competition laws could apply to other states until a later stage of the litigation. This order, however, sees merit in disposing of this issue at an early stage of the litigation, particularly where the issue of whether the different state\u2019s laws conflict will not change significantly as this action progresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-9\">Accordingly, defendants\u2019 motion is Granted, and all references to a nationwide class in indirect purchaser\u2019s claims under California\u2019s Cartwright Act and California\u2019s unfair-competition law are Stricken. This particular ruling is without prejudice to a potential class of California\u2019s residents or a potential class of residents in the states of the named plaintiffs under their respective state laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-10\">C. Unjust-Enrichment Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-11\">Plaintiffs also have a claim for unjust enrichment on behalf of a nationwide class. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>They argue that there is no material difference between the unjust-enrichment laws of all fifty states.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">Disagreeing, defendants point out that the various states differ on whether unjust enrichment can survive on its own as a separate claim versus a remedy that relies on another claim. Indeed, California courts are split on whether unjust enrichment can exist as a separate claim. <em>Compare Melchior v. New Line Productions, Inc., </em>106 Cal.App.4th 779, 793, 131 Cal.Rptr.2d 347 (2003) (quoting <em>Lauriedale Assocs. Ltd. v. Wilson, </em>7 Cal.App.4th 1439, 1448, 9 Cal.Rptr.2d 774 (1992) (\u201cThe phrase \u2018unjust enrichment\u2019 does not describe a theory of recovery, but an effect: the result of a failure to make restitution under circumstances where it is equitable to do so.\u201d)); <em>with Ghirardo v. Antonioli, </em>14 Cal.4th 39, 50, 57 Cal.Rptr.2d 687, 924 P.2d 996 (1996) (holding that a plaintiff may state a claim for unjust enrichment where his claim seeks restitution and other remedies are inadequate). Other states preclude independent unjust-enrichment claims altogether. <em>In re Abbott Labs. Norvir Anti-Trust Litig., </em>2007 WL 1689899, *10 (N.D.Cal. June 11, 2007) (Wilken, J.) (noting that Indiana and Ohio do not recognize independent claims for unjust enrichment).</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">Defendants contend that these claims should be dismissed as an attempt to circumvent the holding of <em>Illinois Brick. </em>If a nationwide free-standing claim for unjust enrichment survives, it would create a monetary remedy for plaintiffs in states that had never chosen to create one. They cite <em>In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Antitrust Litigation, </em>350 F.Supp.2d 160, 208 (D.Me.2004) (Hornby, J.), for the proposition that allowing a restitution claim in all fifty states would undermine the purposes of substantive antitrust law and consumer-protection law. The Restatement is in accord and explains that \u201c[allowing Customers to recover Manufacturers\u2019 overcharges on a theory of unjust enrichment would conflict with the remedial regime established by the law that makes the defendants\u2019 acts illegal.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Restitution \u00a7 44. Defendants, however, seem to forget that the Restatement is not the law in every state. Some states have adopted it. Some have not. Once again, defendants must address their state-policy arguments to the state legislatures and state courts rather than to lead a district judge to force it on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">Once again, the dismissal argument is cast as a nationwide blanket proposal. So cast, it cannot be granted, given the vagaries of the many state laws involved. To be sure, these vagaries will raise serious issues of commonality and manageability on class certification. On this motion, however, this order declines to adopt the sweeping position proposed by defendants. The motion to dismiss all unjust-enrichment claims is Denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-9\">D. State Consumer-Protection Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-10\">Defendants move to dismiss certain of plaintiffs\u2019 claims under state consumer-protection statutes because they have not alleged all elements of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-11\">First, defendants argue that plaintiffs have not alleged \u201cunconscionable conduct\u201d under the state consumer-protection laws of Arkansas, the District of Columbia, Kansas, and New Mexico. Each of the above-mentioned statutes prohibits deceptive and unconscionable conduct in consumer transactions. <em>See </em>Ark. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 4 \u2014 88\u2014107(a); D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 28-3904; Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 50-626; N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 57-12-2(D). Likewise, in each of these states, pleading uneonscionability requires something more than merely alleging that the price of a product was unfairly high. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number><em>State v. R &amp; A Inv. Co., </em>336 Ark. 289, 985 S.W.2d 299, 302 (1999) (\u201cTwo important considerations are whether there is a gross inequality of bargaining power between the parties to the contract and whether the aggrieved party was made aware of and comprehended the provision in question.\u201d); <em>Riggs Nat\u2019l Bank of Washington D.C. v. D.C., </em>581 A.2d 1229, 1251 (D.C.1990) (\u201cTo establish unconscionability, however, the District must prove not only that one of the parties lacked a meaningful choice but also that the terms of the contract are unreasonably favorable to the other party.\u201d). Here, plaintiffs argue that they have pleaded that defendants engaged in unconscionable conduct. They have not, however, pleaded the kind of grossly unequal bargaining power prohibited by these statutes. This is not to say that allegations of price fixing are not serious. It is only to say that they are not the kind of conduct prohibited under these statutes. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as to these claims is Granted. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 claims under these statutes should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-3\">Defendants assert that plaintiffs cannot recover under the New York Consumer Protection Act because they have not alleged that defendants engaged in fraudulent or deceptive conduct. Under New York General Business Law \u00a7 349(a), \u201cdeceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state are hereby declared unlawful.\u201d Antitrust-type claims have been recognized under \u00a7 349(a). <em>See, e.g., Excellus Health Plan, Inc. v. Tran, </em>287 F.Supp.2d 167, 179-80 (W.D.N.Y.2003) (Curtin, J.); <em>Cox v. Microsoft Corp., </em>8 A.D.3d 39, 40, 778 N.Y.S.2d 147 (1st Dep\u2019t 2004). Plaintiffs have alleged at least in a conclusory fashion that defendants engaged in deceptive conduct. They contend that defendants have engaged in deceptive acts to conceal the alleged agreement to fix prices. Here, it would seem that such allegations would be sufficient to state a claim under such law. Defendants hid the alleged conspiracy from plaintiffs, resulting in plaintiffs paying higher prices. Assuming that plaintiffs had pleaded the existence of a conspiracy, plaintiffs can state a claim under this statute. Defendants\u2019 motion is Denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">Defendants also move to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the Oregon Unfair Trade Practices Act and the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act. Oregon\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act lists a number of practices proscribed by the statute; price fixing is not among them. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 646.608. Plaintiffs argue that their allegations should be covered by the \u201ccatch-all\u201d section that proscribes \u201cother unfair and deceptive trade practices.\u201d Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 646.608(u). That provision, however, is subject to the requirement that the state attorney general must first establish a rule stating that such practice is prohibited. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 646.608(4). Plaintiffs have pointed to no such rule established by the Oregon state attorney general. Accordingly, this claim must be dismissed. Similarly, West Virginia\u2019s statute lists a number of unfair and deceptive practices in trade or commerce; price fixing is not among them. W. Va.Code \u00a7 46A-6-102(7). These claims must be dismissed. Defendants\u2019 motion is Granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">Defendants contend that Rhode Island\u2019s unfair-competition statute has been interpreted to foreclose claims based on antitrust violations. The statute is instead targeted at deceptive trade practices that would deceive the customer into purchasing products. <em>ERI Max Entm\u2019t Inc. v. Streisand, </em>690 A.2d 1351, 1354 (R.I.1997). Moreover, Rhode Island does not permit state-law antitrust claims by indirect purchasers. <em>See Siena v. Microsoft Corp., </em>796 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>A.2d 461, 464-65 (R.I.2002). Accordingly, defendants\u2019 motion as to plaintiffs\u2019 claims under Rhode Island consumer-protection law is Granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">Finally, defendants contend that plaintiffs cannot plead the requirements of a claim under the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act, which prohibits unfair methods of competition and deceptive acts or practices in trade and commerce. The Maine Supreme Court has held that \u201c[i]n pricing cases under the Act the inquiry is whether the price has the effect of deceiving the consumer, or inducing her to purchase something that she would not otherwise purchase.\u201d <em>Tungate v. MacLean-Stevens Studios, Inc., </em>714 A.2d 792, 797 (Me.1998). Here, the <em>higher </em>prices plaintiffs allegedly paid for GPUs because of the price-fixing conspiracy could not have induced plaintiffs to purchase them. Arguing that higher prices induced consumers to make purchases simply does not make sense. Accordingly, defendants\u2019 motion as to this claim is Granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">3. Motion to Dismiss Complaints Against Amd.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">Defendant AMD moves to dismiss all claims against it. AMD acquired ATI on September 25, 2006.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> AMD argues that it cannot be held liable for ATI\u2019s conduct <em>before </em>the acquisition because it did not assume liability. AMD argues that it cannot be held liable for ATI\u2019s conduct <em>after </em>the acquisition because it is merely a shareholder, once or twice removed at that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">A. Liability for Behavior Before the Acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">Both direct and indirect purchasers allege that AMD assumed the prior and continuing liabilities of ATI once the acquisition closed. A purchaser of a company does not assume the seller\u2019s liabilities unless: (1) there is an express or implied agreement of assumption; (2) the transaction amounts to a merger or consolidation of the corporations; (3) the purchasing corporation is a mere continuation of the seller; or (4) the transfer of assets to the purchaser is for the fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for the seller\u2019s debts. <em>Ray v. Alad Corp., </em>19 Cal.3d 22, 28, 136 Cal.Rptr. 574, 560 P.2d 3 (1977). Plaintiffs allege that the first exception is present here \u2014 that by agreement AMD assumed ATI\u2019s existing liabilities pursuant to the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-15\">Trouble is, no agreement seems to assume any such liabilities. Plaintiffs assert that AMD\u2019s Form 10K for 2006 indicated that it has assumed all of ATI\u2019s liabilities. Plaintiffs only quote half of the statement. It actually stated \u201cas a result of [AMD\u2019s] acquisition of ATI, we have assumed responsibility for ATI\u2019s legal proceedings which include a securities litigation proceeding and a consumer class action\u201d (Lebsock Decl. Exh. 1, 35). The Form 10K also discussed tax-related liabilities and other legal proceedings related to the acquisition <em>{id. </em>at 56). Plaintiffs also point out that the Form 10K stated that \u201cwe may be subject to significant damage awards which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 45). \u201cWe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d were defined elsewhere in the Form 10K as \u201cAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries, including ATI and its subsidiaries\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 2). The Form 10K makes clear that it refers to those entities together, so these passages do not indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>that AMD assumed all of the liabilities for any action that might arise against ATI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">Although it is clear to the Court that the Form 10K is no admission of AMD\u2019s liability for an ATI antitrust conspiracy, this begs the question whether discovery into the acquisition would unearth an agreement to assume. At the hearing, moreover, counsel discussed the particulars of AMD\u2019s acquisition of ATI. An Alberta, Canada, unlimited liability corporation (ULC) acquired ATI\u2019s shares. They also stated that AMD Finance, an Alberta ULC, is the actual owner of ATI\u2019s shares, and that in turn, AMD, Inc., owns AMD Finance. The corporate organization of these entities is now unclear. Because of this uncertainty in the form of the acquisition, granting AMD\u2019s motion to dismiss is not appropriate at this time. Subject to the stay already in effect, discovery into the acquisition, and the entities involved, may be taken to determine the role of AMD Finance and whether AMD is a proper defendant. For now, however, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss any claims against AMD for conduct occurring before the acquisition is Denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">B. Liability for Behavior After the Acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">AMD contends that it cannot be held liable for actions after the acquisition because AMD is merely ATI\u2019s parent corporation. \u201cIt is a general principle of corporate law deeply ingrained in our economic and legal systems that a parent corporation (so-called because of control through ownership of another corporation\u2019s stock) is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries.\u201d <em>United States v. Bestfoods, </em>524 U.S. 51, 61, 118 S.Ct. 1876, 141 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). Plaintiffs, however, point out that ATI is actually organized under the laws of Canada. They allege that ATI is an unlimited liability corporation organized under the Alberta Business Corporations Act. For unlimited liability corporations, liability of shareholders for any liability, act, or default is unlimited in extent and joint and several in nature. R.S.A., c. B-9, \u00a7 15.2(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-8\">Plaintiffs allege that AMD is liable for ATI\u2019s actions after the acquisition because it participated in the conspiracy \u201cthrough its operation of ATI in the period following the acquisition\u201d (DPC \u00b6 2). Indirect plaintiffs allege that ATI became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of AMD after the acquisition, and that they have since \u201cpursued an integration plan\u201d to eliminate duplicative facilities between the two companies (IPC \u00b6\u00b6 40-41). As with liability before the acquisition, the corporate structure of AMD, AMD Finance, and ATI make it unclear whether AMD is a proper defendant. Accordingly, if and when the general stay of discovery is lifted, plaintiffs will be allowed to take discovery regarding the acquisition and the entities involved. If plaintiffs contend that AMD\u2019s own employees were co-conspirators with other non-AMD defendants, they should make this clear in any amended complaint. For now, AMD\u2019s motion to dismiss all claims against it is Denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-10\">To the extent stated above, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss direct purchasers\u2019 antitrust complaint is Granted. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss indirect purchasers\u2019 antitrust complaint is Granted. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding a nationwide class under California\u2019s Cartwright Act and unfair-competition laws are Stricken from the complaint. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 state-law consumer-protection claims is <em>Granted in Part and Denied in Part. </em>Defendant AMD\u2019s motion to dismiss claims against it is Denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-11\">Turning to the issue of discovery and leave to amend, direct and indirect purchasers may file motions to propound lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>ited discovery and for leave to amend (each limited to 25 pages). The motion should identify what plaintiffs intend to find through discovery and how their proposed amendments to the complaint will remedy the problems identified in this order. A copy of the proposed pleading should be appended to the motion, using italics or bold font to identify the new material. Please take nothing for granted and make the best case for a sustainable complaint. The motion should specify each additional fact that could be asserted even if discovery is <em>not </em>allowed and why such additional fact would make a difference. This additional information will be considered in deciding whether discovery will be permitted before having to replead. The motions should be filed no later than October 11, 2007. Defendants\u2019 joint opposition will be due no later than October 18, 2007. Defendants may file one joint opposition limited to 25 pages in response to the direct purchasers and one joint opposition limited to 25 pages in response to the indirect purchasers. This round of submissions will, in effect, serve as a dismissal motion as well as for the proposed pleadings, so the oppositions should include all Rule 12-type arguments. Plaintiffs\u2019 replies will be due no later than October 25, 2007. Each reply is limited to fifteen pages. The Court will then determine if a hearing is necessary. Please do not ask for extensions or page enlargements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1069-14\">. \"DPC\u201d refers to the direct purchasers\u2019 Second Consolidated and Amended Class Action Complaint. \"IPC\u201d refers to the indirect purchasers\u2019 First Consolidated Class Action Complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">.

They also alleged parallel conduct based on contract language, product design and product pricing. <em>Id. </em>at 51-53.

Moreover, defendants\u2019 behavior could simply be consistent with conscious parallelism.

In such situations, commentators have noted that \u201c[e]ach knows that expanding its sales or lowering its price will reduce the sales of rivals, who will notice that fact, identify the cause, and probably respond with a matching price reduction. Unless the actor can somehow conceal its price reduction or unless its own position is improved by a lower market price, it will hesitate to reduce prices at all.\u201d 6 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <em>Antitrust Law </em>\u00a7 1410b (2d ed.2000). As the Eleventh Circuit has stated, \"conscious parallelism is the practice of interdependent pricing in an oli-gopolistic market by competitor firms that realize that attempts to cut prices usually reduce revenue without increasing any firm\u2019s market share, but that simply price leadership in such a market can readily increase all competitors\u2019 revenues.\u201d <em>Williamson Oil Co. v. Philip Morris, </em>346 F.3d 1287, 1299 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). Such conscious parallelism may well be anticompetitive but it is not illegal. Here, plaintiffs have alleged that the GPU market is highly concentrated between ATI and Nvidia. Defendants simply may not have much of an incentive to cut prices or rush their new products to market.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">. Further clouding the standing issue is that not all plaintiffs or putative class members purchased their computers in the same way. Indirect purchasers plead that consumers often have the option of upgrading their graphics processor when purchasing a computer (IPC \u00b6\u00b6 50-52). Sometimes the GPU is a separate entry on the invoice. Even considering only plaintiffs who purchased computers, some of them decided to pay more for a computer with a faster GPU. Other plaintiffs may have merely purchased a computer from a retail store \"as is,\u201d accepting whatever features the manufacturer decided to provide. This has serious implications for the question of whether or not any overcharges were passed on to the consumer. In the first instance, the overcharge is more likely to have gone to the consumer because the GPU is a separately-invoiced, traceable part of the finished computer. In the second instance, the overcharge may have been absorbed by the manufacturer, the retailer, or at other steps in the distribution chain. The individual decisions that appear to go into purchasing a computer containing a GPU might cloud class certification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1087-10\">. Direct purchasers refer to the acquisition as a \"merger'' in their complaint (DPC \u00b6 19). They also refer to the same transaction as an \"acquisition\u201d <em>{ibid.). </em>At the hearing and in the briefs, however, all parties seem to agree that AMD acquired ATI and that no merger took place.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
