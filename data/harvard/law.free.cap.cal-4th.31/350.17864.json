Following a court trial, defendant was convicted of attempted murder. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 187.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court also found true that defendant intentionally discharged a firearm while committing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the offense (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.5, 12022.53, subds. (b), (c)), inflicted great bodily injury (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.7, 12022.53(d)), participated in a criminal street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (a)), and acted for the benefit of that gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)). The trial court sentenced defendant as follows: the midterm of seven years for attempted murder (\u00a7\u00a7 664, 187),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> plus a consecutive term of 10 years for the criminal street gang enhancement (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(C)), plus a consecutive term of 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement (\u00a7 12022.53(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The Court of Appeal, however, held that the trial court erred in imposing the 10-year enhancement under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1) (hereafter section 186.22(b)(1)) and modified the judgment. It struck the section 186.22(b)(1) enhancement and instead imposed the 15-year minimum parole eligibility date mandated by section 186.22(b)(5),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which applies when a defendant is convicted of \u201ca felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for life,\u201d and provides that the defendant \u201cshall not be paroled until a minimum of 15 calendar years have been served.\u201d The Court of Appeal reasoned that attempted murder was \u201ca felony punishable by imprisonment . . . for life,\u201d within the meaning of section 186.22(b)(5) because the underlying felony of attempted murder and the section 12022.53(d) firearm enhancement <em>together </em>resulted in a life term. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment as modified and directed the trial court to prepare an amended abstract of judgment that reflected the modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The Attorney General disagrees. He argues that section 186.22(b)(5) applies only where the underlying felony itself provides for a life sentence, ruling out any enhancement not included in the definition of the underlying felony. Under this view, the trial court correctly computed defendant\u2019s sentence. For the reasons stated below, we agree and reverse the Court of Appeal\u2019s modification of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">A. <em>The STEP Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Penal Code section 186.22(b)(5) is a provision that was added to the California Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act (STEP Act). (\u00a7 186.20 et seq.) The impetus behind the STEP Act, which was enacted in 1988, was the Legislature\u2019s recognition that \u201cCalifornia is in a state of crisis which has been caused by violent street gangs whose members threaten, terrorize, and commit a multitude of crimes against the peaceful citizens of their neighborhoods. These activities, both individually and collectively, present a clear and present danger to the public order and safety and are not constitutionally protected.\u201d (\u00a7 186.21.) The STEP Act\u2019s express purpose is \u201cto seek the eradication of criminal activity by street gangs . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">On March 7, 2000, the California electorate passed Proposition 21, which amended the STEP Act. As is relevant here, section 186.22(b)(1) now provides that, \u201cExcept as provided by paragraphs (4) and (5), any person who is convicted of a felony committed for the benefit of . . . any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members, shall, upon conviction of that felony, in addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed for the felony . . . , be punished as follows: [f] (A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), the person shall be punished by an additional term of two, three, or four years at the. court\u2019s discretion. [|] (B) If the felony is a serious felony, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7, the person shall be punished by an additional term of five years. H] (C) If the felony is a violent felony, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5, the person shall be punished by an additional term of 10 years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Additionally, Proposition 21 renumbered section 186.22, former subdivision (b)(4) as section 186.22(b)(5). Its substantive language was unchanged. Section 186.22(b)(5) provides: \u201cExcept as provided in paragraph (4), any person who violates this subdivision in the commission of a felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for life, shall not be paroled until a minimum of 15 calendar years have been served.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">B. <em>Court of Appeal Opinion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">The Court of Appeal first noted that a defendant is subject to the section 186.22(b)(5) alternate penalty provision when a court \u201cimposes a life term on a felony committed for the gang\u2019s benefit.\u201d \u201cThis raises the question,\u201d stated the Court of Appeal, \u201cwhether the phrase \u2018felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for life\u2019 in section 186.22(b)(5) means the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>felony in the abstract or the felony actually committed, including conduct that results in enhanced punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The Court of Appeal believed that because the \u201cLegislature did not specify that the felony be punishable by a \u2018base term\u2019 of imprisonment in the state prison for life, nor did it expressly include felonies punishable by life imprisonment as the result of an enhancement,\u201d the phrase \u201cfelony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for life\u201d was ambiguous. As such, \u201ccourts must construe the ambiguity in favor of the defendant, giving him the benefit of every reasonable doubt as to the true interpretation of words or the construction of the statute. [Citations.] This \u2018rule of lenity\u2019 is an appropriate \u2018tiebreaker\u2019 where there are equally plausible interpretations of law. [Citation.]\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeal, because it found \u201cno logical reason why a felony punishable by life imprisonment as a result of an enhancement should be treated differently [than a felony punishable by a \u2018base term\u2019 of imprisonment for life],\u201d struck the section 186.22(b)(1) enhancement and instead imposed the 15-year minimum eligible parole date of section 186.22(b)(5). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">C. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">As stated earlier, the STEP Act was enacted in 1988. At that time, the language that now appears in section 186.22(b)(5) was contained in section 186.22, subdivision (b)(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While current section 186.22(b)(5) has been renumbered several times since 1988, the section\u2019s substantive language has remained the same since 1988, through the voters\u2019 passage of Proposition 21.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n                   Where a voter initiative contains a provision that is identical to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>provision previously enacted by the Legislature, in the absence of an indication of a contrary intent, we infer that the voters intended the provision to have the same meaning as the provision drafted by the Legislature. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Trevino </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 237, 241 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 567, 27 P.3d 283] [\u201cSection 190.2 was enacted by voter initiative in 1978, but the language of its subdivision (a)(2) is identical to a provision that the Legislature enacted as part of the 1977 death penalty law. [Citation.] In the absence of anything suggesting the contrary, we infer that the voters who enacted section 190.2 intended subdivision (a)(2) to have the same meaning as the identically worded provision drafted by the Legislature.\u201d].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because there is no evidence of a contrary intent here, we infer that the voters intended section 186.22(b)(5) to have the same meaning as the identically worded provision drafted by the Legislature in 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Castenada </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 743, 746-747 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 906, 3 P.3d 278], we stated: \u201c \u2018In construing the relevant provisions of the STEP Act, as with any statute, we strive to ascertain and effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d \u201cWe begin by examining the words of the [statute]; if the statutory language is not ambiguous, then we presume the Legislature meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the language governs. [Citations.] If, however, the statutory language lacks clarity, we may resort to extrinsic sources, including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history. [Citation.] In such situations, we strive to select the construction that comports most closely with the Legislature\u2019s apparent intent, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the statute[\u2019s] general purposes. [Citation.] We will avoid any interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 577, 581 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 75, 59 P.3d 150] <em>(Walker).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">1. <em>Ambiguity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">It is unclear, focusing solely on the statutory language, whether the section 186.22(b)(5) phrase \u201ca felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>for life\u201d is limited to those crimes where the underlying felony itself provides for a term of life imprisonment, or whether section 186.22(b)(5) also includes the situation where a defendant is sentenced to a term of life imprisonment because the underlying felony and enhancement together result in a life term.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the statutory language lacks clarity, we strive to ascertain the meaning that most closely comports with the voters\u2019 intent. <em>(Walker, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 581).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">2. <em>Voters\u2019Intent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In 1988, when the predecessor to section 186.22(b)(5) was enacted, an enrolled bill report written by the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency analyzed the financial impact of the provision: \u201cThis proposed provision relating to life terms [former section 186.22, subdivision (b)(3), now section 186.22(b)(5)] would apply to all lifers (except life without possibility of parole). This would result in these lifers having their first parole hearing delayed, except for first degree murderers with a sentence of 25 years to life. Attachment A summarizes the offenses punishable by imprisonment for life and the current and proposed minimum eligible parole dates (MEPD). Those with a current MEPD of less than 15 years would serve additional time.\u201d (Cal. Youth and Adult Correctional Agency, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 2013 (1987-1988 Reg. Sess.) prepared for Governor Deukmejian (Sept. 1, 1988) p. 2.) Attachment A to that report, entitled \u201cSummary of Current and Proposed Minimum Eligible Parole Dates (MEPD) for Lifers\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>(Attachment A), listed nine felonies potentially impacted by the predecessor to section 186.22(b)(5).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In each felony listed in Attachment A, <em>the statute defining the felony itself </em>provided for a life term. Even those felonies in Attachment A that incorporate disparate elements (i.e., sections 667.51 and 667.7 [specified prior convictions] and section 12310 [exploding a device causing great bodily injury]), the life term is encased in the definition of the felony itself. No statute listed in Attachment A looked <em>beyond the language of the statute itself, </em>namely, to another section of the Penal Code, in order to provide for a life term.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The Court of Appeal in the present case looked to a <em>different </em>section of the Penal Code (section 12022.53(d)), not incorporated in the language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>the felony provision itself (attempted murder), in order to find that the felony provided for a life term. We decline to interpret the attempted murder statute in the manner suggested by the Court of Appeal because the enactment of a statute that provides for a term of life imprisonment is best left within the province of the Legislature. As we stated in <em>People v. Wims </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 293, 307 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 895 P.2d 77]: \u201cNor does [the dissent] explain why, if our Legislature intended a sentence enhancement to be \u2018part of the criminal offense to which it is attached\u2019 [citation], it did not simply say so.When the Legislature wishes to create a substantive offense having as one of its elements another substantive offense, it knows how to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that section 12022.53(d), the firearm enhancement at issue here, was enacted in 1997 as part of the \u201c10-20-Life\u201d bill (Assem. Bill No. 4 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.)), and thus predates Proposition 21 by more than two years. In that ensuing period leading up to Proposition 21, section 186.22(b)(5) was left intact by the Legislature and was left intact in Proposition 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">But section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4), which was also enacted as part of Proposition 21 and contains new language,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> provides that where a defendant commits a gang-related crime such as carjacking (\u00a7 215) or home invasion robbery (\u00a7 213, subd. (a)(1)(A)), he shall be \u201csentenced to an indeterminate term of life imprisonment with a minimum term of the indeterminate sentence calculated as the greater of: [][] (A) The term determined by the court pursuant to Section 1170 for the underlying conviction <em>including any enhancement </em>applicable under Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 1170) of Title 7 of Part 2.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Because Proposition 21 enacted section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4), a STEP Act provision that <em>combines </em>an underlying felony with an enhancement in order to establish a minimum term, it follows that section 186.22(b)(5) would have been written in the same manner if such was the intent of the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation of section 186.22(b)(5) is also contrary to the voters\u2019 intent when passing Proposition 21 to impose increased penalties on those who commit crimes to benefit a criminal street gang. In the \u201cFindings and Declarations\u201d section of Proposition 21, \u201c[t]he people [found] and declarefd]\u201d that: \u201cCriminal street gangs have become more violent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>bolder, and better organized in recent years.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 7, 2000) text of Prop. 21, \u00a7 2, subd. (b), p. 119.) \u201cGang-related crimes pose a unique threat to the public because of gang members\u2019 organization and solidarity. Gang-related felonies should result in severe penalties.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 2, subd. (h), p. 119.) \u201cDramatic changes are needed in the way we treat. . . criminal street gangs ... if we are to avoid the predicted, unprecedented surge in . . . gang violence.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 2, subd. (k), p. 119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Yet, if the Court of Appeal\u2019s construction of section 186.22(b)(5) were correct, the circumstance that a defendant committed a crime to benefit a criminal street gang would be meaningless in every case where the defendant committed a gang-related felony providing for a determinate term<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>and </em>was found in violation of the section 12022.53(d) firearm enhancement. This is so because the 15-year minimum eligible parole date set by section 186.22(b)(5) would not impact the defendant\u2019s sentence of 25 years to life under section 12022.53(d). We decline to thwart the will of the voters in such a manner.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed insofar as it struck the section 186.22(b)(1) enhancement and imposed the section 186.22(b)(5) alternate penalty provision. The Court of Appeal is directed to order the trial court to amend the abstract of judgment to reflect that defendant was convicted of attempted murder without premeditation. In all other respects, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">George, C.

(c)(8)), we are not persuaded. In this particular violent felony, like the felonies in Attachment A that incorporate disparate elements, the statute defining the felony provision itself contains the so-called enhancement. The Court of Appeal erred in the present case because it incorporated into the attempted murder statute a firearm enhancement that is not contained within the definition of the attempted murder statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b398-8\"> Current section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4) was added by Proposition 21. It provides in full: \u201cAny person who is convicted of a felony enumerated in this paragraph committed for the benefit of . . . any criminal street gang . . . shall, upon conviction of that felony, be sentenced to an indeterminate term of life imprisonment with a minimum term of the indeterminate sentence calculated as the greater of: [][] (A) The term determined by the court pursuant to Section 1170 for the underlying conviction, including any enhancement applicable under Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 1170) of Title 7 of Part 2 [of the Penal Code], or any period prescribed by Section 3046, if the felony is any of the offenses enumerated in subparagraphs (B) or (C) of this paragraph. [][] (B) Imprisonment in the state prison for 15 years if the felony is a home invasion robbery, in violation of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 213; carjacking, as defined in Section 215; a felony violation of Section 246; or a violation of section 12022.55. [f] (C) Imprisonment in the state prison for seven years, if the felony is extortion, as defined in Section 519; or threats to victims and witnesses, as defined in Section 136.1.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b399-6\"> As provided in section 12022.53, subdivisions (a) and (d), such gang-related felonies include, but are not limited to: attempted murder (\u00a7\u00a7 664/187), mayhem (\u00a7 203), kidnapping (\u00a7 207), robbery (\u00a7 211), assault with a firearm, semiautomatic firearm or machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter (\u00a7 245, subd. (d)(1)-(3)), rape (\u00a7 261), discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling or occupied motor vehicle (\u00a7 246), and discharging a firearm from an occupied motor vehicle (\u00a7 12034, subd. (d)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\"> We are mindful that there is a conflict in the Courts of Appeal on the proper application of section 186.22(b)(5) when the underlying felony itself provides for a term of 15 years to life, 25 years to life, or life without the possibility of parole. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Harper </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 520 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 120], and compare, e.g., <em>People v. Ortiz </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 480, 485-486 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 126] with <em>People v. Herrera </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1364-1365 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 793]; but see Justice Grignon\u2019s dissent as to this portion of the <em>Herrera </em>majority opinion, <em>id. </em>at pp. 1368-1370 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Grignon, J.).) As that issue is not before us, we express no opinion on the matter. We do recognize, however, that section 186.22(b)(5) was enacted in 1988 to ensure that a defendant who committed a gang-related felony providing for a life term would not be eligible for parole until at least 15 calendar years elapsed. While newer and more powerful sentencing laws, such as section 190, have sapped the strength of section 186.22(b)(5), section 186.22(b)(5) still has vitality where the defendant is convicted of attempted murder with premeditation. In this situation, section 186.22(b)(5) raises the seven-year minimum eligible parole date (see \u00a7 3046, subd. (a)) to a 15-year minimum eligible parole date. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Villegas </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1228-1229 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">At oral argument, the Attorney General cited <em>Villegas </em>for the proposition that defendant\u2019s gang-related attempted premeditated murder sentence under section 186.22(b)(5) is properly characterized as a 15-year-to-life sentence that could be added to the 25-year-to-life-sentence for the section 12022.53(d) violation, resulting in a sentence of 40 years to life. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Villegas, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1228-1229.) The question of whether such a characterization is appropriate is not before us and we express no opinion on the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
