California\u2019s Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVPA or Act; Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does not use that precise language in defining who is eligible for involuntary civil commitment as a sexually violent predator.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">In September 2001, before <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, was decided, defendant was committed under the SVPA by a jury that received instructions in the statutory language. However, the jury was not separately and specifically instructed on the need to find serious difficulty in controlling behavior. Defendant claims a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d instruction was constitutionally necessary under <em>Kansas v. Crane.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">The Court of Appeal correctly rejected this contention.  By its express terms, the SVPA limits persons eligible for commitment to those few who have already been convicted of violent sexual offenses against multiple victims (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a)(1)), and who have \u201c diagnosed mental disorder[s]\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>\u201caffecting the emotional or volitional capacity\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (c)) that \u201cpredisposeQ [them] to the commission of criminal sexual acts in a degree constituting [them] menace[s] to the health and safety of others\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>such that they are \u201clikely [to] engage in sexually violent criminal behavior\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (a)(1)). This language inherently encompasses and conveys to a fact finder the requirement of a mental disorder that causes serious difficulty in controlling one\u2019s criminal sexual behavior. The SVPA\u2019s plain words thus suffice \u201cto distinguish the dangerous sexual offender whose serious mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>illness, abnormality, or disorder subjects him to civil commitment from the dangerous but typical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal case.\u201d <em>(Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, 413.) Several other state courts have reached the same result when considering the effect of <em>Kansas v. Crane </em>on statutes similar to the SVPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Moreover, even if instructional error had occurred, the Court of Appeal properly found no prejudice. On the evidence presented at defendant\u2019s trial, no rational jury could have failed to find he harbored a mental disorder that made it seriously difficult for him to control his violent sexual impulses. Hence, the absence of a \u201ccontrol\u201d instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\"><em>In </em>January 1981, and again in June 1981, defendant forcibly raped separate victims. In the first 1981 incident, defendant masturbated in front of a woman in a laundromat. He then grabbed her, and, as she attempted to flee, she fell. Defendant recaptured her, dragged her to a nearby park, and began to rape her. When police arrived, the rape was still in progress, and they had to physically remove defendant from on top of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">In the second 1981 incident, defendant, who was sitting behind a woman at a stadium concert, began touching and harassing her. When she got up to use the restroom, he followed her and dragged her into a men\u2019s room that was posted with an \u201cout of order\u201d sign. The victim said she needed to take medicine and asked if she could get into her purse, hoping to retrieve a knife to defend herself. Defendant replied, \u201cNo, bitch. I am no fool.\u201d He then threw her down, beat her with his fists, tore off her clothes, forced her to orally copulate him, and raped her. Defendant was convicted of two counts of rape and sentenced to state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">He was paroled in early 1987. In June 1987, while still on parole, he gained entry to a home near where he was staying by telling the female resident that he needed to use her telephone to get help with his disabled vehicle. When she left the living room to allow him to make the call in private, he followed her into her bedroom. He told her he had been watching her and announced his intentions. When she tried to scream and fight him off, he slapped her. He threw her down on the bed, spread her legs with his hand, removed her clothing, and raped her. When he was finished, she persuaded him to leave and called the police. Before they arrived, he returned to her residence two more times to attempt to retrieve his eyeglasses. Defendant was convicted of burglary, sexual battery, and three counts of rape. He was again sentenced to state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>During both his prison terms, defendant engaged in acts of sexual misconduct. While serving his first term, he exposed himself to female prison staff. During his second term, he openly masturbated in the prison library and exposed himself in groups where females were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">In June 1999, as defendant approached the parole date for his second term, the San Bernardino County District Attorney filed a petition alleging that he was a sexually violent predator. In December 1999, while confined at Atascadero State Hospital awaiting his SVPA trial, defendant exposed himself and masturbated publicly in the patient dining room.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">At the trial in September 2001, the prosecution called as expert witnesses Dr. Dennis Sheppard and Dr. Kent Franks, both licensed psychologists. Both witnesses reviewed documents detailing defendant\u2019s past crimes, as well as his clinical records. After being informed of his right to do so, defendant had declined to be interviewed by Dr. Sheppard. Defendant had spoken at some length on one occasion with Dr. Franks, but he refused to answer specific questions and declined a second interview. Based on the available information, both experts testified that defendant met the criteria for commitment under the SVPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Among other things, Dr. Sheppard testified as follows: Defendant suffers from \u201cparaphilia, not otherwise specified\u201d (paraphilia NOS)\u2014a mental disorder characterized by intense and recurrent fantasies, urges, and behaviors about sex with nonconsenting persons, which symptoms persist for six months or more and cause significant dysfunction or personal distress. Paraphilic rape is \u201cthat obsessive driven rape uncontrollable for the most part that [persons with this disorder]\u2014you know, feel driven to commit.\u201d The single-minded determination with which defendant repeatedly pursued the consummation of his desire for nonconsensual sex, regardless of circumstances or surroundings, is evidence of defendant\u2019s paraphilia,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as are his persistent episodes of public exposure and masturbation in confinement. Another important factor is defendant\u2019s own acknowledgement of his sexual pathology, \u201csimilar to, you know, T feel like a fish on a hook and I don\u2019t have control.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Dr. Sheppard explained that paraphilia is a chronic, incurable disorder, though patients can be helped to control their sexually deviant behaviors. However, said Dr. Sheppard, defendant\u2019s emotional or volitional control is further impaired by the fact that he also suffers from a delusional disorder known as \u201cpsychosis, not otherwise specified\u201d (psychosis NOS). According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Dr. Sheppard, this condition increases his impulsivity and makes him less likely <em>to </em>appreciate the reality of the situation. In Dr. Sheppard\u2019s view, defendant\u2019s disorders predispose him to sexually violent criminal behavior, as evidenced by his repeated misconduct of this nature and the fact that \u201ceven in a controlled setting [he] continues to sexually act out in about the only way he can.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">When asked to explain his understanding of the SVPA\u2019s legal standard for a diagnosable mental disorder, Dr. Sheppard said he thought that by encompassing both congenital and acquired conditions, and both emotional and volitional impairments, the law meant \u201cto indicate that, you know, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you got this disorder from biology or whether you learned it. And that ... the disorder impairs your emotional or volitional control and that because of that mental disorder that impairs those, that you are likely to commit sexually violent acts.\u201d Asked to assess defendant\u2019s overall risk of reoffense, Dr. Sheppard opined that \u201che has a high likelihood of reoffending\u201d if released without treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Dr. Franks also diagnosed defendant with paraphilia NOS and psychosis NOS, and he agreed with Dr. Sheppard that defendant\u2019s rapes were of the paraphilic type. Dr. Franks further concluded that defendant suffers from polysubstance abuse\u2014i.e., drug and alcohol dependence\u2014and severe \u201cpersonality disorder, not otherwise specified,\u201d with paranoid and antisocial features. According to Dr. Franks, defendant does not \u201chave very good control over his impulses or his emotions in general because he suffers from a mental illness,\u201d and his drug and alcohol dependence exacerbates the problem by further reducing inhibitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Assessing the \u201cdynamic\u201d factors affecting defendant\u2019s risk of reoffense (i.e., those environmental and psychological factors that could be expected to influence future behavior), Dr. Franks said \u201cthe most significant is [that] he has very poor control over his impulses and . . . very poor control over his emotional functioning,\u201d as particularly demonstrated by his sexual exhibitionism while confined. As Dr. Franks recounted, \u201cThe records from the prison indicate he was cited five times for exposing himself, and I counted six instances in three months at Atascadero of indecent exposure. That doesn\u2019t count other instances where he cut the crotch of his shorts out so that his penis was exposed. To me that\u2019s suggesting incredibly poor impulse control. That\u2019s a risk factor.\u201d In sum, Dr. Franks concluded that defendant \u201cis at really high risk. There is basically no doubt [that] without supervision and treatment he would reoffend.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>The jury was instructed in the language of the SVPA, pursuant to a modified version of CALJIC No. 4.19. This instruction explained that a sexually violent predator is one who, inter alia, \u201chas a currently diagnosed mental disorder that makes him a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior,\u201d and that a \u201c \u2018[djiagnosed mental disorder\u2019 includes a congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to the commission of criminal sexual acts in a degree constituting the person a menace to the health and safety of others.\u201d Defendant requested, and was refused, an additional instruction that \u201cthe diagnosed mental disorder must render the person <em>unable to control </em>his dangerous behavior.\u201d (Italics added.) The jury found him to be a sexually violent predator, and he was committed to the custody of the Department of Mental Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Defendant appealed, asserting prejudicial error in the trial court\u2019s failure to give his \u201cunable to control\u201d instruction. While the matter was pending in the Court of Appeal, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407. That decision held that the mental abnormality or personality disorder necessary for involuntary civil commitment of dangerously disordered sex offenders does not require <em>\u201ctotal </em>or <em>complete </em>lack of [behavioral] control\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 411, italics in original), but there must be \u201cproof of <em>serious difficulty </em>in controlling behavior\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 413, italics added). Defendant filed a supplemental brief, arguing that <em>Kansas v. Crane </em>required a \u201cserious difficulty\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Thereafter, the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment. The Court of Appeal reasoned as follows: Defendant\u2019s requested instruction, which would have required a finding he was \u201cunable\u201d to control his behavior, was incorrect under <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407. To the extent <em>Kansas v. Crane </em>nonetheless requires \u201cserious difficulty\u201d in controlling behavior, that standard is inherently encompassed and subsumed by the SVPA\u2019s definitions of \u201csexually violent predator\u201d and \u201cdiagnosed mental disorder.\u201d Thus, no additional \u201ccontrol\u201d instruction was needed. Even if instructional error occurred, defendant suffered no prejudice. Given the \u201cstrong, and essentially uncontested, evidence of defendant\u2019s lack of control over his sexual behavior,\u201d no rational fact finder would have reached a more favorable result had his requested instruction been given. Hence, any error in refusing the instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">We granted review. We will affirm the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">As in the Court of Appeal, defendant argues that his SVPA commitment is invalid under <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, because the statute\u2019s literal language fails to express the federal constitutional requirement of proof of a mental disorder that causes \u201cserious difficulty in controlling behavior\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 413), and the jury was not specifically instructed on the need to find such impairment of control. For reasons we now explain, we reject this contention.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The SVPA, enacted in 1996 (Stats. 1995, ch. 763, \u00a7 3) and thereafter amended, permits the involuntary civil commitment or recommitment, for two-year terms of confinement and treatment, of persons who are found, in jury trials (\u00a7 6604), and beyond a reasonable doubt (\u00a7 6603, subd. (a)), to be \u201csexually violent predator[s]\u201d (\u00a7 6604). The Act defines a sexually violent predator as one \u201cwho has been convicted of a sexually violent offense against two or more victims and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a)(1).) A \u201c \u2018[d]iagnosed mental disorder\u2019 includes a congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to the commission of criminal sexual acts in a degree constituting the person a menace to the health and safety of others.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The year after the SVPA was adopted, the United States Supreme Court considered whether the definition of \u201cmental abnormality\u201d in Kansas\u2019s sexually violent predator act satisfied substantive due process requirements for the involuntary civil commitment of dangerously disordered persons. The court ruled that this definition\u2014which closely paralleled California\u2019s definition of \u201cdiagnosed mental disorder\u201d\u2014was constitutionally valid. <em>(Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks </em>(1997) 521 U.S. 346 [138 L.Ed.2d 501, 117 S.Ct. 2072] <em>(Hendricks).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>As the <em>Hendricks </em>court explained, Kansas had adopted its statute to deal with a \u201c \u2018small but extremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators . . . who do not have a mental disease or defect that renders them appropriate for involuntary treatment pursuant to the [general involuntary civil commitment statute], [but instead] generally have anti-social personality features which are unamenable to existing mental illness treatment modalities\u2019 \u201d and which make them highly likely to engage in repeated acts of predatory sexual violence. <em>(Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, 351, quoting Kan. Stat. Ann., \u00a7 59-29a01.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Accordingly, the Kansas law provided for the involuntary civil commitment of certain persons who had been convicted of, or charged with, sexually violent offenses, \u201c \u2018and who suffered] from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which [made] [them] likely to engage in . . . predatory acts of sexual violence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, 352, quoting Kan. Stat. Ann., \u00a7 59-29a02(a).) A \u201c \u2018mental abnormality\u2019 \u201d was defined as a \u201c \u2018congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity which predisposes the person to commit sexually violent offenses in a degree constituting such person a menace to the health and safety of others.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hendricks, </em>at p. 352, quoting Kan. Stat. Ann., \u00a7 59-29a02(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The constitutional challenge arose in the case of Leroy Hendricks, a lifelong sexual offender who admitted that when he \u201c \u2018[got] stressed out,\u2019 he \u2018[could not] control the urge\u2019 to molest children.\u201d <em>(Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, 355.) Near the conclusion of his latest prison term, on a conviction for \u201ctaking indecent liberties\u201d with two adolescent boys, the state petitioned to confine him civilly as a sexually violent predator. In a jury trial, his extensive history of criminal sexual conduct was detailed. A state doctor testified, and Hendricks agreed, that he suffered from incurable pedophilia. The jury unanimously found he was a sexually violent predator. After determining that pedophilia satisfied the statutory definition of a \u201cmental abnormality,\u201d the trial court ordered his commitment. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 355-356.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The Kansas Supreme Court reversed. It held that substantive due process permits involuntary civil commitment only of a person proven, by clear and convincing evidence, to be both (1) mentally ill and (2) a danger to himself and others. The Kansas statute\u2019s definition of \u201cmental abnormality,\u201d the state high court concluded, did not satisfy the necessary \u201cmental illness\u201d component of an involuntary civil commitment. <em>(Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, 356.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">The United States Supreme Court disagreed. As it explained, \u201c. . . States have in certain narrow circumstances provided for the forcible civil detainment of people who are unable to control their behavior and who thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>pose a danger to the public health and safety. [Citations.] We have consistently upheld such involuntary commitment statutes provided the confinement takes place pursuant to proper procedures and evidentiary standards. [Citations.]\u201d (Hen<em>dricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, 357.)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The court noted: \u201cWe have sustained civil commitment statutes when they have coupled proof of dangerousness with the proof of some additional factor, such as a \u2018mental illness\u2019 or \u2018mental abnormality.\u2019 [Citations.] These added statutory requirements serve to limit involuntary civil commitment to those who suffer from a volitional impairment rendering them dangerous beyond their control. The Kansas Act <em>is plainly of a kind </em>with these other civil commitment statutes: It requires a finding of future dangerousness, and then links that finding to the existence of a \u2018mental abnormality\u2019 or \u2018personality disorder\u2019 <em>that makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the person to control his dangerous behavior. </em>[Citation.] The precommitment requirement of a \u2018mental abnormality\u2019 or \u2018personality disorder\u2019 is consistent with the requirements of these other statutes that we have upheld in that it narrows the class of persons eligible for confinement to those who are unable to control their dangerousness.\u201d <em>(Hendricks, </em>supra, 521 U.S. 346, 358, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Hendricks argued that \u201cmental abnormality\u201d was simply a phrase coined by the Kansas Legislature, not a clinically recognized form of mental illness. However, the high court admonished, \u201cthe term \u2018mental illness\u2019 is devoid of any talismanic significance. Not only do \u2018psychiatrists disagree widely and frequently on what constitutes mental illness,\u2019 [citation], but the Court itself has used a variety of expressions to describe the mental condition of those properly subject to civil confinement. [Citations.] [][] Indeed, we have never required state legislatures to adopt any particular nomenclature in drafting civil commitment statutes. Rather, we have traditionally left to legislators the task of defining terms of a medical nature that have legal significance. [Citations.] As a consequence, the States have, over the years, developed numerous specialized terms to define mental health concepts. Often, these definitions do not fit precisely with the definitions employed by the medical community.\u201d <em>(Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, 359.)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The Kansas statute, the court noted, set forth \u201ccriteria relating to an individual\u2019s inability to control his dangerousness\u201d that were comparable to other civil commitment laws the court had upheld. <em>(Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, 360.) Moreover, the court observed, Hendricks himself amply met these criteria; he had been diagnosed with pedophilia, \u201ca condition the psychiatric profession itself classifies as a serious mental disorder,\u201d and he admitted he could not control his urge to molest children. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThis admitted lack of volitional control, coupled with a prediction of future dangerousness, adequately distinguishes Hendricks from other dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>persons who are perhaps more properly dealt with exclusively through criminal proceedings.\u201d Due process standards for his commitment, said the court, therefore were satisfied. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Accordingly, the judgment of the Kansas Supreme Court was reversed. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 371.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">In <em>Hubbart, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1138, we addressed similar issues in connection with California\u2019s SVPA. Christopher Hubbart had been convicted in 1973, and again in 1982, of felonies arising from sexual assaults against women who were strangers to him. His pattern in these crimes was to break into homes in the early morning hours, bind the sole female occupants, place pillowcases over their heads, and commit forcible sex acts. In more recent incidents, he had administered an enema to the victim, or otherwise cleaned the victim\u2019s rectal cavity.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">After the 1973 conviction, Hubbart was committed to Atascadero State Hospital as a mentally disordered sex offender. There he received intensive therapy, including treatment for his sexually deviant behavior. He was released as an outpatient in 1979, but readmitted in 1981 when he began reoffending. In 1990, while on parole after his second conviction, he assaulted a female jogger. He was convicted of false imprisonment and returned to prison. As Hubbart\u2019s parole release date approached, an SVPA petition was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">At Hubbart\u2019s commitment trial, psychologists diagnosed him with severe paraphilia NOS, characterized by such features as rape, bondage, sodomy, and klismaphilia (arousal by administration of enemas). They said the condition had persisted for over 20 years\u2014Hubbart\u2019s entire adult life\u2014and was accompanied by significant disruption in other areas of social functioning. Hubbart\u2019s risk of reoffense was high, the experts opined, as evidenced by the number and frequency of his violent sexual assaults committed during brief periods of freedom, a lack of insight into his problem, including means of controlling precipitating stress, and an inability to empathize with his victims. He was committed as a sexually violent predator.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">On appeal, Hubbart mounted multiple constitutional attacks on the SVPA, including a claim that the statute violated \u201csubstantive due process\u201d guarantees of the state and federal Constitutions. In his substantive due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>attack, he urged that the SVPA\u2019s definition of a \u201cdiagnosed mental disorder\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (c)) is impermissibly broad, because it is not limited to true \u201c \u2018mental illness,\u2019 \u201d i.e., \u201c \u2018serious cognitive, perceptual or affective dysfunction,\u2019 \u201d but extends to \u201cmental disorders characterized primarily by an inability to control sexually violent impulses and behavior.\u201d <em>(Hubbart, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1138, 1152 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 492, 969 P.2d 584].)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">We rejected this argument. Adhering closely to the reasoning of <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, we explained that \u201ccivil commitment is permissible as long as the triggering condition consists of \u2018a volitional impairment rendering [the person] dangerous beyond their control.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Hubbart, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1138, 1156.) However, we noted, \u201c[t]he [Hendricks] court made clear that due process does not dictate the precise manner in which this \u2018volitional impairment\u2019 is statutorily described.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Indeed, we stressed, <em>\u201cHendricks </em>emphasized the importance of deferring to the legislative branch in an area which is analytically nuanced and dependent upon medical science.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Turning to the SVPA itself, we observed that, aside from \u201cnonsubstantive differences in grammar,\u201d our statute \u201ctracks the Kansas scheme verbatim in describing the [required] mental disorder as a \u2018congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to the commission of criminal sexual acts in a degree constituting the person a menace to the health and safety of others.\u2019 [Citation.] <em>Through this language, the Act targets sexual offenders who suffer from a diagnosed \u2018volitional impairment\u2019 making them \u2018dangerous beyond their control.\u2019 (Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, 358.)\u201d <em>(Hubbart, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1138, 1157, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Moreover, <em>Hubbart </em>emphasized, \u201c[t]he SVPA also establishes the requisite connection between impaired volitional control and the danger posed to the public. Much like the Kansas law at issue in <em>Hendricks, </em>our statute defines [a sexually violent predator] as a person who has committed sexually violent crimes and who currently suffers from \u2018a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u2019 [Citation.] Through this language, the SVPA plainly requires a finding of dangerousness. <em>The statute then \u2018links that finding\u2019 to a currently diagnosed mental disorder characterized by the inability to control dangerous sexual behavior. (Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, 358.) This formula permissibly circumscribes the class of persons eligible for commitment under the Act.\u201d <em>(Hubbart, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1138, 1158, fn. omitted, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">Neither <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, nor <em>Hubbart, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1138, suggested that <em>new </em>elements or requirements, absent from the literal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>statutory language, were being <em>read into </em>these schemes as a condition of their constitutionality. (Cf. <em>In re Crane </em>(2000) 269 Kan. 578 [7 P.3d 285, 290].) On the contrary, the core holding of each of these cases was that (1) when drafting involuntary civil confinement laws, states have considerable leeway in describing and defining the necessary link between a control-impairing disorder and a prediction of future dangerousness, and (2) the particular language chosen for inclusion in the statutes under consideration\u2014Kansas\u2019s in the case of <em>Hendricks, </em>and California\u2019s in the case of Hubbart\u2014satisfied this basic due process requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">In other words, these decisions emphasized, the <em>words </em>used by the Kansas and California laws themselves <em>inherently and adequately convey </em>the crucial class-restricting elements of future dangerousness linked to a disorder-related inability to control behavior. It necessarily follows that, if supported by substantial evidence, any finding of eligibility for commitment under these statutes, when made pursuant to <em>the statutory language itself, </em>also meets constitutional standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The recent, narrow decision in <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, dictates no different result. There, the United States Supreme Court revisited, for limited purposes, the Kansas law it had upheld in <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The case involved Michael Crane, who, within 30 minutes on the same day in January 1993, exposed himself to a tanning salon attendant and committed an aggravated sexual battery on a video store clerk. After his felony conviction for the latter incident, the state sought to commit him as a sexually violent predator.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The experts at Crane\u2019s commitment trial indicated he suffered from antisocial personality disorder, with <em>some </em>difficulty in controlling sexual impulses. The jury was instructed in the words of the Kansas statute (1) that commitment as a sexually violent predator could be based on a \u201c \u2018mental abnormality <em>or </em>personality disorder\u2019 \u201d (italics added) which made it likely the person would reoffend, and (2) that a \u201c \u2018mental abnormality\u2019 \u201d was a \u201c \u2018condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity\u2019 \u201d that predisposed the person to commit sexually violent offenses to a degree that endangered the health and safety of others. <em>(In re Crane, supra, </em>7 P.3d 285, 288.) The jury further heard that a \u201c \u2018personality disorder\u2019 <em>\u201d\u2014undefined in the </em>statute\u2014 included an \u201c \u2018antisocial personality disorder.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Crane was found eligible for commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Crane appealed, arguing, among other things, that there had been no sufficient determination of his inability to control his behavior. The Kansas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Supreme Court understood Crane\u2019s contention in this regard to be that \u201cthe [United States] Supreme Court [in <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346] read a volitional impairment requirement <em>into </em>the [Kansas] Act as a <em>condition </em>of its constitutionality.\u201d <em>(In re Crane, supra, </em>7 P.3d 285, 290, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Inexplicably, the Kansas court accepted this view of <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, concluding that <em>Hendricks </em>had <em>not </em>endorsed the statute\u2019s <em>literal language </em>as constitutionally satisfactory. <em>(In re Crane, supra, </em>7 P.3d 285, 290.) Thus freed to decide that issue for itself, the court concluded that the plain language of the Kansas statute <em>did not </em>presuppose a finding of impaired control, but actually implied otherwise. The court first noted that the statute\u2019s definition of a committable \u201cmental abnormality\u201d could involve an impairment of <em>either </em>\u201cemotional\u201d <em>or </em>\u201cvolitional\u201d capacity, thus suggesting that the \u201cemotional\u201d prong did not involve helplessness to control behavior. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Moreover, the court observed, the Kansas statute allowed commitment on the basis of a \u201cpersonality disorder,\u201d a vague condition which (1) had no precise clinical parameters, (2) was not statutorily defined to require <em>any </em>impairment, emotional <em>or </em>volitional, and (3) according to one expert\u2019s deposition testimony, was shared by 75 percent of the prison population. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The Kansas court concluded that because the Kansas statute\u2019s words did not themselves convey a requirement of inability to control behavior, the constitutional necessity for such a finding must therefore be expressed in further instructions. Accordingly, the court held, failure to instruct Crane\u2019s jury specifically on the need for lack of control was error. The court therefore reversed Crane\u2019s commitment and remanded for a new trial under proper instructions. <em>(In re Crane, supra, 7 </em>P.3d 285, 290.)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">On narrow grounds, the United States Supreme Court <em>overturned </em>the Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s decision. The high court interpreted the Kansas court as holding \u201cthat <em>Hendricks[, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346] insists upon \u2018a finding that the defendant <em>cannot </em>control his dangerous behavior\u2019\u2014even if (as provided by Kansas law) problems of \u2018emotional capacity\u2019 and not \u2018volitional capacity\u2019 prove the \u2018source of bad behavior\u2019 warranting commitment. [Citations.] And the trial court had made no such finding.\u201d <em>(Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, 411, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">In deeming this a misreading of <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, did not directly confront the Kansas court\u2019s holding, contrary to <em>Hendricks\u2019s </em>clear implication, that the Kansas statute could be applied constitutionally only if supplemented by special instructions on the issue of behavioral control. On the contrary, the <em>Kansas v. Crane </em>opinion <em>assumed the validity </em>of Hendricks\u2019s core conclusion that, in this respect, the Kansas statute met constitutional requirements <em>as written.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Thus, at the outset, <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, acknowledged that in <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, the court had upheld the Kansas statute against constitutional challenge. This, <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane </em>noted, was because \u201cthe <em>statutory criterion </em>for confinement <em>embodied in the statute\u2019s words </em>\u2018mental abnormality or personality disorder\u2019 <em>satisfied </em>\u2018 \u201csubstantive\u201d due process requirements.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>at p. 409, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">As <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, further explained, <em>Hendricks </em>had found \u201cthat the Kansas \u2018Act <em>unambiguously </em>requires a finding of dangerousness either to one\u2019s self or to others,\u2019 [citation], and then \u2018links that finding to the existence of a \u201cmental abnormality\u201d or \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d <em>that makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the person to control his dangerous behavior,\u2019 </em>[citation]. And the Court [in Hendricks] ultimately determined that the statute\u2019s \u2018requirement of a \u201cmental abnormality\u201d or \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d is consistent with the requirement of . . . other statutes that we have upheld <em>in that it narrows the class of persons eligible for confinement to those who are unable to control their dangerousness.\u2019 \u201d (Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>at p. 410, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\"><em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, also reiterated why <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, had dismissed arguments that the Kansas statute\u2019s terms \u201cmental abnormality\u201d and \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d failed to describe a form of \u201cmental illness\u201d constitutionally necessary for civil commitment. In this regard, said <em>Kansas v. Crane, </em>\u201cthe Court [in Hendricks] pointed out that we \u2018have traditionally left to legislators the task of defining [such] terms.\u2019 [Citation.] [The <em>Hendricks </em>court] then held that, to \u2018the extent that the civil commitment statutes we have considered set forth criteria relating to an individual\u2019s inability to control his dangerousness, <em>the Kansas Act sets forth comparable criteria.\u2019 </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>at p. 410, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Nothing in <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, suggests that these clear earlier rulings were subject to fundamental review or revision. Instead, said the <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane </em>court, the question now presented was simply whether \u201cthe Kansas Supreme Court [had] interpreted our decision in <em>Hendricks[, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346] in an overly restrictive manner\u201d <em>(Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane, supra, </em>at p. 409) by \u201crequiring the State <em>always </em>to prove that a dangerous individual is <em>completely </em>unable to control his behavior\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 411).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">The court quickly dismissed such an interpretation of <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, holding that the earlier decision set forth \u201cno requirement of <em>total </em>or <em>complete </em>lack of control.\u201d <em>(Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, 411.) <em>Hendricks, </em>the court explained, <em>\u201creferred to the Kansas Act as requiring </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>a \u2018mental abnormality\u2019 or \u2018personality disorder\u2019 that makes it <em>\u2018difficult, </em>if not impossible, for the [dangerous] person to control his dangerous behavior.\u2019 [Citation.] The word \u2018difficult\u2019 indicates that the lack of control to which this Court referred was not absolute.\u201d <em>(Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>at p. 411, first italics added.) Such an extreme approach would be \u201cunworkable,\u201d said the court, given the fine line between \u201c \u2018an irresistible impulse and an impulse not resisted,\u2019 \u201d and considering that \u201cmost severely ill people\u2014even those commonly termed \u2018psychopaths\u2019\u2014retain some ability to control their behavior. [Citations.] [Thus,] [insistence upon absolute lack of control would risk barring the civil commitment of highly dangerous persons suffering severe mental abnormalities.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 411-412.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">On the other hand, the high court noted, the State of Kansas contended that \u201cthe Constitution permits commitment of the type of dangerous sexual offender considered in <em>Hendricks[, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346] without <em>any </em>lack-of-control determination.\u201d <em>(Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, 412.) If Kansas\u2019s argument was an invitation to the court to conclude, contrary to <em>Hendricks, </em>that impairment of control had <em>no relevance </em>to a constitutional civil commitment scheme, it did not succeed. The court declined to retreat from this portion of <em>Hendricks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">As it had in <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, 360, the court indicated that if individuals could be civilly confined as dangerous without <em>any </em>disorder-related difficulty in controlling their dangerous behavior, there would be no adequate distinction from the general run of dangerous persons who are subject exclusively to the criminal law. <em>(Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, 412.) Indeed, the court remarked, in <em>Hendricks </em>itself, the offender\u2019s diagnosed paraphilia, deemed a serious mental illness by the psychiatric profession, and his admitted inability to control his urges, ensured that the Kansas statute had been applied properly there. <em>(Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>at pp. 410, 412-413.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">But the court made clear that the references in <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, to \u201clack of control\u201d did not ascribe to that term \u201ca particularly narrow or technical meaning. And we recognize that in cases where lack of control is at issue, \u2018inability to control behavior\u2019 will not be demonstrable with mathematical precision. It is enough to say that there must be proof of <em>serious difficulty </em>in controlling behavior.\u201d <em>(Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, 413, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">The court acknowledged that this was not an exact standard, but asserted that constitutional safeguards are not always best enforced through rigid bright-line rules. In particular, the court explained, \u201cthe States retain considerable leeway in defining the mental abnormalities and personality disorders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>that make an individual eligible for commitment. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, 413.) Moreover, \u201cthe science of psychiatry, which informs but does not control ultimate legal determinations, is an ever-advancing science, whose distinctions do not seek precisely to mirror those of the law. [Citations.] Consequently, we have sought to provide constitutional guidance in this area by proceeding <em>deliberately and contextually, </em>elaborating generally stated constitutional standards and objectives as specific circumstances require. <em>Hendricks[, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346] embodied that approach.\u201d <em>(Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. at pp. 413-414, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The State of Kansas also argued that its high court should not have interpreted <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, to \u201cabsolutely forbid[]\u201d the commitment of dangerous persons who suffer only \u201cemotional,\u201d but not \u201cvolitional\u201d impairments. The United States Supreme Court agreed that <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, had not discussed emotional impairments, since the disorder at issue there was not of that kind. <em>(Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, 414-415.) The court noted that \u201cwe likewise have no occasion\u201d in Crane\u2019s case to \u201cconsider whether confinement based solely on \u2018emotional\u2019 abnormality would be constitutional.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, the court indicated its reluctance to eliminate primarily emotional difficulties as a basis for the commitment of dangerously disordered persons. It said that \u201c[h]ere, as in other areas of psychiatry, there may be \u2018considerable overlap between a . . . defective understanding or appreciation and . . . [an] inability to control . . . behavior.\u2019 [Citation.] Nor, when considering civil commitment, have we ordinarily distinguished for constitutional purposes among volitional, emotional, and cognitive impairments. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">As its disposition, the court simply vacated the Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s judgment and \u201cremanded [the case] for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\u201d <em>(Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, 415.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Thus, in essence, <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, (1) confirmed the principle of <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, that a constitutional civil commitment scheme must link future dangerousness to a mental abnormality that impairs behavioral control, while (2) making clear that the impairment need only be serious, not absolute. <em>Kansas v. Crane </em>reiterated Hendricks\u2019s holding that within wide boundaries, state legislators may define this difficult-to-articulate concept as they wish, and acknowledged Hendricks\u2019s earlier conclusion that the Kansas statute articulated it sufficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">Nowhere did <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, suggest that the Kansas law so recently upheld <em>as written </em>in <em>Hendricks </em>could be constitutionally applied only with supplemental instructions, in language <em>not </em>chosen by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Kansas\u2019s legislators, pinpointing the impairment-of-control issue. Though the high court rejected the State of Kansas\u2019s argument that <em>no </em>impairment-of-control \u201cdetermination\u201d was required <em>(Kansas v. Crane </em>at p. 412), this language, read in context, appears intended only to verify that a constitutional civil confinement scheme cannot <em>dispense </em>with impaired behavioral control as a basis for commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">As we made clear in <em>Hubbart, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1138, California\u2019s SVPA, like the Kansas statute at issue in <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, and <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, does <em>not </em>dispense with that requirement. On the contrary, California\u2019s statute inherently <em>embraces and conveys </em>the need for a dangerous mental condition characterized by impairment of behavioral control. As we have seen, the SVPA accomplishes this purpose by defining a sexually violent predator to include the requirement of a diagnosed mental disorder (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a)(1)) affecting the emotional or volitional capacity <em>(id., </em>subd. (c)), which predisposes one to commit criminal sexual acts so as to render the person a menace to the health and safety of others <em>(ibid.), </em>such that the person is \u201clikely [to] engage in sexually violent criminal behavior\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (a)(1)). <em>(Hubbart, supra, </em>at pp. 1152-1161.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Indeed, in contrast with the Kansas statute, California\u2019s SVPA states <em>no </em>category of committable disorder which <em>does not expressly require </em>a dangerous effect on emotional or volitional capacity. We are persuaded that a jury instructed in the language of California\u2019s statute must necessarily understand the need for serious difficulty in controlling behavior.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">In our view, a judicially imposed requirement of special instructions <em>augmenting </em>the clear language of the SVPA would contravene the premise of both <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, and <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, that, in this nuanced area, the <em>Legislature </em>is the primary arbiter of how the necessary mental-disorder component of its civil commitment scheme shall be defined and described. (See <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>at pp. 410, 413; <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>at p. 359.) No reason appears to interfere with that legislative prerogative here.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Accordingly, we conclude, <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, does not compel us to hold that further lack-of-control instructions or findings are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>necessary to support a commitment under the SVPA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For the reasons we have detailed, we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">In other states, courts have divided when considering the effect of <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, on similarly worded schemes for the commitment of dangerously disordered sex offenders. The more persuasive decisions have determined, as we do, that the pertinent statutory language\u2014 language sometimes less explicit than California\u2019s on the impairment-of-control issue\u2014adequately conveys <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane\u2019s </em>requirements, and that commitments under the statutes at issue are thus constitutionally valid without the need for additional instructions or specific findings on impairment of control.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Certain out-of-state cases, when concluding that their statutory language satisfied <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, relied in part on the fact that their statutes, either explicitly or by judicial construction, allowed commitment only if it was <em>more likely than not </em>that the person would reoffend if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>free.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On the other hand, we have interpreted the \u201clikely to reoffend\u201d prong of California\u2019s SVPA<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to require only \u201c \u2018a <em>substantial </em>danger, that is, a <em>serious and well-founded </em>risk\u2019 \u201d\u2014but not necessarily a greater than even chance\u2014that the person\u2019s diagnosed mental disorder will lead to new criminal sexual violence unless the person is confined and treated. <em>(People v. Roberge </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 979, 988 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 861, 62 P.3d 97] <em>(Roberge), </em>quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Ghilotti) </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 888, 922 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 44 P.3d 949] <em>(Ghilotti); </em>see also <em>Cooley v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 228, 255 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 177, 57 P.3d 654] <em>(Cooley).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">This difference does not persuade us that specific impairment-of-control instructions are constitutionally required in California. As we have indicated, the \u201cmental disorder\u201d prong of the SVPA\u2014at issue here pursuant to <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407\u2014is distinct from the prong addressing the <em>degree of future dangerousness, </em>which was before us in <em>Roberge, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th 979, <em>Cooley, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th 228, and <em>Ghilotti, supra, 27 </em>Cal.4th 888. (See <em>Ghilotti, supra, </em>at p. 921, fn. 12.) Entirely aside from future dangerousness, the SVPA requires a diagnosed mental disorder <em>affecting the person\u2019s emotional or volitional capacity </em>that predisposes the person to commit sex crimes in a menacing degree. (\u00a7 6600, subd. (c).) We intimated in <em>Ghilotti, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th 888, 921, footnote 12, and confirm here, that this requirement alone implies \u201cserious difficulty\u201d in controlling behavior, as required by <em>Kansas v. Crane.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\"><em>A </em>mental disorder that includes all the above-described elements\u2014 including a dangerous impairment of capacity\u2014must additionally produce an actual risk of violent reoffense which, under all the applicable circumstances, is \u201csubstantial,\u201d \u201cserious,\u201d and \u201cwell-founded.\u201d <em>(Roberge, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th 979, 988; see <em>Ghilotti, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 921, fn. 12.) Jurors instructed in these terms must necessarily understand that one is not eligible for commitment under the SVPA unless his or her capacity or ability to control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>violent criminal sexual behavior is seriously and dangerously impaired. No additional instructions or findings are necessary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Finally, we are influenced in our interpretation of <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, by the South Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s observation in <em>In re Treatment and Care of Luckabaugh, supra, </em>568 S.E.2d 338. Noting that 16 states then had commitment statutes for violent, dangerously disordered sex offenders (see <em>id. </em>at p. 348, fn. 8), the <em>Luckabaugh </em>court reasoned that \u201c[t]o read <em>[Kansas </em>v.] <em>Crane </em>as requiring a special finding [of serious difficulty in controlling behavior] would be to suggest that the United States Supreme Court mandated at least sixteen states to hold new commitment hearings for over 1,200 individuals [currently] committed under their [states\u2019] sexually violent predator acts. [Citation.] We believe the Court\u2019s ruling would have been more explicit if it intended such consequences.\u201d <em>(Luckabaugh, </em>568 S.E.2d at p. 348, fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">For all the reasons indicated, we conclude that a commitment rendered under the plain language of the SVPA necessarily encompasses a determination of serious difficulty in controlling one\u2019s criminal sexual violence, as required by <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407. Accordingly, separate instructions or findings on that issue are not constitutionally required,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and no error arose from the court\u2019s failure to give such instructions in defendant\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Insofar as <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, held that one may not be civilly committed absent some specific <em>\u201cproof </em>of serious difficulty in controlling [dangerous] behavior\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 413, italics added), ample evidence to that effect was presented here. Both expert witnesses testified that defendant suffers from paraphilia, a serious, incurable mental disorder, which is characterized by the obsessive, repetitive, and driven nature of his criminal sexual violence. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 412, 414-415.) The experts indicated that defendant continued to exhibit a marked lack of control over his sexual behavior, as evidenced by his many acts of indecent exposure and public masturbation while confined as a result of his violent sex offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">There was expert testimony that defendant\u2019s control is further impaired by other mental disorders, such as psychosis, paranoia, and severe antisocial personality disorder, which enhance his impulsivity and cloud his judgment. According to one of the testifying psychologists, defendant frankly admitted that he lacked control over his pathological sexual behavior. Defendant offered no contrary evidence. Hence, defendant was clearly established as \u201c \u2018a dangerous sexual offender [of the kind] subject to civil commitment [as distinguished] \u201cfrom other dangerous persons who are perhaps more properly dealt with exclusively through criminal proceedings.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, 412, quoting <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, 360.)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">For similar reasons, we also agree with the Court of Appeal that if instructional error had occurred under <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hurtado </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 1179, 1194 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 186, 52 P.3d 116].) Because it was essentially undisputed that defendant\u2019s diagnosed mental disorder involved serious difficulty in controlling sexual behavior, the absence of an instruction pinpointing that issue must \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt . . . have made no difference in reaching the verdict obtained.\u201d <em>(Yates v. Evatt </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 391, 407 [114 L.Ed.2d 432, 111 S.Ct. 1884].)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">George, C. J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., Brown, J., and Moreno, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-11\"> All further unlabeled statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b799-9\"> Dr. Sheppard distinguished a rape committed as a crime of opportunity, as where a burglar enters a home to steal property, but by happenstance encounters a victim and takes advantage of the circumstance to commit a sexual assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b800-8\"> In addition to the other clinical and historical data on which they relied, both Dr. Sheppard and Dr. Franks rated defendant on the so-called Static-99 scale, which measures the statistical risk of reoffense based on characteristics of the subject\u2019s personal history and past offenses as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>they compare with those of known criminal sexual recidivists. Both experts agreed that defendant scored a 9 on this scale, equating to a high risk of reoffense, i.e., 39 percent within five years, 45 percent within 10 years, and 52 percent within 15 years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b802-8\"> Though they did not raise the point in the Court of Appeal, the People suggest here that defendant has waived his instructional argument, because in this <em>civil </em>proceeding (see <em>Hubbart </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1138, 1170-1179 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 492, 969 P.2d 584] <em>(Hubbart)), </em>he may not complain that the court should have given an instruction other than the <em>incorrect </em>\u201cunable to control\u201d language he proffered at trial. (Citing <em>Orient Handel v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 684, 699 [237 Cal.Rptr. <em>667); </em>see also 7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Trial, \u00a7 272, pp. 318-319.) But if the wording of defendant\u2019s proposed instruction was incorrect, that was confirmed only by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407. Under the circumstances, the Court of Appeal properly proceeded to address the issue whether <em>Kansas v. Crane </em>itself imposed <em>some </em>requirement to instruct specifically on impairment of behavioral control. In reviewing the decision of the Court of Appeal (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 12, subd. (b); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 28), we may and should do the same (see Cal.

Crane </em>(2002) 534 U.S. 407 [151 L.Ed.2d 856, 122 S.Ct. 867], the United States Supreme Court said that a defendant can be confined as a dangerous sexual predator only upon proof of \u201cserious difficulty in controlling behavior.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 413.) California\u2019s Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVPA) (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600 et seq.), enacted before <em>Crane </em>was filed, applies to a person who has a \u201cdiagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>criminal behavior.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 6600, subd. (a)(1).) A \u201cdiagnosed mental disorder\u201d is defined to include a condition \u201caffecting the emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to the commission of criminal sexual acts in a degree constituting the person a menace to the health and safety of others.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 6600, subd. (c).) The SVPA is not expressly limited to defendants who have serious difficulty in controlling their behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Taking the language of the SVPA literally, a person could be confined as a sexually violent predator based on a condition that affects his emotional capacity by making the person likely to engage in sexually violent criminal behavior, even if he does not have serious difficulty in controlling his behavior. In other words, California\u2019s SVPA applies literally to persons who have the capacity to refrain from committing predatory acts but choose to commit them anyway. Even though such persons are a danger to the health and safety of others, under <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, they cannot be confined under the SVPA procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The majority in this case, however, points out the impossibility of distinguishing between the effects of mental illness on emotional capacity and volitional capacity. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 762-763.) After thorough review of the precedents from the United States Supreme Court and this court, it concludes that \u201cCalifornia\u2019s statute inherently <em>embraces and conveys </em>the need for a dangerous mental condition characterized by impairment of behavioral control.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 774.) And because the SVPA specifies that the defendant\u2019s mental disorder must predispose the person to the commission of criminal sexual acts to such an extent that he becomes \u201ca menace to the health and safety of others\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600, subd. (c)), the majority reasons that a defendant\u2019s difficulty in controlling behavior must be serious. I agree with this construction of the SVPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">But the jurors in an SVPA case, if instructed solely in the language of the SVPA, will know nothing of the majority\u2019s sophisticated exercise in statutory construction, of the precedents on which it based its holding, or the implications and conclusions it draws. The jurors may apply the literal language of the statute and find a defendant to be a sexually violent predator without deciding whether the defendant has serious difficulty in controlling his behavior. The jurors would not be acting unreasonably in reaching such a result; as the majority points out, state appellate courts are closely divided on whether statutory language similar to California\u2019s SVPA does or does not include an implied requirement that the defendant have serious difficulty in controlling behavior. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 774 &amp; fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">A recent Arizona Supreme Court decision addressed this problem. After holding that due process requirements do not require a jury instruction on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>serious difficulty in controlling behavior, the court went on to say: \u201cGiven the important interests involved in SVP proceedings for both the state and the individual, no question should arise as to whether the jury understands the importance of finding that a mental disorder, rather than a voluntary decision to engage in repetitive criminal behavior, renders a person dangerous within the meaning of the SVP statute. To assure that jurors understand this requirement, we direct trial judges to instruct juries as follows in future SVP proceedings: ... An individual\u2019s dangerousness must be caused by a mental disorder which, in turn, causes the person to have serious difficulty in controlling his or her behavior.\u201d <em>(In re Leon G. </em>(2002) 204 Ariz. 15 [59 P.3d 779, 788].)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">It would be prudent for California trial courts also to explain to jurors in future cases that defendants cannot be found to be sexually violent predators unless they have serious difficulty in controlling their behavior. Such an instruction will ensure that jurors comply with <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, 413, and do not commit defendants as sexually violent predators without determining that the defendants have serious difficulty in controlling their behavior. There is a risk that the United States Supreme Court, resolving the conflict in state court decisions noted by the majority (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 777), may hold that a jury instruction on controlling behavior is constitutionally required; by anticipating this possibility and mandating such an instruction under our judicial authority, we can ensure the validity of California SVPA commitments.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
