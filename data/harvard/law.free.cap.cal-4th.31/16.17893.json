(On May 15, 2002, we filed the order specifically limiting the issue on review to coverage under the advertising injury provision.) We conclude the term \u201cadvertising injury\u201d as used in the CGL policy requires widespread promotion to the public such that one-on-one solicitation of a few customers does not give rise to the insurer\u2019s duty to defend the underlying lawsuit. For this reason, we reverse the Court of Appeal judgment, which concluded the allegations satisfied the \u201cadvertising injury\u201d provision of the CGL insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">In November 1998, plaintiff Mohammed A. Hameid opened Salon T\u2019Shea, a beauty parlor. Hameid purchased a \u201cBusiness Account Package Policy\u201d from National Fire Insurance of Hartford (National). The policy was effective from November 2, 1998, to November 2, 2001, and provided CGL insurance, including coverage for \u201cadvertising injury\u201d arising out of the \u201cmisappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.\u201d Salon T\u2019Shea was located near a competitor, Bellezza Salon/Day Spa (Bellezza). Shortly after Salon T\u2019Shea opened, Doreen Howard and Heather Billington, two Bellezza hairdressers, left Bellezza to rent work stations from Hameid, taking most of their customers with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">In March 1999, KWP, Inc. (KWP), Bellezza\u2019s owner, sued Hameid, Howard, and Billington for (1) misappropriation of trade secrets, (2) unfair competition, (3) breach of contract, (4) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (5) intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, (6) negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, (7) civil conspiracy, and (8) injunctive relief. KWP claimed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>all three defendants possessed \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d including Bellezza\u2019s \u201ccustomer list, price list and pricing policies,\u201d and that the defendants had \u201cmisappropriated the above-described trade secrets by committing certain acts, including, but not limited to: utilizing the customer list in order to identify and solicit [Bellezza\u2019s] customers, and using [Bellezza\u2019s] confidential price list and pricing policies to undercut [Bellezza].\u201d As to Hameid specifically, the KWP action alleged direct misappropriation and unfair competition, conspiratorial activity with the codefendants, and an agency relationship with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Hameid\u2019s own declaration established that he did no advertising, except to include a flyer in a ValPak that was sent in a mass mailing to local residents. Hameid declares: \u201cDefendants Doreen Howard and Heather Billington rent space at Salon T\u2019Shea which has done no advertising or soliciting for them. What Salon T\u2019Shea does for advertising is to include a flyer in ValPak which is sent to local residents.\u201d KWP, however, did not sue Hameid for mailing the ValPak flyer. Instead, KWP sued Hameid for stealing its customer list and soliciting its customers. Even the coupon on the flyer was not applicable to Howard\u2019s or Billington\u2019s services; it was restricted to other stylists: \u201c20 percent Off Any Service. With Coupon Only. New Clients Only. Discount With Meno or Heidi Only.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Hameid tendered defense of the KWP action to National under the CGL insurance policy\u2019s \u201cadvertising injury\u201d coverage provision, but the insurer refused to defend him. Hameid prevailed against KWP at trial. He then timely filed the present bad faith action against National for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, seeking to recover defense expenses and punitive damages. The trial court struck the punitive damages claim. It also granted National\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that as a matter of law National owed Hameid no duty to defend under the relevant policy provision because the underlying lawsuit claimed misappropriation of trade secrets, and not advertising injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment, concluding National owed Hameid a duty to defend. The court relied on <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co. v. Foxfire Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1993) 820 F.Supp. 489, 494 <em>(Foxfire), </em>in holding that when we view Hameid\u2019s business as a \u201cstart-up community beauty salon,\u201d the relatively limited solicitation of customers through phone calls and ValPak mailers served to call public attention to the salon\u2019 beauty services. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The Court of Appeal concluded that solicitation was therefore equivalent to the widespread promotional activities that <em>Foxfire </em>found constituted advertising under the CGL insurance policy. (See also <em>Sentex Systems, Inc. v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1995) 882 F.Supp. 930, 939, affd. (9th Cir. 1996) 93 F.3d 578 [advertising encompasses one-on-one and group solicitations].) Having concluded the insured\u2019s conduct fell within the National policy\u2019s definition of advertising activity, the court considered whether the policy covered that conduct in its coverage of \u201cadvertising injury\u201d arising out of the \u201cmisappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.\u201d The court concluded that business marketing includes a variety of direct and indirect advertising activities, including misappropriating confidential customer lists to identify and solicit clients. We granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">1. <em>General Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Insurance policy interpretation is a question of law. <em>(Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 18 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619].) An insurance policy is a contract between the insurer and the insured. As with all contracts, \u201cthe mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.\u201d <em>(AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 821-822 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253].) The parties\u2019 intent is inferred from the \u201c \u2018clear and explicit\u2019 meaning of these provisions, interpreted in their \u2018ordinary and popular sense,\u2019 unless \u2018used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage\u2019 .... Thus, if the meaning a lay person would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous, we apply that meaning.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 822.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Liability insurers owe a duty to defend their insureds for claims that potentially fall within the policy\u2019s coverage provisions. \u201cThe carrier must defend a suit which <em>potentially </em>seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.\u201d <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Ins. Co. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 263, 275 [54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168].) However, in an action where no claim is even potentially covered, the insurer owes no duty to defend. <em>(Buss v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 35, 46 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 939 P.2d 766].)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">2. <em>The National Insurance Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">In order to determine whether National owed Hameid a duty to defend, we must examine the CGL insurance policy at issue. As noted, the policy provides defense and indemnity coverage for \u201cadvertising injuries\u201d if the injuries are \u201ccaused by an offense committed in the course of advertising [the insured\u2019s] goods and services.\u201d The coverage obligates National to defend an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>action against the insured if the underlying lawsuit alleges (1) \u201cadvertising\u201d by the insured, (2) an \u201cadvertising injury\u201d offense as defined in the policy, and (3) a causal connection between the advertising injury and the third party claimant\u2019s damages. The \u201cUmbrella Coverage Endorsement\u201d in the same CGL insurance policy provides additional coverage for \u201cadvertising injury\u201d under essentially identical terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Although the CGL insurance policy here does not define \u201cadvertising,\u201d it does define \u201cadvertising injury\u201d to mean injury arising out of one or more offenses, including slander or libel; violation of the right to privacy; copyright, title or slogan infringement; and, at issue here, \u201c[m]isappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   Thus in order for Hameid to have a reasonable expectation of coverage under the National CGL policy for \u201cadvertising injury\u201d he must show that: (1) he was engaged in \u201cadvertising\u201d during the policy period when the alleged \u201cadvertising injury\u201d occurred; (2) KWP\u2019s allegations created a potential for liability under one of the covered offenses (i.e., misappropriation of advertising ideas); and (3) a causal connection existed between the alleged injury and the \u201cadvertising.\u201d <em>(Bank of the West v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1276 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545] <em>(Bank of the </em>West); <em>Peerless Lighting Corp. v. Am. Motorists Ins. Co. </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 995, 1009 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 753] <em>(Peerless).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">3. <em>Did Hameid\u2019s Activities Constitute \u201cAdvertising\u201d Under the National CGL Insurance Policy?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The parties do not dispute that KWP\u2019s alleged injuries occurred during the time National\u2019s policy was in effect. They do, however, disagree on (1) whether Hameid was involved in \u201cadvertising,\u201d and (2) whether KWP\u2019s allegations gave rise to a potential for coverage under the \u201cadvertising injury\u201d policy provision. If we assume that taking trade secrets in the form of a customer list is an offense that may inflict advertising injury, we must then decide whether the offense occurred in the course of Hameid\u2019s advertising his salon\u2019s goods or services. In other words, does solicitation of customers from a customer list constitute \u201cadvertising\u201d within the meaning of the CGL policy, and, if so, did the alleged advertising activity cause advertising injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>The meaning of \u201cadvertising\u201d in a CGL insurance policy has presented a problem for courts interpreting coverage. In <em>Bank of the West, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at page 1276, footnote 9, we interpreted a pre-1986 version of the CGL insurance policy. It covered advertising injury arising out of an offense that occurred during the course of the insured\u2019s advertising activities. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1262.) We observed that, when interpreting CGL insurance policies, \u201ccourts have disagreed on the question of what constitutes \u2018advertising\u2019 .... Most of the published decisions hold that \u2018advertising\u2019 means widespread promotional activities directed to the public at large.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Although we did not decide the meaning of the term because the question was not before us, <em>Bank of the West </em>acknowledged that only a sparse minority of federal district court cases hold \u201cthat the term \u2018advertising\u2019 can also encompass personal solicitations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1276; see <em>Foxfire, supra, </em>820 F.Supp. at p. 494; <em>American States Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Canyon Creek </em>(N.D.Cal. 1991) 786 F.Supp. 821; and <em>John Deere Ins. Co. v. Shamrock Industries, Inc. </em>(D.Minn. 1988) 696 F.Supp. 434 <em>(John Deere).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Here, the Court of Appeal questioned <em>Bank of the West\u2019s </em>statement that most courts have defined \u201cadvertising\u201d to mean \u201cwidespread promotional activities directed to the public at large.\u201d The court relied on <em>Foxfire, supra, </em>820 F.Supp. at page 494, which opined that whether an insured\u2019s activity is \u201cadvertising\u201d under a CGL insurance policy hinges on \u201cthe context of the overall universe of customers to whom a communication may be addressed.\u201d <em>Foxfire </em>commented that \u201c[w]here the audience may be small, but nonetheless comprises all or a significant number of a competitor\u2019s client base, the advertising activity requirement is met.... [W]here the business is one with a small customer base and that base, or a significant part of it, is the target audience, the reach is extensive enough to constitute advertising injury.\u201d (Ibid.; accord, <em>Amway Distribs. Benefits Ass\u2019n v. Federal Ins. Co. </em>(W.D.Mich. 1997) 990 F.Supp. 936, 945 [\u201cadvertising comes in many forms and may differ in scope from business to business, depending on the product, the size of the company, the company\u2019s marketing system, or the size of the target market\u201d]; <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co. v. R.L. Chaides Constr. Co., Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1994) 847 F.Supp. 1452, 1456 <em>(Chaides) </em>[\u201c[a]dvertising activity must be examined in the context of the overall universe of customers to whom a communication may be addressed; to hold otherwise would effectively preclude small businesses . . . from ever invoking their rights to coverage for advertising injury liability\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The Court of Appeal also relied on <em>Peerless, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at pages 1008-1009, which questioned whether \u201cwidespread promotional activities\u201d \u201cin fact [was] the rule adopted by a majority of published opinions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) Peerless, </em>however, does not support the Court of Appeal\u2019s analysis. <em>Peerless </em>actually held that an insured\u2019s participation in a competitive bidding process on a single product involving a single customer did not constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>\u201cadvertising\u201d under the CGL insurance policy and rejected a duty to defend. <em>(Ibid.) Peerless </em>discussed several cases interpreting the advertising injury coverage and suggested that a majority of other jurisdictions do require widespread advertising to the public. <em>Peerless </em>also observed that only a few federal courts interpret advertising injury coverage to apply to personal solicitations to a limited number of individual customers. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1008-1010 [citing several cases following the \u201cwidespread promotion\u201d approach, including <em>Select Design Ltd. v. Union Mut. Fire Ins. </em>(Vt. 1996) 165 Vt. 69 [674 A.2d 798] <em>(Select Design)].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Contrary to <em>Foxfire, </em>we prefer the majority approach as stated in <em>Bank of the West, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at page 1276, and interpret the term \u201cadvertising\u201d as used in CGL policies to mean widespread promotional activities usually directed to the public at large.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The definition reflects the commonly understood meaning of the word.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As noted, a majority of the other jurisdictions that have considered the question have come to a similar conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In <em>Select Design, supra, </em>674 A.2d 798, the insured sought a defense after being sued for allegedly using proprietary information, including a customer list that a competitor\u2019s former employee provided, to solicit the competitor\u2019s customers. The insured\u2019s CGL insurance policy provided coverage for \u201cadvertising injury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 799.) The Vermont Supreme Court stated that the \u201cmajority view\u201d defined \u201cadvertising\u201d as \u201cwidespread distribution of promotional material to the public at large\u201d partially because the majority \u201cread the policy provisions according to their plain, ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 801-803.) The court reasoned that defining \u201cadvertising\u201d to include customer solicitations would stretch too far: \u201cIf the act of contacting potential customers is advertising for the purposes of the policy, then any dispute related to economic competition among businesses is covered by the policy provision for advertising injury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 803.) Thus, the court held that solicitation of the competitor\u2019s customers did not constitute \u201cadvertising\u201d under the CGL insurance policy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 802.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>In <em>Monumental Life Ins. Co. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>(Md.Ct.Spec.App. 1993) 94 Md.App. 505 [617 A.2d 1163], the insured was accused of mailing recruiting letters to a competitor\u2019s employees and courting a competitor\u2019s customers with a personal solicitation that caused many of them to defect. When the insured sought a defense under the \u201cadvertising injury\u201d coverage of its CGL insurance policy, the trial court determined the insured\u2019s alleged activities were not \u201cadvertising.\u201d The Maryland Court of Special Appeals affirmed. It distinguished between \u201cadvertising\u201d and \u201csolicitation,\u201d stating that \u201c[t]he lower court clearly viewed advertising and solicitation as mutually exclusive, the difference being that advertising must be of a public nature.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1173.) The Court of Appeals agreed \u201cwith the lower court that there is no <em>bona fide </em>ambiguity in the language of the policies at issue, nor is there any legitimate doubt as to its application under the circumstances. \u2018Advertising\u2019 means <em>advertising, </em>i.e., \u2018widespread distribution or announcements to the public.\u2019 Consequently, Monumental\u2019s individual, one-to-one solicitations were clearly <em>not </em>\u2018advertising\u2019 within the normal meaning of the word and, accordingly, the lower court acted properly.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1174.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">A federal district court applying Virginia law similarly recognized that \u201cadvertising\u201d means \u201cwidespread distribution of promotional material to the public at large.\u201d <em>(Solers, Inc. v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(E.D.Va. 2001) 146 F.Supp.2d 785, 795 <em>(Solers).) </em>In <em>Solers, </em>a subcontractor sought a defense under the \u201cadvertising injury\u201d provision of its liability insurance policy after allegedly using proprietary information to submit bids on two government contracts. The insured claimed that \u201c[widespread public dissemination of solicitation material is not appropriate for [its] business,\u201d and that \u201cits only advertising mechanism is the submission of written business proposals.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 790.) Thus, the insured asserted that \u201cthe [c]ourt must find that the proposals constitute advertising because to hold otherwise on the grounds that the proposals are not directed at the public at large would be to hold that companies with small, but well-defined markets cannot, as a matter of law, engage in advertising.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>The district court rejected the insured\u2019s contention, holding that the subcontractor\u2019s bids were \u201cnot covered by the [p]olicy because such submissions were not \u2018widespread distribution of promotional material to the public at large.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Solers, supra, </em>146 F.Supp.2d at p. 790, quoting <em>Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>(7th Cir. 1985) 769 F.2d 425, 428-429 [applying Illinois law].) The district court also pointed out that \u201csmall businesses are not limited to insurance coverage for claims based in \u2018advertising injury\u2019 for the protection of their profession. Small businesses may obtain broad coverage by purchasing several forms of insurance, including coverage for errors and omissions liability, directors and officers liability, and completed operations and products liability.\u201d <em>(Solers, supra, </em>146 F.Supp.2d at p. 796, fn. 2.) There is no evidence in this action that Hameid obtained any such small business insurance coverage that may have assisted him in defending the KWP action.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Massachusetts, Missouri, Illinois, and Kansas have also defined \u201cadvertising\u201d as \u201cwidespread promotional activities directed to the public at large.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See <em>Smartfoods, Inc. v.

Co. </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1382, 1388-1389 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 397] [insured could not reasonably have thought painting placed in lobby of building to attract new tenants fell under \u201cadvertising injury\u201d coverage].)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">In addition to propounding <em>Foxfire\u2019s </em>minority view, Hameid asks us to adopt the approach taken in <em>John Deere, supra, </em>696 F.Supp. 434. In <em>John Deere, </em>a Minnesota district court held that three letters extolling the virtues of a pail-filling machine constituted \u201cadvertising.\u201d The district court noted that \u201c[w]hile activity directed at one customer seems to stretch the meaning of advertising, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\u2019s definition of \u2018advertise\u2019 encompasses any form of solicitation, presumably including solicitation of one person.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 440.) Mirroring this argument, Hameid contends that \u201c[advertising is defined by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary as: \u2018To advise, announce, apprise, command, give notice of, inform, make known, publish. To call a matter to public attention by any means whatsoever. Any oral, written, or graphic statements made by the seller in any manner in connection with the solicitation of business and includes: . . . statements and representations . . . contained in any notice, handbill, sign, catalog, or letter.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">National points out, however, that the most recent edition of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary has deleted the sentences on which both Hameid and the <em>John Deere </em>court rely. (See Black\u2019s Law Dict. (7th ed. 1999) p. 55 [defining \u201cadvertising\u201d as \u201c[t]he action of drawing the public\u2019s attention to something to promote its sale\u201d or \u201c[t]he business of producing or circulating advertisements\u201d].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Black\u2019s less expansive definition, and its use of the words \u201cpublic attention,\u201d indicate that \u201cadvertising\u201d does not encompass personal solicitations. In addition, <em>Smartfoods, supra, </em>618 N.E.2d at page 1368, criticized <em>John Deere, </em>calling it \u201cunpersuasively reasoned\u201d and noting that \u201c[w]e doubt that every pitch made by one businessman in a letter to another constitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>advertising as the word is understood in American usage.\u201d Thus, <em>John Deere, </em>which frankly acknowledged that its interpretation \u201cseemed to stretch the meaning of advertising,\u201d offers Hameid little support.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(John Deere, supra, </em>696 F.Supp. at p. 440.)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Hameid also relies on <em>Ford Dealers Assn. v. Dept of Motor Vehicles </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 347, 355 [185 Cal.Rptr. 453, 650 P.2d 328] <em>(Ford Dealers) </em>and its definition of \u201cadvertising\u201d found in a regulation promulgated under the Vehicle Code. As defendant National observes, <em>Ford Dealers </em>reviewed an administrative regulation the Department of Motor Vehicles adopted under the former Administrative Procedure Act to address vehicle licensing and business. As National also observes, <em>Ford Dealers </em>recognized that its role was a \u201climited one\u201d that involved inquiring into a regulation\u2019s validity, not its wisdom. <em>(Ford Dealers, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 355.) The Legislature amended Vehicle Code section 11713 to make it unlawful for an auto dealer to \u201c \u2018make or disseminate . . . before the public ... in any newspaper or other publication, or any advertising device, or by public outcry or proclamation, or in any other manner or means whatever, any statement which is untrue or misleading.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ford Dealers, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 357.)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">As National points out, <em>Ford Dealers </em>upheld the administrative regulation that defined \u201cadvertising\u201d \u201cin the broad context of Vehicle Code Section 11713 [,subdivision] (a)\u201d to include statements communicated to the public. <em>(Ford Dealers, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 356.) Initially, we note that we do not find compelling the interpretation of regulations in a statutory context like the Vehicle Code rather than an insurance context. (See, e.g., <em>Bluehawk v. Continental Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1126, 1131-1132 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 147].) But as National also observes, the challenged regulation also provided, that \u201cadvertising\u201d refers to a \u201c \u2018statement, representation, act or announcement intentionally communicated to the public generally for the purpose of arousing desire to buy or patronize.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ford Dealers, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 357.) Thus, even under <em>Ford Dealers, </em>the common understanding of the term \u201cadvertising\u201d includes its public character.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Finally, we consider the approach the <em>Foxfire </em>court itself took. <em>(Foxfire, supra, </em>820 F.Supp. at p. 494.) As mentioned, <em>Foxfire </em>held that courts should determine whether activities are \u201cadvertising\u201d on a case-by-case basis, noting to whom the promotions are directed. <em>(Ibid.) </em>We disagree. Due to the pervasiveness of CGL insurance policies, and of advertising, if we adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>Foxfire\u2019s </em>malleable definition, we likely would encourage litigation.  Giving identical policy language different meanings for different insureds would eliminate the clarity and certainty that is essential to the insurance industry. Standardization of policy terms is important to insurers and insureds alike. It enables insurers to compare losses and calculate rates and premiums so that rates remain stable, and not based on destabilizing ad hoc views of a particular coverage. It also gives effect to the parties\u2019 mutual intent as it existed at the time of contracting, so far as that intent is ascertainable and lawful. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1636.) In other words, the majority view defines \u201cadvertising\u201d to mean the widespread distribution of promotional materials to the public at large because it interprets the contractual term under its ordinary and popular meaning. It allows uniformity in interpretation under different factual circumstances that may or may not lead to coverage. (See <em>Amcor Sunclipse, supra, </em>241 F.3d at p. 608 [concluding individual solicitations are not advertising because California would not depart from the normal understanding of the term].) Because the parties\u2019 mutual intention is to be inferred, if possible, solely from contract\u2019s written provisions, the clear and ordinary meaning of those terms should control our interpretation. (See <em>AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 821-822.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In addition, we are not persuaded by <em>Foxfire\u2019s </em>assertion that adopting the majority approach \u201cwould effectively preclude small businesses . . . from ever invoking their rights to coverage for advertising injury liability.\u201d <em>(Foxfire, supra, </em>820 F.Supp. at p. 494; see also <em>Chaides, supra, </em>847 F.Supp. at p. 1456.) Under the proposed definition of \u201cadvertising,\u201d small businesses like Hameid\u2019s may still rely on CGL coverage for \u201cadvertising injury\u201d if they place spots on the radio or television, buy space on billboards or bus benches, or take out advertisements in newspapers directed to the public at large, and their content caused advertising injury. Therefore, we conclude that excluding personal solicitations from the definition of \u201cadvertising\u201d in the CGL insurance policy will not foreclose small businesses from invoking their rights under CGL insurance policies or from otherwise purchasing insurance protection that does cover potential liability for such solicitations. <em>(Solers, supra, </em>146 F.Supp.2d at p. 795, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Here, KWP alleged Howard and Billington made telephone calls and sent mailers to Bellezza customers advising them of their new location and of Hameid\u2019s lower prices. These activities strongly resemble the solicitations of a competitor\u2019s customers in <em>Select Design, supra, </em>674 A.2d at pages 801-803; the recruiting letters to a competitor\u2019s employees in <em>Monumental Life Ins. Co. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., supra, </em>617 A.2d at page 1173; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>and the subcontractor\u2019s submission of bids in <em>Solers, supra, </em>146 F.Supp.2d at page 795\u2014all of which were held to be \u201csolicitation,\u201d not \u201cadvertising.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">We conclude that Hameid has failed to show KWP alleged any cause of action amounting to a potentially covered offense under the National CGL insurance policy. We therefore reverse the Court of Appeal on the issue of National\u2019s duty to defend and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">George, C. J., Kennard, J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Brown, J., and Moreno, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied September 10, 2003.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-7\"> Although a separate Penny Saver advertisement is mentioned in investigators\u2019 declarations that accompanied KWP\u2019s complaint, KWP did not claim the advertisement was wrongful or seek damages based on it, and Hameid did not mention it in any of the initial correspondence between him and National following his tender of defense. In addition, the Penny Saver advertisement was not made a part of the record. We therefore refer to the ValPak advertisement only, because it was included in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b60-7\"> The term \u201cstyle of doing business\u201d refers to a company\u2019s comprehensive manner of operating. (See <em>Novell, Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co. </em>(D.Utah 1998) 141 F.3d 983, 986-988 [holding allegation that insured software company copied software developer\u2019s efforts did not trigger duty to defend under \u201cadvertising injury\u201d portion of CGL policy as \u201cmisappropriation of style of doing business\u201d]; see also <em>Poof Toy Prods. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>(E.D.Mich. 1995) 891 F.Supp. 1228, 1232; <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Advanced International Systems, Inc. </em>(E.D.Va. 1993) 824 F.Supp. 583, affd. (4th Cir. 1997) 21 F.3d 424.) Because KWP did not allege that Hameid, Howard, or Billington misappropriated its comprehensive manner of operating, the underlying action did not assert claims connected to misappropriation of style of doing business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b62-6\"> Hameid observes that the Insurance Services Office (ISO), which drafts the standard CGL insurance policies, defines \u201cadvertising\u201d as \u201ca notice that is broadcast or published in the general public or <em>specific market segments </em>for the purpose of attracting customers or supporters.\u201d (Mooning, <em>ISO Advertising and Personal Injury Revisions: Major Surgery or Just a Band-Aid Fix? </em>(1999) 4 Medley\u2019s Emerging Ins. Disputes 16, italics added.) We have limited our review to the question presented and do not have occasion to decide whether widespread promotional activities directed at specific market segments constitute advertising under the CGL policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b62-7\"> Hameid also claims the word \u201cadvertising\u201d and the phrase \u201cadvertising ideas\u201d are ambiguous because the CGL insurance policy does not define the terms. We have, however, held that \u201cthe absence from the policy of a definition of [a] term . . . does not by itself render the term ambiguous.\u201d <em>(Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lawyers\u2019 Mut.

Compounding the difficulty of finding specific holdings defining \u201cadvertising\u201d is the fact courts often dispose of unmeritorious claims of \u201cadvertising injury\u201d through other avenues. (See, e.g., <em>Associated Aviation Underwriters, Inc. v. Vegas Jet, LLC </em>(D.Nev. 2000) 106 F.Supp.2d 1051, 1056 [holding insured did not prove causal connection between alleged injury and \u201cadvertising\u201d activity].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b64-6\"> In addition, New Hampshire and Minnesota have made similar rulings.

Notably, <em>American States </em>also relied in part on a definition of \u201cadvertising\u201d found in an older edition of Black\u2019s.
