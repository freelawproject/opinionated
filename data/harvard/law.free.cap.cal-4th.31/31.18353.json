Code, \u00a7 6300 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> tree trimming regulations? The question is presented under the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">Eliseo Lascano, doing business as Anthony\u2019s Tree Service (ATS), offered and was hired to trim an approximately 50-foot palm tree in defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Traman and Galle Lawsons\u2019 (Lawson) yard for $450. Lawson was not aware a contractor\u2019s license was required to trim a tree measuring 15 feet or more (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 7026.1, subd. (c)), and in fact, neither ATS nor plaintiff Miguel Fernandez was licensed. Unless Fernandez is estopped from denying ATS\u2019s independent contractor status because of any licensing misrepresentations Lascano may have made to Lawson, the parties assume Fernandez is deemed Lawson\u2019s employee by operation of Labor Code section 2750.5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That is because ATS was an unlicensed contractor and the tree trimming at issue required a license. <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 5, 12-16 [219 Cal.Rptr. 13, 706 P.2d 1146] [Lab. Code, \u00a7 2750.5 makes an unlicensed contractor who is performing work for which a license is required an employee of the hirer of the unlicensed contractor, for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation].)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">We therefore confront two issues in this case. First, must a homeowner who is an employer solely by virtue of section 2750.5 comply with OSHA tree trimming regulations, or is such tree trimming a \u201chousehold domestic service\u201d excluded from OSHA? The Courts of Appeal are in conflict on this issue. Second, may an unlicensed contractor\u2019s employee be estopped from claiming that he is the employee of the homeowner if he personally made no misrepresentations concerning the contractor\u2019s license status?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The Court of Appeal concluded tree trimming was not a household domestic service under the circumstances of this case, and that an unlicensed contractor\u2019s employee may be estopped by the contractor\u2019s licensing misrepresentations. We disagree on the first issue, and hence need not address the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Fernandez, who had worked for ATS for two years and had at least four years\u2019 experience trimming trees, was assigned to trim Lawson\u2019s tree. Fernandez fell from the tree during the trimming, sustaining serious injury. He sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits from Lawson. Lawson\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurer, not a party to this action, denied the claim on the ground Fernandez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>had not worked 52 hours and earned $100 in the 90 days preceding the injury, and thus did not fall within the statutory definition of an \u201cemployee\u201d eligible for benefits. (\u00a7\u00a7 3351, subd. (d), 3352, subd. (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Fernandez then sued Lawson for damages, ultimately asserting as relevant here violation of various safety regulations enacted pursuant to OSHA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lawson moved for and was granted summary judgment on the ground that OSHA did not apply to noncommercial tree trimming at a private residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The Court of Appeal reversed, holding the \u201ctrimming of Lawson\u2019s 50-foot palm tree\u201d was not a household domestic service \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d It expressly disagreed with <em>Rosas v. Dishong </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 815, 826 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 339] <em>(Rosas) </em>(\u201cLegislature intended to exclude private residence yard maintenance work, including tree trimming, from OSHA coverage under the \u2018household domestic service\u2019 exclusion\u201d). To determine whether tree trimming constituted \u201chousehold domestic service\u201d within the meaning of section 6303, and was thereby excluded from OSHA, the Court of Appeal reasoned, \u201cthe focus should be on the degree of skill or expertise involved and the training and competence required to safely and successfully perform the task. [][]... [T]he test for whether a tree trimming qualifies as a household domestic service should be whether an average member of the household has the skill and competence to undertake the activity. Under this test, the task of tree trimming (depending on the size and type of the tree and number of trees involved) may sometimes, but not always, qualify as a household domestic service. Ultimately, determining whether an average homeowner possesses the skill and competence to trim a particular tree or trees is a question of fact which should be decided on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>The court further held there were triable issues of fact as to whether Fernandez was bound by any alleged misrepresentation of Lascano concerning ATS\u2019s license status.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">We first consider whether Lawson was required to comply with OSHA tree trimming regulations as Fernandez\u2019s statutory employer. (See \u00a7 6304.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">OSHA requires that \u201c[ejvery employer shall furnish employment and a place of employment that is safe and healthful for the employees therein.\u201d (\u00a7 6400, subd. (a).) \u201cEmployment\u201d is defined as including \u201cthe carrying on of any trade, enterprise, project, industry, business, occupation, or work ... in which any person is engaged or permitted to work for hire, <em>except household domestic </em>service.\u201d (\u00a7 6303, subd. (b), italics added.) The issue here is whether, as a matter of law, a tree trimmer hired by a homeowner for a noncommercial purpose is engaged in \u201chousehold domestic service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">OSHA does not define \u201chousehold domestic service.\u201d Nor does the relevant legislative history offer any guidance on the meaning of the phrase. While the current OSHA was enacted in 1973, it traces its roots to the 1913 \u201c[W]orkmen\u2019s compensation, insurance and safety act.\u201d (Stats. 1913, ch. 176, \u00a7 1, p. 279.) In this act, \u201cemployment\u201d excluded \u201cpersons [who] are employed solely in . . . household domestic services.\u201d (Stats. 1913, ch. 176, \u00a7 51, p. 305.) This same phrase, \u201chousehold domestic service,\u201d consistently appears in all subsequent versions of the \u201cemployment\u201d definition. (Stats. 1917, ch. 586, \u00a7 33, p. 861; Stats. 1919, ch. 471, \u00a7 10, p. 923; Stats. 1923, ch. 90, \u00a7 1, pp. 165-166; Stats. 1929, ch. 249, \u00a7 1, p. 494; Stats. 1937, ch. 90, \u00a7 6303, p. 306; Stats. 1973, ch. 993, \u00a7 46, p. 1927; Stats. 1978, ch. 1248, \u00a7 1, p. 4060; Stats. 2001, ch. 807, \u00a7 1; Stats. 2002, ch. 368, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Generally speaking, \u201chousehold domestic service\u201d is understood to include work both within <em>and </em>outside a residence. (See <em>Catto </em>v. <em>Plant </em>(1927) 106 Conn. 236 [137 A. 764, 765-767] [gardener a \u201cdomestic servant\u201d]; <em>id. </em>at p. 766 [\u201cordinarily a domestic servant is one whose service is connected with the maintenance of the house and land connected with it\u201d].) Indeed, for purposes of regulating wages, hours, and working conditions for household occupations, the Industrial Welfare Commission defines \u201chousehold occupations\u201d in part as \u201call services related to the . . . maintenance of a private household or its premises by an employee of a private householder,\u201d including \u201cgardeners.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 11150, subd. 2(i).) Tree trimming is a service commonly performed by persons hired by homeowners to maintain residential premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Moreover, the purpose of the 1973 overhaul of OSHA was \u201cto allow the State of California to assume responsibility for development and enforcement of occupational safety and health standards under a state plan pursuant to Section 18 of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 . . . (Stats. 1973, ch. 993, \u00a7 107, pp. 1954-1955.) The 1972 proposed California plan stated that the former Division of Industrial Safety\u2019s \u201cauthority extends to virtually every place of employment in California .... [T]he principal exceptions are Federal government agencies, maritime workers, household domestic service workers, and railroad workers except those employed in railroad shops.\u201d (Agriculture &amp; Services Agency, Cal. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Plan (Sept. 25, 1972) \u00a7 3(B), p. III-1.) The exceptions noted for federal agencies, maritime workers, and railroad workers are for broad categories of employees. Viewed in this context, it is likely the term \u201chousehold domestic service workers\u201d similarly encompassed a broad category of workers performing tasks in- and outside of a private residence.  In subsequently enacting the 1973 enabling legislation, and using the term \u201chousehold domestic service\u201d in section 6303, subdivision (b) as an exception to covered \u201cemployment,\u201d the Legislature no doubt also intended to refer to a broad category of workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In addition, the term \u201chousehold domestic service\u201d implies duties that are personal to the homeowner, not those which relate to a commercial or business activity on the homeowner\u2019s part. While OSHA and its predecessors have operated for 90 years primarily in the commercial setting, we need not decide in this case whether a homeowner is subject to OSHA for noncommercial projects other than tree trimming. It is sufficient to note here that there is no indication Lawson wanted the palm tree trimmed for any commercial purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Finally, overwhelming public policy and practical considerations make it unlikely the Legislature intended the complex regulatory scheme that is OSHA to apply to a homeowner hiring a worker to perform tree trimming. It is doubtful the average homeowner realizes tree trimming can require a contractor\u2019s license, let alone \u201cexpect[s] that OSHA requirements would apply when they hire someone to trim a tree for their own personal benefit and not for a commercial purpose .... Moreover, homeowners are ill-equipped to understand or to comply with the specialized requirements of OSHA.\u201d <em>(Rosas, supra, </em>67 Cal.App.4th at p. 826.) Imputing OSHA liability to a homeowner under the circumstances of this case violates basic notions of fairness and notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Lawson asserts that of the 24 states that have federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration approved state plans (including California), \u201cno state has published an opinion finding that a homeowner who is not conducting business out of his home is nonetheless responsible for complying with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>OSHA in the process of home construction, work, or maintenance.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Fernandez does not argue otherwise, but simply states that none of the cases cited by Lawson involve a homeowner being deemed an employer as the statutory consequence of hiring an unlicensed contractor. Here, of course, we are addressing the specific meaning of \u201cemployment\u201d under OSHA, not the more general definition of \u201cemployer\u201d under section 2750.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The Court of Appeal concluded that \u201cthe test for whether a tree trimming qualifies as a household domestic service should be whether an average member of the household has the skill and competence to undertake the activity.\u201d Fernandez argues this is a \u201crational and predictable test for determining whether tree trimming is or is not subject to the \u2018household domestic service\u2019 exclusion under OSHA.\u201d Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. Rather, the Court of Appeal\u2019s approach creates massive uncertainty for a homeowner as to when OSHA would apply. Homeowners are in no position to assess whether they are an \u201caverage\u201d homeowner in terms of their tree trimming competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Fernandez argues that tree trimming cannot be considered a household domestic service because there are safety regulations concerning tree trimming. Even the Court of Appeal below, which otherwise ruled in Fernandez\u2019s favor, rejected this argument. As it observed, \u201c[t]ree trimming services are provided in a wide variety of business, commercial and public contexts. OSHA regulations for tree trimming are therefore necessary to govern instances where such services are provided in contexts other than for a private homeowner. Consequently, the fact such regulations exist does not automatically mean tree trimming must always fall outside OSHA\u2019s \u2018household domestic service\u2019 exclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Similarly, Fernandez argues that because a contractor\u2019s license is required to trim a tree 15 feet or more in height, trimming a 50-foot tree cannot be a household domestic service. A contractor\u2019s license is generally required for a variety of activities, including maintaining or servicing air conditioning, heating, or refrigeration equipment, or installing carpet. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7026.1, subd. (a), 7026.3, 7028, subd. (a).) It is not obvious we would conclude as a matter of law that such activities could never be considered household domestic services.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Having concluded Lawson is not subject to OSHA for noncommercial tree trimming, we need not reach the issue of whether Fernandez may be estopped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>from denying ATS\u2019s independent contractor status because of any licensing misrepresentations on the part of Lascano.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed and the case remanded to that court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">George, C.

Fund v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 5 [219 Cal.Rptr. 13, 706 P.2d 1146] <em>(State </em>Compensation), the parties in this case assume plaintiff Miguel Fernandez is deemed the employee of homeowners Thomas and Gaile Lawson (Lawson) by operation of Labor Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 2750.5<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>because Anthony\u2019s Tree Service (ATS) was unlicensed, and Fernandez was performing work for ATS which required a contractor\u2019s license. Were the question before us today, I would conclude <em>State Compensation </em>was wrongly decided and section 2750.5 has no such effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Section 2750.5 creates a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof that a worker performing services for which a contractor\u2019s license is required, or who is performing such services for a person who is required to obtain such a license, is an employee rather than an independent contractor. (\u00a7 2750.5.) Proof of independent contractor status includes satisfactory proof of the factors delineated in subdivisions (a), (b), and (c). The penultimate paragraph in section 2750.5 provides, \u201cIn addition to the factors contained in subdivisions (a), (b), and (c), any person performing any function or activity for which a license is required pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 7000) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code shall hold a valid contractors\u2019 license as a condition of having independent contractor status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In <em>State Compensation, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d 5, a ranch owner hired an unlicensed contractor <em>(id. </em>at p. 8) to \u201cconstruct a bedroom and a bath in the attic of his ranch house with a stairway providing access\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 7). The contractor fell from a scaffold and was rendered a quadriplegic. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 8.) The ranch owner, apparently not a party to the action, appeared by separate counsel in the review proceeding and argued the contractor was an employee. Similarly, in a personal injury action brought against him by the contractor, the ranch owner asserted that workers\u2019 compensation was the contractor\u2019s exclusive remedy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 7, fn. 1.) State Compensation Insurance Fund, the ranch owner\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer, argued the penultimate paragraph of section 2750.5 was only applicable when the worker was seeking independent contractor status and not when the worker was seeking employee status. <em>(State Compensation, </em>at p. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">This court disagreed, in particular concluding \u201cthe penultimate paragraph establishes a fourth factor necessary to rebut the presumption\u201d that a worker is an employee, not an independent contractor. <em>(State Compensation, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 12.) \u201c[B]y stating that a license is a condition of the status, the Legislature has unequivocally stated that the person lacking the requisite license may not be an independent contractor.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 15.) Thus, while the contractor arguably otherwise satisfied the test for being an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>independent contractor, because he was unlicensed he was held to be an employee entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(State Compensation, </em>at pp. 7-8, 12-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Justice Mosk filed a concurring opinion, expressing his \u201cconcern about the unfair burden effectively imposed on a class of hirers\u201d by Labor Code section 2750.5. <em>(State Compensation, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 16 (conc. opn. of Mosk, J.).) He noted that \u201cInsurance Code section 11590 requires comprehensive personal liability insurance policies to contain a provision for compensation insurance for \u2018employees,\u2019 as that term is defined in Labor Code section 3351, subdivision (d); [section 3352, subdivision (h),] however, expressly excludes, among others, any person employed for less than 52 hours during the 90 calendar days immediately preceding the date of the injury [citation]. Thus, policies drawn to incorporate [Insurance Code] section 11590 effectively fail to provide compensation insurance in the apparently common situation in which workers are engaged in fairly routine and minor repairs rather than major capital improvements.\u201d <em>(State Compensation, </em>at pp. 17-18.) Justice Lucas dissented, adopting the Court of Appeal opinion below, and concluding the language in Labor Code section 2750.5\u2019s penultimate paragraph simply meant that the contractor (as opposed to the ranch owner) could not assert independent contractor status unless he had a contractor\u2019s license. <em>(State Compensation, </em>at pp. 18-23 (dis. opn. of Lucas, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">In <em>State Compensation, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d 5, we did not consider the broader implications of concluding the homeowner was an employer under section 2750.5, perhaps because we were only focusing on workers\u2019 compensation coverage, and the homeowner had that coverage available. Here, while Lawson paid premiums for workers\u2019 compensation coverage, Fernandez fell outside the coverage provisions of workers\u2019 compensation by virtue of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>number of hours worked. Therefore, unlike the homeowner in <em>State Compensation, </em>whose \u201cemployee\u201d came within the coverage provisions of workers\u2019 compensation and workers\u2019 compensation was his exclusive remedy, Lawson is subject to civil liability as an employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Of course, the ramifications of placing employer status on unsuspecting homeowners hiring workers to do a discrete task the homeowner might never suspect would require a contractor\u2019s license are dramatic. Presumably, in the absence of any exclusion under the applicable law, homeowners become potentially liable not only for OSHA compliance, but COBRA health coverage benefits, sexual harassment claims, collective bargaining agreement enforcement, and a myriad of other obligations they are ill-equipped to anticipate or comply with. It seems unlikely the Legislature intended this result when it enacted section 2750.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Rather, it appears Justice Lucas and the Court of Appeal in <em>State Compensation </em>were correct that the language in section 2750.5\u2019s penultimate paragraph simply means that the contractor, as opposed to the homeowner, is precluded from asserting independent contractor status if he is not licensed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">As can be seen, section 2750.5, subdivision (c) already includes \u201cholding a license pursuant to the Business and Professions Code\u201d as one of the many cumulative factors to consider in determining whether the worker\u2019s independent contractor status is bona fide. It seems unlikely the Legislature nevertheless singled out this factor as a kind of \u201ctrump card,\u201d the absence of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>renders a worker an employee despite any other evidence of independent contractor status. Moreover, if the Legislature had intended the penultimate paragraph to be part of the criteria for rebutting the presumption a worker was an employee, it presumably would have made \u201chaving a license\u201d factor (d), along with the other three factors, not listed it in a different paragraph. Further, it would have deleted the reference in subdivision (c) to licensing.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Along these lines, the legislative history of section 2750.5 states, <em>\u201cThree </em>basic factors would have to be proved to show independent contractor status under this bill . . . .\u201d (Sen. Industrial Relations Com., Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3429 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 14, 1978, p. 2, italics added.) The analysis then summarizes the factors currently in section 2750.5, subdivisions (a) through (c). (Sen. Industrial Relations Com., Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3429, <em>supra, </em>p. 2.) \u201cFinally, this bill would require any contractor performing any function or activity for which a license is required from the Contractors\u2019 State Licensing Board to hold the required license as a condition of having independent contractor status.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In addition, the legislative history shows the bill was originally amended to read, \u201cIn addition to subdivisions (a), (b) and (c), any person claiming an independent contractor status shall have, in his possession, a valid contractor\u2019s license issued pursuant to the provisions contained in Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 7000) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code.\u201d (Assem. Bill No. 3429 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 7, 1978.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Indeed, the legislative history of section 2750.5 indicates the Legislature was concerned contractors were improperly characterizing those they hired as independent contractors instead of employees and thereby denying them union scale pay, and workers\u2019 compensation and unemployment insurance benefits. (Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 3429 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 12, 1978, p. 1 [\u201cThe need for this legislation stems from work agreements in the construction industry that tend to undermine collective bargaining agreements by using the guise of independent contractor to cover work that is normally done by employees, thus avoiding payment of union scale, workers compensation insurance and fringe benefits\u201d]; Sen. Floor Statement, Assem. Bill No. 3429 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) p. 1 [\u201cThis legislation is needed because of the huge increase in the number of contractors who are treating their employees as independent subcontractors in order to illegally escape payment of employee U[nemployment] Insurance] taxes, benefits, workers\u2019 compensation premiums, and other costs associated with employees. This situation is totally unfair and is competitively killing the honest contractor who plays by the rules\u201d].) There is no indication in the legislative history the Legislature intended section 2750.5 to apply to a homeowner who hires an unlicensed contractor. (Sen. Floor Statement, Assem. Bill No. 3429 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) p. 2 [\u201cThis bill only covers construction workers and doesn\u2019t cover other employers or employees\u201d].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Indeed, a contractor or construction worker would reasonably be expected to be familiar with licensing and safety law requirements, whereas the average homeowner would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Moreover, the <em>State Compensation </em>analysis leads to several anomalous results. As alluded to by Justice Lucas in his <em>State Compensation </em>dissent, in concluding the homeowner is an employer, we are providing either workers\u2019 compensation or tort recovery to a worker who committed a misdemeanor in performing unlicensed contracting work, but not providing such coverage or recovery to a contractor who actually complied with the law. <em>(State Compensation, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 21.) This is \u201cinconsistent with the purpose of the licensing laws.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Similarly, we create the ironic situation that while the homeowner, Lawson, did not have to pay Lascano, doing business as Anthony\u2019s Tree Service, because he was unlicensed (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 7031), Lawson is deemed his employer under section 2750.5, with concomitant workers\u2019 compensation or tort liability, because Lascano was unlicensed. And, most important, despite the fact that the legislative history of section 2750.5 never hints the statute would apply to a homeowner, we expose unsuspecting homeowners to a panoply of obligations the homeowner is likely unaware of and with which they have little ability to comply. This cannot be a proper interpretation of section 2750.5, and the Legislature should act promptly, by deleting or amending the penultimate paragraph of section 2750.5, to restore an apparently straightforward intent which has been undermined by the section\u2019s garbled syntax.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Baxter, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-9\"> All statutory references are to the Labor Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b77-10\"> Section 2750.5 provides: \u201cThere is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof that a worker performing services for which a license is required pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 7000) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code, or who is performing such services for a person who is required to obtain such a license is an employee rather than an independent contractor. Proof of independent contractor status includes satisfactory proof of these factors:</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">\u201c(a) That the individual has the right to control and discretion as to the manner of performance of the contract for services in that the result of the work and not the means by which it is accomplished is the primary factor bargained for.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">\u201c(b) That the individual is customarily engaged in an independently established business.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">\u201c(c) That the individual\u2019s independent contractor status is bona fide and not a subterfuge to avoid employee status. A bona fide independent contractor status is further evidenced by the presence of cumulative factors such as substantial investment other than personal services in the business, holding out to be in business for oneself, bargaining for a contract to complete a specific project for compensation by project rather than by time, control over the time and place the work is performed, supplying the tools or instrumentalities used in the work other than tools and instrumentalities normally and customarily provided by employees, hiring employees, performing work that is not ordinarily in the course of the principal\u2019s work, performing work that requires a particular skill, holding a license pursuant to the Business and Professions Code, the intent by the parties that the work relationship is of an independent contractor status, or that the relationship is not severable or terminable at will by the principal but gives rise to an action for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">\u201cIn addition to the factors contained in subdivisions (a), (b), and (c), any person performing any function or activity for which a license is required pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 7000) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code shall hold a valid contractors\u2019 license as a condition of having independent contractor status.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-15\">\u201cFor purposes of workers\u2019 compensation law, this presumption is a supplement to the existing statutory definitions of employee and independent contractor, and is not intended to lessen the coverage of employees under Division 4 and Division 5.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b79-10\"> (See, e.g., <em>Hunt Bldg.

Neither Lascano nor Fernandez is rendered an employee of Lawson by virtue of the penultimate paragraph of section 2750.5. Rather, this paragraph simply means that the contractor is precluded from asserting independent contractor status if he is not licensed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
