Proposition 21 operated, among other things, to amend juvenile court procedures, including Welfare and Institutions Code section 777.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As configured since 1986, section 777 allowed a more restrictive disposition for a person who, while already on juvenile probation for a criminal offense adjudicated under section 602, violated that probation by committing new misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">As pertinent here, Proposition 21 revised section 777 in two respects. First, before Proposition 21, the prosecutor could \u201callege[ ] a violation of a condition of probation amounting to a crime,\u201d and either the probation officer or the prosecutor could <em>\u201callege[ </em>] <em>a violation of a condition of probation not amounting to a crime.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 <em>777, </em>former subd. (a)(2), as amended by Stats. 1986, ch. 757, \u00a7 5, p. 2478, italics added (former section 777(a)(2)).) Proposition 21 deleted the initial nonitalicized phrase from section <em>777, </em>subdivision (a)(2) (section 777(a)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Second, before Proposition 21, the reasonable doubt standard governed all section 777(a)(2) proceedings, whether or not a crime was charged therein. (See <em>In re Arthur N. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 226, 240 [127 Cal.Rptr. 641, 545 P.2d 1345] <em>(Arthur N.); </em>Cal. Rules of Court, former rule 1392(d)(1), adopted eff. July 1, 1977, relettered subd. (e)(1) eff. Jan. 1, 1987, and repealed eff. July 1, 1989.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The current statute, which only covers probation violations <em>\u201cnot </em>amounting to . . . crime[s]\u201d (\u00a7 777(a)(2), italics added), allows proof \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Here, the new version of section <em>777 </em>was used to place Eddie M. (petitioner), then on juvenile probation for a prior criminal adjudication, in a more restrictive setting. The section <em>777 </em>motion claimed, and the juvenile court found, several probation violations. No breach of any penal law was averred or sustained in the section <em>777 </em>proceeding. No request or ruling was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>made to confine petitioner beyond the maximum term for his prior section 602 offense (see \u00a7\u00a7 726, 731).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Relying on <em>In re Marcus A. </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 423 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 919] <em>(Marcus </em>A.), petitioner contends that the \u201cnot amounting to a crime\u201d language in current section 777(a)(2) limits that section to probation violations objectively lacking the elements of crimes. He claims that to the extent his probation violations could be charged as crimes, Proposition 21 bars section 777\u2019s use, and relegates modification of his dispositional status to either a new section 602 proceeding or an adult criminal prosecution\u2014each requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Petitioner also contends the preponderance standard of proof authorized by section 777, subdivision (c) (section 777(c)) offends federal due process guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The Court of Appeal correctly rejected petitioner\u2019s approach.  In our view, the statute\u2019s language and long history make clear that an \u201callegefd]\u201d probation violation \u201cnot amounting to a crime\u201d covers <em>any </em>act <em>alleged </em>only as a probation violation. (\u00a7 777(a)(2).) By limiting the statute to probation violations not amounting to crimes, Proposition 21 simply ended prosecutorial use of section 777(a)(2) to seek new <em>criminal adjudications </em>against criminal juvenile probationers. Proposition 21 also relaxed certain procedures attending this prior practice. The new streamlined statute follows adult probation revocation procedures (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.2) by preserving executive discretion to seek a dispositional change for a criminal juvenile probationer who violates probation, regardless of the actual criminal nature of the violation alleged, without proving any crime beyond a reasonable doubt, so long as any resulting physical confinement does not exceed the maximum term of adult confinement tied to the original offense. The juvenile court also retains authority under section 777 to enforce its orders, including orders barring new crimes, against criminal probationers. Moreover, because both juvenile and adult probation violation proceedings differ from criminal prosecutions in purpose, operation, and effect, juvenile probation violations, like their adult counterparts, can constitutionally be proven under section 777(c) by a preponderance standard insufficient for conviction of a charged crime. Hence, we affirm the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">I. STATUTORY BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Section 602 extends juvenile court jurisdiction to persons who are under 18 years of age when they violate any law \u201cdefining crime.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (a); cf. \u00a7 601 [incorrigible youths].) A person found to satisfy section 602 comes under the dispositional jurisdiction of the court. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (a).) Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>jurisdiction often ends when the ward attains age 21, but a higher age limit sometimes applies. (\u00a7 607.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Probation officials investigate and refer juvenile criminal offenders to the prosecuting attorney. (E.g., \u00a7\u00a7 652, 653.5.) No section 602 case begins until the prosecutor files a petition under that statute on the People\u2019s behalf. (\u00a7\u00a7 650, subd. (c), 681, subd. (a).) The petition states which penal laws were violated and whether the offenses are felonies or misdemeanors. (\u00a7\u00a7 656, subd. (f), 656.1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The hearing is \u201cbifurcated.\u201d <em>(In re Gladys R. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 855, 859 [83 Cal.Rptr. 671, 464 P.2d 127].) At the jurisdictional phase, the juvenile court decides whether the petition concerns a person described in section 602. The Evidence Code applies. (\u00a7 701.) Under section 701, the petition cannot be sustained absent \u201c[p]roof beyond a reasonable doubt supported by evidence [ ] legally admissible in the trial of criminal cases.\u201d The court must declare whether the offense is a felony or misdemeanor. (\u00a7 702; <em>In re Manzy W. </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1199, 1203-1204 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 889, 930 P.2d 1255].)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Section 701\u2019s high standard of proof at the jurisdictional phase was added in response to <em>In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 90 S.Ct. 1068] <em>(Winship). (In re Manuel L. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 229, 235 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 865 P.2d 718], citing Stats. 1971, ch. 934, \u00a7 1, p. 1833.) The high court held that federal due process requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt when juveniles are charged with crimes. <em>(Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. at p. 368.) This rule applies at the jurisdictional stage of a criminal delinquency proceeding. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Less exacting rules govern disposition. No statute expressly subjects this phase to the Evidence Code. In addition to other relevant evidence (e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 656.2, subd. (a), 725.5), the court must consider the probation officer\u2019s report. (\u00a7 706; <em>In re Gladys R., supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 855, 859; see <em>In re Romeo C. </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1838, 1843-1845 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 85] [holding \u00a7 706 implicitly incorporates Evid. Code, \u00a7 352].)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">One outcome in section 602 cases is probation, which involves various forms of community release. <em>(In re Kazuo G. </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1, 8 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 155].) Like other juvenile sanctions, probation guides reform, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>promotes accountability, and protects the public. (\u00a7 202, subds. (b) &amp; (e)(3).) Some conditions are dictated by statute. (E.g., \u00a7\u00a7 729-729.3.) Others are discretionary. (See \u00a7 730, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Persons placed on juvenile probation for a criminal offense adjudicated under section 602 may, or may not, also be made wards of the court. A wardship declaration is required if a section 602 criminal probationer is removed from the physical custody of a parent or guardian. (See \u00a7\u00a7 725, 726, 727, 730.)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">For section 602 wards, an \u201cadditional alternative\u201d to probation is commitment to a county home, ranch, or camp. (\u00a7 730, subd. (a).) The most restrictive placement is the California Youth Authority (CYA). (See \u00a7\u00a7 731, 734.)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The court must find that CYA would likely benefit the ward (\u00a7 734), and that it otherwise serves the statutory aims. <em>(In re Ricky H. </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 176, 184 [178 Cal.Rptr. 324, 636 P.2d 13] <em>(Ricky H.).) </em>Nothing bars CYA for section 602 wards who have received no other placement. <em>(Ricky H., supra, </em>at p. 183; see <em>In re John H. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 18, 27 [145 Cal.Rptr. 357, 577 P.2d 177].)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">However, any order removing a section 602 ward from the custody of a parent or guardian must state, among other things, that \u201cphysical confinement\u201d cannot exceed \u201cthe maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the [same] offense or offenses.\u201d (\u00a7 726, subd. (c), 1st par.; see \u00a7 731, 2d par.) This rule took effect January 1, 1977. (Stats. 1976, ch. 1071, \u00a7 29, p. 4827; see <em>id., </em>\u00a7 30, p. 4829.) It seeks to prevent any unconstitutional disparity between the maximum confinements of juveniles and adults for both a first offense (see <em>People v. Olivas </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 236, 242-243, 257 [131 Cal.Rptr. 55, 551 P.2d 375]) and any subsequent offense (see <em>Arthur N., supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 226, 238-239).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">In late 1977, a ward\u2019s \u201cmaximum\u201d confinement on a single count was defined as the upper term prescribed under the Determinate Sentencing Act (DSA) (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170), plus enhancements. (\u00a7 726, subd. (c), 2d par., added by Stats. 1977, ch. 1238, \u00a7 1, p. 4158, eff. Oct. 1, 1977.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>1977 law allowed courts to \u201caggregate\u201d terms of confinement for multiple section 602 counts or petitions, including previously sustained petitions. (\u00a7 726, subd. (c), 3d par.) Aggregation follows the DSA formula for consecutive sentences, including enhancements. (See <em>In re Jovan B. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 801, 810, 812, 818 [863 P.2d 673].)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Section 777\u2014the statute at issue here\u2014has long allowed the juvenile court to modify disposition by ordering a more restrictive placement for a person previously found to have committed a criminal offense under section 602. <em>(In re Ronald E. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 315, 326 [137 Cal.Rptr. 781, 562 P.2d 684].) Between section 777\u2019s enactment in 1961, and Proposition 21\u2019s approval in 2000, the statute contemplated a \u201csupplemental petition\u201d alleging that the prior disposition was not \u201ceffective\u201d in reforming or protecting the section 602 ward or probationer. (Former \u00a7 777(a)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The section 777 \u201csupplemental petition\u201d came to be used in a wide range of situations against persons who were already section 602 wards and probationers. In some cases, the section 777 petition simply alleged a probation violation or other state of facts warranting a change in the disposition currently in effect for the prior offense. In other cases, new crimes were charged <em>as such, </em>producing consequences similar to those attending a <em>new section 602 </em>petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">In 1976, <em>Arthur N. </em>held that where section 777 was used to allege a new crime against a section 602 ward or probationer, the due process rule in <em>Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. 358, applied, and the supplemental petition must be sustained beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Arthur N., supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 226, 239-240.) <em>Arthur N. (id. </em>at pp. 235-239), declined to analogize section 777 \u201cnew crime\u201d proceedings to adult probation revocation proceedings involving a lower standard of proof. Finding no distinction between original (\u00a7 602) and supplemental (\u00a7 777) petitions alleging new crimes, <em>Arthur N., supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at page 240, further held that \u201cthe bifurcated hearing procedure\u201d established for section 602 proceedings applied in section 777 \u201cnew crime\u201d proceedings as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Effective July 1, 1977, the Judicial Council adopted new Juvenile Court Rules, including former .rule 1392(d)(1). This provision subjected all section <em>111 </em>jurisdictional hearings to the same procedures as section 602 jurisdictional hearings, including section 701\u2019s requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt supported by evidence admissible in criminal trials. The Advisory Committee comment explained that former rule 1392(d)(1) \u201cextend[ed]\u201d the reasonable doubt requirement to supplemental petitions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>which did not \u201ccharge[ ] new and different crim[es],\u201d and for which such a standard was not strictly \u201crequired\u201d by <em>Arthur N., supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 226. (Advisory Com. com., Deerings Ann. Codes, Rules (1980 ed.) foll, rule 1392, p. 423; see <em>In re Antonio A. </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 700, 705 [275 Cal.Rptr. 482] [applying same hearsay rules at \u00a7 602 and 777 jurisdictional phases].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">A few years later, this court clarified in <em>In re Michael B. </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 548 [169 Cal.Rptr. 723, 620 P.2d 173], that section <em>111 </em>was not the sole means of charging new crimes against persons already under section 602 jurisdiction. The alternatives were to file either a new section 602 petition or a \u201cunitary\u201d petition under both sections 602 and 777. <em>(In re Michael B., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at pp. 553, 554.) <em>In re Michael B. </em>held, however, that due process required notice of any intent to rely on previously sustained petitions, or, by charging new crimes, to aggregate and extend the maximum term of confinement. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Against this backdrop, the Legislature enacted the California Juvenile Probation Revocation Procedural Act of 1986 (the 1986 Act). (Stats. 1986, ch. 757, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5, pp. 2476, 2478.) This measure amended section 777(a)(2) to indicate that, with respect to section 602 wards and probationers, supplemental petitions applied to \u201c[probation] violations,\u201d and it also ended prosecutorial control over supplemental proceedings in such cases. (See \u00a7 <em>111, </em>former subd. (a), as amended by Stats. 1977, ch. 1241, \u00a7 9, p. 4184.) The 1986 Act gave prosecutors authority to file any supplemental petition \u201calleging]\u201d a probation violation \u201camounting to a crime.\u201d (Former \u00a7 777(a)(2).) The 1986 Act also allowed either the probation officer or the prosecutor to file a supplemental petition <em>\u201calleg[ing]\u201d </em>a probation violation <em>\u201cnot amounting to a crime.\u201d (Ibid., </em>italics added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>In 2000, Proposition 21 changed the scope of section 777 in section 602 cases. As pertinent here, voters deleted the provision allowing prosecutors to allege probation violations amounting to crimes. Now, for wards or probationers under section 602, section 777 applies in only one instance traceable to the 1986 Act\u2014a probation violation \u201cnot amounting to a crime.\u201d (\u00a7 777(a)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">With respect to procedural changes, Proposition 21 replaced the supplemental petition with a \u201cnotice\u201d provision. (\u00a7 777, subds. (a)(2) &amp; (b).) A \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard now applies. (\u00a7 777(c).) Other new language allows \u201creliable hearsay evidence\u201d insofar as it would be \u201cadmissible in an adult probation revocation hearing [under] <em>People v. Brown </em>[(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 452 [263 Cal.Rptr. 391] <em>(Brown)] </em>and any other relevant provision of law.\u201d (\u00a7 777(c).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">n. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">On October 18, 2000, petitioner was arrested for being under the influence of narcotics in public. He admitted ingesting methamphetamine, and the drug was found on his person. Petitioner, who turned age 18 on October 30, 2000, was a juvenile court ward, and was home on probation for a prior section 602 offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>On October 19, 2000, the district attorney filed a new section 602 petition alleging that petitioner possessed a controlled substance, a felony (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11377, subd. (a)), and was under the influence of a controlled substance, a misdemeanor <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 11550, subd. (a)). At the jurisdictional hearing on November 14, 2000, petitioner admitted both offenses, and the court sustained the petition. The dispositional hearing occurred immediately thereafter. Based on the probation report, the court knew about petitioner\u2019s gang affiliation, his prior juvenile crimes starting at age 12 (e.g., battery, grand theft, giving false information to police), and his two prior camp community placements. However, the court rejected the recommendation of CYA.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The court continued petitioner\u2019s wardship under section 602, removed him from parental custody, and ordered him committed to a camp community program for one year. The court continued petitioner\u2019s probation under conditions named and numbered in its order. Petitioner\u2019s maximum term of confinement for the two drug offenses was three years four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">On May 3, 2001, five months after petitioner arrived at Camp Resnick, the probation department moved under section 777 to terminate the placement and to commit petitioner to CYA. The motion, which bore the same docket number as the section 602 drug case, alleged that petitioner had violated probation on six different occasions. All six counts involved both condition No. 1 (obey all laws), and condition No. 2 (follow staff instructions). Count 5 also implicated condition No. 7 (do not leave camp without permission).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The section 777 hearing occurred June 20, 2001. At the jurisdictional phase, counts 1 and 4 were dismissed at the People\u2019s request. Camp employees and petitioner testified about the four other matters, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">Count 2 occurred December 23, 2000. Petitioner disrupted shower time by refusing to exchange his dirty county sweatshirt for a clean one, claiming it was his own property. Staff retrieved the item and sent petitioner to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) as discipline. Petitioner said he viewed staff\u2019s request as equivocal. He felt he did not need a new sweatshirt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">Count 3 occurred March 23, 2001, when petitioner caused a disturbance by refusing to stop reading at bedtime. He was sent to SHU. Petitioner said he meant no harm because others were still awake and he was not sleepy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">Count 5 occurred April 21, 2001, after family visitation in the camp gym. Violating staff instructions, petitioner left the supervised setting of the gym and escorted his family to the exit gate. He was stopped and sent to SHU. Petitioner denied any intent to defy orders or leave camp.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Count 6 occurred April 26, 2001. Petitioner initially refused to shave, as camp rules required. Once petitioner started shaving, he stopped midway and asked to see family pictures mailed to him at camp. After a one-hour standoff, staff sent petitioner to SHU. On the way, he entered a restricted area and opened staff\u2019s mailbox in order to retrieve the pictures. A staff member confronted petitioner. When petitioner refused to move or leave, several employees carried him away. Petitioner claimed that shaving harmed his skin, and that he thought he was allowed to enter the restricted area.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The People argued that petitioner\u2019s misconduct, though seemingly innocuous, disrupted camp routines, encouraged peer disobedience, and threatened staff control. Invoking section 777 as amended by Proposition 21, the People claimed all four counts were supported by a preponderance of the evidence. The juvenile court agreed and sustained the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">At disposition, a camp probation officer testified that petitioner defied authority in order to assert his manhood, and that other wards, most of whom were younger, viewed him as a leader. The witness opined that only CYA, which offered more structure and better counseling, could control petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Over counsel\u2019s objection, the juvenile court found that petitioner would likely benefit from CYA, rejected all other alternatives, and otherwise adopted the recommended disposition. The court noted that despite his desire to be treated as an adult, petitioner misbehaved at camp and committed crimes on probation at home. Petitioner was committed to CYA for the three-year four-month maximum term of confinement attending his section 602 drug offenses, less certain credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Petitioner appealed, urging that because several of his probation violations were criminal in nature, they could not be treated under section 777, and, in any event, they had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. For this proposition, he cited <em>Marcus A., supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">A divided Court of Appeal disagreed with <em>Marcus A., supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th 423, and held that, as a general rule, Proposition 21 does not exclude inherently criminal acts under section 777(a)(2), provided they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>alleged only as probation violations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court of Appeal majority determined that Proposition 21 sought to harmonize section 777 with adult probation revocation proceedings, and \u201cthereby completed] the process begun by the Legislature in 1986.\u201d The majority also determined that because no new criminal charge or longer term of confinement is involved, section 777, like the adult scheme, is not unconstitutional insofar as it employs a preponderance standard of proof. In a separate concurring opinion, one justice accepted petitioner\u2019s claim of statutory error, but opined that the requisite facts had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt in any event.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Petitioner sought review, challenging the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision on both statutory and constitutional grounds. We address both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">A. <em>Meaning of Section </em>777.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Like the court in <em>Marcus A., supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th 423, petitioner insists that section 777(a)(2) has always concerned the nature of the underlying conduct (criminal versus noncriminal) rather than the manner in which the state alleges and treats it (new crime versus probation violation). Under this view, section 777(a)(2)\u2019s limited application to probation violations \u201cnot amounting to . . . crime[s]\u201d excludes acts that constitute crimes, even though they may also violate probation. Petitioner repeats his appellate claim that, except for the bedtime reading incident in count 3, his probation violations involved criminal conduct and thus cannot be used to modify his placement under section 777.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Contrary to what petitioner claims, the plain meaning of the statute does not support his approach. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Birkett </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 226, 231 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 205, 980 P.2d 912] [plain meaning controls].) No literal reference to behavior\u2014criminal or noncriminal\u2014has ever appeared in section 777(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Indeed, in 1986, when section 777(a)(2) was first amended to describe probation violations based on whether they amounted to crimes, lawmakers knew how to define \u201cacts\u201d and the \u201ccommission\u201d or \u201cperpetration\u201d of conduct as criminal or not. (E.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 15 [defining \u201ccrime\u201d as an \u201cact committed or omitted\u201d in violation of penal law], 136, subd. (3) [defining \u201cvictim\u201d as person against whom crime is \u201cperpetrated\u201d].) Then, as now, the Legislature used similar language to characterize section 602 in neighboring sections of the Welfare and Institutions Code. (E.g., \u00a7\u00a7 656.2, subd. (a), 676.5, subd. (a) [\u00a7 602 involves \u201ccommission\u201d of criminal offenses].)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">By contrast, when the Legislature amended section 777(a)(2) in 1986, it made no direct reference to the \u201ccommission\u201d or \u201cperpetration\u201d of \u201cacts\u201d or \u201cconduct\u201d that violated a criminal law. Instead, the 1986 Act emphasized the phrase \u201c[probation] violation,\u201d then simply qualified <em>that </em>term based on whether the <em>violation \u201camount[ed\\ </em>to a crime.\u201d (Former \u00a7 777(a)(2), italics added.) Because the Legislature presumably knew how to draft statutes that targeted criminal <em>acts </em>or <em>conduct, </em>as such (see <em>People v. Harrison </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 321, 329 [256 Cal.Rptr. 401, 768 P.2d 1078]), we can reasonably infer that its failure to include such language in former section 777(a)(2) was intentional. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 434, 451 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 905, 903 P.2d 1037].) Thus, the phrase \u201cnot amounting to a crime,\u201d as used in the 1986 Act, evidently involved something <em>other than </em>the inherent criminal nature of the probation violation that triggered a request for a dispositional modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Under the same settled rules of construction, voters who approved Proposition 21 in 2000 also knew that section 777(a)(2) was not phrased in the manner petitioner suggests when they amended that section.  If Proposition 21 had intended section 777(a)(2) to apply to the \u201ccommission\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u201cconduct\u201d or the \u201cperpetration\u201d of \u201cacts\u201d that are inherently criminal, such language, modeled on similar neighboring statutes, could have been included in the initiative measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Moreover, petitioner\u2019s reading of the current version of section 777(a)(2) would treat as mere surplusage other language that the 1986 Act added and that Proposition 21 retained. (See <em>People v. Hicks </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 784, 794 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 469, 863 P.2d 714].)  Under that language, the modification request must <em>\u201callege[ </em>]\u201d a probation violation \u201cnot amounting to a crime.\u201d (\u00a7 777(a)(2), italics added.) According to both legal and nonlegal dictionaries, the verb \u201callege\u201d means to \u201cplead\u201d or \u201ccharge\u201d matters having legal significance, or to \u201caccuse\u201d or \u201cindict\u201d someone in court. (E.g., Roget\u2019s Internat. Thesaurus (6th ed. 2001) p. 440, col. 2; American Heritage Dict. (4th ed. 2000) p. 46, col. 1; 1 Oxford English Dict. (2d ed. 1989) p. 331, col. 3; West\u2019s Legal Thesaurus/Dict. (special deluxe ed. 1986) p. 42; Ballentine\u2019s Law Dict. (3d ed. 1969) p. 61, col. 2; Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict. (1965) p. 55, col. 2; see Burton, Legal Thesaurus (2d ed. 1992) p. 21, col. 2 [\u201calleged\u201d means \u201casserted formally\u201d].) This feature alone suggests that lawmakers and voters focused on how the authorities choose to treat\u2014i.e., to \u201callege[ ]\u201d\u2014new misconduct, rather than on the inherent criminal nature of those acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">By further stating that what must be \u201callege[d]\u201d is a <em>\u201cviolation of a condition of probation </em>not amounting to a crime,\u201d the Legislature and voters emphasized the nature of the legal pleadings and court proceedings. (\u00a7 777(a)(2), italics added.) Again, this language suggests that whether the statute applies rests on official discretion to <em>plead </em>new misconduct, even if inherently criminal, as a mere probation violation, and to forgo treating the act as a new crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Decisional law and practice guides shed little light on the \u201cnot amounting to a crime\u201d concept. Between 1986 and 2000, the courts largely assumed that because section 777(a)(2) embraced any alleged probation violation whether or not it was inherently criminal, no misconduct escaped the statute\u2019s reach. (E.g., <em>In re Marco A. </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1516, 1521 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 540] [probation violation for being AWOL from county facility amounts to crime depending on how alleged]; see 1 Waxman, Cal. Juvenile Court Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1998 supp.) \u00a7 11.41, pp. 234-235.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Serious debate over the meaning of section 777(a)(2) arose only after Proposition 21 deleted the reference to alleged probation violations \u201camounting to . . . crime[s].\u201d In <em>Marcus A., supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th 423, 427, the court summarily concluded that this change removed all criminal acts from section 777, and that the minor\u2019s illegal possession of cigarettes had been wrongly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>pled as a probation violation. However, the instant Court of Appeal basically rejected this approach and viewed the statute as excluding criminal <em>counts, </em>not criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Much like the present Court of Appeal, we do not read current section 777(a)(2) in the manner petitioner suggests. Absent any express limitation on the nature of the underlying act, and given the allusion to official charging discretion, the statute seems to cover any probation violation alleged in the section 777 notice, whether or not that act could otherwise be pled as a crime. Nevertheless, to confirm this view, we examine petitioner\u2019s arguments in light of the statute\u2019s long history. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wutzke </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 923, 935 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 447, 51 P.3d 310].)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Notably, petitioner avoids discussing the 1986 Act, which added the disputed language to section 777. But as indicated above, we assume voters were aware of the meaning and purpose of this amendment. The history of the 1986 Act shows that the phrase \u201cnot amounting to a crime\u201d allows probation violation proceedings even where the acts could otherwise be charged as crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">At the 1985-1986 Regular Session, Assemblywoman Mojonnier introduced Assembly Bill No. 3769 which, as amended, revised section <em>777.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As pertinent here, the bill originally divided authority to file section 777(a)(2) supplemental petitions between the prosecuting attorney and the probation officer, respectively, based on whether the section 602 ward or probationer was, or was not, \u201cin custody.\u201d (Assem. Bill No. 3769 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Feb. 21, 1986.) The same version of the bill also proposed amending section 653.5 to require the prosecutor to decide within five days of referral whether to invoke section 602 or section <em>777 </em>in out-of-custody cases\u2014steps that only prosecutors could take under then existing law. (Assem. Bill No. 3769 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Feb. 21, 1986.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The original bill arose from legislative concerns that prosecutors were overburdened with case referrals involving persons who were already under juvenile court jurisdiction as the result of prior section 602 adjudications, but were not in custody, and who committed new misconduct. Delays in charging new crimes and probation violations, it was believed, impaired juvenile court treatment and threatened public safety. By requiring prosecutors to quickly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>decide in such cases whether to file a new section 602 petition, or instead a supplemental petition under section 777, and by otherwise allowing probation officials to initiate section 777 proceedings, lawmakers sought to expedite the processing of section 777 matters involving \u201cfurther law or probation violations.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3769 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Feb. 21, 1986, p. 1.) In this regard, the bill was explicitly modeled on Penal Code section 1203.2, which allows probation officers to initiate revocation proceedings against adults for <em>any </em>probation violation, including the commission of new crimes. (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3769 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 8, 1986, p. 3.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Without repudiating these aims, the Legislature revised Assembly Bill No. 3769 only once, in the Assembly, to delete language allocating section 777 filing authority based on the offender\u2019s custodial status. Under the amended bill, which later became the 1986 Act, section 777 could be invoked by either probation officers or prosecutors when the petition \u201callege[d]\u201d a probation violation \u201cnot amounting to a crime,\u201d but only by prosecutors when the petition \u201callege[d]\u201d a violation \u201camounting to a crime.\u201d (Assem. Bill No. 3769 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 8, 1986.)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The final version of Assembly Bill No. 3769 resulted from concerns that the prior draft had inadvertently limited prosecutorial discretion to allege new criminal offenses under section 777. It became clear that if the bill did not grant prosecutors express authority to file supplemental petitions involving probation violations alleged as new crimes, probation officers would control \u201call out of custody 777 petitions, including those 777 petitions that <em>state that the violation of the court order is a law violation.\" </em>(SCOPO, letter to Assemblywoman Mojonnier, Mar. 28, 1986, italics added.) To prevent encroachment onto the People\u2019s exclusive authority to \u201cstate\u201d (or allege) a \u201claw violation\u201d (or crime), the \u201cnot amounting to a crime\u201d language was used to describe the section 777 petitions that both probation officers and prosecutors could file. Lawmakers assumed such matters would often involve noncriminal conduct. However, consistent with the express intent to follow the adult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>model, no such legal requirement was imposed. (See Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3769 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 8, 1986, pp. 2-5; Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3769 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 8, 1986, pp. 1-3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Thus, insofar as the 1986 Act gave both probation officers and prosecutors authority to \u201callege[ ]\u201d probation violations \u201cnot amounting to . . . crime[s],\u201d section 777(a)(2)\u2014like Penal Code section 1203.2\u2014covers both criminal and noncriminal acts. Only by allowing officials to initiate and expedite section 777 proceedings in the widest range of cases could juvenile \u201cstandards of accountability [follow] those in existence for adult probationers.\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 3769 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) 2 Stats. 1986, p. 2476.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">To defeat this view, petitioner invokes portions of Proposition 21 itself that do not directly address section 777. He observes that in these other sections, the initiative both permits and requires the People to file <em>certain </em>criminal charges in adult court without a prior judicial finding of unfitness in juvenile court. Petitioner also observes that the initiative enhances the punishment of <em>certain </em>juvenile crimes. We are therefore asked to infer that the voters, in amending section 777(a)(2) to omit probation violations alleged as crimes, intended <em>all </em>new crimes committed by persons already under section 602 jurisdiction to trigger the maximum punishment, and to limit the prosecutor\u2019s discretion to treat such conduct as mere probation violations affecting only the nature of the juvenile placement for the original crime. Under this view, new criminal conduct must be treated either as a section 602 offense (which can <em>lengthen </em>the maximum term of juvenile confinement), or as an adult crime (which can trigger a state prison term). Since petitioner was over the age of 18 when he violated probation, he implies that only the latter option is available here. (See \u00a7 602, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">We reject this analysis. Whatever limits Proposition 21 places on prosecutorial discretion to allege juvenile criminal conduct in a particular forum or proceeding, the initiative measure does so only with respect to certain violent and serious felonies, and felonies committed under certain aggravating circumstances. (E.g., \u00a7\u00a7 602, subd. (b), 707, subd. (d); see <em>Manduley, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th 537, 549-550.)  As petitioner suggests, no statute added or revised by Proposition 21 requires <em>all </em>criminal acts to be charged as substantive crimes in either juvenile or adult court, or otherwise alters the People\u2019s traditional role in deciding how to treat most offenses. Nor, as we have seen, does section 777(a)(2) expressly or implicitly ban criminal acts as probation violations. If Proposition 21 had made such a \u201cdrastic\u201d change in section 777, and had excluded <em>all </em>section 602 wards and probationers who criminally reoffend, voters \u201cwould have expressed this intent more clearly in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the statute itself.\u201d <em>(Western States Petroleum Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 572 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 139, 888 P.2d 1268].)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In a related vein, petitioner insists that his approach honors certain declarations in the ballot pamphlet. He notes that Proposition 21 protects the public from <em>\u201cthe most violent juvenile criminals and gang </em>offenders,\u201d such as \u201cRAPISTS AND MURDERERS.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 7, 2000) argument in favor of Prop. 21, p. 48.) Insofar as voters viewed the juvenile law as \u201cDANGEROUSLY LENIENT\u201d for some criminal acts, petitioner implies the initiative withdraws section 777 in all such cases. (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>argument in favor of Prop. 21, p 48.)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Petitioner oversimplifies the express purpose of Proposition 21, particularly with respect to statutory amendments affecting juvenile court procedures like section 777. Notwithstanding the clear intent to impose the full range of adult penalties on juveniles who commit the worst crimes, voters disclaimed any intent to <em>\u201cincarcerate kids for minor </em>offenses.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>argument in favor of Prop. 21, p. 48.) The measure itself explained that \u201cless serious offenders\u201d remain eligible for treatment under the juvenile scheme, including \u201cburglars, car thieves, and first time non-violent felons who have potential for rehabilitation.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>text of Prop. 21, p. 119.) Overall, changes to the Welfare and Institutions Code reportedly stressed \u201crehabilitative protocols over incarceration\u201d and greater \u201caccountability\u201d for all juvenile offenders. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Applying these principles, we start from the premise that many probation violations, including those that could be charged as crimes, do not involve violent or serious felonies of the kind targeted for adult treatment and harsh punishment under Proposition 21. As petitioner concedes in his briefs in this court, there is no guarantee that the People can prove beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014in either a section 602 proceeding or an adult criminal prosecution\u2014 all or even most conduct that violates both the criminal law and juvenile probation. (See \u00a7 701; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1096.) Here, the prosecutor implied at the section 777 hearing that petitioner\u2019s outbursts at camp could realistically be treated only as probation violations warranting a new juvenile placement. Petitioner agrees, noting that \u201c[n]one of these offenses were [sic] so grave that it cannot be said that [criminal] prosecution might have been rejected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Under such circumstances, if the prosecutor concludes in the lawful exercise of his discretion to forgo criminal charges in juvenile or adult court, and if section 777 is unavailable as a matter of law, reoffense by a section 602 ward and probationer would entail no specific statutory sanction. Such a potentially wide gap in the law would impair the ability of both the executive and judicial branches to guide youthful reform and to ensure accountability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>for all offenders properly within the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction. Here, petitioner seeks to eliminate section 777 as a sanction for his <em>most serious </em>probation violations (those involving criminal acts), which he committed between age 18 (when probation was last ordered) and age 21 (when juvenile court jurisdiction likely ends), <em>even though adult criminal prosecution is infeasible, </em>and, indeed, a new section 602 criminal adjudication in juvenile court is <em>prohibited. </em>Voters could not have meant to reward criminal juvenile probation violations in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Finally, a comparison of the juvenile and adult schemes after Proposition 21 amended section 777 shows that the voters knew criminal acts would no longer be formally alleged as crimes under section 777(a)(2). As suggested by the Court of Appeal, the voters made additional changes in order to <em>further </em>harmonize juvenile and adult probation violation procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">First, voters removed the \u201camounting to a crime\u201d language that was tied, under the 1986 Act, to the prosecution\u2019s exclusive crime-charging function. By withdrawing section 777 as a means of pleading and proving substantive crimes committed on probation, Proposition 21 requires prosecutors to use another statute for this purpose, namely, section 602. The same dichotomy exists in adult court, where probation can be revoked for criminal acts. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 681-685 [criminal actions], 1203.2 [probation revocation proceedings].)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Second, section 777(c) now contains the same preponderance of the evidence standard used to prove probation violations in adult revocation proceedings, including those based on criminal acts. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.2, subd. (a) (Penal Code section 1203.2(a)); <em>People v. Rodriguez </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 437, 439 [272 Cal.Rptr. 613, 795 P.2d 783] <em>(Rodriguez).) </em>As we discuss further below, crimes alleged in both juvenile and adult court must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 368.) Proposition 21\u2019s more relaxed standard of proof belies any intent to continue using section 777 to allege criminal conduct in the form of substantive crimes as opposed to probation violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Third, voters explicitly adopted special hearsay rules applicable in \u201cadult probation revocation hearing[s]\u201d and alluded to a line of decisions addressing the issue. (\u00a7 777(c), citing <em>Brown, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d 452.) Under this approach, hearsay evidence that is inadmissible to prove guilt in a criminal trial may be admissible to prove an adult probation violation under certain circumstances. <em>(Morrissey v. Brewer </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 471, 489 [33 L.Ed.2d 484, 92 S.Ct. 2593] <em>(Morrissey); Brown, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d 452, 454-455; see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Maki </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 707, 714-717 [217 Cal.Rptr. 676, 704 P.2d 743] [allowing admission of reliable records not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>subject to established hearsay exception]; <em>People v. Arreola </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1144, 1156-1159 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 631, 875 P.2d 736] [disallowing admission of court transcript absent good cause to forgo live testimony].) As with the standard of proof, Proposition 21\u2019s new hearsay rule departs from Evidence Code requirements for proving crimes alleged as such in section 602 jurisdictional hearings and criminal trials. Voters obviously intended that the treatment of a juvenile probationer\u2019s new misconduct, even if inherently criminal, as a mere probation violation under section 777 should parallel the treatment of similar new misconduct under the adult probationary scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In sum, by limiting section 777(a)(2) to matters \u201cnot amounting to . . . crime[s],\u201d Proposition 21 only affected the manner in which such violations are officially treated under the statute. Section 777(a)(2) covers all probation violations alleged as such, including those that are criminal in fact. The Court of Appeal therefore did not err in affirming the order modifying petitioner\u2019s disposition based on the probation violations alleged and sustained in juvenile court. We disapprove <em>In re Marcus A, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th 423, to the extent it reaches a contrary result.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">B. <em>Validity of Section </em>777.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Petitioner argues here, as below, that Proposition 21 violates federal and state due process guarantees by allowing probation violations to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. (\u00a7 777(c).) Even though substantive crimes can no longer be alleged as such under section 777, petitioner finds such proceedings indistinguishable from section 602 proceedings in juvenile court and from criminal trials in adult court. Petitioner claims that because probation violations may involve criminal conduct, and because section 777 inflicts punishment, the facts must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Much like the Court of Appeal, we reject the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">No United States Supreme Court case, including <em>Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. 358, compels or supports the result petitioner seeks. In <em>Winship, </em>officials invoked New York\u2019s juvenile delinquency scheme against a 12-year-old boy. The relevant statute literally covered any act that would constitute a \u201c \u2018crime\u2019 \u201d if done by an adult. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 359.) The petition alleged that the minor had committed \u201c \u2018the crime or crimes of Larceny\u2019 \u201d by entering a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>locker and stealing cash from someone\u2019s purse. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 360.) At the jurisdictional phase, the juvenile court sustained the theft charge under a state statute allowing proof by a preponderance of the evidence. The court also rejected the minor\u2019s claim that only the reasonable doubt standard could constitutionally apply. At the dispositional phase, the minor was committed to a training school for 18 months, subject to annual extensions until age 18. The judgment was affirmed on appeal in state court. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The high court reversed in a two-part decision that accepted the minor\u2019s federal constitutional claim. First, <em>Winship </em>reaffirmed that \u201cthe Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>(Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364.) According to the court, unique and invaluable interests are at stake when someone is formally charged with a crime. Defendants stand to lose their liberty if convicted, and to suffer the social stigma that only criminal conviction can bring. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 363.) The reasonable doubt standard, like the presumption of innocence, was essential in the court\u2019s view to protect innocent persons from erroneous findings of guilt. <em>(Ibid.) </em>By reducing the risk of such factual error, <em>Winship </em>also sought to buttress community confidence in the \u201cmoral force of the criminal law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 364.)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Second, <em>Winship </em>determined that the same interests apply, and the same need for accurate factfinding exists, where a juvenile is accused of a crime in juvenile court. The high court invoked <em>In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 87 S.Ct. 1428], which adopted other due process safeguards in criminal delinquency cases, and which rejected any notion that they differed \u201c \u2018in seriousness\u2019 \u201d from adult criminal prosecutions. <em>(Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. 358, 366.) <em>Winship </em>observed that, like a defendant convicted in criminal court, a juvenile offender is subject to \u201cthe stigma of a finding that he violated a criminal law and to the possibility of institutional confinement\u201d as the result of such finding. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 367, fn. omitted.) Hence, the court held that the reasonable doubt standard is as essential at the adjudicatory stage of a criminal delinquency proceeding as the other safeguards applied in <em>In re Gault, supra, </em>387 U.S. at pages 31-57\u2014notice of the charges, the right to counsel, the rights of confrontation and examination, and the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>(Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. 358, 368 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 90 S.Ct. 1068].)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\"><em>Winship </em>thus stands for the seminal proposition that juveniles, like adults, are entitled to proof beyond a reasonable doubt of all the elements of an alleged crime. This due process rule applies at the adjudicatory stage of a delinquency proceeding in which the state \u201ccharge[s]\u201d the juvenile with an act that would result in criminal conviction \u201cif committed by an adult.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>(Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. 358, 359, fn. omitted.) Nothing in <em>Winship </em>extends the same ratified standard of proof to either juvenile or adult proceedings involving allegations, interests, and consequences different from those at stake when a crime is alleged as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Indeed, it is well settled in the adult context that an alleged probation violation\u2014even one involving criminal conduct <em>in </em>fact\u2014does <em>not </em>trigger the reasonable doubt standard where the state seeks to use the violation only to modify or terminate probation or parole for a prior criminal conviction. The United States Supreme Court established this principle shortly after <em>Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. 358, when it announced the minimum safeguards due upon revocation for both adult parolees <em>(Morrissey, supra, </em>408 U.S. 471), and probationers <em>(Gagnon v. Scarpelli </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 778 [36 L.Ed.2d 656, 93 S.Ct. 1756] <em>(Scarpelli)). </em>We summarize these two cases here.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The premise of <em>Morrissey, supra, </em>408 U.S. 471, which was followed in <em>Scarpelli, supra, </em>411 U.S. 778, 782, is that criminal prosecutions and revocation proceedings are constitutionally distinct. The .high court observed that parole and probation conditions pressure the person to reform and allow the supervising officer to monitor compliance. <em>(Morrissey, supra, </em>408 U.S. at p. 478.) The court also recognized that parole and probation violations often involve the commission of \u201canother crime.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 479.) The court made clear, however, that revocation proceedings, in and of themselves, do not concern guilt of any criminal charges, or risk any increase in the maximum terms of confinement to which persons are exposed by virtue of their underlying convictions. <em>(Morrissey, supra, </em>408 U.S. at p. 480; <em>Scarpelli, supra, </em>411 U.S. at p. 781.) The narrow inquiry is whether conditional release has been violated, and whether parole or probation should be terminated as a result. <em>(Morrissey, supra, </em>408 U.S. at pp. 479-480.) Given these distinctions between criminal and revocation proceedings, the court found no constitutional basis on which to afford parolees and probationers \u201cthe full panoply of rights\u201d available in criminal trials. <em>(Morrissey, supra, </em>408 U.S. at p. 480; accord, <em>Scarpelli, supra, </em>411 U.S. at pp. 788-789.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In deciding what lesser process is due at an adult revocation hearing, the high court balanced the competing concerns. On the one hand, parolees and probationers possess a liberty interest which\u2014though diminished by the terms of conditional release\u2014deserves \u201csome orderly process, however informal.\u201d (Mo<em>rrissey, supra, </em>408 U.S. 471, 482.) On the other hand, because parole and probation violators often pose a threat to the public, the state has an \u201coverwhelming interest\u201d in imprisoning them \u201cwithout the burden of a new adversary criminal trial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 483.) <em>Morrissey </em>at pages 488-489, and <em>Scarpelli, supra, </em>411 U.S. 778, 790-791, specify the procedures that must be followed when parole or probation is terminated. Absent from the list <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>is any requirement that the facts be proven either beyond a reasonable doubt or by any other heightened standard of proof.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">This court followed suit in <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 437. Specifically, <em>Rodriguez </em>held that adult probation can be revoked under a standard of proof no more demanding than that used in an ordinary civil case. We found no due process basis for either a heightened reasonable doubt standard or an intermediate clear and convincing evidence standard. Thus, <em>Rodriguez </em>upheld Penal Code section 1203.2(a) insofar as it permits revocation where a probation violation is proved by a preponderance of the evidence. (51 Cal.3d at pp. 441-442.)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In reaching this result, <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 437, 441, implicitly distinguished <em>Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. 358, and followed <em>Morrissey, supra, </em>408 U.S. 471, and <em>Scarpelli, supra, </em>411 U.S. 778. We agreed with the latter cases that revocation deprives an adult probationer \u201c \u2018only of the conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special [ ] restrictions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Rodriguez, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 442.) We also observed that proceedings under Penal Code section 1203.2 are not part of any \u201c \u2018criminal prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Rodriguez, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 442.) In other words, revocation involves no criminal guilt, no criminal punishment, and no collateral consequences of a \u201cstigmatic, permanent, or irreversible\u201d nature. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 449 (conc. opn. of Lucas, C. J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Moreover, nothing in <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 437, suggested that the preponderance standard was constitutionally suspect depending upon the nature of either the offending conduct or the violated probationary term. Indeed, in upholding Penal Code section 1203.2(a), and in recognizing no exceptions to its reach, we observed that a higher standard of proof could force \u201coverburdened trial judges to give probationers virtually a second trial of their violations,\u201d and could cause \u201cpoor-risk convicted criminals [to] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>remain[ ] at large.\u201d <em>(Rodriguez, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 446.) In sum, we found that the preponderance standard was both constitutional and supported by sound public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">No meaningful difference exists between section 777(c) and Penal Code section 1203.2(a) in determining whether the preponderance standard satisfies due process at a probation violation hearing. In each case, nothing akin to a criminal prosecution is involved. We reject petitioner\u2019s contrary claims, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Preliminarily, juvenile probation violations, like their adult counterparts, do not involve criminal guilt. While section 777 continues to permit dispositional change for probation violations involving criminal conduct, the \u201cnot amounting to a crime\u201d limitation precludes prosecutorial use of the statute to plead and prove the violation <em>as </em>a crime. Thus, unlike criminal convictions or section 602 offenses, section <em>111 </em>adjudications do not entail the \u201cstigma of a finding that [the juvenile] violated a criminal law.\u201d <em>(Winship, supra, 397 </em>U.S. 358, 367, fn. omitted.)  Nor do such probation violations trigger other collateral consequences associated with convictions or section 602 adjudications. (See, e.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (d)(3) [subjecting certain violent or serious \u00a7 602 wardship adjudications to \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law].) Because section <em>777 </em>involves no formal criminal charge, the reasonable doubt standard need not constitutionally apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">In addition, section <em>777 </em>does not inflict or increase criminal punishment by any appreciable due process measure. A juvenile probation violation cannot increase the maximum period of confinement for the crime <em>previously adjudicated under section 602, </em>as calculated when the ward is \u201cremoved from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian as the result of [a section 602] order of wardship.\u201d (\u00a7 726, subd. (c), 1st par.) This maximum period of confinement equals the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed\u201d under the DSA or other applicable sentencing provision \u201cupon an adult convicted of the [same] offense.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As explained above, because section 777(a)(2) only governs \u201c[probation] violation[s]\u201d that are not \u201callegefd]\u201d as crimes, proceedings under this section do not lead to a <em>new criminal adjudication </em>that might increase the maximum period of confinement.  Thus, as reflected by petitioner\u2019s disposition, section <em>111 </em>follows the adult scheme insofar as probation violations do not trigger a term of confinement any longer than the maximum term for the underlying crime. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1203.2, subd. (c), 1203.1, subd. (a); <em>People v. Howard </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1081, 1087-1088 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 870, 946 P.2d 828].) By this measure, section <em>111 </em>makes no unfavorable penal change, and the preponderance standard can apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Petitioner observes, however, that a new, more restrictive placement can be ordered under section 777 while the juvenile is already confined for the maximum term attributable to the prior section 602 offense. He contrasts the situation of an adult probationer in which revocation involves the <em>most </em>restrictive form of custody, state prison. He also asserts that the juvenile scheme, unlike its adult counterpart, <em>requires </em>a gradual \u201cramping up\u201d of placement alternatives, from least to most restrictive, as justified by the person\u2019s behavior at earlier levels. Thus, according to petitioner, the \u201cqualitative\u201d dispositional changes ordered under section 777 after a juvenile violates probation are primarily punitive, are essentially mandatory, and are necessarily more restrictive than any placement the court could properly order at any earlier point in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">We disagree. Under section 202, juvenile proceedings are primarily \u201crehabilitative\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (b)), and punishment in the form of \u201cretribution\u201d is disallowed <em>(id., </em>subd. (e)). Within these bounds, the court has broad discretion to choose probation and/or various forms of custodial confinement in order to hold juveniles accountable for their behavior, and to protect the public. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (e).) The voters reaffirmed these basic principles when they approved Proposition 21, including changes to section 777. (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>text of Prop. 21, p. 119.)  Given these aims, and absent any contrary provision, juvenile placements need not follow any particular order under section 602 and section 777, including from the least to the most restrictive. <em>(In re Michael D. </em>(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1392, 1396 [234 Cal.Rptr. 103]; accord, <em>In re Teofilio A. </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 571, 575-576 [258 Cal.Rptr. 540].) Nor does the court necessarily abuse its discretion by ordering the most restrictive placement before other options have been tried. <em>(Ricky H., supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 176, 183; <em>In re John H., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 18, 27.) Thus, contrary to what petitioner claims, section 777 does not mandate more restrictive placements, or permit vindictive custodial change.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Petitioner insists <em>Arthur N., supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 226, compels us to invalidate section 777(c) on due process grounds. He is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">In <em>Arthur N., supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 226, 229-230, a section 602 ward and probationer was placed in CYA for a robbery alleged and sustained under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>section 777 in its pre-1986 form. <em>Arthur </em>TV. relied on <em>Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. 358, and accepted the minor\u2019s claim that the juvenile court violated his due process rights by adjudicating the robbery under a standard of proof other than beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Arthur </em>N., <em>supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at pp. 239-240.) By the same token, <em>Arthur </em>N. rejected the People\u2019s claim that a juvenile probation violation proceeding is similar for due process purposes to an adult probation revocation hearing in which the reasonable doubt standard does not apply. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 235-236.) Based on the two schemes as they <em>then </em>existed, <em>Arthur </em>N. noted that, unlike the sentence served when adult probation is revoked, confinement under section <em>111 </em>is not \u201cproportionate\u201d to the crime that triggered the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>(Arthur </em>N., <em>supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 239.) <em>Arthur </em>N. also assumed that any greater restraint ordered under section <em>777 </em>\u201cexceeds\u201d what was \u201cpermissible initially\u201d for the prior section 602 offense. <em>(Arthur </em>N., <em>supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 237.)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\"><em>Arthur </em>N., <em>supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 226, does not undermine the preponderance standard set forth in <em>current </em>section 777(c). <em>Arthur </em>N. based its reasonable doubt rule on the assumption that crimes could be pled and proven under section <em>111. </em>However, Proposition 21 transformed section 777(a)(2) into a probation violation procedure in which <em>no </em>criminal offense can be alleged. Nothing in <em>Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. 358, compels a reasonable doubt standard under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Other changes in the law over the last 27 years have undermined <em>Arthur </em>TV.\u2019s distinction between juvenile and adult probation violation proceedings for standard of proof purposes. The maximum period of confinement rule in section 726 was added and refined shortly after <em>Arthur </em>TV. was decided, and long before Proposition 21 amended section <em>111. </em>Now, much like adult probation violations triggering confinement for a term linked to the underlying conviction, section <em>111 </em>determinations do not increase the maximum period of confinement for the original section 602 offense. We also cannot assume that any new placement ordered under section <em>111 </em>\u201cexceeds\u201d what was \u201cpermissible initially.\u201d <em>(Arthur </em>N., <em>supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 226, 237.) The diverse priorities codified after <em>Arthur </em>N. was decided (see \u00a7 202), and the juvenile court\u2019s broad discretion in implementing them, defeat such a rigid, wholly punitive view of section <em>777 </em>as it now exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Accordingly, due process does not require application of the reasonable doubt standard to proceedings alleging a probation violation \u201cnot amounting to a crime\u201d under section 777(a)(2). The Court of Appeal did not err in rejecting petitioner\u2019s constitutional challenge to section 777(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>IV.

As the Attorney General seems to concede, a decision on the merits here is necessary to resolve the conflict as soon as possible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\"> Both the original and amended versions of the bill, and the bill digest, were drafted by the State Coalition of Probation Organizations (SCOPO). Legislative reports prepared in conjunction with Assembly Bill No. 3769 both allude and adhere to SCOPO documents explaining the measure. Indeed, there is virtually no substantive difference between legislative and SCOPO summaries of the bill. State archive materials for Assembly Bill No. 3769 include the SCOPO documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b536-7\"> Penal Code section 1203.2 remains largely unchanged since it appeared in materials related to Assembly Bill No. 3769 and the 1986 Act. Penal Code section 1203.2, subdivision (a) states, in part: \u201c[T]he court may revoke and terminate . . . probation if the interests of justice so require and the court, in its judgment, has reason to believe from the report of the probation officer or otherwise that the person <em>has violated any of the conditions of his or her probation, has become abandoned to improper associates or a vicious life, or has subsequently committed other offenses, regardless whether he or she has been prosecuted for such offenses.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Subdivision (b) of Penal Code section 1203.2 states, in part: \u201cUpon its own motion or <em>upon the petition of the .. . probation officer or the district attorney </em>. . . , the court may modify, revoke, or terminate the probation of the probationer pursuant to this subdivision.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b540-9\"> Of course, nothing we say here is intended to preclude use of the same conduct, if actually criminal, as the basis for both a section <em>111 </em>probation violation proceeding, and either a section 602 proceeding or an adult criminal prosecution, or to suggest that prosecuting authorities must make an election between probation revocation and a new criminal adjudication in such cases. (Cf. Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.2(a) [allowing revocation of adult probation \u201cregardless whether [the person] has been prosecuted for such offenses\u201d].) That question is not raised or decided in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b543-8\"> In <em>Morrissey, supra, </em>408 U.S. 471, 489, the court held that parolees must receive the following protections at revocation hearings: \u201c(a) written notice of the claimed violations of parole; (b) disclosure to the parolee of evidence against him; (c) opportunity to be heard in person and to' present witnesses and documentary evidence; (d) the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation); (e) a \u2018neutral and detached\u2019 hearing body such as a traditional parole board, members of which need not be judicial officers or lawyers; and (f) a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking parole.\u201d <em>Morrissey </em>further noted that the parole board is entitled to consider \u201cletters, affidavits, and other material that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In addition to the <em>Morrissey </em>requirements, <em>Scarpelli, supra, </em>411 U.S. 778, 790, held that both parolees and probationers may be entitled at the revocation hearing to appointed counsel on a limited \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b545-9\"> It bears emphasis that former section 502\u2014the predecessor to section 202\u2014stated an explicit preference for juvenile court treatment \u201cin [the minor\u2019s] own home.\u201d (Former \u00a7 502, repealed by Stats. 1976, ch. 1068, \u00a7\u00a7 1.5, 14, pp. 4741, 4781; see <em>In re Aline D. </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 557, 562 [121 Cal.Rptr. 816, 536 P.2d 65].) Given this priority, which has since been removed from the statutory scheme, it was understood that persons within the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction under section 602 would receive the most lenient disposition initially, and that more restrictive alternatives could be imposed only incrementally after less restrictive options had each been tried. In particular, CYA was considered a last resort, available \u201c \u2018only after all else ha[d] failed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Aline D., supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 564.) Under this inflexible view, dispositional change was necessarily \u201c \u2018punitive.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
