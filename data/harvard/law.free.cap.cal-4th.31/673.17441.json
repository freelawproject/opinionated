Code, \u00a7 187; all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise indicated), conspiracy to commit murder (\u00a7 182), attempted murder (\u00a7\u00a7 187, 664), discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling (\u00a7 246), and assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)), accompanied by a prior murder special-circumstance finding (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(2)). Defendant\u2019s appeal is automatic. (\u00a7 1239, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The special circumstance finding was based on defendant\u2019s 1980 Texas murder conviction following a guilty plea. Prior to trial on the charged offenses, a hearing was held to determine whether the Texas conviction was \u201cpunishable as murder\u201d in California, as required by section 190.2, subdivision (a)(2). Although the trial court refused to bind defendant over for trial on the prior murder special circumstance, the Court of Appeal reinstated the allegation, holding that the Texas murder conviction was for an offense that, under Texas law, included all elements of second degree murder, as defined by California law, thereby satisfying section 190.2. <em>(People v. Martinez </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 197 [281 Cal.Rptr. 205] <em>(Martinez).) </em>We unanimously denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">As will appear, the prior murder issue constitutes the centerpiece of defendant\u2019s appeal. We conclude that defendant\u2019s contention is barred by the doctrine of law of the case. On the merits, we further conclude that defendant\u2019s prior Texas murder conviction based on his guilty plea to unlawfully, knowingly and intentionally shooting his victim, was punishable as second degree murder under California law. As none of defendant\u2019s other contentions has merit, we will affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">The present murder count was based on the 1988 murder of Victor Castillo. Castillo and Jose Manuel Meza performed casual labor for defendant, putting roofs and trusses on buildings in the Riverside area. Defendant\u2019s friend Jose Abel Camacho also worked with these men. Defendant owed back wages to Castillo, Meza and some other laborers, but when confronted by these men, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>defendant showed hostility and reluctance to pay. On at least two occasions, defendant displayed firearms, including a machine gun. About a week before the murder, Raul Ibarra confronted defendant and told him to pay \u201call those guys\u201d the money he owed them. Defendant pointed a firearm at Ibarra and told him to mind his own business, an act that led to a weapons assault charge against defendant. On the day before Castillo\u2019s murder, Meza filed a complaint for back wages with the Labor Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">On the evening of November 4, 1988, Castillo joined Meza, Jose Borquez, and others talking and drinking beer outside a Victoria Street home where Meza\u2019s brother lived. Defendant drove by in his blue Toyota automobile, with Camacho his passenger. Castillo approached the car, and when he was about five feet away, defendant shouted \u201cHere you are, motherfucker,\u201d raised his AK-47 rifle, and fired at Castillo two or three times, killing him. Camacho was also armed with a rifle, but he pointed it at no one, perhaps because he had difficulty lowering the car window. After defendant drove away, the remaining men heard multiple gunshots from several blocks away.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Defendant next drove to Ibarra\u2019s home on Grove Street, where Leonardo Armenia was visiting. Armenia heard gunshots and went outside, where he saw defendant driving his blue Toyota. Someone else was with him, probably Camacho. As defendant approached the house, he raised an AK-47 rifle and commenced firing at Armenia, who ran inside. Armenia thought he could distinguish two different rifles being fired. Approximately 45 bullets were fired into the house, but no one was harmed\u2014although one bullet missed Armenia by only a foot. This incident led to the attempted murder and firearm discharge counts against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Officers Kilmer and Lino spotted defendant\u2019s car headed away from Riverside. One taillight was out and the car was weaving from side to side. The officers ordered defendant and Camacho to stop and exit the car. Defendant was unsteady and appeared to be intoxicated. The officers handcuffed the men and noticed the car\u2019s left and right rear windows were shattered. They discovered loaded firearms in the car and numerous spent casings scattered throughout. The officers performed a field sobriety test on defendant and concluded he was intoxicated. The officers arrested and transported defendant and Camacho to county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">A follow-up investigation produced additional circumstantial evidence further linking defendant with the crimes. We will discuss additional facts of record material to specific guilt phase issues in the course of resolving those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">The defense attempted to cast doubt on the prosecution\u2019s version of the shootings. Witnesses Meza and Borquez, contrary to their earlier testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>now indicated they did not see defendant shooting at them or Castillo. The defense also called Camacho, who denied that he or defendant fired shots at anyone, contrary to his earlier testimony at his own trial that defendant had fired his rifle at the Victoria and Grove Street locations. Camacho testified that on the day of the shootings, defendant and some other men spent two hours shooting and drinking beer. Camacho indicated that they had been drinking earlier as well, and that defendant drank many more beers than the other men. Later that day, defendant drank more beer and also used cocaine and speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Following the guilt verdicts, the prosecution presented uncontradicted evidence on the special circumstance allegation. The jury found true the allegation that defendant, on May 16, 1980, had been convicted of the crime of murder of Antonio LeFosse, in violation of section 19.02, subdivision (a)(1), of the Texas Penal Code, a special circumstance within the meaning of California Penal Code section 190.2, subdivision (a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">At the penalty phase, the People introduced the evidence underlying defendant\u2019s Texas homicide conviction. In brief, this evidence showed that defendant shot and killed cabdriver LeFosse during a fare dispute. Defendant signed a statement to Texas police indicating he shot LeFosse when the latter appeared to be reaching underneath the seat for a weapon. To shoot LeFosse, defendant admitted he first had to remove his pistol from his back pocket, pull back the slide, load a clip of bullets, extract a shell, then pull the slide forward to ensure it was ready for firing.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The People also introduced evidence of defendant\u2019s pointing a firearm at an apartment manager, Michael Pluim, in Riverside, and his possession of a homemade metal \u201cshank\u201d concealed in a mattress cover in his jail cell. The defense introduced evidence of defendant\u2019s Mexican background, his poverty and difficult upbringing, and his life in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">On rebuttal, the prosecutor introduced evidence of defendant\u2019s disciplinary problems in a Texas prison, his transfer to a Mexican prison, and his failure to report to authorities while on limited leave from that prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">II. PRETRIAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">A. <em>Validity of Prior Murder Special Circumstance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">California Penal Code section 190.2, subdivision (a)(2), allows a death sentence to be imposed if \u201c[t]he defendant was convicted previously of murder in the first or second degree .... [A]n offense committed in another jurisdiction, which if committed in California would be punishable as first or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>second degree murder, shall be deemed murder in the first or second degree.\u201d In the present case, the prosecution introduced evidence showing that in 1980 in Texas defendant pleaded guilty to \u201cunlawfully intentionally and knowingly causing the death of Antonio LeFosse, by shooting him with a gun.\u201d (See Tex. Pen. Code, \u00a7 19.02, subd. (b)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Prior to trial, defendant contended his Texas offense, as defined by Texas law in 1980, did not include California\u2019s requisite element of express or implied malice, and therefore would not have qualified as \u201cpunishable as . . . murder\u201d in California. As noted, defendant prevailed in this argument before the trial court, but the Court of Appeal reached a contrary conclusion. <em>(Martinez, </em>supra, 230 Cal.App.3d 197.) Nonetheless, defendant reasserts the issue here. Before reaching the merits of defendant\u2019s claim, we first examine the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision and then address the Attorney General\u2019s contention that the claim is barred by the doctrine of law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">1. <em>Court of Appeal Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The <em>Martinez </em>court noted that the trial court\u2019s decision was based on its conclusion that Texas law failed to recognize the doctrine of imperfect self-defense announced in <em>People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668, 674 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1], a doctrine that conceivably could have reduced defendant\u2019s crime to manslaughter. <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d at pp. 200-201.) In other words, the lower court relied on the possibility that defendant\u2019s Texas murder would not have been <em>punished </em>as murder at a trial held here. The Court of Appeal disagreed with that approach, finding <em>Flannel </em>irrelevant in determining whether the Texas offense was <em>punishable </em>as murder in California. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Andrews </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 200, 222-223 [260 Cal.Rptr. 583, 776 P.2d 285] <em>(Andrews).) </em>As the Court of Appeal stated, \u201c[w]e conclude that the magistrate and trial court, by focusing on whether Texas recognized a <em>Flannel </em>defense, were, in effect, attempting to determine whether defendant would have been <em>punished </em>for murder had he committed his offense in California. In other words, both judges apparently interpreted the phrase \u2018would be punishable\u2019 as requiring \u2018certainty of punishment\u2019 rather than \u2018the capacity therefor.\u2019 Under <em>Andrews, </em>the relevant inquiry is whether the offense of which the defendant was convicted in Texas <em>includes the elements of first or second degree murder in California </em>such that the Texas offense was one which had the capacity for punishment as first or second degree murder.\u201d <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d at pp. 202-203, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Turning to an analysis of the Texas and California <em>elements </em>of murder, the Court of Appeal believed that the Texas requirement that the defendant \u201cintentionally or knowingly causes . . . death\u201d (Tex. Pen. Code, \u00a7 19.02, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>subd. (b)(1)), was the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of California\u2019s requirement of an \u201cunlawful killing . . . with malice aforethought.\u201d (Cal. Pen. Code, \u00a7 187; see <em>Martinez, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d at p. 203.) The <em>Martinez </em>court concluded that defendant\u2019s Texas murder conviction included the elements of second degree murder under California law. <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>at p. 203.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The court continued by observing that in 1974, a revision of the Texas murder statutes introduced the terms \u201cintentionally\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d to help simplify and clarify the various culpable mental states for various crimes. This revision suggested to the <em>Martinez </em>court that these terms \u201cdo not create previously unknown mental states, but, rather, define the traditional mens rea concept of malice in more precise and comprehensible language. In other words, what distinguishes \u2018murder\u2019 in California from \u2018murder\u2019 in Texas is terminology, not substance.\u201d <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d at p. 204, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The court then examined the Texas statutes defining \u201cintentionally\u201d and \u201cknowingly,\u201d concluding that they respectively embodied the California concepts of express and implied malice. <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d at pp. 204-205.) Thus, under Texas Penal Code section 6.03, subdivision (a), \u201cA person acts intentionally, or with intent, with respect to the nature of his conduct or to a result of his conduct when it is his conscious objective or desire to engage in the conduct or cause the result.\u201d The <em>Martinez </em>court observed that an \u201cintentional\u201d murder under section 19.02, subdivision (a)(1), of the Texas Penal Code is one in which the defendant \u201c \u2018intended to engage in the act that caused the death . . . [and] . . . also . . . specifically intended that death result from that conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>at p. 204; see <em>Morrow </em>v. <em>State </em>(Tex.Crim.App. 1988) 753 S.W.2d 372, 375-376, fn. 3.) Thus, \u201c[i]n our view, the mental state which Texas law refers to as \u2018intentionally,\u2019 when applied to the Texas crime of murder, is simply another way of defining the mental state which California refers to as \u2018express malice,\u2019 that is, a deliberate intent to kill (\u00a7 188).\u201d <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>at pp. 204\u2014205.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Similarly, the <em>Martinez </em>court concluded that under Texas law, acting \u201cknowingly\u201d is equivalent to the California concept of acting with implied malice. Under Texas Penal Code section 6.03, subdivision (b), a person acts knowingly \u201cwhen he is aware of the nature of his conduct or that the circumstances [surrounding his conduct] exist,\u201d and is also \u201caware that his conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result.\u201d The <em>Martinez </em>court, finding no precise Texas case on point, opined that \u201c[t]he Texas mental state of \u2018knowingly\u2019 and the California mental state of \u2018implied malice\u2019 both focus on the subjective awareness, or knowledge, of the defendant. In Texas, a defendant knowingly causes the death of another, and thus commits murder, when the defendant is subjectively aware that death is \u2018reasonably certain to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>result\u2019 from the defendant\u2019s conduct. In California, a defendant kills another human being with implied malice, and likewise commits murder, when the defendant is subjectively aware of the life-threatening risk involved in the defendant\u2019s conduct. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Dellinger </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 1212, 1221 [264 Cal.Rptr. 841, 783 P.2d 200].) Based on the foregoing analysis, we conclude, as previously stated, that the Texas mental state of \u2018knowingly\u2019 includes each of the concepts embodied in the mental state of \u2018implied malice,\u2019 such that a \u2018knowing\u2019 killing in Texas is equivalent to a killing with \u2018implied malice\u2019 in California.\u201d <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d at pp. 205-206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The <em>Martinez </em>court concluded that, given the equivalence of Texas and California law as pertains to the mental states needed for first and second degree murder, defendant\u2019s Texas murder conviction was properly deemed a prior offense, \u201c \u2018which if committed in California would be punishable as second degree murder,\u2019 \u201d for purposes of section 190.2, subdivision (a)(2). <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d at p. 206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">2. <em>Law of the Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The Attorney General argues that, under the law of the case doctrine, defendant should not be allowed to reargue the issue. The Attorney General realizes, however, that \u201cthe doctrine will not be adhered to where its application will result in an unjust decision, e.g., where there has been a \u2018manifest misapplication of existing principles resulting in substantial injustice\u2019 [citation], or the controlling rules of law have been altered or clarified by a decision intervening between the first and second appellate determinations. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stanley </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 787 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 543, 897 P.2d 481].) Although the substantive issue presented here may be complex, and the elements of murder under Texas law in 1980 somewhat unclear, we cannot say that the <em>Martinez </em>court manifestly misapplied existing law, or that intervening decisions have clarified that law since <em>Martinez </em>was decided. Accordingly, we conclude that the law of the case doctrine applies here. Nonetheless, we will explore the substantive issue in some depth to demonstrate that no manifest misapplication of law occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">3. <em>Equivalence of Texas and California Elements of Murder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Defendant argues the <em>Martinez </em>court erred in finding that his 1980 Texas plea to \u201cunlawfully intentionally and knowingly\u201d shooting and killing a person qualified as an offense, \u201cwhich if committed in California would be punishable as first or second degree murder.\u201d (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(2).) He observes that in 1980 the Texas murder statute did not expressly require proof of malice, i.e., proof of either an unlawful intent to kill (required in California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>to show express malice) or an abandoned and malignant heart (required for implied malice). (See \u00a7 188.) Instead, defendant contends a Texas defendant could be convicted of murder if he merely intentionally or knowingly committed the act causing death, whether or not his act and intent were mitigated by his voluntary intoxication, unreasonable self-defense, or other justification or excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">As we will explain, defendant\u2019s Texas guilty plea to <em>both </em>intentionally <em>and </em>knowingly shooting his victim eliminated any uncertainty as to whether his act qualified, at the least, as an <em>implied </em>malice murder under California law.  Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, such mitigating factors as imperfect self-defense or voluntary intoxication are not elements of the offense of murder in this state. We agree with the <em>Martinez </em>court that defendant\u2019s Texas murder conviction did indeed qualify as a prior murder for purposes of California\u2019s special circumstance provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">a. <em>California Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">In this state, \u201cmalice\u201d is defined by statute as \u201cexpress\u201d if the defendant intended \u201cunlawfully\u201d to kill his victim, and \u201cimplied\u201d if the killing was unprovoked or the circumstances showed \u201can abandoned and malignant heart.\u201d (\u00a7 188.) Defendant finds nothing in 1980 Texas law requiring such states of mind, an argument we explore below. But the quoted portion of the California statutory definition of implied malice has given way to a definition more meaningful to juries, so that malice is now deemed implied \u201c \u2018when the killing results from an intentional act, the natural consequences of which are dangerous to life, which act was deliberately performed by a person who knows that his conduct endangers the life of another and who acts with conscious disregard for life.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dellinger, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 1217; see CALJIC No. 8.11 [defining implied malice killing]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Rios </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 450, 460 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 512, 2 P.3d 1066]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Blakeley </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 82, 87-88 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 451, 999 P.2d 675]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitfield </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 437, 450 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 858, 868 P.2d 272].) Such conduct amounts to second degree murder, and for purposes of applying the <em>Andrews </em>elements test, these prerequisites are the sole elements of that offense. (See CALJIC No. 8.31.)  As explained below, by pleading guilty to intentionally and knowingly causing death by shooting, defendant acknowledged <em>at the least </em>committing an act meeting the foregoing California definition of <em>implied </em>malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Defendant observes that in California in 1980, unlike in Texas, the doctrine of imperfect self-defense allowed a defendant to negate malice by showing he was acting with an actual, though unreasonable, belief in the need to defend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>himself and thus did not intend to kill unlawfully or with an abandoned and malignant heart. (E.g., <em>People v. Flannel, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at pp. 674-680.) Similarly, in California, unlike Texas, a defendant could present evidence of his voluntary intoxication to show he did not act with the requisite mental state for the offense of murder. (E.g., <em>People v. Saille </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1103, 1115 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 364, 820 P.2d 588]; but see \u00a7 22, subd. (b), as amended in 1995 [voluntary intoxication admissible \u201csolely\u201d to show whether defendant lacked specific intent or, in a murder case, whether defendant \u201cpremeditated, deliberated, or harbored <em>express </em>malice aforethought\u201d (italics added)].) Language in <em>In re Christian S. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 768, 779-780 and footnote 4 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 33, 872 P.2d 574], suggests that a defendant may rely on the doctrine of imperfect self-defense, or voluntary intoxication, or on similar mitigating factors to defeat a claim that he acted with the <em>unlawful </em>intent required for either express <em>or implied </em>malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">But the unavailability of such mitigating theories under Texas law does not defeat application of the prior murder special circumstance in this case, for those mitigating factors are not elements of the offense of murder but are defensive matters, which may reduce murder to manslaughter by negating malice. We note that, if we were to adopt defendant\u2019s position and hold that, for purposes of applying the <em>Andrews </em>\u201celements\u201d test, \u201cunlawfulness\u201d or \u201cunlawful intent\u201d is an additional California element of murder lacking in Texas law, our holding effectively could disqualify <em>all </em>out-of-state murders for the prior murder special circumstance. Although given the opportunity to file supplemental authorities, appellate counsel has cited no other state that makes \u201cunlawfulness\u201d an essential element of the crime of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Thus, the absence of imperfect self-defense or voluntary intoxication is not an <em>element </em>of the offense of murder to be proved by the People. Instead, these doctrines are \u201cmitigating circumstances,\u201d which may reduce murder to manslaughter by negating malice. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Rios, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 461, and cases cited.) The defendant is obliged to \u201cproffer some showing on these issues sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt of his guilt of murder.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 461-462.) The problem with defendant\u2019s analysis is that it merely shows that it was <em>conceivable </em>he could have mounted a defense of voluntary intoxication, imperfect self-defense, or other mitigating circumstance, had he been tried in California rather than Texas, and had he chosen to defend rather than plead guilty. But because of his guilty plea, we have no way of knowing whether a successful defense to murder could have been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">As we stated in <em>Andrews, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at page 222, \u201c[defendant is attempting to characterize the words \u2018would be punishable\u2019 as if they were synonymous with the term \u2018would be punished.\u2019 \u2018Punishable\u2019 has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>defined as \u2018[d]eserving of or capable or liable to punishment; capable of being punished by law or right.\u2019 (Black\u2019s Law Dict. (5th ed. 1979) p. 1110, col. 1.) The word does not denote certainty of punishment, but only the capacity therefor .... [\u00b6] To accept defendant\u2019s statutory construction would mean that every time the prosecution alleged a murder conviction from a foreign jurisdiction, the trial court must determine whether the guilt ascertainment procedures of that jurisdiction afforded the same procedural protections as those in California. We do not read such a requirement into the statute.\u201d We further stated in <em>Andrews </em>that the intent underlying section 190.2, subdivision (a)(2), was to limit the use of foreign convictions to those that \u201cinclude all the elements of the offense of murder in California . . . .\u201d <em>(Andrews, supra, </em>at p. 223; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Trevino </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 237, 242-244 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 567, 27 P.3d 283].)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">We concluded in <em>Andrews </em>that because it would have been <em>\u201cpossible </em>for [the defendant] to have been convicted of murder\u201d in this state, the offense was \u201cpunishable\u201d.here. <em>(Andrews, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 223, italics added.) As will appear, by pleading guilty to unlawfully, intentionally, and knowingly shooting and killing someone, defendant in the present case admitted committing an act that had the <em>capacity </em>of being punished as murder in this state. In <em>Andrews's </em>words, it was entirely \u201cpossible\u201d to have convicted defendant of second degree murder in California. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">b. <em>Texas Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Did defendant\u2019s Texas murder include all the elements of a California murder, as required by Andrews? According to the Attorney General, and supported by <em>Martinez, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d at pages 205-206, in 1974, before defendant committed his Texas murder, Texas substantially adopted the Model Penal Code to simplify the criminal statutes <em>without changing the substantive law, </em>by discarding former references to mens rea and malice, and substituting language defining murder as \u201cintentionally or knowingly causing] the death of an individual.\u201d (Tex. Pen. Code, \u00a7 19.02, subd. (b)(1); see Tex. Pen. Code, \u00a7 6.03, subds. (a), (b) [defining these mental states].) Indeed, the framers of the Model Penal Code stated that \u201c[m]urder is defined in Section 210.2 to include cases where a criminal homicide is committed purposely, knowingly, or recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life,\u201d and opined that these \u201cconcepts provide a more satisfactory means of stating the culpability required for murder than did the older language of \u2018malice aforethought\u2019 and its derivatives.\u201d (Model Pen. Code &amp; Commentaries, com. to \u00a7 210, p. 2; see also <em>id., </em>pp. 13-19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">But we have found no decisions squarely equating the Texas murder statute\u2019s reference to intentionally or knowingly causing death with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>California concepts of express or implied malice. The Attorney General cites Texas cases supposedly so holding, but as defendant observes, they fail to go that far. (See <em>Dowden </em>v. <em>State </em>(Tex.Crim.App. 1988) 758 S.W.2d 264, 276 [dissent noted equivalence of California\u2019s requirement of malice and Texas\u2019s requisite \u201cintent to kill\u201d]; <em>Durrough v. State </em>(Tex.Crim.App. 1981) 620 S.W.2d 134, 138 [former Texas concept of malice \u201cnecessarily includes\u201d intentional conduct required under 1974 amendment]; <em>Luck v. State </em>(Tex.Crim.App. 1979) 588 S.W.2d 371, 374 [Texas court\u2019s post-1974 reference to concept of murder with malice].)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">On the other hand, defendant fails to cite Texas authorities holding that the 1974 adoption of the Model Penal Code definitions for the requisite mental states for murder necessarily abandoned the concepts of express or implied malice and created <em>lesser </em>standards in their place. Nor does he cite any Texas case in which a defendant was actually convicted of murder without requiring at least the equivalent of a conscious indifference to life. (See <em>Cook </em>v. <em>State </em>(Tex.Crim.App. 1994) 884 S.W.2d 485, 489-491 [Texas murder statute must be interpreted as requiring either intent or knowledge that the act will or may cause death]; <em>Morrow </em>v. <em>State </em>(Tex.Crim.App. 1988) 753 S.W.2d 372, 375-376, fn. 3 [\u201cintentional[]\u201d murder under the Texas murder statute is one in which the defendant <em>both </em>intended to engage in the act that caused the death and also specifically intended that death result from that conduct]; <em>Beggs v. State </em>(Tex.Crim.App. 1980) 597 S.W.2d 375, 377 [Texas murder statute focuses on the <em>result </em>of one\u2019s conduct, not merely its nature]; cf. <em>Holmes v. State </em>(Tex.App. 1992) 830 S.W.2d 263, 266 [\u201cintentional[]\u201d murder under Texas statute can include either an actual intent to kill or a conscious desire to commit the act causing death].)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Because Texas case law does not definitively settle the point, we look to the bare language of the Texas statutes. As noted, defendant pleaded guilty to the Texas offense of unlawfully intentionally and knowingly causing the death of his victim by shooting him. Thus, by his plea he admitted that he had the \u201cconscious objective or desire\u201d either to shoot or to kill. (Tex. Pen. Code, \u00a7 6.03, subd. (a) [defining \u201cintentionally\u201d].) Similarly, by acknowledging that he knowingly caused a death, his plea admitted he was \u201caware that his conduct [was] reasonably certain to cause\u201d death. (Tex. Pen. Code, \u00a7 6.03, subd. (b) [defining \u201cknowingly\u201d].) Consciously intending to shoot or kill someone, with knowledge that death is reasonably certain to occur, seems an <em>even more culpable act </em>than merely shooting someone with a conscious disregard for his life, an act that would be sufficient to constitute implied malice in California. <em>(People v. Rios, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 460.)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">As noted, Texas Penal Code section 6.03, subdivision (b), states that a person acts \u201cknowingly\u201d with respect to the nature of his conduct or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>surrounding circumstances \u201cwhen he is aware of the nature of his conduct or that the circumstances [surrounding his conduct] exist.\u201d The section continues, however, by stating that one acts knowingly \u201cwith respect to a result of his conduct when he is aware that his conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Defendant claims that under Texas Penal Code section 6.03, subdivision (b), he could have been convicted of murder if he simply was aware of the nature or circumstances surrounding his conduct. But he cites no cases so holding, and the last sentence of the subdivision seemingly also requires knowledge that death is reasonably certain to result from defendant\u2019s conduct. In other words, by admitting he knowingly caused a death, he admitted he was aware death was reasonably certain to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">In short, although Texas case law in 1980 may have been unclear as to whether a murder conviction could be based entirely on the defendant\u2019s intent to commit the act causing death, as opposed to an actual intent to kill, defendant\u2019s guilty plea included, and possibly exceeded, all the elements required by California law to constitute implied malice and second degree murder. That being so, the <em>Martinez </em>decision should be deemed law of the case, as that case involved no \u201c \u2018manifest misapplication of existing principles,\u2019 \u201d and no post <em>-Martinez </em>decisions have intervened to cast doubt on its holding. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stanley, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 787.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Our conclusion makes it unnecessary to reach the Attorney General\u2019s alternative argument that we properly may consider the facts and circumstances underlying the offense to which defendant pleaded guilty, facts that in this case were elicited during the penalty phase. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Trevino, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 241 [inquiring whether \u201cconduct\u201d of the offender satisfied all elements of California law]; <em>Andrews, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 223 [inquiring whether prior offense included \u201call the elements of the offense of murder in California\u201d]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 343, 345 [243 Cal.Rptr. 688, 748 P.2d 1150] [allowing reference to \u201centire record\u201d in determining whether prior offense was \u201cserious felony\u201d for purposes of sentence enhancement].) Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, our reliance on the wording of the Texas indictment to determine what crime defendant committed would not constitute improper consideration of extraneous \u201cfacts and circumstances underlying the offense.\u201d In order to apply the \u201celements\u201d test of <em>Andrews, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pages 222-223, we certainly must know, at the least, the crime to which defendant pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">B. <em>Statements of Prospective Juror Paul N.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">During voir dire, and in the presence of 10 of the 12 jurors who ultimately were selected for defendant\u2019s trial, the prosecutor questioned Prospective Juror Paul N. about the alcohol and drug rehabilitation facility he managed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Mr. N. described himself as a recovering substance abuser who had been in continual contact with alcoholics and drug addicts during his 11-year tenure, and claimed he had treated nearly 500 clients, approximately 120 successfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Mr. N. agreed, without defense objection, that \u201cin general\u201d his clients \u201cwhen they are intoxicated, realize what\u2019s going on.\u201d Over a subsequent defense objection that the prosecutor was making Mr. N. his \u201cexpert witness,\u201d Mr. N. was also permitted to confirm that people with alcohol problems sometimes \u201cmake excuses for themselves,\u201d by thinking \u201cthey are going to do one thing and yet end[ing] up doing another\u201d and \u201cgo[ing] back to drinking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Defendant now characterizes Mr. N.\u2019s testimony as saying that persons such as defendant with alcohol problems \u201ccan and do plan their actions, although they may not always follow through to carry out their plans. He thus expressed an opinion as an \u2018expert\u2019 on a principal issue in [defendant\u2019s] case, i.e., whether [defendant] committed a planned intentional killing\u201d despite his claimed intoxication. In defendant\u2019s view, the trial court should have conducted further voir dire to determine whether the panel had become \u201cinfected\u201d by Mr. N.\u2019s statements. Defendant claims the error violated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to confrontation and an impartial jury. (See <em>Mach v. Stewart </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 137 F.3d 630, 633 [prospective juror in sex abuse case claimed expertise in the area and stated she had never seen a case in which the child victim\u2019s abuse claims ultimately were not borne out].)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s characterization, a fair reading of the record discloses that Mr. N.\u2019s comments primarily concerned a substance abuser\u2019s tendency to \u201cbackslide\u201d despite his good intentions, and not to his ability to plan or premeditate a crime while intoxicated. Although Mr. N. also agreed that generally intoxicated persons \u201crealize what\u2019s going on,\u201d defendant failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s question or defendant\u2019s response, which in any event was too broad and indefinite to be viewed as referring to defendant\u2019s ability to plan or premeditate a crime. Accordingly, we find no error in failing to conduct additional voir dire. That being so, we need not pass on the Attorney General\u2019s arguments that defendant waived the claim of error by (1) failing to request further voir dire questions or move to quash the venire, and (2) failing to exhaust his peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">III. GUILT PHASE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">A. <em>Court\u2019s Explanations and Instructions to the Jury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">Defendant argues the trial court violated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process and a fair trial by giving the jury explanations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>instructions which unduly favored the prosecution. Defendant complains that the court erred by telling the jury (1) Armenta did not testify because he could not be located, (2) the prosecutor was not to blame for the loss of certain missing physical evidence, and (3) defendant Martinez was also known as Jose Serrano Reyna. As will appear, defendant failed to make proper objection to, or request clarification of, these various statements. Moreover, whether viewed separately or together, these matters were far too minor to constitute prejudicial error. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hedgecock </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 395, 407 [272 Cal.Rptr. 803, 795 P.2d 1260 [due process violation for court to remove element of offense from jury\u2019s consideration]; <em>People v. Santana </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1207 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 158].)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">1. <em>Armenia\u2019s Absence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Although Armenta testified for the People at defendant\u2019s preliminary examination, he returned to Mexico before trial and could neither be compelled to appear nor located despite the prosecutor\u2019s reasonable diligence to find him. Accordingly, the People moved to introduce Armenia\u2019s earlier preliminary examination testimony. Before admitting it, the court, without defense objection, explained to the jury that Armenta was unavailable to testify because he could not be located.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Defendant now asserts the court\u2019s explanation was \u201cfalse\u201d in that the true reason Armenta was unavailable was because he was in Mexico beyond the court\u2019s process and refused to voluntarily testify for the People. Defendant points to testimony elicited at a preliminary hearing held on the question of the prosecutor\u2019s due diligence and showing that at one point the People were able to contact Armenta by phone but he refused to return to testify. Defendant asserts that the court\u2019s assertedly false statement as to the inability to locate Armenta impermissibly bolstered the credibility of Armenta\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The Attorney General notes that the court\u2019s explanation was fully supported by a later federal Justice Department letter to the effect that Armenta indeed could not be located. In any event, we fail to see how the court\u2019s explanation to the jury could possibly bear on or enhance the credibility of Amenta\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony. If defendant believed otherwise, he should have objected and proposed a correction or clarification. Clearly, he waived the point by not objecting on this ground. (E.g., <em>People v. Hawkins </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 920, 945 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 897 P.2d 574].)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">2. <em>Missing Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">Evidently, the prosecutor misplaced an envelope containing some glass fragments found at the Grove Street crime scene. This evidence had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>admitted at Camacho\u2019s separate trial, but could not be located by the time defendant was tried. Rather than rule evidence of these fragments inadmissible as defendant requested, the court instead explained to the jury that, following an officer\u2019s testimony regarding the fragments found on Grove Street, an envelope containing some fragments was \u201clost,\u201d possibly by the court clerk. Although defendant had earlier argued against admitting any evidence of these fragments, he failed to object to the court\u2019s explanation to the jury, and likewise sought no clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Defendant now argues the court\u2019s foregoing explanatory statement was factually inaccurate, in that the prosecutor must be charged with misplacing the envelope, there being no evidence that court personnel were responsible. Defendant asserts the court\u2019s inaccurate statement \u201cimpermissibly bolstered the prosecution\u2019s credibility, relieved the prosecution of any need to explain why it could not show the jury pieces of physical evidence,\u201d and thereby violated defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. Defendant does not explain the significance of the missing evidence to the defense, and we fail to see how the court\u2019s explanation to the jury could possibly bear on or enhance the prosecution\u2019s credibility. Again, if defendant believed otherwise, he should have objected and proposed a correction or clarification. Clearly, he waived the point by not objecting.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">3. <em>Defendant\u2019s Use of an Alias</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The trial evidence showed that defendant often identified himself as Jose Serrano Reyna. He used that alias when he purchased the gun used to shoot victim Castillo as well as during other gun purchases, and he identified himself by that name to various officers and other persons. Defendant complains that \u201cwhatever factual dispute might have existed\u201d on the alias issue was \u201cobliterated\u201d by the court\u2019s frequent recitation, both in reading the information to the jury, and in the verdict forms themselves, that defendant Omar Fuentes Martinez was \u201calso known as Jose Serrano Reyna.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The Attorney General contends that because defendant never objected to these frequent recitations, he thereby waived the point. Although defendant argues that objections to instructions and verdict forms were unnecessary (see \u00a7 1259), he points to no contested issue whatever regarding his using an alias\u2014the record indicates the evidence was uncontradicted on the matter. We see no prejudicial error in the court\u2019s recitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">B. <em>Victim Photographs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">Defendant next asserts that his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial were violated by the admission at the guilt phase of (1) two live <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>photographs of victim Castillo and some of his relatives, and (2) two autopsy photographs, one depicting Castillo\u2019s face, and one his chest area surgically opened with a probe inserted to show the bullet\u2019s trajectory.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">1. <em>Live Photographs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The court permitted the prosecutor to admit two photographs of victim Castillo with some relatives. Defendant asserts these photographs were irrelevant, could only have worked to unduly prejudice defendant, and hence were inadmissible. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Osband </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 622, 677 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 26, 919 P.2d 640].)  The Attorney General observes, however, that the prosecutor used the photographs for identification purposes while examining five different witnesses, and also to identify Castillo as the subject in the autopsy photographs. Our cases have permitted similar uses of photographs of victims while alive. <em>(Ibid.; People v. DeSantis </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1198, 1230 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 628, 831 P.2d 1210].) We find no error in admitting these photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">2. <em>Autopsy Photographs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">The court also permitted the prosecutor to admit two autopsy photographs of victim Castillo. One photograph shows Castillo\u2019s face with one eye partially open, and was admitted for purposes of identification and comparison with the live photographs. The other photograph displays Castillo\u2019s chest area only, with a probe inserted to demonstrate the probable trajectory of the bullet. As the Attorney General argues, the facial photograph was used for a proper purpose, was neither gory nor gruesome, and could not have prejudiced the defense. As for the chest photograph, its value in demonstrating the bullet\u2019s trajectory was debatable but not wholly lacking. Although other less graphic photographs may have been more useful in this regard, we find no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretionary decision to admit the one at issue despite its unpleasant nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">Our decision in <em>People v. Scheid </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 348, 939 P.2d 748] is instructive.  There, in resolving a similar claim, we observed that the court\u2019s decision to admit victim photographs is a discretionary matter that we will not disturb on appeal unless the prejudicial effect of the photographs clearly outweighs their probative value. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 18; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 352.) We also noted that murder victim photographs need not be rejected merely because they are cumulative to other evidence in the case. <em>(Scheid, supra, </em>at p. 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">In the present case, we have examined the autopsy photographs in question, and although unpleasant to view, they are not unduly gruesome or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>inflammatory and, as previously noted, both bear some relevance to issues in the case. All photographs of murder victims are disturbing <em>(People v. Scheid, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 19), yet the photographs in question are no more graphic or gruesome than those we have encountered in other cases. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 302, 320-321 &amp; fn. 9 [208 Cal.Rptr. 196, 690 P.2d 669].) In sum, the trial court could properly decide, in its discretion, to admit these photographs as having probative value outweighing their potentially prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">IV. PENALTY PHASE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">A. <em>Victim Photographs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Echoing his guilt phase argument, defendant asserts his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial were violated by the admission at the penalty phase of the previously described photographs of victim Castillo and various relatives. Defendant argues the photographs were irrelevant to the penalty determination, being insufficient standing alone to show any impact on the victim\u2019s family. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 787, 832-836 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 696, 819 P.2d 436].) But as we have noted, these photographs were properly admitted at the guilt phase and, accordingly, were properly considered at the penalty phase as well. <em>(People v. Cooper </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d <em>771, </em>821 [281 Cal.Rptr. 90, 809 P.2d 865].) Moreover, no reasonable possibility of prejudice arose from the admission of these quite ordinary family photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">B. <em>Aggravating Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">1. <em>Evidence of Defendant\u2019s Possession of a Shank</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">Defendant next argues his constitutional rights were violated by admitting, pursuant to section 190.3, factor (b), evidence that he possessed a shank in his jail cell. The record shows that an inspection of defendant\u2019s cell revealed a shank or sharpened piece of metal concealed inside the mattress cover on defendant\u2019s bed. Defendant unsuccessfully objected to the admission of this evidence on the ground that possessing a shank did not amount to prior criminal activity involving an implied threat of force or violence. (See <em>ibid.) </em>He renews his argument here.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">Defendant acknowledges that we have often held that possession of weapons while incarcerated satisfies the statutory requirement of an implied threat. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Smithey </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 936, 1002-1003 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 243, 978 P.2d 1171], and cases cited; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(1990) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>50 Cal.3d 1158, 1186-1187 [270 Cal.Rptr. 286, 791 P.2d 965].) But he asks that we reconsider our decisions, arguing that no \u201c \u2018implied threat\u2019 can exist unless the defendant has committed an act or spoken words directed at an individual or group of persons <em>who can infer that the defendant has made a threat. </em>In other words, the term \u2018implied threat\u2019 necessarily connotes some form of communication . . . .\u201d  The argument is meritless, for section 190.3, factor (b), by its terms applies to either \u201cexpress or implied\u201d threats, and a communicated threat would constitute an <em>express </em>one. As we have held, mere possession of a potentially dangerous weapon in custody \u201c \u2018involves an implied threat of violence even where there is no evidence defendant used or displayed it in a provocative or threatening manner.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Smithey, <em>supra, </em>at p. 1002, quoting from an earlier case.)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Defendant also doubts the reliability of the evidence regarding his possession of the shank. He observes that no direct evidence was admitted that he made the shank, put it in his mattress cover, or ever used it.  But the record did show that for the six preceding months, defendant was the sole occupant of the cell, that jail staff frequently inspected for contraband such as shanks, and that such inspections routinely included mattresses and their covers. The shank had been placed in the four-inch-thick mattress cover near its top, and thus located beneath defendant\u2019s head as he reclined. We think such circumstantial evidence was sufficient to demonstrate defendant\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">2. <em>Rebuttal Evidence of Shooting at Texas Apartment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Defendant asserts the court erred in admitting, at the penalty phase, rebuttal character evidence to the effect that, in 1978, 15 years before the charged offense, defendant and an unidentified man had an armed confrontation outside a Texas apartment. Defendant\u2019s half brother, Evarardo Aviles, testified that he heard defendant yelling at and arguing with the other man, who was armed and was interested in seeing Aviles\u2019s girlfriend, Andaverde. Aviles knew that defendant was also usually armed with a small pistol. Being afraid for his safety, Aviles went inside his apartment and later heard shots being fired from two different weapons, but evidently no one was hit. Although he never saw who fired the guns, Aviles assumed that defendant and the other man had exchanged shots. Over defense objection based on the unreliability of this evidence, the trial court admitted it after holding a foundational hearing (Evid. Code, \u00a7 402) and ruling that, although the evidence would not qualify as aggravating evidence under Penal Code section 190.3, factor (b), it could be used to rebut defense testimony regarding defendant\u2019s good character and peaceful nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">We agree with defendant that the court erred in admitting this evidence, although the error was harmless. Although the prosecutor was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>rebut the defense\u2019s mitigating evidence that defendant was a peaceful person with evidence relating to that character trait (see, e.g., <em>People v. Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 730, 791 [230 Cal.Rptr. 667, 726 P.2d 113] [prosecutor allowed to present more \u201cbalanced picture\u201d of the defendant\u2019s personality]), Aviles\u2019s inconclusive and speculative testimony was wholly insufficient for this purpose. Without Aviles\u2019s knowing the circumstances surrounding the shooting incident, or even whether defendant participated in the shooting, his evidence was essentially valueless and should have been excluded. But as the Attorney General observes, any error was harmless in light of the inconclusive nature of the evidence and the weight of the other aggravating circumstances in the case, including the charged offense and the prior Texas murder. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Pinholster </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 865, 962 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 765, 824 P.2d 571] [admission of irrelevant aggravating evidence rarely reversible error]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 367, 426-427 [276 Cal.Rptr. 731, 802 P.2d 221] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">3. <em>Evidence of Defendant\u2019s Parole Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Defendant next argues the court erred in allowing the prosecutor to admit evidence showing that, by taking a job in Houston, Texas, defendant failed to comply with the conditions of his parole from a Mexican prison. The defense had elicited testimony from defendant\u2019s wife, Maria Bautista, to the effect that he was released from prison \u201cbecause his conduct was good.\u201d Bautista also testified she was unaware that defendant\u2019s trip to the United States was a violation of his parole, or that he was required to spend weekends in the nearest Mexican jail. On cross-examination, the prosecutor showed Bautista a document she had signed requiring defendant to report any address change that could interfere with the prison\u2019s surveillance over him. The prosecutor also called a Mexican prison director, Miguel Castro, who confirmed that defendant was released from prison on condition he report to the nearest Mexican jail for incarceration on weekends. According to Castro, persons not complying were subject to arrest and returned to prison. Defendant violated his parole by failing to appear for incarceration for 66 weekends.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Defendant argues the court erred in admitting the terms and circumstances of his release from the Mexican prison. In defendant\u2019s view, impeaching Bautista and admitting Castro\u2019s testimony was improper because the matter of defendant\u2019s release was wholly collateral to the penalty determination. The Attorney General responds that the foregoing evidence was appropriate to rebut the inference, arising from Bautista\u2019s direct testimony, that defendant was a well-behaved prisoner who complied with the conditions of his release. Although the challenged evidence was only marginally relevant to the penalty issue, we find no abuse of the court\u2019s broad discretion to permit such cross-examination or rebuttal. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>p. 791.) In any event, any error in admitting evidence of defendant\u2019s parole violation was harmless in light of the other aggravating circumstances in the case. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Kaurish </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 648, 702 [276 Cal.Rptr. 788, 802 P.2d 278] [probation violation evidence harmless]; <em>People v. Wright, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at pp. 427-429.)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">4. <em>Evidence of Defendant\u2019s Conduct in Texas Prison</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Defendant next complains of testimony by a Texas correctional officer, Raymond Sandoval, that he lost confidence in defendant as a result of two incidents which resulted in defendant\u2019s being given the lowest of three prisoner classifications. In one incident, defendant was involved in a nonviolent sit-down strike in the prison gym. The other incident arose when defendant was found in an unauthorized area where some inmates went to obtain bakery yeast to make alcoholic beverages. Sandoval admitted he knew of no other negative information regarding defendant and he thought defendant was a quiet person.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Following a foundational hearing (Evid. Code, \u00a7 402), the trial court admitted Sandoval\u2019s testimony to rebut defendant\u2019s own good character evidence, which included family testimony regarding his trustworthiness and reliability, and Bautista\u2019s testimony that defendant was released from Mexican prison due to his good conduct. Although defendant contends otherwise, we see no abuse of discretion in admitting Sandoval\u2019s testimony. In any event, in light of the remaining aggravating evidence in the case, Sandoval\u2019s testimony regarding defendant\u2019s relatively minor infractions could not have affected the jury\u2019s penalty verdict. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Silva </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 604, 636 [247 Cal.Rptr. 573, 754 P.2d 1070] [evidence of defendant\u2019s threat to kill guards deemed harmless].)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">5. <em>Evidence of Defendant\u2019s Relationship with Yvonne Eder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Defendant asserts the court erred in eliciting irrelevant evidence regarding his relationship with Yvonne Eder. Eder testified at the guilt phase regarding a prior offense in June 1988 when she was riding with defendant (known to her as Joe Reyna) and he was stopped by police who seized an automatic rifle from his car. On cross-examination, and over defendant\u2019s irrelevancy objection, the court itself elicited the fact that Eder was defendant\u2019s \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d Neither court nor counsel asked further questions regarding the nature of the relationship. During penalty phase oral argument, the prosecutor asked rhetorically, and without defense objection, \u201cWhat was [defendant] doing while his wife and children were at home in Chino? He was dating Yvonne Eder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">Defendant now claims the \u201cgirlfriend\u201d evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial, indicating to the jury that defendant had a girlfriend while married. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>the subject of Eder\u2019s relationship with defendant was relevant to explain her presence in the car when the gun was seized, to assist in establishing defendant\u2019s identity as Joe or Jose Reyna, and to aid the jury in evaluating Eder\u2019s testimony. In any event, in light of the other aggravating evidence in the case, any error in admitting Eder\u2019s unelaborated guilt phase statement was undoubtedly harmless to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">6. <em>Cumulative Effect of Errors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Although defendant contends the cumulative effect of the foregoing asserted evidentiary errors warrants reversal, as we have seen only one error occurred (admitting evidence regarding possible shooting at Texas apartment), and it was clearly harmless. <em>(Ante, </em>at p. 694.)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">C. <em>Instruction on Assault with a Deadly Weapon and Weapon Possession in Jail</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Defendant contends the court erred in instructing the jury, pursuant to CALJIC No. 8.87, that evidence had been introduced to show defendant committed murder, assault with a firearm, and possession of a weapon in jail, which offenses \u201cinvolve the express or implied use of force or violence or the threat of force or violence\u201d under Texas Penal Code section 19.03. With respect to the instruction\u2019s reference to assault with a firearm, defendant assumes it refers to the inconclusive evidence of his possible involvement in a 1978 shooting at a Texas apartment, an incident we agree did not qualify as aggravating evidence. <em>(Ante, </em>at pp. 694-695.) But as the Attorney General points out, the instruction was an appropriate reference to defendant\u2019s 1988 armed assault on apartment owner Pluim. Because the instruction further required the jury to find each aggravating offense occurred beyond a reasonable doubt before considering it, it is inconceivable the jury counted the 1978 Texas apartment incident as a significant aggravating factor, or that the instruction affected the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Defendant also complains of the instruction\u2019s reference to his possible weapon possession in jail because no evidence was admitted showing he actually or impliedly threatened anyone. But as we previously observed <em>(ante, </em>at p. 694), mere possession of a potentially dangerous weapon in custody involves an implied threat of violence under Texas Penal Code section 19.03. The instruction properly submitted defendant\u2019s weapon possession to the jury as a possible aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">D. <em>Response to Jury Inquiry Regarding Commutation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">Defendant asserts the court erred in responding to a jury inquiry regarding the finality of a life without parole sentence. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>The jury was instructed, pursuant to CALJIC Nos. 8.84 and 8.88, that the penalty for defendant shall be death or life imprisonment without possibility of parole. During its penalty deliberations, the jury sent a note inquiring whether defendant could be \u201cexchanged with Mexico like last time\u201d and whether \u201cthere is any way he can get out, if life without parole.\u201d Outside the jury\u2019s presence, counsel agreed the jury could be told that an exchange with Mexico was impossible, that the commutation power applies to both life without parole and death sentences, and that the jury should not consider commutation in determining the appropriate sentence. The court indicated to counsel it would tell the jury that in its experience commutation of a life without parole sentence would not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Thereafter, the court advised the jury that no exchange with Mexico would be possible, that the Governor could commute either sentence, but that the jury should not consider such speculative matters in deciding penalty. The court also commented that in its experience commutation \u201chas never happened, nor do I, as a trial judge expect it to ever happen.\u201d A juror then asked if \u201cthat is the only circumstance that would permit that?\u201d and the court replied that barring a \u201ccataclysmic earthquake\u201d destroying all prisons, commutation was the only \u201clegal way\u201d and with the Governor a \u201cpolitically elected official,\u201d it would not happen in the near future. The court repeated that the jurors should approach their deliberations as if the choice were between death and life without possibility of parole \u201cfor sure,\u201d and without considering the possibility of commutation in deciding penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Defendant made no objection to the court\u2019s explanatory response to the jury\u2019s questions and, accordingly waived his present argument. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hart </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 546, 656 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 132, 976 P.2d 683]; <em>People v. Carpenter </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 312, 360 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 935 P.2d 708].) In any event, his points lack merit.  Defendant first argues that the court misadvised the jurors regarding the ease with which a Governor could commute a life without parole sentence, failing to tell them that, by reason of defendant\u2019s prior record, no commutation would be possible without the agreement of four Supreme Court justices. (Cal. Const., art. V, \u00a7 8.) Yet our cases require no such detailed advice regarding judicial limitations on the Governor\u2019s commutation power. <em>(Hart, supra, </em>at pp. 655-656, and cases cited; but see <em>Coleman v. Calderon </em>(9th Cir. 2000) 210 F.3d 1047, 1051.)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Our review of the court\u2019s comments indicates it adequately explained the theoretical possibility of the commutation of a death or life-without-parole sentence, and cautioned the jurors not to consider the matter. (See <em>People v. Hovey </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 543, 584 [244 Cal.Rptr. 121, 749 P.2d 776]; <em>People v. Ramos </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 136, 159, fn. 12 [207 Cal.Rptr. 800, 689 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>430].) As we recently explained, and contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, nothing in <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>South Carolina </em>(2002) 534 U.S. 246 [151 L.Ed.2d 670, 122 S.Ct. 726], or <em>Shafer </em>v. <em>South Carolina </em>(2001) 532 U.S. 36 [149 L.Ed.2d 178, 121 S.Ct. 1263], suggests the court\u2019s instructions and explanations were inadequate. In those cases, unlike here, the court failed to tell jurors that the defendant would be ineligible for parole. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 581, 636 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 68 P.3d 302]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Prieto </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 226, 270 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 18, 66 P.3d 1123]; <em>People v. Snow </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 43, 123, 124 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 271, 65 P.3d 749].) Our cases hold that CALJIC Nos. 8.84 and 8.88, unlike the instructions given in <em>Shafer </em>or <em>Kelly, </em>adequately inform the jury of the defendant\u2019s ineligibility for parole. <em>(Prieto, supra, </em>at pp. 270-271; <em>People v. Smithey, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 1009.)</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Defendant also faults the court for suggesting the present Governor, or a successor, might be swayed politically to <em>release </em>a prisoner. Of course, nothing in the court\u2019s remarks did any such thing. In context, the court was proposing the opposite thesis, namely, that political considerations made it highly unlikely a commutation would ever occur. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Box </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 1153, 1198 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 69, 5 P.3d 130].) In any event, as noted, defense counsel acceded to the court\u2019s explanatory statement and thus waived any objection for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Defendant argues the court\u2019s explanatory statement, by inaccurately suggesting the Governor could unilaterally commute a death sentence and might do so for political reasons, thus degraded the jury\u2019s relative importance in the sentencing process and diminished the jurors\u2019 sense of responsibility. (See <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1985) 472 U.S. 320, 328-329 [86 L.Ed.2d 231, 105 S.Ct. 2633].)  After reading the court\u2019s entire statement in context, we find no reasonable possibility that any such degrading or diminishing occurred here. (See <em>People v. Hines </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 997, 1072-1074 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 594, 938 P.2d 388]; <em>People v. Fierro </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 173, 244-248 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 426, 821 P.2d 1302].) As previously noted, the court\u2019s explanation did <em>not </em>posit the possibility of a politically engendered commutation. Instead, the court made it clear that commutation was an unlikely event, and carefully and repeatedly told the jury not to consider the possibility of commutation in determining the appropriate penalty. Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Shafer v. South Carolina, supra, </em>532 U.S. 36, is misplaced. In <em>Shafer, </em>the trial court had merely instructed that life imprisonment \u201cmeans until the death of the defendant,\u201d and failed to clarify that parole was unavailable to the defendant. The <em>Shafer </em>court therefore deemed inadequate the trial court\u2019s subsequent admonishment not to \u201cconsider[]\u201d the availability of parole. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Finally, defendant argues the court\u2019s statement improperly told the jurors defendant could be released from prison by an earthquake if he were sentenced to life without parole. In defendant\u2019s view, the court\u2019s remarks \u201cinvited the jury to speculate about the possibility\u201d of an earthquake big enough to free him from confinement.  Although the court may have erred in mentioning the speculative possibility of an earthquake causing defendant\u2019s release, the error was harmless and could not possibly have affected the verdict. (See <em>People v. Hill </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 959, 1009-1011 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 475, 839 P.2d 984] [prosecutor\u2019s reference to an earthquake or other \u201cmiracles\u201d deemed harmless error].) Despite defendant\u2019s present concern, it is highly unlikely any juror chose death for him because of a concern that a \u201ccataclysmic earthquake\u201d might some day set him free. In any event, as noted, defense counsel acceded to the court\u2019s explanatory statement, including the earthquake reference, and thus waived any objection for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">E. <em>Miscellaneous Instructional Omissions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Defendant asserts the court erred, and violated his state and federal constitutional rights, in failing to instruct the jurors they must find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that (1) the aggravating circumstances were true, (2) they were so substantial as to outweigh the mitigating circumstances and justify a death verdict, and (3) death was the appropriate penalty. Defendant also complains of the court\u2019s failure to require jury unanimity regarding the applicable aggravating circumstances. We have recently and repeatedly rejected all these contentions. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Hughes </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 404-406 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 401, 39 P.3d 432]; <em>People v. Weaver </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 876, 991-993 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 29 P.3d 103]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carpenter, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at pp. 417-421; <em>People v. Bradford </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1005, 1057-1059 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 225, 929 P.2d 544].) We see no good reason to reexamine those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Defendant cites <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348], and <em>Ring </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(2002) 536 U.S. 584 [153 L.Ed.2d 556, 122 S.Ct. 2428], as justifying reconsideration of the foregoing decisions. These cases, however, have no application to the penalty phase procedures of this state. <em>(People v. Prieto, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at pp. 262-264; see <em>People v. Smith, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 642; <em>People v. Snow, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 126, fn. 32].)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the United States Supreme Court found a constitutional requirement that any <em>fact, </em>other than a prior conviction, which increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be formally charged, submitted to the fact finder, treated as a criminal element, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Apprendi v. New Jersey, supra, </em>530 U.S. at pp. 476-490.)  We see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>nothing in <em>Apprendi </em>that would require specific findings regarding the truth of the aggravating circumstances, their relative weight, or the appropriateness of a death penalty. (See also <em>Ring v. Arizona, supra, </em>536 U.S. at p. 602 [requiring jury finding beyond reasonable doubt as to <em>facts </em>essential to punishment]; <em>People v. Anderson </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 543, 589-590, fn. 14 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 575, 22 P.3d 347].)</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Defendant asserts the court erred in failing to require the jury to submit a statement of reasons supporting its death verdict. We have repeatedly held otherwise. (E.g., <em>People v. Diaz </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 495, 571-572 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 353, 834 P.2d 1171]; <em>People v. Frierson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 142, 179 [158 Cal.Rptr. 281, 599 P.2d 587].)</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Defendant contends the court should have instructed the jury that evidence of defendant\u2019s background could only be considered as mitigating evidence. We have rejected the contention that the instructions should identify the various aggravating and mitigating evidence. (E.g., <em>People v. Lewis </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 334, 395 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 272, 28 P.3d 34]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Box, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 1217; <em>People v. Medina </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 870, 909 [274 Cal.Rptr. 849, 799 P.2d 1282].) Defendant cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Hardy </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 86 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 825 P.2d 781] to support his theory the court erred in failing to instruct that evidence of a defendant\u2019s background can only be mitigating unless it falls under one of the permissible aggravating factors listed in section 190.3. But <em>Hardy </em>found it unnecessary to reach the question whether such an instruction was required, holding instead that no prejudicial error occurred, because no reasonable possibility existed that the jury improperly considered any of the defendant\u2019s background evidence as aggravating. <em>(Hardy, supra, </em>at pp. 207-208.) We reach the same conclusion here. Defendant points to a portion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument in which he attempted to rationalize or justify the severe punishment defendant\u2019s father inflicted on him on one occasion. Nothing in the argument, however, told the jury to deem defendant\u2019s background evidence an aggravating factor to be counted against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">F. <em>Automatic Motion to Modify</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Defendant next contends the court relied on inadmissible or irrelevant evidence in denying his motion to modify sentence (\u00a7 190.4). As the Attorney General observes, however, defendant made no contemporaneous objection to the ruling and, accordingly, waived the point for appeal. (See <em>People v. Riel </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1153, 1220 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 998 P.2d 969].) In any event, the point lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">Defendant\u2019s motion to modify emphasized such mitigating factors as his level of intoxication during his various offenses, his disadvantaged childhood, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>his current family relationship, and his ability to serve a life sentence without committing further acts of violence. The court, in its statement of reasons denying modification, cited as aggravating factors the circumstances of the charged crimes, the prior Texas murder special circumstance, and defendant\u2019s apparent custom of driving around with automatic weapons. The court acknowledged defendant\u2019s troubled background and found it was unfortunate but not a sufficient justification or excuse for murder, while defendant\u2019s current family relationship was \u201cmoderated\u201d by his apparent infidelity, and defendant also apparently \u201ccheat[ed] his employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">As for defendant\u2019s intoxication, the court faulted defendant for persisting in drinking after he had \u201cgotten into trouble previously on it.\u201d The court also doubted defendant was as intoxicated as he claimed, noting that his intoxication did not prevent him from picking an appropriate victim, expressing ill will toward him, and then shooting that victim in a surprise attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Defendant first argues the court improperly relied on his intoxication as an aggravating factor. (Cf. <em>People v. Hardy, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 207 [jury should not deem defendant\u2019s proffered background or character evidence aggravating].) But the record fails to support the claim. Rather than treat defendant\u2019s intoxication as an aggravating factor, the court merely explained why it did not consider this evidence to be sufficiently mitigating when balanced with the aggravating evidence. No error occurred here. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1188, 1222 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 240, 939 P.2d 354], and cases cited; <em>People v. Siripongs </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 548, 585 [247 Cal.Rptr. 729, 754 P.2d 1306].)</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Defendant also faults the Court for considering defendant\u2019s possible marital infidelity as an aggravating factor. But again, the court\u2019s remarks indicate it simply felt the evidence that defendant had a \u201cgirlfriend\u201d while still married diminished the mitigating force of his background and family evidence, and especially his wife\u2019s testimony that he was a good father and always treated her well. In any event, assuming error occurred, no reasonable possibility exists that the court\u2019s consideration of defendant\u2019s possible marital infidelity affected its ruling. As the court\u2019s statement of reasons makes clear, its decision was founded on the other, more substantial aggravating circumstances in the case. (See <em>People v. Avena </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 394, 448 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 301, 916 P.2d 1000]; <em>People v. Whitt </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 620, 660-661 [274 Cal.Rptr. 252, 798 P.2d 849].)</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Defendant contends that the court erred in assuming that his troubled background was not relevant to justify or excuse his offenses and therefore constituted an aggravating factor. (See <em>People v. Davenport </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 247, 288-290 [221 Cal.Rptr. 794, 710 P.2d 861].) To the contrary, we find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>nothing in the record indicating the court treated defendant\u2019s background evidence as aggravating or as wholly irrelevant to the penalty determination. The court merely acknowledged that although defendant\u2019s \u201cbackground of deprivation\u201d was a mitigating factor, it could not serve to excuse defendant\u2019s \u201cten-year history\u201d of violence. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Scott, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 1222.) As <em>Scott </em>explains, the court was entitled to evaluate the weight of defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence in determining whether to grant or deny his modification motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">G. <em>Constitutionality of Death Penalty Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Defendant asserts that this state\u2019s death penalty statute is unconstitutional in various respects, by (1) failing to rationally narrow the class of death-eligible defendants; (2) allowing the prosecutor unfettered discretion to charge a murder case as a capital offense; (3) failing to provide meaningful intercase or intracase proportionality review; and (4) requiring certain sentencing factors to be extreme or substantial in order to have mitigating effect. We have recently and repeatedly rejected these arguments, and defendant gives us no good reason to reconsider these authorities. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Weaver, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at pp. 989-992; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ochoa </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 398, 458-459, 462 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 324, 28 P.3d 78]; <em>People v. Box, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 1217; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crittenden </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 152-158 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 474, 885 P.2d 887].)</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">H. <em>Asserted Violation of International Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Defendant argues that imposing the death sentence on him, a citizen of Mexico, would violate international law and treaties and would require his death sentence be vacated. Defendant\u2019s premise is that, by reason of the various trial errors supposedly committed in his case, he was denied due process and a fair trial as guaranteed by international law. But as we have seen, no significant errors occurred here. Defendant also asserts that international law guarantees him the right to be free of racial discrimination, and that \u201cvarious studies\u201d show the death penalty is imposed in a racially discriminatory manner, but he alleges no facts of record indicating that any such discrimination occurred in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">In any event, we have repeatedly rejected similar arguments based on international law, and defendant gives us no good reason to reconsider these authorities. (See <em>People v. Ochoa, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 462; <em>People v. Jenkins </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 1055 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 997 P.2d 1044]; <em>People v. Ghent </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 739, 778-779 [239 Cal.Rptr. 82, 739 P.2d 1250].)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>I. <em>Lethal Injection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Defendant contends that death by lethal injection is cruel and unusual punishment. Again, we have recently and repeatedly rejected these arguments, and defendant gives us no good reason to reconsider these authorities. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Ochoa, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 464; <em>People v. Samayoa </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 795, 864 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 400, 938 P.2d 2]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Holt </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 619, 702 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 782, 937 P.2d 213].)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">J. <em>Correcting Abstract of Record</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Defendant observes that the abstract of judgment incorrectly recites that defendant was sentenced to \u201clife without the possibility of parole\u201d for the premeditated and deliberate attempted murder charged in count four. In fact, as the Attorney General acknowledges, the actual sentence was one of life <em>with </em>possibility of parole for this offense. We will order the judgment corrected. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 354 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 627, 885 P.2d 1040].)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">K. <em>Cumulative Effect of Errors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Defendant asserts that the cumulative effect of the various evidentiary and instructional errors in this case requires reversal of the judgment, but as we have seen, no serious errors occurred that, whether viewed individually or in combination, could possibly have affected the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">The judgment, as corrected (see pt. IV. J., <em>ante), </em>is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">George, C. J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Brown, J., and Moreno, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b742-12\">KENNARD, J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"AK6\">I concur in affirming the judgment as to guilt. I dissent, however, from the affirmance of the special circumstance finding and the sentence of death. The special circumstance finding is invalid because it is based on a prior murder conviction in another jurisdiction that does not include all the elements of murder under California law. The sentence of death is invalid because it is based on the invalid special circumstance finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">Under California\u2019s death penalty law, capital punishment may be imposed for the crime of first degree murder only if that crime was committed with one or more of the special circumstances listed in Penal Code section 190.2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>subdivision (a). Here, the information alleged and the jury found only one special circumstance, that defendant \u201cwas convicted previously of murder in the first or second degree\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(2)). For purposes of this special circumstance, \u201can offense committed in another jurisdiction, which if committed in California would be punishable as first or second degree murder, shall be deemed murder in the first or second degree.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As this court has explained, this provision limits qualifying foreign convictions to those that \u201cinclude all the elements of the offense of murder in California.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Andrews </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 200, 223 [260 Cal.Rptr. 583, 776 P.2d 285]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Trevino </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 237, 244 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 567, 27 P.3d 283].)</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Here, to prove the prior murder special circumstance, the prosecution introduced evidence that defendant was convicted of murder in Texas in 1980. The jury\u2019s prior murder special-circumstance finding is based entirely on this Texas conviction. The issue, then, is whether this Texas conviction \u201cinclude[s] all the elements of the offense of murder in California.\u201d <em>(People v. Andrews, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 223; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Trevino, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 244.) It does not. The reason it does not, briefly stated, is this: California law recognizes the doctrine of imperfect self-defense, under which a defendant who kills with an actual but unreasonable belief in the need for self-defense is not guilty of murder but may be guilty of manslaughter. Imperfect self-defense is not an affirmative defense; rather, it is inherent in the statutory definition of malice, which is an element of murder. Texas law does not recognize the doctrine of imperfect self-defense, and therefore a Texas murder conviction does not include the element of malice as defined by California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">To provide a fuller explanation of this reasoning, I begin with the statutory definition of murder in California as \u201cthe unlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus, <em>with malice </em>aforethought.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a), italics added.) This statutory definition makes \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d (which this court\u2019s opinions usually shorten to \u201cmalice\u201d) an element of murder. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Rios </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 450, 460 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 512, 2 P.3d 1066] [\u201cmurder includes ... the element of malice\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">California law recognizes two forms of malice: express malice and implied malice. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 188.) Under the statutory definitions, express malice exists when \u201cthere is manifested a deliberate intention <em>unlawfully </em>to take away the life of a fellow creature,\u201d and implied malice exists \u201cwhen no considerable provocation appears, or when the circumstances attending the killing show <em>an abandoned and malignant heart.\u201d (Ibid., </em>italics added.) As this court has explained, these statutory definitions of express and implied malice incorporate the doctrine of imperfect self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>In the statutory definition of express malice, the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d defines an essential characteristic. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Saille </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1103, 1114 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 364, 820 P.2d 588] [\u201cexpress malice and an intent unlawfully to kill are one and the same\u201d].) Because \u201c[a] person who actually believes in the need for self-defense necessarily believes he is acting lawfully\u201d <em>(In re Christian S. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 768, 778 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 33, 872 P.2d 574]), a person who kills intentionally while actually believing in the need for self-defense lacks the intent to kill <em>unlawfully </em>and thus lacks express malice <em>(id. </em>at pp. 778-780). If the belief in the need for self-defense is unreasonable, the killer, though not guilty of murder, may be guilty of voluntary manslaughter. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, under California law, express malice is intent to kill <em>without </em>an actual belief in the need for self-defense. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>People v. Lee </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 47, 81 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 625, 971 P.2d 1001] (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.); <em>People v. Breverman </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 142, 189 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 870, 960 P.2d 1094] (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">This court has construed the statutory definition of implied malice (Pen. Code, \u00a7 188 [\u201cwhen no considerable provocation appears, or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned or malignant heart\u201d]) to mean that the defendant \u201c <em>for a base, antisocial motive </em>and with wanton disregard for human life, does an act that involves a high degree of probability that it will result in death.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Christian S., supra, 7 </em>Cal.4th at p. 780, fn. 4.) As this court has explained, \u201c[a] defendant who acts with the requisite actual belief in the necessity for self-defense does not act with the base motive required for implied malice, i.e., with \u2018an abandoned and malignant heart.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>If the belief in the need for self-defense is unreasonable, the killer, though not guilty of murder, may be guilty of voluntary manslaughter. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, under California law, implied malice is the commission of an intentional act, the natural consequences of which are dangerous to life, with knowledge of the danger <em>(People v. Lasko </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 101, 107 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 441, 999 P.2d 666]), but <em>without </em>a genuine belief in the need for self-defense <em>(In re Christian S., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 780, fn. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Here, as mentioned above, the prosecution introduced evidence that defendant was convicted of the crime of murder in Texas in 1980, and the jury\u2019s prior murder special-circumstance finding is based on this conviction. As both the majority and the Attorney General concede (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 684.), Texas law does not recognize the doctrine of imperfect self-defense, so that a defendant who kills with an actual but unreasonable belief in the need for self-defense may be convicted of murder. Because Texas does not recognize imperfect self-defense, a Texas murder conviction does not include the element of malice, either express or implied, as defined by California law. Therefore, defendant\u2019s Texas murder conviction does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>\u201cinclude all the elements of the offense of murder in California\u201d <em>(People v. Andrews, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 223), and it cannot establish the prior murder special circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The majority summarily dismisses this argument with the assertion that \u201cthe absence of imperfect self-defense ... is not an <em>element </em>of the offense of murder to be proved by the People,\u201d but instead it is a \u201c \u2018mitigating circumstance[]\u2019 \u201d that, according to the majority, \u201cmay reduce murder to manslaughter by negating malice.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 685.) As support for this assertion the majority cites <em>People v. Rios, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at page 461. As <em>Rios </em>explains, however, <em>\u201c[i]mperfect self-defense </em>obviates malice because that most culpable of mental states \u2018cannot coexist\u2019 with an actual belief that the lethal act was necessary to avoid one\u2019s own death or serious injury at the victim\u2019s hand.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThus, where the defendant killed intentionally and unlawfully, evidence of... an actual, though unreasonable, belief in the need for self-defense, is relevant only to determine whether <em>malice has been established, </em>thus allowing a conviction <em>of murder, </em>or <em>has not been established, </em>thus precluding a murder conviction . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>These words are not obscure or ambiguous. They can mean only one thing; Malice as an element of the crime of murder under California law includes as an essential component the absence of imperfect self-defense. It necessarily follows that a foreign conviction, such as defendant\u2019s Texas murder conviction, that does not establish the absence of imperfect self-defense does not include the element of malice, and cannot support a prior murder special circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Moreover, it is the prosecution, not the defense, that has the burden of proof on the issue of imperfect self-defense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rios, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 462.) When a factual circumstance negates an element of the crime, as imperfect self-defense negates malice, the federal Constitution\u2019s due process guarantee requires the prosecution to bear the burden of proving the absence of that circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 684, 704 [44 L.Ed.2d 508, 95 S.Ct. 1881]; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Endell </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 850 F.2d 470, 472.) The elements of a crime are \u201c[t]hose constituent parts of a crime which must be proved by the prosecution to sustain a conviction.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979) p. 467.) To sustain a conviction for murder under California law, the prosecution must prove malice and, in so doing, must prove the absence of imperfect self-defense. Accordingly, the absence of imperfect self-defense is an element, or an essential component of an element, of the offense of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The Attorney General argues that a decision of the Court of Appeal holding that defendant\u2019s Texas murder conviction qualifies under the prior murder special circumstance <em>(People v. Martinez </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 197 [281 Cal.Rptr. 205]) established the law of the case that this court must adhere to. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>The doctrine of the law of the case, on which the Attorney General relies, applies in criminal as well as civil matters and even in death penalty cases. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stanley </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 786-787 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 543, 897 P.2d 481].) But the doctrine is intended merely to enhance judicial economy, and it is not applied when the earlier decision was a \u201cmanifest misapplication of existing principles resulting in substantial injustice\u201d <em>(People v. Shuey </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 835, 846 [120 Cal.Rptr. 83, 533 P.2d 211]), or when \u201cthe controlling rules of law have been altered or clarified by a decision intervening between the first and second appellate determinations\u201d <em>(People v. Stanley, supra, </em>at p. 787). Both of these exceptions exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Imposing the death penalty on a defendant for a killing without any qualifying special circumstance is a \u201csubstantial injustice\u201d under our law, which requires at least one special circumstance before capital punishment may even be considered. The Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was a \u201cmanifest misapplication of existing principles\u201d because the Court of Appeal did not recognize that the statutory definition of malice in California excludes any killing committed with an actual belief, whether reasonable or not, in the need for self-defense. This court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Christian S., supra, 7 </em>Cal.4th 768, which clarified the controlling rule of law\u2014that imperfect self-defense is inherent in the statutory definitions of express and implied malice\u2014was decided in 1994, three years <em>after </em>the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision, and thus it is an intervening decision establishing an exception to the doctrine of law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Like the majority (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 688.), I see no need to decide whether, as the Attorney General argues, this court may look beyond the statutory definition of murder in Texas to determine whether defendant\u2019s Texas conviction includes all the elements of murder in California. Nothing in the record of the Texas murder conviction (see <em>People v. Guerrero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 343, 345 [243 Cal.Rptr. 688, 748 P.2d 1150]) establishes that defendant did not kill with an actual belief in the need for self-defense. On the contrary, the presentence report includes defendant\u2019s statement that he drew his gun and fired the fatal shot because the victim \u201cappeared to be reaching underneath the seat for a weapon.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 680.)</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment as to guilt only and would reverse the judgment as to special circumstance and as to the penalty of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied November 12, 2003, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
