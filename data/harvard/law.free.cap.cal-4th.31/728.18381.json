We conclude it is not. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Plaintiff Jarrow Formulas, Inc. (Jarrow), a manufacturer of vitamins and nutritional supplements, engaged defendant Sandra Hogan LaMarche (individually and doing business as The Network, hereafter LaMarche), a graphic designer, to design labels for its products. A dispute arose about the ownership of certain artwork, and Jarrow sued LaMarche for rescission and fraud. Represented by defendant Mark Brutzkus, LaMarche cross-complained against Jarrow for slander of title and interference with economic advantage. Jarrow obtained a summary judgment and dismissal of the cross-complaint. After a bench trial on Jarrow\u2019s complaint, the court entered judgment in favor of LaMarche.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Subsequently, Jarrow filed this malicious prosecution action against both LaMarche and Brutzkus, alleging they had filed the cross-complaint in the prior action maliciously and without probable cause. LaMarche and Brutzkus moved to strike Jarrow\u2019s malicious prosecution complaint pursuant to section 425.16. The trial court denied the motion, stating that a malicious prosecution action is not subject to scrutiny under the anti-SLAPP statute. Defendants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">The Court of Appeal reversed, holding that a malicious prosecution cause of action can be subject to section 425.16. The court further held that both LaMarche and Brutzkus had satisfied their initial burden under the antiSLAPP statute of proving that Jarrow\u2019s malicious prosecution claim arose from acts in furtherance of their speech and petition rights (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1)) and that Jarrow did not meet its responsive burden of establishing a probability of success on the merits. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal directed the trial court to grant the anti-SLAPP motion. We granted Jarrow\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Section 425.16 provides, inter alia, that \u201cA cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Resolution of an anti-SLAPP motion \u201crequires the court to engage in a two-step process. First, the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity. The moving defendant\u2019s burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken \u2018in furtherance of the [defendant]\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue,\u2019 as defined in the statute. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) If the court finds such a showing has been made, it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.\u201d <em>(Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 67 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 507, 52 P.3d 685] <em>(Equilon).) </em>Since the trial court in this case denied LaMarche\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion on the ground that the statute\u2019s initial, \u201carising from,\u201d prong does not encompass malicious prosecution claims, it did not reach the statute\u2019s second, \u201cprobability of prevailing,\u201d prong. As noted, in reversing, the Court of Appeal ruled for defendants on both prongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">A. <em>\u201cArising from \u201d prong</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Our primary task in construing a statute is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Kelly Broadcasting Co. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 724 [257 Cal.Rptr. 708, 771 P.2d 406].) Where possible, \u201cwe follow the Legislature\u2019s intent, as exhibited by the plain meaning of the actual words of the law . . . .\u201d <em>(California Teachers Assn. v. Governing Bd. of Rialto Unified School Dist. </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 627, 632 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 671, 927 P.2d 1175].) Our anti-SLAPP jurisprudence heretofore has scrupulously honored this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">In <em>Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope and Opportunity </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 471, 969 P.2d 564] <em>(Briggs), </em>when first construing the \u201carising from\u201d prong of section 425.16, we held on the basis of the statute\u2019s plain language that a defendant moving specially to strike a cause of action arising from a statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration in a legally authorized official proceeding need not separately demonstrate that the statement or writing concerns an issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>public significance. <em>(Briggs, supra, </em>at p. 1109.) And in a trio of opinions issued last year, we held that the plain language of the \u201carising from\u201d prong encompasses any action based on protected speech or petitioning activity as defined in the statute <em>(Navellier </em>v. <em>Sletten </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 89-95 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 52 P.3d 703] <em>(Navellier)), </em>rejecting proposals that we judicially engraft the statute with requirements that defendants moving thereunder also prove the suit was intended to chill their speech <em>(Equilon, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 58) or actually had that effect <em>(City of Cotati v. Cashman </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 69, 75 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 519, 52 P.3d 695]).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">The Court of Appeal, in concluding that this malicious prosecution action falls within the anti-SLAPP statute\u2019s \u201carising from\u201d prong, adhered to our plain language approach. As we previously have observed, \u201cplainly read, section 425.16 encompasses any cause of action against a person arising from any statement or writing made in, or in connection with an issue under consideration or review by, an official proceeding or body.\u201d <em>(Briggs, supra, 19 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1113.) Consistently with that observation, the Court of Appeal held that this action, which is based on allegations that LaMarche and Brutzkus maliciously and without probable cause brought and maintained a cross-complaint against Jarrow in the course of a civil lawsuit, is subject to anti-SLAPP scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The Court of Appeal grounded its conclusion in the anti-SLAPP statute\u2019s express definition of a \u201ccause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) That definition, which is found in subdivision (e) of the statute, places within section 425.16\u2019s purview \u201cany written . . . statement or writing made before a . . . judicial proceeding,\u201d \u201cany written . . . statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a . . . judicial body,\u201d and \u201cany other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(1), (2) &amp; (4).) As the Court of Appeal noted, LaMarche was sued for filing a cross-complaint in the former municipal court and Brutzkus, her attorney, for written and oral statements he made while acting as an advocate for LaMarche in the municipal court action. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal reasoned, this action falls within the ambit of a \u201ccause of action against a person arising from any act . . . in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1)), as statutorily defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">As a plain language matter, the Court of Appeal unquestionably was correct. Indeed, the point is not disputed. Jarrow concedes that, by its terms, section 425.16 potentially may apply to every malicious prosecution action, because every such action arises from an underlying lawsuit, or petition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>judicial branch. By definition, a malicious prosecution suit alleges that the defendant committed a tort by filing a lawsuit. <em>(Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Bear Stearns &amp; Co. </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 1118, 1130-1131 [270 Cal.Rptr. 1, 791 P.2d 587].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, every Court of Appeal that has addressed the question has concluded that malicious prosecution causes of action fall within the purview of the anti-SLAPP statute. (See, e.g., <em>White v. Lieberman </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 210, 220-221 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 608]; <em>Mattel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Luce, Forward, Hamilton &amp; Scripps </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1188 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 794]; <em>Chavez </em>v. <em>Mendoza </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 1083, 1087-1088 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 825].) Courts in our sister states construing similar statues are in accord.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Even while conceding the plain language point, however, Jarrow argues there is no evidence the Legislature intended that section 425.16 apply to malicious prosecution claims. Jarrow misunderstands the point and purpose of plain language interpretation. \u201cThe plain language of the statute establishes what was intended by the Legislature.\u201d <em>(People v. Statum </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 682, 690 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 572, 50 P.3d 355].) \u201c \u2018If the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction, nor is it necessary to resort to [extrinsic] indicia of the intent of the Legislature ....\u2019\u201d <em>(People v. Talibdeen </em>(2000) 27 Cal.4th 1151, 1154 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 922, 46 P.3d 388].) The anti-SLAPP statute is not ambiguous with respect to whether its protection of \u201cany act\u201d furthering protected rights encompasses suing for malicious prosecution. As we previously have observed, \u201c[n]othing in the statute itself categorically excludes any particular type of action from its operation.\u201d <em>(Navellier, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 92.)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">In addition to honoring the anti-SLAPP statute\u2019s plain language, the Court of Appeal\u2019s construction adheres to the express statutory command that \u201cthis section shall be construed broadly.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (a).) It also accords with the Legislature\u2019s specific decision not to include malicious prosecution claims in the statutory list of actions to which \u201c[t]his section shall not apply.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (d) [exempting \u201cany enforcement action brought in the name of the people of the State of California by the Attorney General, district attorney, or city attorney, acting as a public prosecutor\u201d].) The Legislature clearly knows how to create an exemption from the anti-SLAPP statute when it wishes to do so. It has not done so for malicious prosecution claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>\u201cWhere, as here, legislative intent is expressed in unambiguous terms, we must treat the statutory language as conclusive.\u201d <em>(Equilon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 61.) Nevertheless, we may observe that available legislative history buttresses a plain language construction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cLegislative history materials respecting the origins of section 425.16 indicate the statute was intended broadly to protect, inter alia, direct petitioning of the government and petition-related statements and writings\u2014that is, \u2018any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or <em>judicial </em>proceeding\u2019 (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(1)) or \u2018in connection with an issue under consideration or review\u2019 <em>(id., </em>subd. (e)(2)) by such.\u201d <em>(Briggs, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1120, italics added.) And as we have noted, \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s intent consistently has been to protect all direct petitioning of governmental bodies . . . including . . . courts . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1121.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Jarrow also argues that the legislative history materials contain no evidence the Legislature ever considered applying the statute to malicious prosecution claims. Jarrow is mistaken. As amicus curiae the People point out, several documents in the relevant legislative history materials indicate that when the Legislature was considering, enacting, and amending anti-SLAPP legislation, it was aware that malicious prosecution actions may be SLAPP\u2019s.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Notwithstanding the foregoing, Jarrow suggests that this court should craft for malicious prosecution claims a categorical exemption from application of the anti-SLAPP statute. Jarrow argues that applying section 425.16 to malicious prosecution claims would have essentially the same effect of denying malicious prosecution victims a remedy as would applying the litigation privilege (Civ. Code, \u00a7 47, subd. (b)); hence, for the same reasons malicious prosecution claims are exempt from application of the litigation privilege, we should exempt them from the anti-SLAPP statute. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>In support of its proposal, Jarrow invokes our declaration almost 50 years ago, in <em>Albertson </em>v. <em>Raboff </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 375, 382 [295 P.2d 405] (Albertson), that \u201cthe fact that a communication may be absolutely privileged for the purposes of a defamation action does not prevent its being an element of an action for malicious prosecution in a proper case. The policy of encouraging free access to the courts that underlies the absolute privilege applicable in defamation actions is outweighed by the policy of affording redress for individual wrongs when the requirements of favorable termination, lack of probable cause, and malice are satisfied.\u201d As we more recently stated, \u201cThe only exception to application of [the litigation privilege] to tort suits has been for malicious prosecution actions.\u201d <em>(Silberg v. Anderson </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 216 [266 Cal.Rptr. 638, 786 P.2d 365].)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Jarrow\u2019s attempted analogy between the litigation privilege and the anti-SLAPP statute is inapt. As the Court of Appeal noted, the litigation privilege is an entirely different type of statute than section 425.16. The former enshrines a substantive rule of law that grants absolute immunity from tort liability for communications made in relation to judicial proceedings <em>(Rubin </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1187, 1193 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 847 P.2d 1044]); the latter is a procedural device for screening out meritless claims <em>(College Hospital Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 718 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 898, 882 P.2d 894]).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">In language the Legislature first adopted in the 1870\u2019s,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the litigation privilege states simply that \u201cA privileged publication or broadcast is one made . . . [i]n any . . . judicial proceeding . . . .\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 47, subd. (b).) Section 425.16, in contrast, comprises a detailed and specific statutory scheme. Since section 425.16 neither states nor implies an exemption for malicious prosecution claims, for us judicially to impose one as Jarrow urges \u201cwould violate the foremost rule of statutory construction. When interpreting statutes, \u2018we follow the Legislature\u2019s intent, as exhibited by the plain meaning of the actual words of the law .... \u201cThis court has no power to rewrite the statute so as to make it conform to a presumed intention which is not expressed.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Cotati </em>v. <em>Cashman, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Nor does this case present the same all-or-nothing problem as did <em>Albertson </em>and its progeny. We do not face in this case, as we did in <em>Albertson, </em>the logical necessity of choosing between the \u201cfree access to the courts\u201d <em>(Albertson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 382) protected by the litigation privilege and the \u201credress for individual wrongs\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>afforded by the malicious prosecution tort. (See <em>ibid., </em>citing Veeder, <em>Absolute Immunity in Defamation: Judicial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number><em>Proceedings </em>(1909) 9 Colum. L.Rev. 463, 470.) Unlike the \u201cabsolute bar to relief created by the litigation privilege\u201d <em>(Manufacturers Life Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 257, 283 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 220, 895 P.2d 56]), the anti-SLAPP statute requires only \u201ca minimum level of legal sufficiency and triability\u201d <em>(Linder </em>v. <em>Thrifty Oil Co. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 429, 438, fn. 5 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 179, 2 P.3d 27]).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">In asserting that the anti-SLAPP statute, if applied, would have the effect of barring malicious prosecution claims, Jarrow \u201cfall[s] prey ... to the fallacy that the anti-SLAPP statute allows a defendant to escape the consequences of wrongful conduct. . . .\u201d <em>(Navellier, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 93.) In fact, \u201cthe anti-SLAPP statute neither constitutes\u2014nor enables courts to effect\u2014any kind of \u2018immunity\u2019 .... When a \u2018 \u201ccomplaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited\u201d \u2019 [citation], it is not subject to being stricken as a SLAPP.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">In sum, the litigation privilege \u201cposes a clear bar\u201d <em>(Ribas v. Clark </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 355, 364 [212 Cal.Rptr. 143, 696 P.2d 637]) to actions based on statements made in litigation. In view of that privilege\u2019s \u201cabsolute nature\u201d <em>(Silberg v. Anderson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 209), it was essential in <em>Albertson </em>that we gloss the statutory language memorializing it, in light of \u201cthe policy of affording redress\u201d for malicious prosecution, lest that remedial tort be altogether eliminated. (See <em>Albertson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 382.) No such imperative applies here. The anti-SLAPP statute \u201cdoes not bar a plaintiff from litigating an action that arises out of the defendant\u2019s free speech or petitioning\u201d <em>(Navellier, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 93); rather, \u201cit subjects to potential dismissal only those actions in which the plaintiff cannot \u2018state[] and substantiate[] a legally sufficient claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">In another vein, Jarrow argues that the Legislature cannot have meant to subject malicious prosecution claims to anti-SLAPP scrutiny, because malicious prosecution is \u201ca unique, carefully circumscribed tort with its own pre-screening\u201d mechanisms. By \u201cpre-screening\u201d mechanisms, Jarrow apparently refers to the elements of the malicious prosecution tort itself, and in particular to the element of lack of probable cause. (See <em>Sheldon Appel Co. v. Albert &amp; Oliker </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 863, 871 [254 Cal.Rptr. 336, 765 P.2d 498] <em>(Sheldon Appel Co.).) </em>That malicious prosecution has elements and that a plaintiff must prove these in order to recover, of course, hardly makes malicious prosecution unique among torts.  Nor does the malicious prosecution tort\u2019s utility in combating meritless and harassing litigation preclude the possibility that a particular malicious prosecution action may itself be meritless or designed to harass. To the contrary, spurious malicious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>prosecution suits may, like others, \u201cchill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Jarrow\u2019s \u201cpre-screening\u201d argument is logically flawed. We cannot infer from any generalized overlap in the stated legislative aims underlying section 425.16 (see <em>id., </em>subd. (a)) and the policies we have recognized as supporting the existence of the malicious prosecution tort (see <em>Albertson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 382) that the Legislature could not have discerned a role for the anti-SLAPP mechanism in the malicious prosecution context.  Considered as devices for screening out meritless suits, the anti-SLAPP device and the lack-of-probable-cause element of malicious prosecution are perhaps similarly focused, but they are not duplicates. A malicious prosecution defendant who in fact had probable cause in the underlying action may, depending on the circumstances of the particular case, be able to obtain dismissal on that ground only after protracted and costly litigation. By contrast, section 425.16 was \u201cbased on the need to \u2018screen out meritless cases at an early stage.\u2019 \u201d <em>(College Hospital Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 718; see generally <em>Sheldon Appel Co., supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 873.) Moreover, because lack of probable cause is not the only element of a malicious prosecution claim (favorable termination of the prior action and malice also being necessary; see <em>Sheldon Appel Co., supra, </em>at p. 871), such a claim may lack merit even when the plaintiff can prove lack of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In sum, contrary to Jarrow\u2019s implication, plausible reasons for the Legislature\u2019s having equipped malicious prosecution defendants with both weapons\u2014the probable cause defense <em>and </em>a potential anti-SLAPP motion\u2014against meritless attack can easily be discerned. Ultimately it appears that, in choosing comprehensive language for the anti-SLAPP statute\u2019s \u201carising from\u201d prong, \u201c \u2018[t]he Legislature recognized that \u201call kinds of claims could achieve the objective of a SLAPP suit.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Navellier, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at pp. 92-93.) Under the remedial scheme the Legislature crafted, therefore, \u201c \u2018the nature or form of the action is not what is critical but rather that it is against a person who has exercised certain rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Equilon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">In petitioning for review, Jarrow also argued that, because filing or maintaining an action without probable cause does not constitute a valid \u201cact of that person in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1)), malicious prosecution claims, which by definition are based on filing or maintaining actions without probable cause, should not be eligible for anti-SLAPP protection. We already have, in another context, considered and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>rejected Jarrow\u2019s \u201cvalidity\u201d argument, noting it \u201c \u2018confuses the threshold question of whether the SLAPP statute [potentially] applies with the question whether [an opposing plaintiff] has established a probability of success on the merits.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Navellier, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 94.)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Contrary to Jarrow\u2019s suggestion, that malicious prosecution is an action based on alleged abusive activity does not entail that simply by alleging malicious prosecution a plaintiff can exempt a lawsuit from antiSLAPP scrutiny. \u201c \u2018The Legislature did not intend that in order to invoke the special motion to strike the defendant must first establish [its] actions are constitutionally protected under the First Amendment as a matter of law. If this were the case then the [secondary] inquiry as to whether the plaintiff has established a probability of success would be superfluous.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Navellier, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at pp. 94\u201495.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Finally, Jarrow argues that affirmance will result in elimination of the malicious prosecution tort, thereby giving a \u201cgreen light to parties and counsel\u201d to bring meritless actions and rendering unscrupulous litigators and attorneys \u201cexempt from any accountability for their acts.\u201d Not so. Neither section 425.16 itself nor anything in our anti-SLAPP jurisprudence diminishes the viability of meritorious malicious prosecution claims that may be articulated against such persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">\u201cThe Legislature . . . has provided, and California courts have recognized, substantive and procedural limitations that protect plaintiffs against overbroad application of the anti-SLAPP mechanism.\u201d <em>(Briggs, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 1122-1123.) \u201cCourts deciding anti-SLAPP motions, for example, are empowered to mitigate their impact by ordering, where appropriate, \u2018that specified discovery be conducted notwithstanding\u2019 the motion\u2019s pendency. [Citation.] And if \u2018the court finds that a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay, the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to a plaintiff prevailing on the motion.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Equilon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 66.) Thus, as we repeatedly have observed, the Legislature\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>detailed anti-SLAPP scheme \u201censur[es] that claims with the requisite minimal merit may proceed.\u201d <em>(Navellier, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 94.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">For all these reasons, we decline to create a categorical exemption from the anti-SLAPP statute for malicious prosecution causes of action. Accordingly, we hold that this action is not exempt from anti-SLAPP scrutiny merely because it is one for malicious prosecution. If on reflection the Legislature desires to create an exemption for malicious prosecution claims, it may easily do so. (See <em>Briggs, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1123 [same with respect to \u201cpublic interest\u201d limitation].)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">B. <em>\u201cProbability of prevailing\u201d prong</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">As mentioned earlier, if a court ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion concludes the challenged cause of action arises from protected petitioning, it then \u201cdetermines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.\u201d <em>(Equilon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 67.) To satisfy this prong, the plaintiff must \u201cstate[] and substantiate[] a legally sufficient claim.\u201d <em>(Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin. Securities, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 412.) \u201cPut another way, the plaintiff \u2018must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>Parker, Covert &amp; Chidester </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 811, 821 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 19, 50 P.3d 733] <em>(Wilson).)</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>The Court of Appeal here ruled that Jarrow had not met its burden under the \u201cprobability of prevailing,\u201d or merits, prong of the anti-SLAPP statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In petitioning for review, Jarrow specified the question whether, assuming the anti-SLAPP statute applies, a malicious prosecution claim predicated, as this one is, on an underlying suit that was terminated on summary judgment with a finding of insufficient evidence should be deemed, as a matter of law, to satisfy the statute\u2019s merits prong. Jarrow points out that the minute order memorializing the trial court\u2019s disposal of LaMarche\u2019s cross-complaint states that \u201cno competent evidence\u201d of harmful activity by Jarrow or damages to LaMarche\u2019s business had been presented.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> According to Jarrow, this \u201csummary judgment ruling with its findings alone\u201d should be sufficient, as a matter of law, to satisfy the anti-SLAPP statute\u2019s merits prong. We disagree.  The entry of summary judgment for the defense on an underlying claim on grounds of insufficient evidence does not establish as a matter of law that the litigant necessarily can \u201cstate[] and substantiate[]\" <em>(Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin. Securities, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 412) a subsequent malicious prosecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">First, contrary to Jarrow\u2019s assertion, defense summary judgment on the underlying claim does not establish lack of probable cause as a matter of law. \u201c \u2018Counsel and their clients have a right to present issues that are arguably correct, even if it is extremely unlikely that they will win ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Sheldon Appel Co., supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 885, quoting <em>In re Marriage of Flaherty </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 650 [183 Cal.Rptr. 508, 646 P.2d 179].) Accordingly, there is probable cause if, at the time the claim was filed, \u201cany reasonable attorney would have thought the claim tenable.\u201d <em>(Sheldon Appel Co., supra, </em>at p. 886.) Plainly, a claim that appears \u201carguably correct\u201d or \u201ctenable\u201d when filed with the court may nevertheless fail, as LaMarche\u2019s did, for reasons having to do with the sufficiency of the evidence actually adduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>as the litigation unfolds.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As defendants point out, every case litigated to a conclusion has a losing party, but that does not mean the losing position was not arguably meritorious when it was pled. <em>(Wilson, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 824.) And just as an action that ultimately proves nonmeritorious may have been brought with probable cause, successfully defending a lawsuit does not establish that the suit was brought without probable cause. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 819-820; <em>Roberts v. Sentry Life Insurance, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th at p. 383.)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Second, obtaining summary judgment for the defense on the underlying claim does not necessarily establish the malice element of a subsequent malicious prosecution claim. Jarrow asserts it does in this case, \u201cbecause, even after an opportunity for discovery, no competent evidence was adduced to support the underlying claim.\u201d The trial court\u2019s \u201cno competent evidence\u201d finding was not quite so sweeping. (See fn. 12, ante.) But even assuming Jarrow characterizes the record correctly, the asserted conclusion does not follow. \u201cMerely because the prior action lacked legal tenability, as measured objectively . . . <em>without more, </em>would not logically or reasonably permit the inference that such lack of probable cause was accompanied by the actor\u2019s subjective malicious state of mind.\u201d <em>(Downey Venture </em>v. <em>LMI Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 478, 498 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 142], citing <em>Sheldon Appel Co., supra, 47 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 885-886.)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">We therefore reject, as did the Court of Appeal, Jarrow\u2019s suggestion that its having obtained summary judgment on the cross-complaint in the underlying litigation establishes as a matter of law, for the purposes of section 425.16, the merits of its malicious prosecution claim. Nor does the record afford any other basis for our gainsaying the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">George, C.

In any event, we previously have considered and rejected the suggestion that the anti-SLAPP statute unduly burdens plaintiffs\u2019 access to courts. \u201cAs we recognized in <em>Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin.

(\u00a7425.16, subd. (g) [when anti-SLAPP motion is pending, court \u201cmay order that specified discovery be conducted\u201d].) It is not our role, of course, generally to pronounce on the wisdom of legislative policy in this area. We may nevertheless observe that Jarrow does not demonstrate that it was prejudiced by a lack of discovery in this case or that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to order discovery. The Court of Appeal concluded, as a matter of law based on undisputed evidence, that the underlying action did not lack probable cause. That conclusion is not implicated by our review of the question whether section 425.16 potentially encompasses malicious prosecution causes of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b779-9\"> \u201cIn deciding the question of potential merit, the trial court considers the pleadings and evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant [citation]; though the court does not <em>weigh </em>the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence, it should grant the motion if, as a matter of law, the defendant\u2019s evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff\u2019s attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim.\u201d <em>(Wilson, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 821, citing \u00a7 425.16, subd.
