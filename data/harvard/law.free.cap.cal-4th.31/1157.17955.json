Code, \u00a7 3110)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought by laborers to recover unpaid contributions to their employee benefit plans.  ERISA preempts state laws that \u201crelate to\u201d employee benefit plans. (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a).) In 1991, we held that ERISA preempted a similar mechanic\u2019s lien statute (\u00a7 3111) that \u201csingle[d] out ERISA plans for special treatment\u201d and, thus, related to employee benefit plans. <em>(Carpenters So. Cal. Admin. Corp. v. El Capitan Development Co. </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1041, 1049 [282 Cal.Rptr. 277, 811 P.2d 296] <em>(El Capitan).) </em>Because section 3110 is a law of general applicability and does not \u201crelate to\u201d ERISA plans (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a)), we conclude that ERISA does not preempt plaintiffs\u2019 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">The facts are largely taken from the Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">R. Betancourt and other employees (laborers) are union members who worked for R. P. Richards, a subcontractor of Trabucco &amp; Associates. R. P. Richards employed laborers pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement (Agreement) between Trabucco and laborers\u2019 union, District Council No. 16 of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry of the United States and Canada (Union).</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">Laborers worked on a residential construction project, which Storke Housing Investors and BDC Storke Development (collectively, Storke) owned. According to the Agreement, laborers were entitled to an hourly compensation package, including wages and benefits. Laborers received their cash wages, but R. P. Richards failed to make contributions to the Union\u2019s trust funds for the benefit of laborers. Pursuant to section 3110, laborers recorded a mechanic\u2019s lien for unpaid contributions in the amount of $33,236.56 against Storke\u2019s real property. In May 2000, laborers, as individuals and as members of Union, and Union, as a party to the Agreement but not as a trust fund (collectively, plaintiffs) filed the instant action to foreclose on the section 3110 lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">Storke demurred, contending that the amounts due were fringe benefit contributions owing to Union\u2019s employee benefit plan, and, as such, ERISA preempted plaintiffs\u2019 action. (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a).) Relying on our decision in <em>El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 1041, the trial court concluded that ERISA preempted plaintiffs\u2019 action. The court sustained Storke\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-8\">Plaintiffs appealed. The Court of Appeal reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment. It concluded that \u201c[b]ecause decisions of the United States Supreme Court subsequent to <em>El Capitan </em>have dramatically narrowed the preemptive scope of ERISA, we hold that ERISA does not bar this action. We conclude that we are not bound by <em>El Capitan.\u201d </em>The Court of Appeal reasoned, \u201cSection 3110 is a state law of general applicability which creates no rights or restrictions concerning the administration or funding of ERISA plans. Therefore, it matters not that the remedy provided by section 3110\u2014foreclosure on the landowner\u2019s property\u2014is not a remedy provided to redress violations of ERISA. (See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(d)(2).)\u201d Our review follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-10\">\u201cOn review of the judgment of the Court of Appeal reversing the superior court\u2019s orders sustaining defendants\u2019 demurrers, we examine the complaint de <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>novo to determine whether it alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any legal theory, such facts being assumed true for this purpose. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(McCall v. PacifiCare of Cal., Inc. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 412, 415 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 271, 21 P.3d 1189].) As relevant here, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that (1) laborers worked on Storke\u2019s real property for an hourly compensation pursuant to the Agreement; (2) laborers\u2019 Union was a party to the Agreement; (3) laborers were due $33,236.56 for their unpaid labor on the project; and (4) plaintiffs recorded a mechanic\u2019s lien on the Storke property pursuant to section 3110.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">The parties do not seriously dispute that plaintiffs\u2019 section 3110 action seeks to recover unpaid contributions to their benefit plans. Though section 3110 is not limited to an express trust fund (see \u00a7 3111), Storke maintains that plaintiffs\u2019 \u201caction is a backdoor attempt to do something that this court in <em>El Capitan </em>has already ruled against.\u201d Because <em>El Capitan </em>held that ERISA preempts an action under section 3111, Storke contends an action under section 3110 is similarly preempted. In contrast, plaintiffs urge this court to declare that <em>El Capitan </em>is no longer good law in light of subsequent federal high court decisions on ERISA preemption, but also claim that <em>El Capitan </em>is simply not applicable to cases arising under section 3110. In order to address these claims, we begin with a discussion of ERISA and its preemption clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">A. <em>ERISA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">\u201cERISA is a comprehensive federal statutory scheme designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans.\u201d <em>(El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1047, citing <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 85, 90 [77 L.Ed.2d 490, 103 S.Ct. 2890] <em>(Shaw).) </em>It \u201csets various uniform standards, including rules concerning reporting, disclosure, and fiduciary responsibility, for both pension and welfare plans. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Shaw, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 91.) ERISA\u2019s preemption clause states, in pertinent part: \u201c[T]he provisions of this subchapter . . . shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter <em>relate to </em>any employee benefit plan described in section 1003(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of this title. . . .\u201d (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a), italics added.) \u201cThe basic thrust of the pre-emption clause . . . was to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans.\u201d <em>(New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 645, 657 [131 L.Ed.2d 695, 115 S.Ct. 1671] <em>(Travelers).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>In its 1983 decision in <em>Shaw, </em>the high court pronounced that \u201c[a] law \u2018relates to\u2019 an employee benefit plan, in the normal sense of the phrase, if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\u201d <em>(Shaw, supra, </em>463 U.S. at pp. 96-97, fn. omitted.) In a later case, the high court explained that \u201cto determine whether a state law has the forbidden connection, we look both to \u2018the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive,\u2019 <em>[Travelers, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 656], as well as to the nature of the effect of the state law on ERISA plans, <em>id., </em>at 658-659.\u201d <em>(California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc. </em>(1997) 519 U.S. 316, 325 [136 L.Ed.2d 791, 117 S.Ct. 832] (Dillingham) [holding California\u2019s prevailing wage statute is not preempted by ERISA].) As to an impermissible reference, the high court concluded that \u201c[w]here a State\u2019s law acts immediately and exclusively upon ERISA plans . . . , or where the existence of ERISA plans is essential to the law\u2019s operation . . . , that \u2018reference\u2019 will result in pre-emption.\u201d <em>(Dillingham, supra, </em>519 U.S. at p. 325.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">The high court has also held that \u201cstate laws providing alternative enforcement mechanisms also relate to ERISA plans, triggering pre-emption. See <em>Ingersoll-Rand [Co. </em>v. <em>McClendon </em>(1990) 498 U.S. 133 [112 L.Ed.2d 474, 111 S.Ct. 478]].\u201d <em>(Travelers, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 658; see also <em>Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. </em>v. <em>Moran </em>(2002) 536 U.S. 355, 377-379 [153 L.Ed.2d 375, 122 S.Ct. 2151] <em>(Rush </em>Prudential);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. at p. 56.) \u201cThe policy choices reflected in the inclusion of certain remedies and the exclusion of others under the federal scheme would be completely undermined if ERISA-plan participants and beneficiaries were free to obtain remedies under state law that Congress rejected in ERISA. . . . [\u00b6] The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>deliberate care with which ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement remedies [in 29 United States Code section 1132(a)] were drafted and the balancing of policies embodied in its choice of remedies argue strongly for the conclusion that ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement remedies were intended to be exclusive.\u201d <em>(Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. at p. 54.) For example, the high court has held that a state law wrongful discharge action based on an employer\u2019s motivation to avoid paying pension benefits <em>(Ingersoll-Rand, supra, </em>498 U.S. at p. 145), and a state common law action based on improper processing of an ERISA benefits claim <em>(Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. at p. 57), both impermissibly conflicted with ERISA\u2019s enforcement scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">Beginning with <em>Travelers, </em>the United States Supreme Court has narrowed the scope of ERISA preemption. <em>(Travelers, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 656 [court must look \u201cbeyond the unhelpful text\u201d of preemption clause];<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Dillingham, supra, </em>519 U.S. at pp. 324\u2014325 [following <em>Travelers]; De Buono v.

While the high court recognized that ERISA\u2019s preemption clause (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a)) was \u201cclearly expansive,\u201d the court clarified that its \u201crelate to\u201d language was not intended to change \u201cthe starting presumption that Congress does not intend to supplant state law.\u201d <em>(Travelers, supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 654-655; <em>De Buono, supra, </em>520 U.S. at p. 813.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">In other words, \u201cwhere federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation, [citation], we have worked on the \u2018assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Travelers, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 655; <em>De Buono, supra, </em>520 U.S. at p. 814 [respondents have \u201cconsiderable burden of overcoming \u2018the starting presumption\u2019 \u201d].) The high court emphasized that \u201c \u2018[p]re-emption does not occur . . . if the state law has only a tenuous, remote, or peripheral connection with covered plans, as is the case with many laws of general applicability.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Travelers, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 661.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>B. <em>Section 3110</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">Section 3110 provides that \u201call persons and laborers[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] of every class performing labor upon or bestowing skill or other necessary services on ... a work of improvement shall have a lien upon the property upon which they have bestowed labor ... for the value of such labor done . . . whether done ... at the instance of the owner or of any person acting by his authority or under him as contractor or otherwise.\u201d Our state Constitution guarantees that \u201claborers of every class [] shall have a lien upon the property upon which they have bestowed labor or furnished material for the value of such labor done and material furnished; and the Legislature shall provide, by law, for the speedy and efficient enforcement of such liens.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XIV, \u00a7 3.) \u201c \u2018The mechanic\u2019s lien is the only creditors\u2019 remedy stemming from constitutional command and our courts \u201chave uniformly classified the mechanics\u2019 lien laws as remedial legislation, to be liberally construed for the protection of laborers and materialmen.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Wm. R. Clarke Corp. v. Safeco Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 882, 889 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 578, 938 P.2d 372] <em>(Wm. R. Clarke).) </em>Even before our present Constitution was adopted in 1879, the first session of our state Legislature enacted a mechanic\u2019s lien law in 1850. <em>(Connolly Development, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 803, 826 [132 Cal.Rptr. 477, 553 P.2d 637] <em>(Connolly).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">In concluding that ERISA did not preempt plaintiffs\u2019 action, the Court of Appeal reasoned that section 3110 is a statute governing the payment of wages and thus, under federal case law, is the subject of traditional state regulation. Noting that section 3110 does not refer to employee benefit trust funds, the Court of Appeal characterized the provision as \u201ca state law of general applicability that creates no rights or restrictions concerning the administration or funding of ERISA plans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">Under the rationale of <em>Travelers </em>and <em>Dillingham, </em>we agree with the Court of Appeal that ERISA does not preempt plaintiffs\u2019 action under section 3110. The state statute does not \u201crelate to\u201d ERISA plans. (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a).) In other words, it does not make \u201creference to\u201d or have a \u201cconnection with\u201d ERISA plans. (See <em>Dillingham, supra, </em>519 U.S. at p. 324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-7\">Unlike section 3111, which we discuss further below, section 3110 is a mechanic\u2019s lien law of general application and does not itself refer to ERISA plans. (See <em>Burch </em>v. <em>George </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 246, 273 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 165, 866 P.2d 92] [no contest law \u201cis a neutral state law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>general application that here would only tenuously affect an ERISA plan, if at all\u201d].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As noted, though the Court of Appeal did not address this, in 1999 the Legislature amended the definition of \u201claborer,\u201d which is referenced in section 3110, to include an express trust fund. (\u00a7 3089, subd. (b).) The amendment to section 3089, however, is \u201cintended to give effect to the longstanding public policy of this state to protect the entire compensation of laborers on works of improvements, regardless of the form in which that compensation is to be paid.\u201d (\u00a7 3089, subd. (b).) We conclude that section 3110 is not \u201c \u2018specifically designed to affect employee benefit plans.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mackey </em>v. <em>Lanier Collection Agency &amp; Serv. </em>(1988) 486 U.S. 825, 829 [100 L.Ed.2d 836, 108 S.Ct. 2182] <em>(Mackey).) </em>Section 3110 does not \u201cact[] immediately and <em>exclusively </em>upon ERISA plans,\u201d nor is \u201cthe existence of ERISA plans . . . essential to the law\u2019s operation.\u201d <em>(Dillingham, supra, </em>519 U.S. at p. 325, italics added; <em>Southern Calif. IBEW-NECA Trust v. Standard Indus. </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 247 F.3d 920, 926 <em>(Standard Industrial) </em>[payment bond statute \u201cnot necessarily limited to ERISA plans\u201d; no impermissible reference].) This section is \u201c \u2018 \u201cremedial legislation, to be liberally construed\u201d \u2019 \u201d to protect the rights of laborers and materialmen in general. <em>(Wm. R. Clarke, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 889.) Because section 3110 \u201c \u2018functions irrespective of ... the existence of an ERISA plan,\u2019 \u201d it \u201cdoes not make reference to ERISA plans.\u201d <em>(Dillingham, supra, </em>519 U.S. at p. 328, quoting <em>Ingersoll-Rand, supra, </em>498 U.S. at p. 139; <em>Travelers, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 656.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">Nor does section 3110 have a \u201cconnection with\u201d ERISA plans. <em>(Dillingham, supra, </em>519 U.S. at pp. 328-329; <em>Travelers, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 662.)  As a law of general applicability, section 3110 \u201cdoes not bind ERISA plans to anything.\u201d <em>(Dillingham, supra, </em>519 U.S. at p. 332.) This mechanic\u2019s lien law permits laborers and other persons, who may include participants in ERISA plans or the plans themselves, to obtain a lien to secure payment for their labor and materials. (\u00a7\u00a7 3110, 3089.) Section 3110\u2019s effect on ERISA plans, however, is indirect at most because it does not compel plans to function in a certain way. <em>(Dillingham, supra, </em>519 U.S. at p. 333 [added inducement under Lab. Code, \u00a7 1777.5 is not \u201ctantamount to a compulsion upon apprenticeship programs\u201d]; <em>Travelers, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 662 [surcharges under New York statute \u201cleave plan administrators right where they would be in any case, with the responsibility to choose the best overall coverage for the money\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">The high court has explained that \u201cwhere federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation, [citation], we have worked on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>the \u2018assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Travelers, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 655.)  As noted, California\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien law derives from constitutional command (Cal. Const., art. XIV, \u00a7 3) and dates back to 1850. <em>(Wm. R. Clarke, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 889; <em>Connolly, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 826.) We have long recognized that it is within the state\u2019s police power to provide for enforcement of liens for labor and materials. (See <em>Roystone Co. v. Darling </em>(1915) 171 Cal. 526, 540 [154 P. 15].) Storke fails to show that it was Congress\u2019s \u201c \u2018clear and manifest purpose\u2019 \u201d <em>(Travelers, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 655) that ERISA preempt our state\u2019s long-standing mechanic\u2019s lien laws. As the high court explained, \u201cWe could not hold pre-empted a state law in an area of traditional state regulation based on so tenuous a relation without doing grave violence to our presumption that Congress intended nothing of the sort.\u201d <em>(Dillingham, supra, </em>519 U.S. at p. 334; see <em>De Buono, supra, </em>520 U.S. at pp. 814-815 [describing types of state laws Congress intended ERISA to preempt].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">Storke, however, maintains that section 3110 is preempted because it constitutes an alternative enforcement mechanism to ERISA. <em>(Travelers, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 658; <em>Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. at p. 56; see <em>El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1054.) In their section 3110 action, laborers seek to recover delinquent contribution benefits from Storke, who is neither their employer nor a signatory to the Agreement. Storke contends this is impermissible under <em>El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at page 1052, and is inconsistent with federal cases. (See, e.g., <em>EklecCo </em>v. <em>Iron Workers Union Sec. Funds </em>(2d Cir. 1999) 170 F.3d 353, 357 <em>(EklecCo) </em>[New York\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien law preempted as an alternative enforcement mechanism]; <em>Bast v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 150 F.3d 1003, 1010 [ERISA preempts state law claims even if plaintiffs are left without a remedy]; <em>Crull v. Gem Ins. Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1995) 58 F.3d 1386, 1391, fn. 3 <em>[Travelers </em>does not \u201csignal a retreat from <em>Pilot Life\u2019s </em>holding\u201d regarding the exclusive remedies of ERISA].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">Pointing to this case\u2019s factual similarities with <em>El Capitan, </em>Storke claims laborers \u201care seeking to have alternate responsible parties\u2014parties who never entered into any contractual arrangement with the trust funds, the Union, the individual employees, or the employer\u2014to pay those contributions.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For reasons that follow, we disagree that <em>El Capitan </em>compels the conclusion that ERISA preempts section 3110.

After their employer failed to make contributions to the employees\u2019 trust funds in excess of $121,000, the funds\u2019 administrator recorded trust fund liens under former section 3111<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> against El Capitan Development Company\u2019s real property, on which the employees had performed work. The administrator alleged that \u201cbecause the unpaid contributions were due on account of work performed on El Capitan\u2019s property, section 3111 created liens on that property.\u201d <em>(El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1046.) We held that the action under section 3111 was preempted under ERISA (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a)). <em>(El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1056.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-7\">In our 1991 decision, we recognized the broad scope of the key term, \u201crelate to,\u201d in ERISA\u2019s preemption clause (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a)), based on congressional intent and high court decisions. <em>(El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pp. 1047-1049.) We concluded that \u201c[a]ll that is necessary to invoke ERISA\u2019s statutory preemption provision is that the state law in question \u2018relate to\u2019 an ERISA plan.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1047.) The state law in question was section 3111, which we concluded \u201cprovid[ed] an additional method of funding, a lien against real property . . . .\u201d <em>(El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1052.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-8\">We determined that \u201csection 3111 \u2018relates to\u2019 such plans by creating a mechanism for enforcing an employer\u2019s contribution obligations that Congress did not provide.\u201d <em>(El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pp. 1047-1048.) Relying on <em>Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. 41, and <em>Iron Workers Pension Fund v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number><em>Terotechnology </em>(5th Cir. 1990) 891 F.2d 548, we emphasized that section 3111 was preempted because this provision purported to regulate ERISA plans through a new cause of action or remedy not provided under ERISA, the state\u2019s hen laws. <em>(El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pp. 1048, 1051, 1052, 1054, 1055.) \u201c \u2018The expectations that a federal common law of rights and obligations under ERISA-regulated plans would develop, . . . would make little sense if the remedies available to ERISA participants and beneficiaries under [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)] could be supplemented or supplanted by varying state laws.\u2019 \u201d <em>(El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1053, quoting <em>Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. at p. 56.) This recognition that section 3111, if applied, would regulate the conditions under which the terms of an ERISA plan might be enforced supported our conclusion that the section related to such plans and thus was preempted. <em>(El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pp. 1048, 1051, 1054.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">We also rejected the argument that section 3111 was not preempted because it was a generally applicable mechanism for enforcing judgments. (See <em>Mackey, supra, </em>486 U.S. 825 [general state garnishment statute not preempted].) We explained that \u201c[s]ection 3111 gives a trust fund a right to a lien against the property of third parties, such as El Capitan, that the fund would not, and does not, have under ERISA. . . . Therefore, section 3111 cannot be upheld under <em>Mackey </em>as it creates a new substantive right against the property of a third party that is not created by ERISA and, thus, goes beyond being a mere means of enforcing a judgment.\u201d <em>(El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1055.) We also rejected the contention that section 3111 only affected an employee benefit plan in a \u201c \u2018tenuous, remote, or peripheral\u2019 manner\u201d; rather, the provision had the substantive effect of making an additional entity liable to the trust fund for contributions. <em>(El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1056.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">Contrary to Storke\u2019s contention, <em>El Capitan </em>does not compel the conclusion that section 3110 is preempted. In that decision, we explained the differences between sections 3110 and 3111, though both provide mechanic\u2019s lien remedies. <em>(El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1049 &amp; fn. 3.)  We stated that in contrast to persons seeking a mechanic\u2019s lien remedy under section 3110, ERISA plans do not provide labor and materials for a construction project. <em>(El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1049.) But because section 3111 would treat ERISA plans the same as persons who provide labor and materials by giving these plans a mechanic\u2019s lien remedy unavailable under ERISA, we concluded section 3111 would single out ERISA plans for special treatment and thus \u201crelates to\u201d these plans. <em>(El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1049; <em>Mackey, supra, </em>486 U.S. at p. 829.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-7\">Though we recognized in <em>El Capitan </em>that by providing a new cause of action or remedy, section 3111 purported to regulate ERISA plans <em>(El </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number><em>Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1051), our holding that section 3111 was preempted relied heavily on the fact that the section is \u201cdesigned to affect [ERISA plans] specifically.\u201d <em>(El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1049.) We observed that the high court \u201chas \u2018virtually taken it for granted that state laws which are \u201cspecifically designed to affect employee benefit plans\u201d are preempted under \u00a7 514(a).\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>Mackey, supra, </em>486 U.S. at p. 829.) We emphasized that unlike section 3110, \u201c[s]ection 3111 is specifically for the use of express trust funds established pursuant to collective bargaining agreements.\u201d <em>(El Capitan, supra, </em>53 Cal. 3d at p. 1049, fn. 3.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1209-5\">We conclude that section 3110 does not constitute an alternative enforcement mechanism subject to ERISA preemption. (See <em>U.S. Fidelity, supra, </em>215 F.3d 136; see also <em>Standard Industrial, supra, </em>247 F.3d 920.) In <em>U.S. Fidelity, </em>the First Circuit Court of Appeals held that a Massachusetts bond statute\u2014requiring a general contractor to post a bond to secure payment for a subcontractor\u2019s fringe benefit contributions\u2014was not preempted by ERISA. After noting the \u201cchanged legal landscape\u201d of ERISA preemption jurisprudence <em>(U.S. Fidelity, supra, </em>215 F.3d at p. 138), <em>U.S. Fidelity </em>concluded the bond statute did not constitute an alternative enforcement mechanism: \u201cThose state laws which touch upon enforcement but have no real bearing on the intricate web of relationships among the principal players in the ERISA scenario (e.g., the plan, the administrators, the fiduciaries, the beneficiaries, and the employer) are not subject to preemption on this basis. [Citation.] It follows that a state statute which only creates claims against a surety does not constitute an impermissible alternative enforcement mechanism as that term is used in ERISA jurisprudence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 141.) <em>U.S. Fidelity </em>deemed the state bond statute a law of general applicability <em>(id. </em>at p. 145), and recognized the statute \u201cregulates an area of the law traditionally thought to be the states\u2019 preserve: enforcing contracts under state law for the citizenry\u2019s protection. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 141.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-6\">Likewise, we conclude that section 3110 is a statute that has \u201cno real bearing on the intricate web of relationships among the principal players in the ERISA scenario . . . .\u201d <em>(U.S. Fidelity, supra, </em>215 F.3d at p. 141.) As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>remedial statute of general applicability, section 3110 does not regulate the relationship between ERISA plans and participants or beneficiaries. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1165-1166.)  Plaintiffs here are laborers and their union that seek to secure a mechanic\u2019s lien on Storke\u2019s real property for full payment for their labor. They are neither suing or being sued in an effort to enforce the terms of an ERISA plan. (See <em>Laborers\u2019 Trust Funds v. Maui Prince Hotel </em>(1996) 81 Haw. 487 [918 P.2d 1143, 1154] <em>(Maui Prince Hotel) </em>[state lien law not preempted because it \u201cmerely provides a \u2018remedy available to a certain class of creditors that transcends ERISA obligations and concerns\u2019 \u201d].) Neither the plan, nor its administration and management, nor the benefits it provides, are implicated except insofar as it may be the recipient of any amounts recovered under the lien. To the extent the mechanic\u2019s lien remedy \u201ccould be interpreted as regulating relationships between an ERISA plan and a third party, the relationships are too tenuous, remote, or peripheral to be preempted by ERISA.\u201d <em>(Standard Industrial, supra, </em>247 F.3d at p. 929.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-5\">The high court\u2019s decision in <em>Mackey, supra, </em>486 U.S. 825, further helps distinguish this case from <em>El Capitan. </em>While the high court held that Georgia\u2019s general garnishment law was not preempted, it concluded that the state\u2019s antigamishment provision that expressly referred to, and applied solely to, ERISA employee benefit plans was subject to ERISA preemption. <em>(Mackey, supra, </em>486 U.S. at p. 829.) The antigamishment provision protected ERISA welfare benefit plans, but not non-ERISA plans, from garnishment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 830 &amp; fn. 4.) As the high court explained, \u201cIt is this \u2018singling out\u2019 that pre-empts\u201d the state statute. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 838, fn. 12.) On the other hand, the court concluded the general garnishment law was among those \u201cstate-law methods for collecting money judgments [that] must, as a general matter, remain undisturbed by ERISA; otherwise, there would be no way to enforce such a judgment won against an ERISA plan.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 834.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1210-6\">Storke asserts that the \u201cmultiplicity and inconsistency of the lien laws from state to state, and the variety of conditions that they impose on employers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>their benefit plans and third parties are precisely the burdens that Congress intended for ERISA\u2019s preemption provision to avoid.\u201d We are unpersuaded. First, Storke fails to identify any specific material differences between our state lien law and any from other jurisdictions. Second, and more importantly, the high court has explained that a state law \u201cthat increases the cost of providing benefits to covered employees will have some effect on the administration of ERISA plans, but that simply cannot mean that every state law with such an effect is pre-empted by the federal statute.\u201d <em>(De Buono, supra, </em>520 U.S. at p, 816, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-5\">D. <em>Other Decisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-6\">Several post-Travelers cases from other jurisdictions have reached conclusions different from ours. (See, e.g., <em>EklecCo, supra, </em>170 F.3d at p. 357 [lien statute making property owner liable for employer\u2019s ERISA contributions preempted as alternative enforcement mechanism]; <em>Plumbing Industry Bd. </em>v. <em>E. W. Howell Co., Inc. </em>(2d Cir. 1997) 126 F.3d 61, 68-69 <em>(Plumbing Industry Bd.) </em>[same]; <em>IBEW v. Trig Elect. Const. Co. </em>(2000) 142 Wn.2d 431 [13 P.3d 622, 627] <em>(Trig) </em>[public works lien statute making third party contractor liable for ERISA contributions preempted as \u201calternative funding mechanism for the ERISA plans\u201d]; but see <em>Maui Prince Hotel, supra, </em>918 P.2d at pp. 1154\u20141155 [neutral and general mechanic\u2019s and materialman\u2019s lien statute not preempted].) As one court observed, \u201cBecause the state law impermissibly adds to the exclusive list of parties ERISA holds responsible for an employer\u2019s benefit obligations, it cannot stand.\u201d <em>(Plumbing Industry Bd., supra, </em>126 F.3d at p. 69.) However, we find these cases to be inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-8\">Although these cases recognized the \u201cstarting presumption that Congress does not intend to supplant state law\u201d in areas of traditional state regulation <em>(Travelers, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 654), we conclude that none of these cases gave due consideration to the presumption before finding preemption. <em>(Plumbing Industry Bd., supra, </em>126 F.3d at pp. 68-69; <em>EklecCo, supra, </em>170 F.3d at p. 357; <em>Trig, supra, </em>13 P.3d at pp. 626-627.) Indeed, in discussing the alternative enforcement mechanism doctrine, these cases did not expressly consider whether the state statute at issue was in an area of traditional state regulation. <em>(Plumbing Industry Bd., supra, </em>126 F.3d at pp. 68-69; <em>EklecCo, supra, </em>170 F.3d at p. 357; <em>Trig, supra, </em>13 P.3d at pp. 626-627; see also <em>Trig, supra, </em>13 P.3d. at p. 629 (dis. opn. of Johnson, J.) [\u201cthe majority avoids any meaningful application of the post-Travelers doctrine and reaches a conclusion inconsistent with current law\u201d].) This presumption against preemption is particularly salient in this case given that our state has long recognized the importance of the mechanic\u2019s lien remedy, which is within the proper exercise of our state\u2019s police power. <em>(Roystone Co. v. Darling, supra, </em>171 Cal. at p. 540; <em>Connolly, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 826; see <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1165, 1167.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>Moreover, in <em>Plumbing Industry Bd., supra, </em>126 F.3d 61, relied on by <em>EklecCo, supra, </em>170 F.3d 353, the New York lien law at issue was specifically amended \u201cto better protect the rights of workers by \u2018 supplement[ing]\u2019 the scheme for enforcing employee benefit obligations arising in connection with public works contracts [citation].\u201d <em>(Plumbing Industry Bd., supra, </em>126 F.3d at p. 65.) In concluding that ERISA preempted the lien law as an alternative enforcement mechanism, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals observed, \u201cWere states free to supplement the enforcement matrix at will, Congress\u2019 policy choices would be undermined.\u201d <em>(Plumbing Industry Bd., </em>at p. 68, citing <em>Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. at p. 54.)  In contrast, section 3110 here was not designed to \u201csupplement\u201d the enforcement scheme for employee benefit obligations. Instead, this mechanic\u2019s lien law implements our state\u2019s constitutional mandate to protect \u201claborers of every class\u201d and allow them to recover their entire compensation, regardless of the form the compensation takes.

After noting that since <em>Pilot Life </em>it has found only one other state law that provided a prohibited alternative remedy (i.e., <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, supra, </em>498 U.S. 133 (Ingersoll-Rand)), the high court ultimately found that the state law in question\u2014 Illinois\u2019s statute requiring health maintenance organizations (HMO\u2019s) to provide independent review of disputes between primary care physicians and HMO\u2019s\u2014did not conflict with ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement scheme because it did not provide a new cause of action or authorize a new form of ultimate relief. <em>(Rush Prudential, supra, </em>536 U.S. at pp. 379-380.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">The high court acknowledged that the alternative enforcement mechanism rule \u201chas, up to now, been far more straightforward than it is here.\u201d <em>(Rush Prudential, supra, </em>536 U.S. at p. 378.) In contrast to the additional claim or remedy at issue in <em>Pilot Life </em>and <em>Ingersoll-Rand, </em>the state statute in <em>Rush Prudential </em>did not \u201cenlarge\u201d the relief available under ERISA. <em>(Rush Prudential, supra, </em>536 U.S. at p. 379.) \u201c[A]lthough the reviewer\u2019s determination would presumably replace that of the HMO as to what is \u2018medically necessary\u2019 under this contract, the relief ultimately available would still be what ERISA authorizes in a suit for benefits under [29 United States Code section] 1132(a).\u201d <em>(Rush Prudential, supra, </em>536 U.S. at p. 380, fns. omitted.)

Because New York\u2019s surcharges only indirectly affected the prices of insurance policies, which was a result typical of traditional state regulation, the court held the state law was not preempted by ERISA. <em>(Travelers, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 668.) \u201c[A] law operating as an indirect source of merely economic influence on administrative decisions . . . should not suffice to trigger pre-emption . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 662.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1204-8\"> In 1999, the Legislature amended the definition of \u201claborer\u201d (\u00a7 3089) to include \u201can express trust fund described in Section 3111, to whom a portion of the compensation of a laborer ... is paid by agreement with that laborer or the collective bargaining agent of that laborer.\u201d (Stats. 1999, ch. 795, \u00a7 4.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1205-7\"> \u201cA state law that applies to a wide variety of situations, including an appreciable number that have no specific linkage to ERISA plans, constitutes a law of general application for purposes of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a).\u201d <em>(Carpenters Local Union No. 26 v.
