In <em>In re Tyrell J. </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 68 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 33, 876 P.2d 519], we declined to follow the reasoning of <em>Martinez </em>and instead upheld the warrantless search of the person of a juvenile who was on juvenile probation and subject to a search condition of which the police were unaware at the time of the search. In <em>People v. Robles </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 789, 800 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 914, 3 P.3d 311], we held that the search of a residence could not be justified by the circumstance that the defendant\u2019s brother, who lived in the residence, was on probation and subject to a search condition of which the police were unaware at the time of the search. In the present case, police searched the residence of two persons, one of whom was on parole and subject to a search condition of which the police were unaware at the time of the search. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that evidence seized during the search must be suppressed as to both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Defendants Arlene Dena Sanders and Kenton Michael McDaniel were charged by information with possession for sale of cocaine base in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11351.5. The information further alleged that McDaniel had suffered a prior conviction of the same offense. Defendants moved to suppress evidence, and a hearing was conducted at which the following evidence was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">On April 6, 1999, Bakersfield Police Officers Glen Davis and Scott Thatcher responded to a report of a disturbance at an apartment building. They spoke to the building manager, who indicated that there was a fight going on in defendants\u2019 apartment. As they approached the apartment, Officer Davis heard a man and woman inside yelling at each other. Officer Thatcher knocked on the door. The yelling stopped and, a short time later, Sanders peeked out through some blinds. Officer Thatcher knocked again and ordered the occupants to open the door. After a short delay, Sanders opened the door. She had an abrasion on her face, and McDaniel was nearby, standing behind a couch. The officers entered the apartment. They saw McDaniel place something behind a couch cushion. Officer Thatcher caught a glimpse of something metal. Sanders demanded that the officers leave and began \u201ctussling\u201d with Officer Thatcher. McDaniel also demanded that the officers leave and moved toward Officer Thatcher, telling him to leave Sanders alone. The officers handcuffed both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Officer Davis then conducted a \u201cprotective sweep\u201d of the apartment \u201cto make sure there [was] no one else in the residence that could endanger [the officers\u2019] safety.\u201d In one of the bedrooms, the closet door was open and Officer Davis saw a pair of work boots. One of the boots \u201chad a bunch of plastic bags stuffed into it and it had little white chunks of cocaine base knotted into the comers.\u201d After making this discovery and completing the sweep of the apartment, Officer Davis contacted the police department and learned that McDaniel was on parole and \u201csubject to search terms.\u201d Officer Davis requested assistance, including a police dog, and conducted a parole search of the apartment. He seized the baggies he previously had seen in the work boot, as well as other items. Officer Thatcher recovered a pair of scissors from between the couch cushions.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The prosecution introduced into evidence at the suppression motion a one-page document entitled \u201cNotice and Conditions of Parole\u201d that reflected that on May 23, 1998, McDaniel had been released on parole for three years on the condition, among others, that \u201cYou and your residence and any property under your control may be searched without a warrant by an agent of the Department of Corrections or any law enforcement officer.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The superior court denied the motion to suppress evidence. Sanders pled guilty to a reduced charge of possession of a controlled substance, in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11350, and was sentenced to a term of 16 months in prison. McDaniel pled guilty as charged to possession of cocaine base, in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11351.5. The alleged prior conviction was stricken and McDaniel was sentenced to a term of five years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Defendants appealed. They did not challenge the validity of the officer\u2019s entry into the apartment, but argued it was unlawful for the police to search the apartment after defendants were handcuffed. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment, holding that the \u201cprotective sweep\u201d of the apartment was unlawful under the rule announced in <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Buie </em>(1990) 494 U.S. 325 [108 L.Ed.2d 276, 110 S.Ct. 1093], and was not justified as a parole search because the officers were unaware at the time of the search that McDaniel was on parole. We granted review to decide whether the search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>was lawful because McDaniel was on parole, despite the fact that the officers were unaware of McDaniel\u2019s parole status when they conducted the search.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Exclusion of \u201crelevant, but unlawfully obtained evidence\u201d is permitted under article I, section 28, subdivision (d) of the California Constitution \u201conly if exclusion is required by the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>(In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 890 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744].) \u201cThe exclusionary rule was adopted to effectuate the Fourth Amendment right of all citizens \u2018to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures ....\u2019\u201d <em>(United States v. Calandra </em>(1974) 414 U.S. 338, 347 [38 L.Ed.2d 561, 94 S.Ct. 613].) \u201c[T]he \u2018prime purpose\u2019 of the [exclusionary] rule, if not the sole one, \u2018is to deter future unlawful police conduct.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(United States v. Janis </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 433, 446 [49 L.Ed.2d 1046, 96 S.Ct. 3021]; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Powell </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 465, 479 [49 L.Ed.2d 1067, 96 S.Ct. 3037] [\u201c \u2018[T]he exclusion of illegally seized evidence is simply a prophylactic device intended generally to deter Fourth Amendment violations by law enforcement officers.\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u201cThe purpose of the exclusionary rule is not to redress the injury to the privacy of the search victim: \u2018[T]he ruptured privacy of the victims\u2019 homes and effects cannot be restored. Reparation comes too late.\u2019 [Citation.] Instead, the rule\u2019s prime purpose is to deter future unlawful police conduct and thereby effectuate the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures: \u2018The rule is calculated to prevent, not to repair. Its purpose is to deter\u2014to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way\u2014by removing the incentive to disregard it.\u2019 [Citations.] In sum, the rule is a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.\u201d <em>(United States v. Calandra, supra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 347-348, fn. omitted; <em>United States v. Leon </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 897, 906 [82 L.Ed.2d 677, 104 S.Ct. 3405].)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">\u201c \u2018[P]hysical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Payton v. New York </em>(1980) 445 U.S. 573, 585 [63 L.Ed.2d 639, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 1379-1380].) \u201cAt the very core [of the Fourth Amendment] stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.\u201d <em>(Silverman v. United States </em>(1961) 365 U.S. 505, 511 [5 L.Ed.2d 734, 81 S.Ct. 679].)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>Griffin v. Wisconsin </em>(1987) 483 U.S. 868 [97 L.Ed.2d 709, 107 S.Ct. 3164], upheld a warrantless search of the residence of a probationer pursuant to a state regulation permitting any probation officer \u201cto search a probationer\u2019s home without a warrant as long as his supervisor approves and as long as there are \u2018reasonable grounds\u2019 to believe the presence of contraband\u2014 including any item that the probationer cannot possess under the probation conditions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 870-871.) The high court began its analysis by recognizing that \u201c[a] probationer\u2019s home, like anyone else\u2019s, is protected by the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement that searches be \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 873.) But the usual requirement \u201cthat a search be undertaken only pursuant to a warrant\u201d was excused based upon the \u201cspecial need\u201d to supervise probationers. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court also recognized that probationers and parolees \u201cdo not enjoy \u2018the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled, but only . . . conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special [probation] restrictions.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 874.) The court concluded: \u201cSupervision, then, is a \u2018special need\u2019 of the State permitting a degree of impingement upon privacy that would not be constitutional if applied to the public at large.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 875.) The court was quick to add, however, that the \u201cpermissible degree [of impingement upon privacy] is not unlimited.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\"><em>United States v. Knights </em>(2001) 534 U.S. 112 [151 L.Ed.2d 497, 122 S.Ct. 587] held that a law enforcement officer investigating criminal conduct could search the residence of a probationer without a warrant pursuant to a probation search condition. The defendant in <em>Knights </em>was on probation that included a condition that he \u201c \u2018[s]ubmit his . . . person, property, place of residence, vehicle, personal effects, to search at anytime, with or without a search warrant, warrant of arrest or reasonable cause by any probation officer or law enforcement officer.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 114.) A sheriff\u2019s detective who knew of the search condition and suspected Knights had committed acts of vandalism and an act of arson, searched Knights\u2019s home without a warrant and found incriminating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The high court declined to decide \u201cwhether Knights\u2019 acceptance of the search condition constituted consent in the <em>Schneckloth </em>[v. <em>Bustamonte </em>(1973) 412 U.S. 218 [36 L.Ed.2d 854, 93 S.Ct. 2041]] sense of a complete waiver of his Fourth amendment rights\u201d because the court concluded that the search \u201cwas reasonable under our general Fourth Amendment approach of \u2018examining the totality of the circumstances,\u2019 [citation] with the probation search condition being a salient circumstance.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Knights, supra, </em>534 U.S. 112, 118.) The court observed that \u201c[i]nherent in the very nature of probation is that probationers \u2018do not enjoy \u201cthe absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 119.) The court concluded that \u201c[t]he probation condition thus significantly diminished Knights\u2019 reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d <em>(id. </em>at pp. 119-120, fn. omitted), but the court did \u201cnot decide whether the probation condition so diminished, or completely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>eliminated, Knights\u2019 reasonable expectation of privacy (or constituted consent . . .) that a search by a law enforcement officer without any individualized suspicion would have satisfied the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 120, fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn to an examination of California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">In <em>In re Martinez, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 641, we addressed a situation similar to that of the present case, in which police conducted a warrantless search of a residence and later discovered that the suspect was on parole. Martinez was arrested in a car outside his home. Police then conducted a full search of his home without a warrant. The officers were unaware that Martinez was on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">We held that the search of the defendant\u2019s residence could not be justified as a parole search, stating: \u201cAlthough past cases have sometimes declared that a parolee is in \u2018constructive custody\u2019 or \u2018without liberty,\u2019 \u2018[factions of \u201ccustody\u201d and the like . . . cannot change the reality of a parolee\u2019s conditional freedom and cannot affect the constitutional protections surrounding his interest in that conditional freedom.\u2019 [Citation.] In the instant case regular police officers undertook the search pursuant to their general law enforcement duties; the officers, at the time of the search, did not even know of defendant\u2019s parole status. The investigation involved suspected criminal activity, not parole violations. Under these circumstances the officers cannot undertake a search without probable cause and then later seek to justify their actions by relying on the defendant\u2019s parole status, a status of which they were unaware at the time of their search. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Martinez, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 641, 646.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Nearly 25 years later, we questioned the reasoning of <em>Martinez </em>in <em>In re Tyrell J., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 68. In that case, police searched the person of a juvenile probationer without knowing he was subject to a condition of probation that he \u201c \u2018[s]ubmit to a search ... by any law enforcement officer.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 74.) The officer in <em>Tyrell J. </em>encountered the juvenile at a high school football game and conducted a pat-down search after the minor repeatedly adjusted his pants, causing the officer to suspect the juvenile was hiding a weapon. The officer did not find a weapon, but retrieved a bag of marijuana from the minor\u2019s pants. The officer was unaware that the minor was on juvenile probation subject to the condition that he \u201c \u2018[sjubmit to a search of [his] person and property, with or without a warrant, by any law enforcement officer, probation officer or school official.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Tyrell J., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 68, 74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">This court assumed without deciding that the officer lacked sufficient cause for the search, but ruled the search was lawful nevertheless because \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>juvenile probationer subject to a valid search condition does not have a <em>reasonable </em>expectation of privacy over his or her person or property.\u201d <em>(In re Tyrell J., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 68, 86.) We observed that both adult and juvenile probationers \u201c \u2018 \u201chave a reduced expectation of privacy, thereby rendering certain intrusions by governmental authorities \u2018reasonable\u2019 which otherwise would be invalid under traditional constitutional concepts, at least to the extent that such intrusions are necessitated by legitimate governmental demands.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 85.) We relied upon the decisions in <em>Hudson v. Palmer </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 517 [82 L.Ed.2d 393, 104 S.Ct. 3194], which held that a prison inmate had no expectation of privacy in his or her prison cell, and <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Assn. </em>(1989) 489 U.S. 602 [103 L.Ed.2d 639, 109 S.Ct. 1402], which upheld as constitutional federal regulations requiring the testing of the blood and urine of railway workers involved in certain train accidents. Acknowledging that <em>Hudson </em>and <em>Skinner </em>involved situations quite different from the circumstances involved in <em>Tyrell J., </em>we stated: \u201cAlthough the image of a train wreck in <em>Skinner . . . </em>and the prison cell in <em>Hudson </em>... are perhaps extreme examples, the controlling legal proposition in both cases is nevertheless apt. There, as here, the circumstances surrounding the challenged search reveal that the person\u2019s expectation of privacy is not one society is prepared to recognize as reasonable and legitimate.\u201d <em>(In re Tyrell J., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 68, 86.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The court in <em>Tyrell J. </em>also relied upon the circumstance that the suspect in that case was a juvenile, observing that \u201cimposing a strict requirement that the searching officer must always have advance knowledge of the search condition would be inconsistent with the special needs of the juvenile probation scheme. That scheme embraces a goal of rehabilitating youngsters who have transgressed the law, a goal that is arguably stronger than in the adult context.\u201d <em>(In re Tyrell J., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 68, 86-87.) We also recognized, however, that such advance knowledge of the search condition is desirable, because it \u201chelps ensure that the resulting search is not conducted \u2018for reasons unrelated to the rehabilitative and reformative purposes of probation or other legitimate law enforcement purposes.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 87.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">We acknowledged that language in our opinion in <em>Martinez </em>\u201cappears conducive to the minor\u2019s position,\u201d but we declined to follow \u201cthe stated rationale in <em>Martinez </em>because, at the time that decision was rendered, there existed no automatic search condition imposed on parolees, inclusive of searches to be performed either by parole officers or law enforcement officers. Therefore, although the defendant in <em>Martinez </em>might have been subject to search by his parole officer, he could reasonably expect to be free of arbitrary searches by police officers. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Tyrell J., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 68, 88-89.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Justice Kennard, joined by Justice Mosk, argued in her dissent that the court\u2019s basis for distinguishing our earlier decision in <em>Martinez </em>was flawed, noting that when <em>Martinez </em>was decided, \u201cexpress search conditions were rarely used with parole grants because, under the doctrine of \u2018custodia legis,\u2019 the status of parolee was deemed sufficient in itself to justify excepting searches by parole authorities from the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. [Citations.] Under this view, every grant of parole included an implied search condition, and an officer\u2019s knowledge of parole status was equivalent to knowledge of a parole search condition.\u201d <em>(In re Tyrell J., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 68, 94 (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The majority in <em>Tyrell J. </em>observed that its opinion was \u201cconsistent with the primary purpose of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule,\u201d which, as noted above, \u201c \u2018 \u201cis to deter future unlawful police conduct and thereby effectuate the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures\u201d \u2019 [citations],\u201d reasoning that because the officer did not know the minor was subject to a search condition, he \u201ctook the chance that the search would be deemed improper.\u201d <em>(In re Tyrell J., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 68, 89.) The majority concluded, therefore, that \u201cour reluctance to adopt a strict \u2018knowledge-first\u2019 rule for juvenile probation search conditions will not encourage police to engage in warrantless searches.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Justice Kennard disagreed, stating that the majority\u2019s holding \u201coffers police officers an incentive to search any juvenile despite the lack of probable cause and a warrant, for if it later turns out that the juvenile has a probation search condition, the fruits of the search will be admissible in court.\u201d <em>(In re Tyrell J., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 68, 98 (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Our holding in <em>Tyrell J. </em>that police could justify a search based upon the existence of a search condition of which they were unaware received a chilly reception. Referring to our earlier decision in <em>Martinez, </em>one commentator stated: \u201cRegrettably, that eminently sound position was later abandoned in <em>In re Tyrell J. </em>on the bizarre reasoning that a probationer who knows that he is subject to \u2018a valid search condition\u2019 to his release consequently \u2018does not have a <em>reasonable </em>expectation of privacy over his person or property\u2019 vis-a-vis any search by anyone, including a search by a police officer unaware of the probationer status! As the dissent in <em>Tyrell J. </em>aptly noted, that strange conclusion, without precedent in <em>any </em>jurisdiction, gives police an incentive to make searches even without probable cause because, should it turn out that the suspect is a probationer, the evidence will be admissible nonetheless.\u201d (4 La Fave, Search and Seizure (3d ed. 1996) \u00a7 10.10(e), p. 792.) Other commentators have been equally unkind. (Comment, <em>Fourth Amendment Protections for the Juvenile Probationer After In Re Tyrell J. </em>(1996) 36 Santa Clara L.Rev. 865, 884 [\u201cThe court\u2019s decision is unsettling, as it erodes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>credibility of Fourth Amendment protections.\u201d (Fn. omitted.)]; Comment, <em>Fourth Amendment Protection for Juvenile Probationers in California, Slim or None?: In re Tyrell J. </em>(1995) 22 Hastings Const.

Robles, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 789, in which we examined whether the warrantless search of the defendant\u2019s residence was proper because, unknown to the searching officers, a cohabitant was on probation and subject to a search condition. Police conducted an unlawful search of the defendant\u2019s garage and discovered a stolen car. The next day, police learned that the defendant\u2019s brother, who shared the apartment with the defendant, was on probation and was subject to a search condition. We held the search was unlawful, because the police violated the defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy by entering the garage without a warrant and without knowledge of the brother\u2019s search condition. (23 Cal.3d at p. 800.)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">We declined to extend the logic of <em>Tyrell J. </em>to validate the search of the garage, stating: \u201cEven though a person subject to a search condition has a severely diminished expectation of privacy . . . those who reside with such a person enjoy measurably greater privacy expectations in the eyes of society.\u201d <em>(People v. Robles, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 789, 798.) We recognized that the extent of such a cohabitant\u2019s expectation of privacy hinged, in part, upon the searching officer\u2019s knowledge of the search condition: \u201c[C]ohabitants need not anticipate that officers with no knowledge of the probationer\u2019s existence or search condition may freely invade their residence in the absence of a warrant or exigent circumstances. Thus, while cohabitants have no cause to complain of searches that are reasonably and objectively related to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>purposes of probation . . . they may legitimately challenge those searches that are not. <em>Tyrell J., </em>which focused specifically on the reasonableness of a probationer\u2019s privacy expectations, does not indicate otherwise.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 799.)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">We then turned to the conclusion in <em>Tyrell J. </em>that its holding is consistent with the primary purpose of the exclusionary rule\u2014to deter future unlawful police conduct. <em>(In re Tyrell J., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 68, 89.) We noted in <em>Robles </em>that \u201cresidential searches present an altogether different situation.\u201d <em>(People v. Robles, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 789, 800.) \u201cNotably, residences frequently are occupied by several people living together, including immediate family members and perhaps other relatives or friends, as well as guests. Allowing the People to validate a warrantless residential search, after the fact, by means of showing a sufficient connection between the residence and any one of a number of occupants who happens to be subject to a search clause, would encourage the police to engage in facially invalid searches with increased odds that a justification could be found later. It also would create a significant potential for abuse since the police, in effect, would be conducting searches with no perceived boundaries, limitations, or justification. [Citation.] The potential for abuse, with its consequent impact on the citizenry, is especially heightened in high crime areas where police might suspect probationers to live. Thus, while society generally has an interest in having all probative evidence before the court, in circumstances such as these a knowledge-first requirement is appropriate to deter future police misconduct and to effectuate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Our holding in <em>Robles </em>mandates the conclusion that the search in the present case was unlawful as to Sanders.  As we held in <em>Robles, </em>Sanders had a reduced expectation of privacy because she was living with a parolee subject to a search condition, but she \u201cneed not anticipate that officers with no knowledge of the probationer\u2019s existence or search condition may freely invade their residence in the absence of a warrant or exigent circumstances.\u201d <em>(People v. Robles, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 789, 799.)  The circumstance that McDaniel was on parole, while the defendant\u2019s brother in <em>Robles </em>was on probation, makes no difference; the expectation of privacy of cohabitants is the same whether the search condition is a condition of probation or parole. It is clear that the search was unlawful as to Sanders.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>The Attorney General conceded in the Court of Appeal that the search was unlawful as to Sanders and repeated that concession in his opening brief in this court. The Attorney General recanted that concession, however, in response to the amicus curiae brief of the California District Attorneys Association. The Attorney General now argues that although the evidence was discovered during the invalid protective sweep, \u201cthe evidence was later obtained independently during a valid parole search, untainted by the protective sweep.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The Attorney General\u2019s belated justification for the search fails. Citing <em>Segura </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 796 [82 L.Ed.2d 599, 104 S.Ct. 3380], the Attorney General argues that \u201cthe evidence discovered in this case resulted from lawful police conduct, independent from the protective sweep.\u201d The decision in <em>Segura, </em>however, involved facts that were far different from the circumstances in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In <em>Segura, </em>law enforcement officers illegally entered the defendant\u2019s apartment to secure the premises while a search warrant was being obtained. Despite the illegal entry into the apartment, the high court held \u201cthe evidence discovered during the subsequent search of the apartment the following day pursuant to the valid search warrant issued wholly on information known to the officers before the entry into the apartment need not have been suppressed as \u2018fruit\u2019 of the illegal entry, because the warrant and the information on which it was based were unrelated to the entry, and therefore constituted an independent source for the evidence . . . .\u201d <em>(Segura v. United States, supra, </em>468 U.S. 796, 799.) In the present case, it cannot be said that the parole search was unrelated to the unlawful protective sweep of the apartment. It was only after drugs were discovered during the unlawful protective sweep that Officer Davis contacted the police department and learned that McDaniel was on parole and subject to a search condition. On the record before us, we have no basis upon which to conclude that the seizure of the drugs was not the fruit of the unlawful protective sweep of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Having concluded that the search was unlawful as to Sanders, we turn to the more difficult question of whether the search also was unlawful as to McDaniel. We did not consider in <em>Robles </em>whether a search that violates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>reasonable expectation of privacy of a cohabitant of a parolee subject to a search condition also is unlawful as to the parolee.  We now conclude that it is. As we recognized in <em>In re Martinez, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 641, 646, police cannot justify an otherwise unlawful search of a residence because, unbeknownst to the police, a resident of the dwelling was on parole and subject to a search condition. As we explain, this result flows from the rule that whether a search is reasonable must be determined based upon the circumstances known to the officer when the search is conducted and is consistent with the primary purpose of the exclusionary rule\u2014to deter police misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In <em>Martinez, </em>we rejected the view \u201cthat a parolee is without any constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Martinez, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 641, 647, fn. 5.) Instead, we recognized \u201c \u2018the reality of a parolee\u2019s conditional freedom and ... the constitutional protections surrounding his interest in that conditional freedom.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 646.)  A parolee\u2019s expectation of privacy certainly is diminished, but it is not eliminated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Tyrell </em>J., however, we declined to follow the reasoning of <em>Martinez </em>and held instead that \u201ca juvenile probationer subject to a valid search condition does not have a <em>reasonable </em>expectation of privacy over his or her person or property.\u201d <em>(In re Tyrell J., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 68, 86.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">In <em>People v. Reyes </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 743, 754 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 734, 968 P.2d 445], we held that \u201ceven in the absence of particularized suspicion, a search conducted under the auspices of a properly imposed parole search condition does not intrude on any expectation of privacy \u2018society is \u201cprepared to recognize as legitimate.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (Contra, <em>United States v. Crawford </em>(9th Cir. 2003) 323 F.3d 700.) In <em>Reyes, </em>unlike the present case and <em>Tyrell </em>J., the searching officer was aware of the existence of the search condition. In fact, the standard adopted in <em>Reyes, </em>upholding a search conducted \u201cunder the auspices of a properly imposed parole search condition,\u201d presumes the officer\u2019s awareness of the search condition, because a search cannot be conducted \u201cunder the auspices\u201d of a search condition if the officer is unaware that the condition exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>We recognized in <em>Reyes </em>that whether the parolee has a reasonable expectation of privacy is inextricably linked to whether the search was reasonable.  A law enforcement officer who is aware that a suspect is on parole and subject to a search condition may act reasonably in conducting a parole search even in the absence of a particularized suspicion of criminal activity, and such a search does not violate any expectation of privacy of the parolee. We observed in <em>Reyes: </em>\u201cThe level of intrusion is de minimis and the expectation of privacy greatly reduced when the subject of the search is on notice that his activities are being routinely and closely monitored. Moreover, the purpose of the search condition is to deter the commission of crimes and to protect the public, and the effectiveness of the deterrent is enhanced by the potential for random searches. We thus conclude a parole search may be reasonable despite the absence of particularized suspicion.\u201d <em>(People v. Reyes, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 743, 753.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">But our reasoning in <em>Reyes </em>does not apply if the officer is unaware that the suspect is on parole and subject to a search condition. Despite the parolee\u2019s diminished expectation of privacy, such a search cannot be justified as a parole search, because the officer is not acting pursuant to the conditions of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In order to determine whether the search was unlawful as to McDaniel, we must examine \u201c \u2018the totality of the circumstances,\u2019 \u201d with two salient circumstances being McDaniel\u2019s parole search condition and the officer\u2019s lack of knowledge of that condition. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Knights, supra, </em>534 U.S. 112, 118.) \u201cThe touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and the reasonableness of a search is determined \u2018by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual\u2019s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 118-119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The decision in <em>United States v. Knights, supra, </em>534 U.S. 112, upheld a search of a probationer for an \u201cinvestigatory\u201d rather than a \u201cprobationary\u201d purpose conducted by a police officer who knew the probationer was subject to a search condition. The high court relied upon the probationer\u2019s diminished expectation of privacy and the state\u2019s dual interest in determining whether the probationer is complying with the terms of probation and protecting the community from further criminal acts by the probationer; \u201cWhen an officer has reasonable suspicion that a probationer subject to a search condition is engaged in criminal activity, there is enough likelihood that criminal conduct is occurring that an intrusion on the probationer\u2019s significantly diminished privacy interests is reasonable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 121.) But if an officer is unaware that a suspect is on probation and subject to a search condition, the search is not justified by the state\u2019s interest in supervising probationers or by the concern that probationers are more likely to commit criminal acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>This is not to say that the validity of the search depends upon the officer\u2019s purpose.

But whether a search is reasonable must be determined based upon the circumstances known to the officer when the search is conducted. \u201c[A]lmost without exception in evaluating alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment the Court has first undertaken an objective assessment of an officer\u2019s actions in light of the facts and circumstances then known to him.\u201d <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1978) 436 U.S. 128, 137 [56 L.Ed.2d 168, 98 S.Ct. 1717]; <em>Ornelas v.

The rule serves \u201c \u2018to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way\u2014by removing the incentive to disregard it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mapp v. Ohio </em>(1961) 367 U.S. 643, 656 [6 L.Ed.2d 1081, 81 S.Ct. 1684].) \u201cThe rule also serves another vital function\u2014 \u2018the imperative of judicial integrity.\u2019 [Citation.] Courts which sit under our Constitution cannot and will not be made party to lawless invasions of the constitutional rights of citizens by permitting unhindered governmental use of the fruits of such invasions. Thus, in our system, evidentiary rulings provide the context in which the judicial process of inclusion and exclusion approves some conduct as comporting with constitutional guarantees and disapproves other actions by state agents. A ruling admitting evidence in a criminal trial, we recognize, has the necessary effect of legitimizing the conduct which produced the evidence, while an application of the exclusionary rule withholds the constitutional imprimatur.\u201d <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 1, 12-13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>[20 L.Ed.2d 889, 88 S.Ct. 1868]; <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>supra, 428 U.S. 465, 492 [\u201cthis demonstration that our society attaches serious consequences to violation of constitutional rights is thought to encourage those who formulate law enforcement policies, and the officers who implement them, to incorporate Fourth Amendment ideals into their value system\u201d (fn. omitted)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Thus, the admission of evidence obtained during a search of a residence that the officer had no reason to believe was lawful merely because it later was discovered that the suspect was subject to a search condition would legitimize unlawful police conduct.  Accordingly, we hold that an otherwise unlawful search of the residence of an adult parolee may not be justified by the circumstance that the suspect was subject to a search condition of which the law enforcement officers were unaware when the search was conducted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">An additional reason for suppressing the evidence obtained in the search of the residence in the present case, where the police were unaware that one of the residents was subject to a search condition, is to protect the rights of the parolee\u2019s cohabitants and guests. As we recognized in <em>Robles, </em>and as is demonstrated by the circumstances of the present case, a search of the residence of a person subject to a search condition often affects the rights of cohabitants and guests as well. Permitting evidence that has been suppressed as to a cohabitant to be used against the parolee would encourage searches that violate the rights of cohabitants and guests by rewarding police for conducting an unlawful search of a residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">As we noted in <em>Robles: </em>\u201cMany law-abiding citizens might choose not to open their homes to probationers [or parolees] if doing so were to result in the validation of arbitrary police action. If increased numbers of probationers were not welcome in homes with supportive environments, higher recidivism rates and a corresponding decrease in public safety may be expected, both of which would detract from the \u2018optimum successful functioning\u2019 of the probation system.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Robles, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 789, 799.) The assurance that evidence discovered during such an arbitrary search could not be used against the \u201claw-abiding citizen\u201d would provide little solace if the police still were encouraged to conduct such unlawful searches by permitting them to use any evidence discovered against the probationer or parolee. \u201cThe potential for abuse, with its consequent impact on the citizenry, is especially heightened in high crime areas where police might suspect probationers to live.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 800.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>We held in <em>Robles </em>that permitting police to use a search condition to justify the search of a residence when the officer was unaware of the probation condition serves to encourage unlawful police conduct, especially in neighborhoods in which a higher than average number of persons are on probation. <em>(People v. Robles, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 789, 800 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 914, 3 P.3d 311].) The same would be true if we permitted the People to admit the evidence only against the person subject to the search condition, rather than against all of the occupants of the residence. The police still would be encouraged to engage in facially invalid searches in the hope that at least one of the occupants would be subject to a search condition. Suppressing the evidence only as to cohabitants of a person subject to a search condition, but not as to the probationer or parolee, would do little to decrease the chance that a person living with a probationer or parolee would be the victim of an unlawful search and would largely eviscerate the protections granted in <em>Robles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">George, C.

Here, as in <em>Tyrell J., </em>the issue is whether, under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a search may be validated after the fact by reliance on a search condition unknown to the searching officer at the time of the search. In each case, the search condition had been imposed without the agreement or consent of the person later subjected to the search. In each case, consideration of the purpose of the Fourth Amendment, to \u201csafeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials\u201d <em>(Camara v. Municipal Court </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 523, 528 [18 L.Ed.2d 930, 87 S.Ct. 1727]), leads to the conclusion that the search was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">The federal Constitution\u2019s Fourth Amendment provides: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause . . . .\u201d The United States Supreme Court has said: \u201c \u2018[S]earches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>approval by a judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable . . . subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions. The exceptions are \u2018jealously and carefully drawn,\u2019 and there must be \u2018a showing by those who seek exemption . . . that the exigencies of the situation made that course imperative.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Coolidge v. New Hampshire </em>(1970) 403 U.S. 443, 454-455 [29 L.Ed.2d 564, 91 S.Ct. 2022].)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">At issue in <em>Tyrell J. </em>was the warrantless search of a minor at a school football game. When the minor moved to suppress the marijuana found during that search, the prosecution sought to justify it based on a condition of the minor\u2019s juvenile probation in an earlier unrelated case that he submit \u201c \u2018to a search of [his] person and property, with or without a warrant, by any law enforcement officer, probation officer or school official.\u2019 \u201d The juvenile court denied the suppression motion and declared the minor a ward of the court. <em>(Tyrell J., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 74-75.) The Court of Appeal reversed, reasoning that \u201cthe fortuity of the search condition did not validate the otherwise improper search\u201d by a police officer who did not know of the search condition. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">A majority of this court disagreed with that holding, concluding that to impose \u201ca strict requirement that the searching officer must always have advance knowledge of the search condition would be inconsistent with the special needs of the juvenile probation scheme.\u201d <em>(Tyrell J., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 86-87.) Because of those \u201cspecial needs,\u201d the <em>Tyrell J. </em>majority reasoned, a juvenile probationer subject to a search condition must \u201cassume every law enforcement officer might stop and search him at any moment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 87.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In expressing a different view in my dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Mosk, I relied on two decisions, <em>In re Martinez </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 641 [83 Cal.Rptr. 382, 463 P.2d 734] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Gallegos </em>(1964) 62 Cal.2d 176 [41 Cal.Rptr. 590, 397 P.2d 174], in which this court had held that the prosecution may not rely on a probation or parole search condition when the searching officer did not know of its existence. (See <em>Tyrell J., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 94 (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) Embracing that view in this case, the majority invalidates the warrantless search of the apartment occupied by defendants Sanders and McDaniel because at the time of the search the officers did not know that McDaniel was on parole and therefore subject to a parole condition that he submit to warrantless searches. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 335.) Left open by the majority here is the continuing vitality of the majority opinion in <em>Tyrell J., </em>which upheld an officer\u2019s warrantless search of a minor based upon the minor\u2019s probation search condition of which the officer conducting the search was unaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">I would draw no distinction between the warrantless search of an adult parolee and the warrantless search of a juvenile probationer. As to each, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>would apply the same analysis: Neither search can later be justified by information such as the search condition in this case that was unknown to the searching officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">I have an additional observation about the majority\u2019s analysis. As I noted at the outset, the purpose of the Fourth Amendment is to safeguard the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. (See <em>Tyrell J., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 98 (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) Throughout the opinion, the majority in this case refers to the exclusionary rule\u2019s goal of deterring unlawful police conduct as supporting its holding that the search here cannot be justified by a parole search condition of which the searching officers were ignorant. But that goal is not relevant in determining whether a particular search or seizure violates the Fourth Amendment, which is the issue here. The exclusionary rule\u2019s purpose comes into play only when the inquiry is whether unlawfully obtained evidence must be suppressed. As the United States Supreme Court has pointed out: \u201cWhether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately imposed in a particular case ... is \u2018an issue separate from the question whether . . . Fourth Amendment rights . . . were violated by police conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>(United States v. Leon </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 897, 906 [82 L.Ed.2d 677, 104 S.Ct. 3405].) Here, there is no dispute between the parties that any evidence seized unlawfully from defendants cannot be used against them in a criminal trial. Thus, not at issue here is whether unlawful police conduct justifies suppression of evidence. Unlike the majority, therefore, I see no need to consider the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">For the reasons given, I join the majority in affirming the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment invalidating the search of the apartment occupied by defendants Sanders and McDaniel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\"> Shortly before oral argument, the Attorney General filed a request for judicial notice of copies of the complaint, the information, and the abstract of judgment in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kenton Michael McDaniel, </em>Superior Court of Kern County, No. SC69228A.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>exclusionary rule \u201cthus operates as \u2018a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Accordingly, \u201c[w]hether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately imposed in a particular case\u201d\u2014and hence the relevance of its deterrence purpose\u2014\u201cis \u2018an issue separate from the question whether the Fourth Amendment rights of the party seeking to invoke the rule were violated by police conduct.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>This distinction logically follows from the fact that an exclusionary remedy presupposes some illegality. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Peltier </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 531, 539 [45 L.Ed.2d 374, 95 S.Ct. 2313]; <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Tucker </em>(1974) 417 U.S. 433, 447 [41 L.Ed.2d 182, 94 S.Ct. 2357].) In other words, until police officers conduct an unlawful search or seizure, the question of sanction or deterrence does not arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">A review of United States Supreme Court decisions discussing the purpose of the exclusionary rule confirms this premise. In each case, the court was not determining if the defendant had suffered a constitutional violation but whether\u2014given a violation\u2014illegally obtained evidence could nevertheless be admitted, i.e., whether under the circumstances exclusion would advance the goal of deterring future police misconduct. For example, in <em>United States v. Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. 897, the court considered whether the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule justified extending its scope to evidence seized pursuant to a facially valid warrant later found unsupported by probable cause. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 908-912, 918-919.) In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra </em>(1974) 414 U.S. 338 [38 L.Ed.2d 561, 94 S.Ct. 613], the question was whether the exclusionary rule should apply to grand jury proceedings. Similarly, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Janis </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 433 [49 L.Ed.2d 1046, 96 S.Ct. 3021], the court considered its application to federal civil proceedings where evidence had been illegally seized by state officials.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Here, we confront a threshold Fourth Amendment question: whether the officers conducted an illegal search because they were unaware at the time that Kenton Michael McDaniel was subject to a parole search condition, which would have otherwise validated their conduct. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Woods </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 668, 681-682 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 88, 981 P.2d 1019]; <em>People v.

Until we know they acted unlawfully, deterrence is not at issue because the matter of sanction has not yet arisen. And the fact that deterrence is the primary purpose of the exclusionary rule does not assist in analyzing the predicate question.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Until <em>In re Tyrell J., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 68, and <em>People v. Robles </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 789 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 914, 3 P.3d 311], this court\u2019s search and seizure jurisprudence was generally consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s view that the purpose of the exclusionary rule was relevant to the scope of the remedy, not the contours of the constitutional right itself.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both of these decisions concerned the legality of the officers\u2019 conduct, not the appropriateness of excluding the evidence. In <em>Tyrell J., </em>however, the court\u2019s analysis for the first time\u2014perhaps to shore up a constitutionally suspect result\u2014included reference to the \u201cprimary purpose of the Fourth Amendment\u201d as part of its rationale. <em>(Tyrell J., </em>at p. 89.) The misstep instigated by <em>Tyrell J. </em>was compounded in <em>Robles </em>with a similar discussion. <em>(Robles, </em>at pp. 799-800.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Now, once again, the majority embraces the same misdirected reasoning. Error, however, does not improve with repetition. The third time is not the charm. The deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule is not a consideration in assessing the totality of the circumstances affecting the reasonableness of a search. While conflating Fourth Amendment principles does not produce an incorrect result in this case, we should avoid sloppy analysis that could cause future mischief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-6\"> See <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Krull </em>(1987) 480 U.S. 340 [94 L.Ed.2d 364, 107 S.Ct. 1160] (question whether exclusionary rule applies to evidence obtained in objectively reasonable reliance on statute subsequently found unconstitutional); <em>Nix v.

Disregarding that admonishment, the majority holds here that if police officers do not know a defendant is a parolee when searching the defendant\u2019s home without a warrant, the circumstance that the defendant is in fact subject to a parole term that provides legal authority for the search is absolutely irrelevant to the search\u2019s validity. But a parole search term significantly diminishes a defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy, whether or not the searching officers know the defendant is on parole. Accordingly, I find that, whether or not the officers are aware of it, a defendant\u2019s status as a parolee with a validly imposed parole search term warrants full consideration in assessing a search\u2019s reasonableness under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The precise question here is whether police officers violated the Fourth Amendment rights of defendants Kenton Michael McDaniel and Arlene Dena Sanders when they responded to a report of a loud and apparently physical domestic dispute in progress at defendants\u2019 apartment unit and then searched the unit without a warrant and without knowing that McDaniel was on parole. The majority gives no weight to the circumstance that McDaniel\u2019s parole terms authorized the officers to search his home when investigating the reported dispute. The majority further concludes that the officers\u2019 lack of knowledge regarding McDaniel\u2019s parolee status renders the search constitutionally invalid as to both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">I concur in the majority\u2019s decision that the search infringed upon defendant Sanders\u2019s constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. \u201c \u2018[Examining the totality of the circumstances\u2019 \u201d <em>(Knights, supra, </em>534 U.S. at p. 118), however, I conclude otherwise with respect to defendant McDaniel. Even though the officers did not know McDaniel was a parolee when they arrived at the apartment and conducted the challenged search, that circumstance did not meaningfully alter or increase McDaniel\u2019s legitimate expectation of privacy as a parolee in that situation.

Application of those standards leads me to conclude that the challenged search did not violate McDaniel\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">In <em>Knights, supra, </em>534 U.S. 112, the United States Supreme Court reiterated the now familiar principle that \u201c[t]he touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and the reasonableness of a search is determined \u2018by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual\u2019s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Knights, supra, </em>534 U.S. at pp. 118-119.) Under the high court\u2019s general Fourth Amendment approach, courts \u201c \u2018examin[e] the totality of the circumstances\u2019 \u201d to evaluate whether a particular warrantless search was reasonable. (Id. at p. 118.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Here, the factual circumstances surrounding the challenged search are undisputed. Defendant McDaniel was a parolee. He was subject to a lawfully imposed parole search term that put him on notice that any law enforcement officer might search his person and his residence at any time without a warrant. While in their apartment, defendants McDaniel and Sanders engaged in a loud fight that led neighbors to call the police. When police officers arrived and knocked on the door, someone deadbolted the door, refusing them entry. Eventually Sanders opened the door and allowed the officers inside. At that point, the officers saw McDaniel hide something metallic behind a couch cushion. The officers also observed that Sanders appeared to have been in a physical altercation, with a fresh abrasion on her face. Sanders and McDaniel soon became belligerent and combative with the officers. McDaniel demanded that they leave the apartment, even though his parolee status entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>the officers to stay and to search him and his residence without a warrant. After handcuffing both defendants, the officers made a protective sweep of the other rooms of the apartment to check for third persons. During this sweep, the officers saw a boot containing drug contraband in plain view in an open closet of one of the bedrooms. After seeing the boot, the officers contacted the police department and learned that McDaniel was on parole and subject to a search term. They requested assistance and conducted a parole search of the apartment. The contraband was seized, and a pair of scissors was recovered from between the couch cushions.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Defendants do not challenge the validity of the officers\u2019 entry into the apartment, but argue it was unlawful for the officers to search the apartment after handcuffing them. The majority agrees with defendants. Assuming the officers\u2019 protective sweep was, as the Court of Appeal found, unlawful under <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Buie </em>(1990) 494 U.S. 325 [108 L.Ed.2d 276, 110 S.Ct. 1093],<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the majority concludes it was not justified as a parole search because the officers did not know when they made the sweep that McDaniel was on parole. I disagree. Given the totality of the circumstances surrounding the challenged search, I find it did not violate the parolee\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to privacy. My reasons are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Following Knights\u2019s totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, I first examine the degree to which the search intruded on the parolee\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy. On this score, it is settled that an individual\u2019s \u201c \u2018capacity to claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment depends . . . upon whether the person who claims the protection of the Amendment has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded place.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Minnesota v. Carter </em>(1998) 525 U.S. 83, 88 [142 L.Ed.2d 373, 119 S.Ct. 469].) For a person to have a legitimate expectation of privacy, he or she must have manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search, and that expectation must be one society recognizes as reasonable. <em>(California v. Ciraolo </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 207, 211 [90 L.Ed.2d 210, 106 S.Ct. 1809]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robles </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 789, 795 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 914, 3 P.3d 311]; <em>In re Tyrell J. </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 68, 83 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 33, 876 P.2d 519].)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Here, McDaniel was subject to a lawfully imposed search term that expressly applied both to his person and to his residence. There appears no reason to doubt that McDaniel was unambiguously informed of this term. The existence of this search term is, as the United States Supreme Court puts it, a \u201csalient circumstance\u201d in the analysis. <em>(Knights, supra, </em>534 U.S. at p. 118 [describing a probation search condition as a \u201csalient circumstance\u201d].) But whatever <em>subjective </em>expectation of privacy McDaniel may have had with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>respect to the illegal drugs in his apartment bedroom, the parole search term significantly diminished his <em>reasonable </em>expectation of privacy in the same way that a search condition significantly diminishes a probationer\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 119-120.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\"><em>Knights </em>next calls for assessing the degree to which a warrantless search of a parolee is \u201c \u2018needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Knights, supra, </em>534 U.S. at p. 119.) Plainly, the governmental interests at stake here are legitimate and well established. \u201cAs a convicted felon still subject to the Department of Corrections, a parolee has conditional freedom\u2014granted for the specific purpose of monitoring his transition from inmate to free citizen. The state has a duty not only to assess the efficacy of its rehabilitative efforts but to protect the public, and the importance of the latter interest justifies the imposition of a warrantless search condition.\u201d <em>(Reyes, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 752.) The state\u2019s requirement of search terms for parolees \u201cis triggered by [the parolee\u2019s] own conduct. The existence of this triggering event\u2014the crime which results in conviction . . . \u2014creates the compelling need for government intervention and diminishes any reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The high court similarly recognizes that a state\u2019s \u201cinterest in apprehending violators of the criminal law, thereby protecting potential victims of criminal enterprise, may therefore justifiably focus on <em>probationers </em>in a way that it does not on the ordinary citizen.\u201d <em>(Knights, supra, </em>534 U.S. at p. 121, italics added.) A parolee such as McDaniel, however, presents a much more serious risk to society than a probationer, in that a parolee is not placed on probation but is sent to prison, either because of the seriousness of his or her crimes or because of criminal recidivism that warrants a state prison sentence. A fortiori, a state\u2019s interest in protecting the public is even greater in the case of parolees, who more so than probationers have demonstrated a \u201cproclivity for anti-social criminal, and often violent, conduct\u201d and an inability \u201cto control and conform their behavior to the legitimate standards of society by the normal impulses of self-restraint.\u201d <em>(Hudson v. Palmer </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 517, 526 [82 L.Ed.2d 393, 104 S.Ct. 3194] [describing prisoners].)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Relying on <em>New Jersey v. T.L.O. </em>(1985) 469 U.S. 325, 337-338 [83 L.Ed.2d 720, 105 S.Ct. 733], and other high court authority, <em>Reyes </em>observed there are two additional factors relevant to determining whether a challenged intrusion is justified: the necessity for the intrusion, and the procedure used in conducting the search. <em>(Reyes, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 751.) In our case, both of these factors support the reasonableness of the search as to the parolee. As noted, in this case the police officers did not decide randomly or arbitrarily to investigate an individual and search his house without justification, hoping to find evidence of criminal activity. Rather, the parolee\u2019s own conduct\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>participating in an altercation that caused concerned neighbors to call police\u2014prompted the police to come to the parolee\u2019s apartment. Also, what the officers saw in plain view\u2014a fresh abrasion on Sanders\u2019s face, McDaniel\u2019s attempt to hide something metallic behind a couch cushion, and both defendants\u2019 becoming belligerent and combative toward them\u2014prompted them to handcuff both defendants and to make a protective sweep of the residence. Although the officers evidently misjudged the propriety of a protective sweep in the situation before them, the procedure they employed was in fact no more invasive or violative of McDaniel\u2019s privacy than what he could reasonably expect, given his parole search term and his conduct. Indeed, as a parolee involved in a loud, and apparently physical, domestic dispute, McDaniel should fully have expected police intervention and invocation of his parole search term. The fact that the searching officers did not know of the parole term at the outset of their involvement did not, from McDaniel\u2019s perspective, meaningfully alter or increase any reasonable expectation of privacy he may have had as a parolee in those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Because our decisions and those of the high court uniformly instruct courts to examine <em>the totality of the circumstances </em>when evaluating the reasonableness of a warrantless search, it is wrong as a matter of law for the majority to regard only one factor as controlling, i.e., the searching officers\u2019 lack of knowledge that McDaniel was a parolee. (See <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Robinette </em>(1996) 519 U.S. 33, 39 [136 L.Ed.2d 347, 117 S.Ct. 417] [\u201cwe have consistently eschewed bright-line rules, instead emphasizing the fact-specific nature of the reasonableness inquiry\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">While lack of knowledge certainly is significant, the search here was reasonable in light of all the following circumstances: (1) when the officers conducted the search, McDaniel was subject to a parole search term that provided legal authority and a valid justification for the search; (2) McDaniel\u2019s expectation of privacy in his home was greatly reduced due to his parolee status and parole search term; (3) the officers did not go to defendants\u2019 apartment arbitrarily or capriciously or for purposes of harassing the occupants; rather, defendants\u2019 engagement in a loud and apparently physical fight, their belligerence, and McDaniel\u2019s suspicious hiding of a metallic object, prompted the officers\u2019 involvement and actions; (4) the officers acted with what they believed was proper justification in making the protective sweep; (5) although, given their grasp of the situation, the officers apparently misjudged the propriety of a protective sweep, that sweep was in fact not intrusive of McDaniel\u2019s privacy expectations, because his parole terms expressly authorized it, and he could reasonably have expected it, given the circumstances that brought the officers to his door; and (6) the government\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>significant interests in deterring parolees from criminal activity and protecting the public from their crimes would be advanced by our finding the search reasonable as to McDaniel and allowing admission of the drug contraband evidence at his criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The majority properly acknowledges that a search\u2019s validity does not turn on the individual officers\u2019 actual motivations. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 334.) But by evaluating the search\u2019s reasonableness with reference to only those \u201ccircumstances <em>known to the officer </em>when the search is conducted\u201d <em>(ibid., </em>italics added), the majority fails to \u201c \u2018examin[e] the totality of the circumstances\u2019 \u201d <em>(Knights, supra, </em>534 U.S. at p. 118). In so doing, the majority effectively rejects the high court\u2019s determination that a lawfully imposed search term \u201csignificantly diminish[es]\u201d one\u2019s \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 120) and is \u201ca salient circumstance\u201d in the analysis <em>(id. </em>at p. 118).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Moreover, the majority is demonstrably wrong in concluding that actual circumstances may never validate a search where the facts known or otherwise available to the searching officer would not have justified a person of reasonable caution in the belief that a search was appropriate. In a consensual search, for instance, it generally is accepted that the facts available to the officer when conducting a search must cause the officer to have a reasonable belief that a third party who consents has authority over the premises to be searched. But if the facts do not give rise to such reasonable belief, then the officer\u2019s \u201cwarrantless entry without further inquiry is unlawful <em>unless authority actually </em>exists.\u201d <em>(Illinois v. Rodriguez </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 177, 188-189 [111 L.Ed.2d 148, 110 S.Ct. 2793], italics added.) Hence, by excluding consideration of the circumstance that a lawful basis for the search (i.e., the parole search term) existed at the time of the officers\u2019 protective sweep, the majority disregards this established Fourth Amendment principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The majority\u2019s rule leads to absurd consequences, as the following two hypothetical scenarios illustrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">First, let us assume facts very similar to those here. Police officers respond to a report of a loud fight between X and Y at their apartment. The officers\u2019 arrival stops the fight, but both X and Y begin to act belligerently toward the officers, who handcuff them. Rather than conducting a protective sweep, the officers immediately call the police department. They are told, erroneously, that neither disputant is a probationer, but that Y is a parolee. Relying on this <em>incorrect </em>information, the officers search the apartment unit and find illegal drugs, which they seize, in Y\u2019s open closet. A day later, the officers discover that, in fact, Y\u2019s parole had long since expired, but he currently is on probation subject to a search condition. Under these circumstances, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>officers\u2019 good faith reliance on the outdated and erroneous parole status information would not validate the search of Y\u2019s closet <em>(People </em>v. <em>Willis </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 22 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 105, 46 P.3d 898]), and according to the majority\u2019s analysis, the search would have intruded unreasonably upon Y\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights because, notwithstanding Y\u2019s significantly diminished expectation of privacy as a probationer, the officers did not know that Y was on probation (in fact, they were led to believe that probation was not an issue), and they consequently acted without a probation-related purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Second, let us assume that police officers respond to a report of a loud fight between X and Y at a house Y owns. Again, the officers\u2019 arrival stops the fight, but both X and Y begin to act belligerently toward the officers, who handcuff them. The officers immediately call the police department and are told, again erroneously, that neither disputant is a probationer, but that Y is a parolee. Relying on this incorrect information, the officers search the house and find firearms, which they seize, in one of the bedrooms. After arresting Y, the officers discover that Y\u2019s parole had long since expired, but that he in fact had escaped from prison after a later conviction. As in the previous hypothetical, the officers\u2019 good faith reliance on the erroneous parole status information does not validate the search of the bedroom. <em>(People v. Willis, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th 22.) But even though Y had virtually no reasonable expectation of privacy as a prison escapee, the majority\u2019s analysis would deem the search unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment because the officers did not know of Y\u2019s status as an escapee when they conducted the search. Neither of these results makes any logical sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">As indicated, <em>Knights, supra, </em>534 U.S. 112, and <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, supra, </em>497 U.S. <em>177, </em>both support my position that courts may properly consider facts not available to an officer in evaluating the reasonableness of a warrantless search. Apart from these two decisions, however, the other authorities the majority cites largely are inapposite (see maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>decisions cited at p. 334), for none considered the reasonableness of a search pertaining to a defendant whose expectation of privacy had been drastically reduced due to a lawfully imposed search term or search condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Moreover, in proposing to find constitutional violations as to <em>both </em>defendants here, the majority unduly emphasizes the fact that a residence is involved and fails to heed the controlling principle that \u201cthe Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.\u201d <em>(Katz v. United States </em>(1967) 389 U.S. 347, 351 [19 L.Ed.2d 576, 88 S.Ct. 507].) That a search may be deemed valid as to one occupant of a residence but invalid as to another comports fully with the high court\u2019s teaching that \u201cthe legitimacy of certain privacy expectations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>vis-\u00e1-vis the State may depend upon the individual\u2019s legal relationship with the State.\u201d <em>(Vernonia School Dist. 47J </em>v. Acton (1995) 515 U.S. 646, 654 [132 L.Ed.2d 564, 115 S.Ct. 2386].) And as this court has itself recognized, \u201c[t]hat persons under the same roof may legitimately harbor differing expectations of privacy is consistent with the principle that one\u2019s ability to claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment depends upon the reasonableness of his or her individual expectations.\u201d <em>(People v. Robles, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 798; accord, <em>People v. Hernandez </em>(1996) 218 A.D.2d 167 [639 N.Y.S.2d 423, 426-427] [suppression of evidence found inappropriate in case against a prison escapee, but appropriate in case against the escapee\u2019s homeowner brother].) Therefore, even though a parolee\u2019s home, like anyone else\u2019s, is protected by the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement that searches be reasonable (see <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Wisconsin </em>(1987) 483 U.S. 868, 873 [97 L.Ed.2d 709, 107 S.Ct. 3164] [concluding the same in the context of probationers]), parolees remain properly subject to specific constraints on their privacy that would not be constitutional if applied to their cohabitants and the public at large (see <em>id. </em>at p. 875).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Finally, relying on <em>People v. Robles, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 789, the majority erroneously concludes that suppressing the evidence here as to the parolee, in addition to the nonparolee cohabitant, is necessary to deter police misconduct. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 335.) Applying the suppression sanction in the nonparolee\u2019s case is appropriate, of course, because her Fourth Amendment privacy interests were in fact violated. <em>(People v. Robles, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at <em>pp. </em>798-800.) But the majority unjustifiably extends the suppression sanction for the benefit of the parolee, whose constitutional privacy interests were not violated, in order to \u201cdecrease the chance that a person living with a probationer or parolee would be the victim of an unlawful search.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 798-800.) That is just plain wrong and gives the parolee a huge and undeserved windfall. <em>(Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1978) 439 U.S. 128, 134 [58 L.Ed.2d 387, 99 S.Ct. 421] [\u201cit is proper to permit only defendants whose Fourth Amendment rights have been violated to benefit from the [exclusionary] rule\u2019s protections\u201d].) Nothing in <em>People </em>v. <em>Robles </em>or any other authority supports such a novel and disproportional approach to deterring potential police misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">In sum, McDaniel\u2019s parolee status and the search term to which he was subject severely diminished any reasonable expectation of privacy McDaniel may have had in his home and provided legal authority for the challenged search. Although the police officers initially knew nothing of McDaniel\u2019s parolee status, their sweep search was in actuality no more intrusive of McDaniel\u2019s privacy than what his parole terms expressly authorized. Finally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>even though the officers may have misjudged the propriety of a protective \"sweep in the situation facing them, no decision to conduct a search should have surprised McDaniel, in light of his participation in the events that brought the officers to his door.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Given the totality of these circumstances, I find the challenged search did not violate McDaniel\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Moreover, finding the search reasonable in circumstances such as these\u2014where a parolee\u2019s search term provides a legal basis for a warrantless search when the parolee\u2019s involvement in an altercation and criminal wrongdoing is at issue\u2014would advance the significant governmental interests in deterring parolees from criminal activity and protecting the public from their crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">I would affirm defendant McDaniel\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied October 22, 2003, and the opinion was modified to read as presented above. Brown, J., did not participate therein. Baxter, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\"> The majority expresses no view regarding this aspect of the Court of Appeal\u2019s analysis (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 324, fn. 2), and neither do I.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
