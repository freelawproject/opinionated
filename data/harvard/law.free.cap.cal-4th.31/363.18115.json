(See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 337, subd. 1, 338, subds. (b), (c); <em>Regents of University of California v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 624, 630 [147 Cal.Rptr. 486, 581 P.2d 197] <em>(Regents).)</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, a 1971 statute established a further general rule that no action for latent construction defects may be commenced more than 10 years after \u201csubstantial completion\u201d of the construction project. (\u00a7 337.15, as enacted by Stats. 1971, ch. 1569, \u00a7 1, p. 3149.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This \u201cabsolute\u201d 10-year limitations period applies regardless of when the defect was discovered. <em>(Regents, supra, </em>at p. 631.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Pre-1971 cases held that the discovery-based limitations period for a latent-defect suit alleging breach of an express or implied warranty is \u201ctolled\u201d\u2014that is, halted and suspended in progress\u2014while the defendant\u2019s promises or attempts to honor the warranty by repairing the defect are pending. Relying heavily on these earlier authorities, and in suits not confined to warranty theories, two Court of Appeal cases concluded that the alternate 10-year statute of limitations of section 337.15 is also subject to tolling for repairs. <em>(Grange Debris Box &amp; Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1349 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 515] <em>(Grange Debris); Cascade Gardens Homeowners Assn. v. McKellar &amp; Associates </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 1252 [240 Cal.Rptr. 113] <em>(Cascade Gardens).) </em>A more recent Court of Appeal decision disagreed. <em>(FNB Mortgage Corp. v. Pacific General Group </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 1116 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 841] <em>(FNB Mortgage).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Here the trial court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action, concluding that the 10-year limitations period could not be extended by a defendant\u2019s promises or attempts to repair. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment. The appellate court held that section 337.15 is subject both to equitable tolling during periods of repair and to equitable estoppel if defendants engaged in conduct that delayed the filing of suit. We granted review to resolve the extent to which the doctrines of equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>tolling and equitable estoppel should apply to the 10-year statute of limitations set forth in section 337.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We agree with <em>FNB Mortgage, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th 1116, that section 337.15\u2019s 10-year statute of limitations for latent construction defects is not subject to a general rule of equitable tolling while promises or attempts to repair are pending. A broad tolling-for-repairs rule would contravene the Legislature\u2019s clear intent, at the time it adopted section 337.15, to ensure a generous but firm cutoff date for latent-defect suits. Moreover, the extraordinary length of the limitations period set forth in section 337.15 weighs strongly against the need for such a tolling mle as a matter of fair procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Though we thus find no basis for equitable <em>tolling </em>during any period in which the defendant\u2019s promises or efforts to repair are pending, we do not foreclose application of the distinct doctrine of equitable <em>estoppel. A </em>defendant whose conduct induced plaintiffs to refrain from filing suit within the 10-year period might be equitably estopped to assert that the statute of limitations had expired. However, plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint alleges no facts sufficient to establish such an estoppel, and we find no basis upon which to allow a further opportunity to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">We will therefore reverse the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment. We will also disapprove the <em>Grange Debris </em>and <em>Cascade Gardens </em>decisions insofar as they conflict with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Plaintiffs filed their original complaint on August 5, 1999, and a first amended complaint on December 3, 1999, asserting both individual and class claims. The first amended complaint alleged as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">The Eagles Ridge project is a 450-unit development of single-family homes in Antioch. Defendants\u2014Centex Homes and related entities (collectively Centex), American Consolidated Industries, Inc., and numerous Does\u2014 variously designed, developed, built, and/or sold the Eagles Ridge homes, or designed, manufactured, sold, and/or installed the windows. The four individual plaintiffs, whose claims typify those of the other class members, are homeowners within the development who bought their houses directly from defendants. The Eagles Ridge homes suffer from design or manufacturing defects, including leaks in the windows and window systems, that have caused damage to each of the individual residences. These defects were discovered within three years before the lawsuit was filed. They may have developed earlier, but could not have been discovered sooner with reasonable diligence. \u201c[A]s problems resulting from unknown defects were discovered,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>defendants represented to plaintiffs that they would correct all problems, were experts in the construction field, and would take the steps required to ensure the quality and integrity of the residences. \u201c[A]t various times [defendants have attempted to make repairs ... or advised plaintiffs that the . . . windows were not defective and not to file a lawsuit.\u201d Despite their promises and attempts to repair, defendants \u201chave not properly completed[,] reconstructed, repaired and/or restored the windows, interior waterproofing systems, and walls associated therewith.\u201d By their conduct, defendants are estopped to assert that the statute of limitations has expired. Damages are recoverable on theories of implied warranty, strict liability, and negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Defendants demurred on two grounds. They urged the entire action was barred by section 337.15\u2019s 10-year limitations period for latent construction defects. They also insisted the complaint\u2019s class allegations were insufficient. In support of their statute of limitations argument, defendants asked the court to take judicial notice that the Notices of Completion on the four homes owned by the individual plaintiffs were recorded in November 1988, some 10 years and 9 months before plaintiffs filed their original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In response, plaintiffs urged that the first amended complaint properly pled a class action. With respect to the statute of limitations, plaintiffs argued that the complaint sufficiently alleged both <em>equitable tolling </em>for repairs and <em>equitable estoppel </em>to assert the statute by virtue of defendants\u2019 conduct that forestalled a timely lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">On April 24, 2000, the trial court filed its \u201cOrder After Hearing on Demurrer.\u201d The order sustained the demurrer without leave to amend on grounds that the action was barred by the statute of limitations. The order reasoned: The parties \u201cappear to agree\u201d that, unless \u201ctolled\u201d for about nine months, section 337.15\u2019s 10-year limitations period had expired before the complaint was filed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For two reasons, the allegations of the complaint are not <em>specific </em>enough to establish a repairs-based \u201cestoppel.\u201d First, plaintiffs allege <em>in the alternative </em>that defendants <em>either </em>promised and attempted to repair <em>or </em>denied the defects and made demands not to sue; the latter conduct is insufficient to create an \u201cestoppel.\u201d Second, by alleging simply that repairs were attempted \u201cat various times,\u201d plaintiffs leave open the possibility this conduct occurred <em>after November 1998 </em>(when the statute of limitations expired unless tolled), and thus was not timely to create a \u201ctolling.\u201d Amendments might cure these factual deficiencies, but amendment would be futile here, because section 337.15 is a \u201cstatute of repose,\u201d and thus is not subject to \u201cequitable tolling\u201d for repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Plaintiffs appealed, and the Court \u00f3f Appeal reversed. Unlike the trial court, the Court of Appeal agreed with those decisions <em>(Grange Debris, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th 1349; <em>Cascade Gardens, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d 1252) that extended equitable tolling for repairs to section 337.15, and rejected the contrary reasoning of <em>FNB Mortgage, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th 1116. Moreover, the Court of Appeal concluded, just as section 337.15 is subject to equitable tolling, the statute also is not immune from equitable estoppel. The Court of Appeal ruled that plaintiffs had pled grounds for an equitable estoppel, sufficient to survive demurrer, by alleging that defendants\u2019 repeated promises to repair had caused them to delay filing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">We granted Centex\u2019s petition for review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We now conclude that the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">1. <em>Equitable tolling.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Section 337.15, enacted in 1971, provides generally that \u201c[n]o action may be brought\u201d against those involved in the design, supervision, or construction of an improvement to real property, or their sureties, for latent defects in the design or construction, or for injury to property caused by such defects, unless the suit is filed within 10 years after \u201csubstantial completion\u201d of the project. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (a).) The 10-year period begins to run no later than \u201c[t]he date of recordation of a valid notice of completion.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (g)(2).) Section 337.15 \u201cshall [not] be construed as extending the period prescribed by the laws of this state for bringing any action.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">As we explained in <em>Regents, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 624, a suit to recover for a construction defect generally is subject to limitations periods of three or four years, depending on whether the theory is breach of warranty (\u00a7 337, subd. 1 [four years: \u201caction upon any contract, obligation or liability founded upon an instrument in writing\u201d]) or tortious injury to property (\u00a7 338, subds. (b), (c) (formerly subds. 2, 3) [three years: trespass or injury to real or personal property]). However, these periods begin to run only when the defect would be discoverable by reasonable inspection. <em>(Regents, supra, </em>at p. 630.) On the other hand, \u201csection 337.15 . . . imposed an absolute requirement that a suit . . . to recover damages for a [latent] construction defect be brought within 10 years of the date of substantial completion of construction, regardless of the date of discovery of the defect.\u201d <em>(Regents, supra, </em>at p. 631, fn. omitted.) \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>interplay between these statutes sets up a two-step process: (1) actions for a latent defect must be filed within three years ... or four years ... of discovery, but (2) in any event must be filed within ten years ... of substantial completion.\u201d <em>(North Coast Business Park v. Nielsen Construction Co. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 22, 27 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 104].)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Section 337.15 states several situations in which the 10-year limit shall not apply (see text discussion, <em>post), </em>but it contains no provision for extension of the limitations period during periods of repair. Nonetheless, plaintiffs urge that the statute is subject to \u201cequitable tolling\u201d while the defendant\u2019s promises or attempts to remedy a defect are pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Equitable tolling is a judge-made doctrine \u201cwhich operates independently of the literal wording of the Code of Civil Procedure\u201d to suspend or extend a statute of limitations as necessary to ensure fundamental practicality and fairness. <em>(Addison v. State of California </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 313, 318-319 [146 Cal.Rptr. 224, 578 P.2d 941] <em>(Addison); </em>see also <em>Bollinger v. National Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 399, 411 [154 P.2d 399] <em>(Bollinger).) </em>This court has applied equitable tolling in carefully considered situations to prevent the unjust technical forfeiture of causes of action, where the defendant would suffer no prejudice. (E.g., <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1072, 1080 [282 Cal.Rptr. 445, 811 P.2d 737] <em>(Lambert) </em>[claim against title insurer accrues upon insurer\u2019s refusal to defend title, but two-year limitations period is equitably tolled until underlying title action is resolved]; <em>Prudential-LMI Com. Insurance v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 674, 687-693 [274 Cal.Rptr. 387, 798 P.2d 1230] <em>(Prudential-LMI) </em>[one-year period to sue on casualty insurance policy begins upon \u201cinception of the loss,\u201d but is equitably tolled from timely notice of loss until insurer denies claim]; <em>Addison, supra, </em>at pp. 317-321 [six-month period for state court suit against public agency was equitably tolled during plaintiffs\u2019 timely federal suit raising both federal and state claims]; <em>Elkins v. Derby </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 410, 414-420 [115 Cal.Rptr. 641, 525 P.2d 81] <em>(Elkins) </em>[one-year period for personal injury action was tolled while plaintiff, acting in good faith, pursued workers\u2019 compensation remedy against defendant]; <em>Bollinger, supra, </em>at pp. 410-412 [15-month period to sue on fire insurance policy was tolled while timely prior action, erroneously dismissed as premature, was pending].)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">As these cases illustrate, the effect of equitable tolling is that the limitations period <em>stops running </em>during the tolling event, and begins to run again only when the tolling event has concluded. As a consequence, the tolled interval, no matter when it took place, is tacked onto the end of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>limitations period, thus extending the deadline for suit by the entire length of time during which the tolling event previously occurred.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The Legislature may preclude equitable tolling by stating its intention \u201cto disallow tolling under any circumstances not enumerated in the statute.\u201d <em>(Laird v. Blacker </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 606, 618 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 550, 828 P.2d 691] <em>(Laird) </em>[attorney malpractice limitations statute (\u00a7 340.6) providing that limitations period shall \u201cin no event\u201d be tolled except as specified <em>(id., </em>subd. (a))]; see also, e.g., <em>Battuello v. Battuello </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 842, 847 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 548] <em>(Battuello) </em>[special one-year limitations statute (\u00a7 366.2) for surviving action against deceased person, providing that period \u201cshall not be tolled or extended for any reason\u201d except as specified (id., subd. (b))].)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Moreover, equitable tolling should not apply if it is \u201cinconsistent with the text of the relevant statute\u201d <em>(United States v. Beggerly </em>(1998) 524 U.S. 38, 48 [141 L.Ed.2d 32, 118 S.Ct. 1862] [quiet title action must commence within 12 years after discovery of government\u2019s title claim; generous limitations period, beginning only upon discovery, already provides for equitable tolling, and further tolling not warranted]; see also <em>Lampf v. Gilbertson </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 350, 363 [115 L.Ed.2d 321, 111 S.Ct. 2773] [where federal securities fraud action was subject to limitations of one year from discovery, or three years from violation, three-year period was \u201coutside\u201d limit not subject to tolling]) or contravenes clear legislative policy (cf. <em>Abreu v. Svenhard\u2019s Swedish Bakery </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1446, 1456 [257 Cal.Rptr. 26] [equitable tolling would violate policy of uniform federal statute of limitations for suits claiming violations of labor contracts]).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u201cAs with other general equitable principles, application of the equitable tolling doctrine requires a balancing of the injustice to the plaintiff occasioned by the bar of his claim against the effect upon the important public interest or policy expressed by the . . . limitations statute.\u201d <em>(Addison, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 313, 321.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Plaintiffs insist that in construction defect cases, the rule of tolling for repairs is well established. As they observe, two Court of Appeal decisions, <em>Grange Debris, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th 1349, 1360, and <em>Cascade Gardens, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d 1252, 1256-1258, have concluded that the 10-year limitations period of section 337.15 is tolled while the defendant\u2019s promises or attempts to remedy the defect are pending. For this holding, <em>Grange Debris </em>relied solely on <em>Cascade Gardens. Cascade Gardens, </em>in turn, invoked the \u201cclear authority\u201d of several earlier decisions, <em>Aced v. Hobbs-Sesack Plumbing Co. </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 573, 585 [12 Cal.Rptr. 257, 360 P.2d 897] <em>(Aced), Mack v. Hugh W. Comstock Associates </em>(1964) 225 Cal.App.2d 583, 589 [37 Cal.Rptr. 466] <em>(Mack), </em>and <em>Southern Cal. Enterprises v. Walter &amp; Co. </em>(1947) 78 Cal.App.2d 750, 755 [178 P.2d 785] <em>(Southern Cal. Enterprises). (Cascade Gardens, supra, </em>at p. 1256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">But <em>Aced, Mack, </em>and <em>Southern Cal. Enterprises </em>are inapposite to the question before us. They predate the 1971 adoption of section 337.15, and were narrowly concerned with how to apply the limitations period for express or implied warranties. These cases simply confirmed that the statute of limitations <em>for </em>breach of warranty does not begin to run until discovery of the defect, and is thereafter tolled during periods the warrantor claims he can honor the warranty by repairing the defect, and attempts to do so. <em>(Aced, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d 573, 577, 585 [radiant heating system; plaintiff stipulated he was relying solely on a theory of implied warranty]; <em>Mack, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.2d 583, 585, 589 [radiant heating system; plaintiff alleged breach of express warranty]; <em>Southern Cal. Enterprises, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.2d 750, 752-753, 755 [installed carpet; plaintiff alleged breach of express warranty].)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><em>Aced, Mack, </em>and <em>Southern Cal. Enterprises </em>did not consider how tolling should apply to an alternative, overarching limitations period later enacted specifically for suits alleging defects in the construction of improvements to real property\u2014a limitations period measured, regardless of discovery, from the date the work of construction was completed. Contrary to the assumption of <em>Cascade Gardens, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d 1252, those earlier cases are not persuasive authority for extending a \u201ctolling for repairs\u201d rule to section 337.15.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>In <em>FNB Mortgage, supra, 76 </em>Cal.App.4th 1116, the Court of Appeal properly discounted the pre-1971 precedents, rejected the holding of <em>Cascade Gardens, </em>and concluded that the 10-year limitations period of section 337.15 is not equitably tolled for repairs. <em>FNB Mortgage </em>reached the correct result.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">At the outset, the plain language of section 337.15 suggests that the 10-year limitations period is not subject to extension for reasons not stated in the statute itself. Unlike subdivision (a) of section 340.6, the attorney malpractice limitations statute (see <em>Laird, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 606, 618; see also, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 340.5 [malpractice by health care provider], 366.2, subd. (b) [surviving action against deceased person]), section 337.15 does not ban nonstatutory tolling in so many literal words. But the structure and tone of section 337.15 do differ markedly from garden-variety California limitations statutes. The latter simply provide the various \u201cperiods prescribed for the commencement of [specified] actions.\u201d (\u00a7 335; see also, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 336, 336a, 337, 337.5, 338, 339, 341.) By contrast, section 337.15 declares, in stentorian terms, that \u201c[n]o <em>action [for latent construction </em>defects] <em>may be brought . . </em>. more than 10 years after the <em>substantial completion </em>of the development or improvement.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Section 337.15 itself provides several clear exemptions from the 10-year limit. The limit does not apply to actions for personal injury. (\u00a7 337.15, subd. (a)(1), (2); cf. \u00a7 337.1, subd. (a)(3) [four-year limitation period for <em>patent </em>construction defects].) It does not apply to suits based on \u201cwillful misconduct or fraudulent concealment.\u201d (\u00a7 337.15, subd. (f); cf. \u00a7\u00a7 340.5, 340.6, subd. (a) [both permitting \u201ctolling\u201d for \u201cfraud\u201d or \u201cintentional concealment\u201d].) It does not apply to a cross-complaint for indemnity by one participant in the project against another, if the cross-complainant himself was sued directly within the 10-year period. (\u00a7 337.15, subd. (c); <em>Valley Circle Estates v. VTN Consolidated, Inc. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 604, 608-615 [189 Cal.Rptr. 871, 659 P.2d 1160] <em>(Valley Circle Estates).) </em>It cannot be asserted by \u201cany person in actual possession or . . . control ... of [the] improvement ... at the time any deficiency [therein] constitutes the proximate cause\u201d of the damage for which recovery is sought. (\u00a7 337.15, subd. (e).) An argument thus arises, under the maxim <em>inclusio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>that the Legislature intended to omit other exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>But if doubt remains from the language of section 337.15, it is dispelled by reference to the well-known goal of this special limitations statute. \u201c[T]he purpose of section 337.15 is to protect contractors and other professionals and tradespeople in the construction industry from perpetual exposure to liability for their work. <em>(Regents[, supra,] </em>21 Cal.3d 624, 633, fn. 2 [147 Cal.Rptr. 486, 581 P.2d 197]; <em>Wagner v. State of California </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 922, 929-930 [150 Cal.Rptr. 489].) The statute reflects a legitimate concern that \u2018expanding concepts of liability could imperil the construction industry unless a statute of limitations was enacted.\u2019 <em>(Moseley v. Abrams </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 355, 362 [216 Cal.Rptr. 40].) Such concerns legitimately include the prohibitive cost of insurance against a perpetual and never ending risk.\u201d <em>(Sandy v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 1277, 1285 [247 Cal.Rptr. 677].)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The history of section 337.15 confirms that the statute is the result of general legislative concern about the economic effects of indefinite \u201clong tail\u201d defect liability on the construction industry. Section 337.15 was a response to considerable expansion of California\u2019s common law of construction liability. Traditionally, a builder\u2019s sole liability for his finished product was on an express or implied warranty, which required privity between plaintiff and defendant, and the builder thus owed no duty to third persons once the owner accepted the improvement. (See, e.g., <em>Kolburn v. P. J. Walker Co. </em>(1940) 38 Cal.App.2d 545, 550 [101 P.2d 747].) In the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s, these limitations gave way to the principle that a builder may be liable to those foreseeably injured or damaged by construction defects under theories of negligence <em>(Dow </em>v. <em>Holly Manufacturing Co. </em>(1958) 49 Cal.2d 720, 724-728 [321 P.2d 736]; <em>Oakes v. McCarthy Co. </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 231, 247-249 [73 Cal.Rptr. 127] <em>(Oakes)) </em>and, at least in the case of a mass home developer, strict tort liability <em>(Kriegler v. Eichler Homes, Inc. </em>(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 224, 226-229 [74 Cal.Rptr. 749]).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">At the same time, courts increasingly recognized ways to extend the limitations periods for suits on construction defects. As indicated above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>1960\u2019s decisions confinned that the time to sue on a construction warranty was tolled while promises or attempts to repair were pending. <em>(Aced, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d 573, 585; <em>Mack, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.2d 583, 589.) Contemporaneous cases held that the statutes of limitations for the burgeoning theories of construction defect recovery did not begin to run until the defects were or should have been discovered (see, e.g., <em>Aced, supra, </em>at pp. 583-584 [warranty]; <em>Avner </em>v. <em>Longridge Estates </em>(1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 607, 616-618, 77 Cal.Rptr. 633 [strict liability]; <em>Oakes, supra, </em>267 Cal.App.2d 231, 254-255 [negligence]; see also <em>Regents, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 624, 630) or while they were fraudulently concealed (e.g., <em>Balfour, Guthrie &amp; Co. v. Hansen </em>(1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 173, 189 [38 Cal.Rptr. 525]).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In 1967, the Legislature responded in part to these developments by adopting section 337.1. (Stats. 1967, ch. 1326, \u00a7 1, p. 3157.) This statute provides that recovery for death, injury, or damage caused by a <em>\u201cpatent </em>deficiency\u201d (\u00a7 337.1, subd. (a), italics added) in the design, supervision, or construction of an improvement to realty must be sought within <em>four </em>years after substantial completion of the improvement. <em>(Id., </em>subds. (a), (c).) A \u201cpatent deficiency\u201d is defined as one \u201capparent by reasonable inspection.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (e).) Notwithstanding the general rule, if an injury to person or property occurs in the fourth year after completion, suit may be brought within one year after the injury, but no more than five years after completion. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).) The limitations period provided by section 337.1 cannot be asserted by one who actually possesses or controls the property at the time the deficiency causes the actionable damage or injury. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d).) Owner-occupied single-family residences are exempt from the four-year limit. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Despite this 1967 legislation, members of the building industry still faced exposure to liability for all defects in their past projects so long as these defects remained undiscovered and undiscoverable by reasonable inspection. On April 14, 1970, Assemblyman Powers introduced Assembly Bill No. 2528 (1970 Reg. Sess.), seeking to limit suits for latent construction defects to an eight-year period after substantial completion. After numerous amendments in committee, the bill was placed in the inactive file at the request of Assemblyman Powers, and it died there on August 21, 1970. (See Assem. Final Hist. (1970 Reg. Sess.) p. 761.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>In October 1970, the Assembly Interim Committee on the Judiciary, chaired by Assemblyman Hayes, convened a public hearing \u201cto determine if a statute of limitations can be drafted in actions for hidden (or latent) construction defects.\u201d (Assem. Judiciary Interim Com., Hearing on Application of the Doctrine of Strict Tort Liability to Building Construction (Oct. 23, 1970) p. 1 (1970 Committee Hearing).) Building industry representatives testified at length that the trend toward expanded and time-extended defect liability was producing a risk for which insurance was available only at prohibitive cost, if at all, thus threatening the industry\u2019s economic health. (1970 Com. Hearing, pp. 4-51.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Appended to the 1970 Committee Hearing transcript was a survey of construction defect limitations periods adopted in other states. According to this survey, the applicable statutes of limitations ranged from four to 12 years after substantial completion of the projects in question. (1970 Com. Hearing, appen. B, pp. 11-12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">On April 15, 1971, Assemblyman Hayes introduced Assembly Bill No. 2742 (1971 Reg. Sess.) (Assem. Bill No. 2742), which, as amended, became section 337.15. (See Assem. Final Hist. (1971 Reg. Sess.) p. 873.) As originally drafted, Assembly Bill No. 2742 provided that suits for latent construction defects, other than those based on willful misconduct or fraudulent concealment, would be subject to a limitations period of <em>six </em>years after substantial completion. (Assem. Bill No. 2742, as introduced Apr. 15, 1971.) A subsequent Assembly amendment removed personal injury actions from the limitations period, increased the period to 10 years, and provided for cross-complaints beyond the 10-year period by persons sued directly within that time. (Assem. Amend. to Assem. Bill No. 2742, July 22, 1971.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>The above-described survey of the laws of other states was made part of the legislative record of Assembly Bill No. 2742 in both the Assembly and the Senate. (See Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2742, appen. B; Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2742 as amended Oct. 22, 1971, pp. 1-4.) Analyses of the bill consistently described it as \u201cbar[ring]\u201d or \u201c[p]rohibit[ing]\u201d latent defect suits brought beyond the proposed limitations period. (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2742, p. 1; Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2742 as amended Oct. 22, 1971, p. 1; Assemblyman James A. Hayes, letter to Governor Reagan (Nov. 9, 1971) requesting signature on Assem. Bill No. 2742; Enrolled Bill mem. to Governor on Assem. Bill No. 2742, Nov. 16, 1971.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Thus the Legislature, faced with a developing body of common law on the subject, carefully considered how to provide a fair time to discover construction defects, and to sue upon such defects if necessary, while still protecting a vital industry from the damaging consequences of indefinite liability exposure. For latent deficiencies, the lawmakers rejected shorter periods in favor of a limit in the upper range of those previously adopted by other jurisdictions. Moreover, by placing exemptions in the latent defect statute for personal injury, willful misconduct, and fraudulent concealment, the legislators demonstrated an intent to pick and choose the particular exceptions they wished to allow and those particular aspects of the prior case law they wished to embrace. The implication arises that except as stated, and for important policy reasons, the Legislature meant the generous 10-year period set forth in section 337.15 to be firm and final.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Significantly, the adopters of both sections 337.1 and 337.15 knew that the case law had engrafted a \u201ctolling for repairs\u201d rule onto the four-year discovery-based limitations period for breach of a construction warranty. Yet, despite the Legislature\u2019s careful attention to other issues raised by prior court decisions, it did not provide a \u201crepairs\u201d extension in either section 337.1 or section 337.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">On the contrary, the Legislature specified in section 337.15 that <em>whatever limitations periods might otherwise apply, </em>\u201cno action\u201d for injury to property arising from latent construction defects \u201cmay be brought\u201d more than 10 years after substantial completion of the project. (\u00a7 337.15, subd. (a); see also <em>id., </em>subd. (d); <em>Regents, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 624, 631.) The inference arises that regardless of whatever <em>tolling rules </em>might otherwise apply <em>within </em>the 10-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>period, the Legislature intended no such extension of the \u201cabsolute\u201d <em>(Regents, supra, </em>at p. 631) 10-year limit itself. The legislative failure to ratify tolling for repairs under these circumstances is another indication that a judicial doctrine extending the 10-year limitations period for this reason would contravene the intent of section 337.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">In one common circumstance, an equitable tolling rule would directly undermine the statutory purpose. As we have seen, section 337.15 allows one sued directly within the statutory period to cross-complain for indemnity against another project participant, even if the statute of limitations for direct actions has by then expired, so long as the cross-complaint is filed before a trial date has been set. (\u00a7\u00a7 337.15, subd. (c), 428.10, subd. (b), 428.50, subd. (b); <em>Valley Circle Estates, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d 604, 608-615.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, potential indemnitors can never be entirely certain they are safe once the 10-year period passes. But they should generally be able to assume that any suit which may give rise to cross-complaints against them was filed within 10 years after substantial completion of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">A general rule that the limitations period is tolled for repairs would destroy such an assumption. As was emphasized in <em>FNB Mortgage, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th 1116, such a rule would allow \u201c[a]n unsuspecting subcontractor [to] be sued for indemnity, long after the statute\u2019s 10-year limitations period had passed, and despite the absence of any action alleging defects within the 10-year period, simply because the indemnitee (the subsequent cross-complainant) was deemed to have tolled the 10-year period [by offering or attempting to repair] and was thus subject to subsequent suit.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1133.) The \u201cunsuspecting subcontractor[s]\u201d caught in this net might include architects and engineers who, as in the example provided during the 1970 Committee Hearing, had since retired, but were still forced to maintain expensive errors and omissions coverage to meet their potential \u201clong tail\u201d liability for alleged defects in projects completed many years in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Hence, the purpose of section 337.15, as revealed by its history, weighs against a judicially imposed rule that the 10-year limitations period set forth in this statute is tolled for repairs. On the other hand, countervailing policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>of practicality and fairness do not compel such a rule. If the defendant\u2019s acts or promises occurred well before expiration of the 10-year limit, an extension <em>at the end </em>of the limitations period is unnecessary to protect the plaintiff\u2019s rights.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And because the limitations period provided by section 337.15 is so. \u201cexceptionally long\u201d <em>(Aas, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 627, 653), it indicates the Legislature\u2019s effort to provide, within the strict statutory period itself, a reasonable time to discover, adjust, and, if necessary, sue upon latent defects. Given the particular considerations that led the Legislature in 1971 to seek a generous but firm cutoff date for construction defect lawsuits, further extension of the period by judicial fiat is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">This case contrasts starkly with those in which we found a special need for equitable tolling. In each prior instance, the <em>brevity </em>of the literal limitations period would otherwise have caused forfeiture of a cause of action, or other undue hardship, despite the plaintiff\u2019s diligent efforts to pursue his claim in a correct and orderly way. In <em>Lambert, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 1072, absent equitable tolling, literal application of the <em>two-year </em>statute of limitations for actions against a title insurer would have forced the insured \u201cto defend the underlying [title] action, at [his] own expense, and <em>simultaneously </em>to prosecute\u2014 again at [his] own expense\u2014a separate action against the title company for failure to defend.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1078.) In <em>Prudential-LMI, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 674, the insured had only <em>one year </em>after inception of the loss to sue his insurer for coverage, but that period could easily run out while the insurer, having, received a timely notice of loss, conducted the investigation necessary to determine whether the claim should be paid or denied. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 687-693.)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In <em>Bollinger, supra, </em>25 Cal.2d 399, the insured <em>did </em>sue within the <em>15 months </em>allowed by the policy, but that action was dismissed, after the limitations period had expired, on a false technicality urged by the insurer. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 404-411.) Similarly in <em>Addison, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 313, the plaintiffs <em>did </em>sue in <em>federal </em>court within the <em>six-month </em>period for actions against public agencies. Just after this brief limitations period expired by its literal terms, the government defendant moved to dismiss the federal action, whereupon plaintiffs immediately filed their state court complaint. As plaintiffs feared, the federal court subsequently dismissed their federal causes of action and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>declined to retain their pendent state claims, leaving them without a remedy unless equitable tolling was applied. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 317-319.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Finally, in <em>Elkins, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 410, the plaintiff, acting in good faith, first pursued a timely workers\u2019 compensation remedy against the defendants, thereby foreclosing resort to tort litigation. After the <em>one-year </em>statute of limitations for personal injury actions had expired, the workers\u2019 compensation referee found that the plaintiff was not the defendant\u2019s \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes, and was thus not entitled to benefits. The plaintiff then promptly filed his court action. We applied the well-established California principle that \u201cthe running of the limitations period is tolled \u2018[w]hen an injured person has several legal remedies and, reasonably and in good faith, pursues one.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 414.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">No similar issues are presented here. Because plaintiffs had <em>three or four </em>years <em>after discovery, </em>and up to <em>ten </em>years after the project\u2019s completion, to bring their suits for latent construction defects, many of the concerns that might warrant equitable tolling are ameliorated. Indeed, were we to conclude that the generous limitations period of section 337.15 is equitably tolled for repairs, despite the absence of any specific indication that the 1971 Legislature so intended, the implication would arise that <em>all </em>statutes of limitations are similarly tolled or suspended in progress while the parties make sincere efforts to adjust their differences short of litigation. We find no such general principle in California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Plaintiffs and the dissent urge several reasons why section 337.15 should be equitably tolled for repairs. None is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">First, it is urged that if the Legislature had intended to disallow equitable tolling of section 337.15, it would have done so expressly, as in sections 340.5 (health care malpractice) and 340.6, subdivision (a) (attorney malpractice; see <em>Laird, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 606, 618; see also <em>Battuello, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th 842, 847 [\u00a7 366.2; one-year limitations period for surviving action against deceased person]). But an <em>express </em>legislative ban on equitable tolling is not the only circumstance in which courts will decline to apply this judicially developed doctrine. As is explained above, they will also do so where, as here, tolling would contravene the legislative purpose. Of course, the no-tolling result we reach under section 337.15 is <em>consistent </em>with our construction of the similar <em>but shorter </em>\u201ctwo-step\u201d statute of limitations (one year from discovery or four years from wrongful act or omission, whichever occurs first) for attorney malpractice. (\u00a7 340.6, subd. (a); see <em>Laird, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 606, 618.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Next, plaintiffs and the dissent assert that the legislative history of section 337.15 focuses exclusively upon the problem of a statute of limitations that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>began </em>only when the <em>plaintiff discovered </em>the defect. There is no indication, plaintiffs assert, that the Legislature meant to preclude the <em>defendant </em>from tolling the limitations period, once begun, by his own voluntary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">But while delayed discovery was an important issue, the legislators\u2019 concerns, as indicated above, were broader. They sought to ensure ample time to discover and sue upon latent construction defects, while still establishing a predictable period within which the construction and insurance industries must make provision for such suits. And though a defendant who promises or undertakes repairs might be said to \u201ccontrol\u201d the time for suit <em>against him, </em>his conduct, as we have noted, would have consequences for unsuspecting coparticipants in the project, whose exposure to indemnity liability would thereby be extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Plaintiffs and the dissent emphasize our statement in <em>Regents, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 624, that section 337.15 is not a \u201csubstantive limit upon the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action\u201d <em>(Regents, supra, </em>at p. 640), but merely an \u201cordinary, procedural statute of limitations\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 641) to which, they assert, equitable tolling may thus properly apply. However, their reliance on <em>Regents </em>is misplaced. The issue there was whether the surety on a contractor\u2019s bond\u2014then not among the persons specifically mentioned in the statute\u2014 nonetheless could claim the protection of section 337.15\u2019s 10-year limitations period. The <em>Regents </em>majority answered that question no. <em>(Regents, supra., </em>at pp. 632-643.) The dissenters argued that because section 337.15 was a substantive limit on legal rights and duties, it precluded the plaintiff, in any suit brought after expiration of the 10-year period, from proving a contractor\u2019s breach of duty which the surety must make good. <em>(Regents, supra, </em>at pp. 644\u2014649 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Clark, J.); see <em>id. </em>at p. 640 (maj. opn.).) The majority rejected <em>that </em>contention <em>(id. </em>at pp. 640-642), but nothing in the holding of <em>Regents </em>compels a conclusion that where section 337.15 does apply, it should be subject to equitable tolling.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Plaintiffs and the dissent note that the Legislature has not expressly disagreed with the equitable tolling rule set forth in <em>Cascade Gardens, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d 1252, and <em>Grange Debris, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th 1349 (but see <em>FNB Mortgage, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th 1116). Of course, the Legislature has not revisited section 337.15 at all since 1981, well before these cases were decided.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> There are many reasons why the Legislature fails to address intervening judicial constructions of a statute, including inattention, press of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>other business, and trust in the courts to correct their own errors. <em>(People </em>v. <em>King </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 59, 77 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 233, 851 P.2d 27]; <em>County of Los Angeles v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 391, 404 [179 Cal.Rptr. 214, 637 P.2d 681].) Hence, \u201c \u2018legislative inaction is a \u201c \u2018weak reed upon which to lean.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Harris v. Capital Growth Investors XIV </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1142, 1156 [278 Cal.Rptr. 614, 805 P.2d 873], quoting <em>Troy Gold Industries, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Occupational Safety &amp; Health Appeals Bd. </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 379, 391, fn. 6 [231 Cal.Rptr. 861].) Here, mere legislative silence fails to dissuade us from our conclusion that section 337.15 is not subject to equitable tolling for repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Plaintiffs suggest that equitable tolling for repairs protects homeowners from unscrupulous builders who might otherwise make false promises or \u201cband-aid\u201d repairs in order to forestall suit until after the 10-year period had passed. Tolling for repairs is also good policy, plaintiffs maintain, because it encourages resolution of construction defect disputes without resort to the courts. But a tolling rule seems just as likely to <em>discourage </em>a potential defendant from undertaking voluntary remedial efforts before the limitations period expires. If his efforts failed, he would only have prolonged the already lengthy period during which he was exposed to suit.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Moreover, if a plaintiff can show, in a particular case, that the defendant\u2019s promises or attempts to repair prevented a timely suit, the defendant may be equitably <em>estopped </em>from invoking the protection of the statute of limitations. (See discussion, <em>post.) </em>Thus, an automatic rule of equitable <em>tolling </em>is not necessary to counteract fraudulent assurances of repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">We therefore conclude that the 10-year limitations period set forth in section 337.15 is not subject to tolling in progress while a potential defendant\u2019s promises or attempts to repair the defect are pending. The distinct question remains whether a defendant may nonetheless be equitably estopped to assert this statute of limitations if he prevented a timely suit by his conduct upon which the plaintiffs reasonably relied.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">2. <em>Equitable estoppel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Plaintiffs assert that even if equitable tolling does not apply, their first amended complaint states facts which should estop these particular defendants from relying on the limitations period of section 337.15. Plaintiffs invoke the venerable principle that \u201c \u2018[o]ne cannot justly or equitably lull his adversary into a false sense of security, and thereby cause his adversary to subject his claim to the bar of the statute of limitations, and then be permitted to plead the very delay caused by his course of conduct as a defense to the action when brought.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Carruth v. Fritch </em>(1950) 36 Cal.2d 426, 433 [224 P.2d 702], quoting <em>Howard </em>v. <em>West Jersey &amp; S. S. R. Co. </em>(N.J. Ch. 1928) 102 N.J. Eq. 517 [141 A. 755, 757-758].)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Equitable tolling and equitable estoppel are distinct doctrines. \u201c \u2018Tolling, strictly speaking, is concerned with the point at which the limitations period begins to run and with the circumstances in which the running of the limitations period may be suspended. . . . Equitable estoppel, however, . . . comes into play only after the limitations period has run and addresses . . . the circumstances in which a party will be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense to an admittedly untimely action because his conduct has induced another into forbearing suit within the applicable limitations period. [Equitable estoppel] is wholly independent of the limitations period itself and takes its life . . . from the equitable principle that no man [may] profit from his own wrongdoing in a court of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Battuello, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th 842, 847-848, quoting <em>Bomba </em>v. <em>W. L. Belvidere, Inc. </em>(7th Cir. 1978) 579 F.2d 1067, 1070.)  Thus, equitable estoppel is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>available even where the limitations statute at issue expressly precludes equitable tolling. <em>(Leasequip, Inc. v. Dapeer </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 394, 405-408 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 782] [\u00a7 340.6; attorney malpractice statute of limitations]; <em>Battuello, supra, </em>at pp. 847-848 [\u00a7 366.2; special one-year limitations period for surviving actions against deceased person].)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">One aspect of equitable estoppel is codified in Evidence Code section 623, which provides that \u201c[w]henever a party has, by his own statement or conduct, intentionally and deliberately led another to believe a particular thing true and to act upon such belief, he is not, in any litigation arising out of such statement or conduct, permitted to contradict it.\u201d (See <em>DRG/Beverly Hills, Ltd. v.

According to the Court of Appeal, \u201c[plaintiffs] alleged in their complaint that Centex had repeatedly promised to repair the damage to their homes. Based on these allegations, [plaintiffs] argued Centex was equitably estopped to assert the statute of limitations as a defense because . . . Centex\u2019s promises caused them to delay filing suit. . . . [T]hese allegations were sufficient to overcome a demurrer based on the statute of limitations contained in section 337.15.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">We disagree. The complaint\u2019s sole allegation on this issue is \u201cthat <em>at various times </em>Defendants have attempted to make repairs ... or advised Plaintiffs that the defective windows were not defective and not to file a lawsuit,\u201d but have not properly repaired the leaking windows and associated damage, and \u201care [therefore] estopped to assert that Plaintiffs have not commenced this action in a timely fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">This is insufficient. Contrary to the Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning, the complaint is devoid of any indication that defendants\u2019 conduct <em>actually and reasonably induced plaintiffs to forbear suing within the 10-year period of section 337.15. </em>There is no suggestion that the repair attempts alleged, if successful, would have obviated the need for suit. Moreover, for all that appears, the \u201cvarious times\u201d at which defendants\u2019 alleged conduct occurred were times well before the statute of limitations ran out, or even, as the trial court suggested, after it had expired. And there is no claim that the inadequacy of these repairs, or the falsity of defendants\u2019 alleged \u201cno defect\u201d representations, remained hidden until after the limitations period had passed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Hence, plaintiffs have pled no facts indicating that defendants\u2019 conduct directly prevented them from filing their suit on time. Accordingly, the first amended complaint establishes no basis to estop defendants from asserting that plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action are barred by the 10-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">3. <em>Amendment of complaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">As noted above, the trial court sustained defendants\u2019 demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint without affording plaintiffs an opportunity to amend. The court found, among other things, that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to estop defendants from asserting that the statute of limitations had expired. The court conceded that amendment might cure the purely factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>deficiencies, but it ultimately reasoned that tolling for repairs was simply not available, as a matter of law, to extend the limitations period of section 337.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">In reversing, the Court of Appeal determined that <em>both </em>tolling <em>and </em>estoppel were available, and that the first amended complaint was sufficient on both theories. We, on the other hand, have concluded that while section 337.15\u2019s 10-year limitations period is not <em>tolled </em>for repairs, defendants might be <em>estopped </em>under particular circumstances to invoke this statute of limitations. However, we have agreed with the trial court that the current complaint fails to state sufficient facts to establish such an estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Without stressing the point, plaintiffs have urged at all stages that if their complaint is deficient, but could be remedied by additional factual allegations, a chance should be afforded to assert such facts. The question thus arises whether plaintiffs should be allowed an opportunity to amend to state facts sufficient to set forth an equitable estoppel. In the specific circumstances of this case, we conclude the answer is \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Of course, \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that if there is a reasonable possibility that a defect in the complaint can be cured by amendment . . . , a demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Minsky </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 113, 118 [113 Cal.Rptr. 102, 520 P.2d 726].) But the particular history of this case persuades us there is no reasonable possibility plaintiffs can state credible facts to support an equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">We realize that after the trial court sustained defendants\u2019 demurrer to the first amended complaint\u2014the ruling at issue here\u2014plaintiffs did offer more specific estoppel allegations in a proposed second amended complaint. This proposed complaint made express claims that, from the time plaintiffs purchased their homes until expiration of the 10-year limitations period, defendants engaged in a pattern of falsely promising repairs, or making sham repairs they knew would fail, and then refused to respond further once the 10-year period had passed, all with the purpose and effect of inducing plaintiffs to forbear suing within the statutory time. The trial court rejected the proposed complaint, both as untimely and on the incorrect assumption that if section 337.15 could not be <em>tolled </em>for repairs, equitable <em>estoppel </em>was equally unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">But even if the new allegations of the proposed second amended complaint were technically sufficient to establish an estoppel, several circumstances negate any inference that these new assertions had a substantial basis in fact. In the first place, the gravamen of the new allegations\u2014that defendants\u2019 promises and attempts to repair continued throughout the entire 10-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>period, that plaintiffs were thereby induced to forbear suing until the period expired, and that defendants then abruptly refused further cooperation\u2014must have been within plaintiffs\u2019 personal knowledge at the time they filed their lawsuit. No reason appears why these assertions, if true, were not presented sooner.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Doubt about the credibility of the new allegations is heightened by developments in this court. During oral argument, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was asked what additional facts, not included in the first amended complaint, could be asserted to support a theory of equitable estoppel. At a minimum, counsel could have referred us to the claims set forth in the proposed second amended complaint. He did not do so. Instead, he responded only that repairs promised or attempted by defendants <em>at any time </em>during the 10-year period gave rise, as a matter of law, to a form of <em>implicit reliance </em>by plaintiffs that defects in the construction of plaintiffs\u2019 homes would be remedied. This, counsel argued, should extend the statute of limitations by a time equivalent to the period during which repairs were pending. In short, counsel simply reiterated a theory of equitable <em>tolling </em>which we have rejected in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Under these circumstances, we are convinced there is no reasonable possibility plaintiffs can assert new, credible facts suggesting that defendants are equitably estopped to assert the 10-year statute of limitations for latent construction defects. Accordingly, no basis appears to allow a remand for purposes of amendment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Equitable tolling does not apply to the 10-year statute of limitations set forth in section 337.15. The Court of Appeal decisions in <em>Grange Debris Box &amp; Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th 1349, and <em>Cascade Gardens Homeowners Assn. v. McKellar &amp; Associates, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d 1252, are disapproved to the extent they concluded otherwise. Moreover, plaintiffs have failed to plead facts that would equitably estop defendants from asserting this limitations period, and there appears no reasonable possibility the deficiency can be remedied by credible amendment of the complaint. The trial court thus correctly sustained defendants\u2019 demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint without leave to amend, and dismissed the action. The Court of Appeal erred by overturning the judgment of dismissal. The judgment of the Court of Appeal is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">George, C.

(See text discussion, <em>ante </em>and <em>post.) </em>But where a lengthy limitations statute such as section 337.15 is at issue, automatic tolling bears a far less direct relationship to fundamental fairness. The facts of <em>Cascade Gardens, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d 1252, demonstrate the point. There, a certificate of completion of a construction project was recorded on July 13, 1973. If not tolled, the 10-year limitations period of section 337.15 would thus have expired on July 12, 1983. However, during the four-month period from January 1974 until April 1974, the contractor attempted repairs. The plaintiffs finally brought their suit on August 12, 1983. The Court of Appeal deemed the suit timely under section 337.15 because the <em>1973-1974 </em>repair efforts had postponed expiration of the 10-year period by four months, from <em>July to November 1983.

But this strained treatment of the early authorities obscures their overall context. <em>Aced, Mack, </em>and <em>Southern Cal.

Section 337.15 was last amended by Statutes 1981, chapter 88, section 1, pages 204-205. <em>Cascade Gardens </em>was decided six years later, in 1987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b420-5\"> As evidence that the Legislature supports the principle of tolling for repairs in construction defect cases, plaintiffs direct our attention to new Civil Code section 895 et seq., adopted in 2002. (See fns. 2, 8, <em>ante.) </em>This statutory <em>scheme </em>comprehensively revises the law applicable to construction defect litigation for individual residential units, other than condominium conversions, first sold after January 1, 2003. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 896, 938.) Where it applies, the new scheme expressly <em>supersedes </em>section 337.15, though it retains the basic premise that suit may commence no later than 10 years after substantial completion of the project. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 941, subds. (a), (d).) Among other things, the new law <em>requires, </em>as a prerequisite to suit, elaborate \u201cnonadversarial procedure[s]\u201d to try to resolve the dispute <em>(id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 910 et seq., 914), including a prelitigation opportunity for the builder to effect repairs <em>(id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 917-928). Civil Code section 927 states that if the statute of limitations runs <em>during the repair process, </em>the time for filing a suit for an actionable defect, or for inadequate repairs, is tolled from the date the claimant originally notified the builder of his claim until 100 days after the repair process is complete. The new scheme further provides, in cryptic fashion, that \u201c[e]xisting statutory and decisional law regarding tolling of the statute of limitations shall apply to the time periods for filing an action . . . under this title,\u201d but that <em>repairs </em>shall <em>not </em>toll the limitations period <em>except as specifically provided in section 927. </em>(Civ. Code, \u00a7 941, subd. (e).) Civil Code section 895 et seq. demonstrates only that the Legislature knows how to toll the statute of limitations for repairs when it wishes to do so. Moreover, a 2002 statute that provides for a limited form of <em>statutory </em>tolling while <em>mandatory </em>dispute resolution efforts proceed, but otherwise explicitly <em>excludes </em>tolling for repairs, affords little support for the premise that <em>equitable </em>tolling should apply under a 1971 statute of limitations to a defendant\u2019s <em>voluntary </em>efforts to remedy alleged defects. We reach a similar conclusion with respect to Civil Code section 1375, specially applicable to common interest developments, which includes somewhat similar express provisions for tolling while <em>mandatory </em>dispute adjustment procedures go forward in timely fashion. <em>(Id., </em>subds.

In opposition to defendants\u2019 demurrer, plaintiffs urged that the first amended complaint sufficiently alleged plaintiffs\u2019 \u201c[r]eliance\u201d on defendants\u2019 promises and attempts to repair, and that defendants\u2019 conduct, as alleged, \u201cestopped\u201d them from invoking the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">In papers supporting their later motion to amend, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel represented that they had recently learned of defendants\u2019 similar conduct in <em>other </em>residential developments, whereby defendants \u201cwilfully lulled homeowners into a sense of security [by promising repairs] until [defendants were confident that these homeowners would refrain from instituting litigation until the applicable statute of limitations had expired.\u201d This language suggests counsel understood the essential elements of equitable estoppel, while failing to explain why similarly relevant allegations <em>within plaintiffs\u2019 personal knowledge </em>were not presented sooner, if true.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Finally, plaintiffs\u2019 appellate briefs, both in the Court of Appeal and in this court, indicate their full awareness that tolling and estoppel are distinct theories. Hence, there could have been no confusion about the import of this court\u2019s question at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b426-6\">WERDEGAR, J. Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"ACJ\">I respectfully dissent. I cannot join the majority in rejecting application of equitable tolling to the 10-year limitation on actions for latent construction defects (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 337.15).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Second, while I agree with the majority that in an appropriate case a defendant may be equitably estopped to assert that section 337.15\u2019s 10-year limitation has expired, I disagree that there is no reasonable possibility plaintiffs in this case can allege sufficient facts to establish such an estoppel. Consequently, I would allow plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint in order to correct any deficiencies the majority purports to identify.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\n<em>Tolling</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\u201cStatutes of limitations are not so rigid as they are sometimes regarded.\u201d <em>(Bollinger v. National Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 399, 411 [154 P.2d 399].) It is well established that statutes of limitation are not to be applied inflexibly where equity and justice favor the application of equitable tolling, and suspension of the running of a particular statute will not frustrate its purpose of preventing surprise through the revival of stale claims. (See <em>Elkins </em>v. <em>Derby </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 410, 417-419 [115 Cal.Rptr. 641, 525 P.2d 81].) For instance, \u201c[t]he statute of limitations is tolled where one who has breached a warranty claims that the defect can be repaired and attempts to make repairs.\u201d <em>(Aced v. Hobbs-Sesack Plumbing Co. </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 573, 585 [12 Cal.Rptr. 257, 360 P.2d 897] <em>(Aced).) </em>Another established application of the general principle\u2014today repudiated by the majority\u2014has been that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>\u201c[i]n cases involving construction defects . . . the statute of limitations is tolled during each period the defendant attempts to repair the defect.\u201d (3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1996) Actions, \u00a7 684, p. 871.)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The majority argues that \u201cthe purpose of section 337.15, as revealed by its history, weighs against a judicially imposed rule that the 10-year limitations period set forth in this statute is tolled for repairs. On the other hand, countervailing policies of practicality and fairness do not compel such a rule.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 378-379.) I disagree. As Justice Richardson long ago explained in a unanimous opinion for this court, \u201cthe equitable tolling doctrine fosters the policy of the law of this state which favors avoiding forfeitures and allowing good faith litigants their day in court.\u201d <em>(Addison v. State of California </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 313, 320-321 [146 Cal.Rptr. 224, 578 P.2d 941] <em>(Addison).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">As its opinion nowhere specifies the elements of equitable tolling, the majority leaves the inaccurate impression that, unless we in this case categorically bar that remedy in construction defect cases, it will appear by judicial \u201cfiat\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 379) or happen automatically whenever \u201ca potential defendant\u2019s promises or attempts to repair the defect are pending\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 383). The majority misdescribes the law. Courts do not enjoy unfettered discretion to toll a statute of limitations. Rather, \u201capplication of the doctrine of equitable tolling requires timely notice, and lack of prejudice, to the defendant, and reasonable and good faith conduct on the part of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Addison, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 319.)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">According to the majority, \u201cthe plain language of section 337.15 suggests that the 10-year limitations period is not subject to extension for reasons not stated in the statute itself.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 373.) I discern no such suggestion. Section 337.15 does not mention tolling, equitable or otherwise. The omission is significant; had the Legislature meant to preclude equitable tolling, it easily could have said so, as it has in other statutes of limitation. (See \u00a7\u00a7 340.5 [\u201cno event\u201d shall toll limit on actions against health care providers except those specified], 340.6 [same for attorney malpractice actions], 366.2, subd. (b) [limit on actions on liability of a deceased person \u201cshall not be tolled or extended for any reason\u201d except as specified in certain code sections].)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Thus, contrary to the majority, equitable tolling in this case is not inconsistent with the text of the statute. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 371.) The majority in any event is not actually relying on section 337.15\u2019s plain language, but, rather, on its perception of that statute\u2019s \u201cstructure and tone\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 373), which the majority characterizes as \u201cstentorian\u201d <em>(ibid.). </em>Such observations are at best irrelevant, since, as the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>concedes, the tolling remedy at issue \u201cis a general equitable one which operates independently of the literal wording of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d <em>(Addison, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 318; see maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 367.)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The majority also advances a legislative intent argument, based on the Legislature\u2019s asserted failure when enacting section 337.15 to provide an express repairs extension, despite knowing that case law had earlier \u201cen-grafted a \u2018tolling for repairs\u2019 rule onto the four-year discovery-based limitations period for breach of a construction warranty\u201d and its asserted \u201ccareful attention\u201d to other (unspecified) issues raised by prior court decisions. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 377.) But in California it \u201cis established that the running of the statute of limitations may be suspended by causes not mentioned in the statute itself\u2019 <em>(Bollinger v. National Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>25 Cal.2d at p. 411),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Legislature is presumed to have been aware of that principle when it enacted section 337.15 <em>(People v. Seneca Ins. Co. </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 954, 972 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 842, 62 P.3d 81]).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Framing the legislative intent argument somewhat differently, the majority asserts the Legislature\u2019s silence respecting equitable tolling when enacting section 337.15 bespeaks its intent to bar application of that long-established doctrine in this context. \u201cWe can rarely determine from the failure of the Legislature to pass a particular [provision] what the intent of the Legislature is with respect to existing law.\u201d <em>(Ingersoll v. Palmer </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1321, 1349 [241 Cal.Rptr. 42, 743 P.2d 1299].) For that reason, we \u201cshould not presume the Legislature intended \u2018to overthrow long-established principles of law unless such intention is made clearly to appear either by express declaration or by necessary implication ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Juran v. Epstein </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 882, 896 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 588].)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The majority does not deny the Legislature has acquiesced for many years in <em>Cascade Gardens Homeowners Assn. v. McKellar &amp; Associates </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 1252 [240 Cal.Rptr. 113] <em>(Cascade </em>Gardens) and <em>Grange Debris Box &amp; Wrecking Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1349 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 515] <em>(Grange Debris), </em>cases confirming that courts may apply the doctrine of equitable tolling to section 337.15. (See <em>Cascade Gardens, supra, </em>at p. 1256; <em>Grange Debris, supra, </em>at p. 1360.) Sixteen years ago, <em>Cascade Gardens </em>held on the basis of \u201c[c]lear authority\u201d that \u201cunder certain circumstances\u201d and where \u201cprinciples of equity and justice . . . allow,\u201d section 337.15 is subject to equitable tolling while repairs are undertaken. <em>(Cascade Gardens, supra, </em>at p. 1256, citing <em>Aced, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d at p. 585, <em>Mack v. Hugh W. Comstock Associates </em>(1964) 225 Cal.App.2d 583, 589-590 [37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Cal.Rptr.466] <em>(Mack), </em>and <em>Southern Cal. Enterprises v. Walter &amp; Co. </em>(1947) 78 Cal.App.2d 750, 755 [178 P.2d 785] <em>(Southern Cal. Enterprises).) </em>As the majority concedes, the Legislature has never expressly disagreed with <em>Cascade Gardens </em>or taken any action to overrule or limit its holding. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 381.) Accordingly, it would be reasonable for us to presume the Legislature is aware of the judicial construction and approves of it. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 779, 789 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 114, 29 P.3d 197]; <em>People v. Hallner </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 715, 720 [277 P.2d 393].)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The majority, however, seeks to repudiate <em>Cascade Gardens </em>on grounds that three cases on which that court relied are inapposite because they were breach of warranty cases that predate the adoption of section 337.15. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 372, discussing <em>Aced, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d 573, <em>Mack, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.2d 583, and <em>Southern Cal. Enterprises, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.2d 750.) But that <em>Aced, Mack, </em>and <em>Southern Cal. Enterprises </em>were decided before section 337.15 was enacted is irrelevant, as <em>Cascade Gardens </em>relied on these cases not for any conclusion respecting section 337.15\u2019s legislative history or wording, but solely as authority for the proposition that \u201crepairs, such as those undertaken by [the defendants there] toll statutes of limitations as a matter of law\u201d <em>(Cascade Gardens, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d at p. 1256). The majority does not dispute that <em>Aced, Mack, </em>and <em>Southern Cal. Enterprises </em>so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The majority characterizes <em>Cascade Gardens' </em>authorities as \u201cnarrowly concerned with how to apply the limitations period for express or implied warranties\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 372), but that does not tell the whole story. While <em>Cascade Gardens </em>cited warranty cases, it did so not for peculiarly warranty-related principles, but, rather, as \u201ccases involving [or discussing] construction defects, defective products, and other breaches of warranty [in which] the defendant attempts to repair the defect\u201d (3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Actions, \u00a7 684, p. 871). For example, the <em>Mack </em>opinion expressly addressed tolling of other \u201cCode of Civil Procedure sections . . . relating to the tortious injury or damage to person or property . . . .\u201d <em>(Mack, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.2d at p. 589 [considering \u201cthe application of these statutes\u201d and concluding \u201cthe proper one to apply\u201d \u201cwas tolled during the entire period when the respondents attempted to repair the heating plant\u201d involved in the case]; see also <em>Cascade Gardens, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d at p. 1257, fn. 4 [analogizing <em>Mack].) </em>In <em>Aced, </em>although we cited several cases showing that construction contracts \u201cordinarily . . . give rise to an implied warranty\u201d <em>(Aced, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d at p. 582), we also noted the rule that \u201c[t]he statute of limitations is tolled when one who has breached a warranty claims that the defect can be repaired and attempts to make repairs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 585.) And the Court of Appeal in <em>Southern Cal. Enterprises </em>actually was at pains to <em>distinguish </em>the case of the \u201c \u2018typical warranty\u2019 \u201d <em>(Southern Cal. Enterprises, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.2d at p. 757) from the rule governing that case, which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>stated as: \u201c \u2018if the seller promises that something shall happen or shall not happen to the goods within a specified future time, the promise though it may be called a warranty cannot be broken until that time has elapsed and until then the statute will not begin to run\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 758; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 757). In sum, the reasoning of <em>Cascade Gardens </em>and the warranty cases on which it relied\u2014that promises to repair \u201cextend the limitations periods for suits on construction defects\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 374, describing, inter alia, <em>Aced </em>and Mack)\u2014is fully applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Pointing to section 337.15\u2019s express exceptions, the majority invokes the maxim <em>inclusio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>apparently to suggest that, by including express statutory exceptions, the Legislature meant to displace established, generally applicable equitable exceptions. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 373.) The majority does not develop the argument, perhaps realizing that \u201cthe [cited] maxim, while helpful in appropriate cases, \u2018is no magical incantation, nor does it refer to an immutable rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>(California Fed. Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 342, 351 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 279, 902 P.2d 297].) As the Court of Appeal pointed out, a recognized exception to the maxim arises when its application would conflict with well-established legal principles that the Legislature has not expressly repudiated. <em>(Juran </em>v. <em>Epstein, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at p. 896; see also <em>Battuello </em>v. <em>Battuello </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 842, 848 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 548].) Accordingly, as the Court of Appeal concluded, the presence of enumerated exceptions in section 337.15 does not imply legislative intent to exclude equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Confirming trial courts\u2019 discretionary access to equitable tolling, contrary to the majority, would not undermine the legislative purposes underlying section 337.15. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 373-377.) The majority\u2019s lengthy recitation of section 337.15\u2019s legislative history confirms \u201cthe statute is the result of general legislative concern about the economic effects of indefinite Tong tail\u2019 defect liability on the construction industry\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 374), but it ultimately does not support the majority\u2019s position. Plaintiffs argue persuasively that the Legislature\u2019s primary aim when enacting section 337.15 was to eliminate generalized application of the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d in construction defect litigation. Retention of equitable tolling would not undermine section 337.15\u2019s impact on the perceived evils of that rule, because, as the majority acknowledges, a defendant who promises or undertakes repairs is generally able to control the time of any suit against it. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 381.)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Ultimately, the majority can point to but one circumstance\u2014that involving the so-called unsuspecting subcontractor\u2014in which it can credibly claim an equitable tolling rule would undermine the statutory purpose. (See maj. opn., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>ante, </em>at p. 378.) The majority\u2019s objection, however, depends on the questionable assumption that subcontractors responsible for defects generally will neither participate in nor be informed about repairs contractor defendants might promise or undertake. Common sense suggests that such a circumstance, if it ever occurs, is likely to be the exception. In any event, the majority does not persuade me this theoretical possibility should drive our construction of section 337.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">As we long have understood, section 337.15 is an \u201cordinary statute of limitations, subject to the same rules ... as other statutes of limitations.\u201d <em>(Regents of University of California v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 624, 642 [147 Cal.Rptr. 486, 581 P.2d 197].) One such generally applicable rule has been that statutes of limitations may be subject to equitable tolling during periods of repair. <em>(Cascade Gardens, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d at p. 1256.) Given the Legislature\u2019s long-standing acquiescence in <em>Cascade Gardens </em>and its progeny, the absence of an express reference to equitable tolling in section 337.15 affords no justification for barring that generally available remedy in construction defect cases. I conclude that equitable tolling of section 337.15 to protect homeowners from unscrupulous builders and to encourage amicable resolution of construction defect disputes should remain available in appropriate cases when plaintiffs can demonstrate the remedy\u2019s required elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\n<em>Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">I agree with the majority that a defendant whose conduct induces plaintiffs to refrain from filing suit within the statutory period may, depending on the circumstances, be equitably estopped to assert that section 337.15\u2019s 10-year limitation on latent construction defect actions has expired. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 367.) The majority concludes that plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint alleges insufficient facts to establish such an estoppel. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 385.) Assuming that conclusion is correct, I would allow plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The majority correctly notes that \u201cplaintiffs did offer more specific estoppel allegations in a proposed second amended complaint. This proposed complaint made express claims that, from the time plaintiffs purchased their homes until expiration of the 10-year limitations period, defendants engaged in a pattern of falsely promising repairs, or making sham repairs they knew would fail, and then refused to respond further once the 10-year period had passed, all with the purpose and effect of inducing plaintiffs to forbear suing within the statutory time.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 386.) \u201cIt is axiomatic that if there is a reasonable possibility that a defect in the complaint can be cured by amendment or that the pleading liberally construed can state a cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>of action, a demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend.\u201d <em>(Minsky </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 113, 118 [113 Cal.Rptr. 102, 520 P.2d 726].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The majority acknowledges this axiom (see maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 386), but fails to apply it.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Conceding that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed allegations may be \u201ctechnically sufficient to establish an estoppel,\u201d the majority nevertheless denies plaintiffs that remedy, partly on the ground that plaintiffs\u2019 belated presentation of the proposed second amended complaint gives rise to doubt about the credibility of its allegations. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 386.) But elsewhere the majority acknowledges that plaintiffs have urged \u201cat <em>all stages </em>that if their complaint is deficient, but could be remedied by additional factual allegations, a chance should be afforded to assert such facts.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The record contains a declaration, submitted to the superior court by one of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, stating that only five days <em>after </em>defendants\u2019 demurrer was granted without leave to amend did counsel <em>become </em>aware, through conversations with another attorney, of the facts plaintiffs proposed to allege in their second amended complaint. Moreover, we previously have stated, in a case where \u201cthe defense of estoppel set out in the amendment was known for a considerable time before the trial,\u201d that the fact \u201c \u2018the new matter set up by the amendment was well known to the [party] when he filed his original [pleading] was no good reason why he should not have been permitted to amend.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Tolbard v. Cline </em>(1919) 180 Cal. 240, 245 [180 P. 610]; see also 49A Cal.Jur.3d (2002) Pleading, \u00a7 224, p. 371.) The majority on the other hand cites no authority for its apparent implication that plaintiffs\u2019 failure to supply a reason why the second amended complaint was not \u201cpresented sooner\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 387) is grounds for denying them an opportunity to amend their complaint, nor do I know of any such authority. To the contrary, \u201c[a]ny judge, at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, . . . may allow the amendment of any pleading . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 576.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The majority also professes doubt about the credibility of the new allegations for the reason that, when plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was asked at oral argument what additional facts, not included in the first amended complaint, could be asserted to support a theory of equitable estoppel, he responded that \u201crepairs promised or attempted by defendants <em>at any time </em>during the 10-year period gave rise, as a matter of law, to a form of <em>implicit reliance </em>by plaintiffs,\u201d thus reiterating a theory of equitable tolling, rather than specifically referring us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the claims set forth in the proposed second amended complaint. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 387.) The majority concludes that this omission and the proposed amendment\u2019s timing \u201cnegate any inference that these new assertions had a substantial basis in fact.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 386.) The conclusion does not follow. After all, the majority does not claim that plaintiffs <em>abandoned </em>or <em>repudiated </em>the allegations of the proposed second amended complaint, nor, indeed, did plaintiffs do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">I am aware of no requirement that an issue or position that has been briefed before this court must be reiterated at oral argument in order to be preserved, nor of any principle that counsel who is nonresponsive to the court\u2019s question concerning a position is deemed to have abandoned that position. In addressing the topic of reliance before us, plaintiffs certainly were entitled to argue implicit reliance and even to reiterate their tolling theory, without being deemed to abandon the alternative, and perfectly consistent, position respecting amendment that they have urged at all stages of this litigation\u2014viz., \u201cthat if their complaint is deficient, but could be remedied by additional factual allegations, a chance should be afforded to assert such facts.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 386.) In accordance with our liberal rules respecting amendment of the pleadings (see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 473, 576), I would afford plaintiffs that opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Kennard, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">On August 27, 2003, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-9\"> All further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\"> The majority inferentially acknowledges the point in recognizing the possibility that \u201csection 337.15 is subject to the several separate <em>statutes </em>[not mentioned in section 337.15] that specify when certain limitations periods will be tolled.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 383, fn. 17.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\"> As the majority concedes, the trial court found there was a possibility that amendment could cure any factual deficiencies in plaintiffs\u2019 estoppel allegations.
