Section <em>777 </em>has long allowed a more restrictive disposition where juvenile probationers previously found to have committed crimes under section 602 commit new misconduct. Among its many provisions, Proposition 21 limits section <em>777, </em>as applied to persons under section 602 jurisdiction, to \u201callege[d]\u201d probation violations \u201cnot amounting to . . . crime[s].\u201d (\u00a7 <em>111, </em>subd. (a)(2) (section 777(a)(2)).) In <em>Eddie M., </em>we conclude that section 777(a)(2) is not limited to probation violations that are inherently noncriminal in nature, but applies to any misconduct, criminal or noncriminal, so long as it is alleged only as a probation violation, not as a new juvenile crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Here, the Court of Appeal construed section 777(a)(2) in a manner contrary to <em>Eddie M., </em>thereby negating the application of another important provision of Proposition 21. This latter provision, by adding section 186.30, subdivision (b)(3) to the Penal Code (Penal Code section 186.30(b)(3)), imposes a gang registration requirement for a \u201cpetition sustained\u201d in juvenile court for any gang-related \u201ccrime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Specifically, the Court of Appeal held Proposition 21\u2019s gang registration requirement inapplicable in this case where the juvenile court had (1) sustained an allegation under section 777(a)(2) that the minor violated probation by possessing ammunition, and (2) found, for purposes of the gang registration provision, that this conduct was a gang-related crime. The Court of Appeal reasoned that because criminal conduct is excluded per se from proceedings under section 777(a)(2) as amended by Proposition 21\u2014a result we disavow in <em>Eddie </em>M.\u2014both the ammunition possession count and the gang registration order the juvenile court had attached to that count must be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>But as the Court of Appeal\u2019s premise fails, so must its conclusion based solely on that premise. Because the Court of Appeal erred in its determination that misconduct cannot be adjudicated <em>as a probation violation </em>under section 777(a)(2) if, in fact, it constitutes a crime, the court also erred when it relied exclusively on that principle to void the juvenile court\u2019s finding of a gang-related crime for which a registration condition was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In so deciding, we do not address whether there may be other reasons why the gang registration provision of Penal Code section 186.30(b)(3) might not apply in a section 777(a)(2) probation violation proceeding. (See <em>post, </em>at p. 517, fn. 4.) We leave that question to be decided in the first instance by the Court of Appeal. Accordingly, we will reverse the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment insofar as it conflicts with <em>Eddie M. </em>and this case, and will remand for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in these two decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">A. JUVENILE COURT PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">In 1996, the juvenile court sustained a section 602 petition charging Emiliano M. with two misdemeanors, namely, joyriding (Pen. Code, \u00a7 499b), and carrying a concealed firearm in a vehicle <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 12025, subd. (a)). On September 12, 1996, Emiliano was declared a ward under section 602, and received probation. The court imposed conditions which, among other things, prohibited the possession of weapons and ammunition, banned any association with specific persons linked to the Thugs Gone Krazy gang, and required payment of a restitution fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Between January 1997 and July 1999, the juvenile court sustained as many as five petitions against Emiliano under section 777 for numerous probation violations, including the possession of ammunition and association with gang members. Each time, the juvenile court continued Emiliano\u2019s wardship and probation, and ordered compliance with existing conditions. New conditions also were imposed barring any association with the Central Myrtle Street gang, and requiring the payment of various fees and fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">After he turned 18 years old and while still on juvenile probation, Emiliano became the subject of an attempted murder investigation arising out of a drive-by shooting. While executing a search warrant in the shooting case on July 20, 2000, police found Emiliano in the possession of two air pistols, four boxes of ammunition, and Central Myrtle Street gang paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">The present juvenile court proceeding began shortly after the police search. Authorities filed two new section 777 petitions which, as amended, accused Emiliano of violating juvenile probation by (1) failing to pay restitution, fines, and fees ordered on three occasions in 1996 through 1999, (2) possessing air pistols on July 20, 2000, in violation of the wardship order dated September 12, 1996, and (3) possessing ammunition on the same date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>in violation of the same court order. A consolidated bifurcated hearing occurred on August 29, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">At the jurisdictional phase of the instant section 777 hearing, Emiliano admitted violating juvenile probation by not paying restitution, fines, and fees notwithstanding his ability to pay. He submitted the remaining allegations to the juvenile court for adjudication based on certain police reports. The court found Emiliano possessed both air pistols and ammunition in violation of probationary terms imposed on September 12, 1996, in the underlying section 602 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">At the dispositional phase of the section 777 hearing, the juvenile court retained Emiliano as a section 602 ward, and continued probation under numerous conditions, including confinement for one year in county jail and compliance with restrictions on gang activity and associations. In addition, the court ordered Emiliano to register with law enforcement as a gang member within 10 days of his release from custody, alluding to Penal Code section 186.30(b)(3) as the source of this requirement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Emiliano objected to gang registration on unspecified grounds. The juvenile court overruled the objection, stating on the record that it assumed Emiliano was challenging the constitutionality of the registration statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">B. COURT OF APPEAL DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">On appeal, Emiliano targeted the registration requirement. In particular, he claimed that Penal Code section 186.30(b)(3) is facially unconstitutional on several grounds. The Court of Appeal ultimately agreed to invalidate the gang registration requirement in this case. However, after soliciting supplemental briefs on the issue, the panel based its decision solely on statutory grounds that implicated <em>both </em>Penal Code section 186.30(b)(3), <em>and </em>section 777(a)(2), on which the underlying probation violations were based.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">At the outset, the Court of Appeal alluded to the fact that after Proposition 21, section 777(a)(2) applies only to \u201callege[d]\u201d probation violations \u201cnot amounting to . . . crime[s].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to the court, this language limits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>section 777 to probation violations that involve \u201cnoncriminal misconduct,\u201d and that do not comprise \u201cindependent crime[s].\u201d The sole authority cited for this conclusion was <em>In re Marcus A. </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 423 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 919] <em>(Marcus </em>A.), which used similar reasoning to reverse a section 777 probation violation based on a criminal act. Thus, the instant Court of Appeal held that even where no new crime is alleged in the section 777(a)(2) proceeding, the statute does not apply to probation violations that are inherently criminal in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Next, the Court of Appeal determined that its interpretation of Proposition 21\u2019s version of section 777(a)(2) undermined a key jurisdictional finding in the juvenile court. The appellate court observed that, unlike the other probation violations sustained below (i.e., failure to pay fines and fees, and possession of air pistols), Emiliano\u2019s act of possessing ammunition in violation of an express probationary term constituted a crime. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12021, subd. (d), 12316, subd. (b).) Reasoning that such conduct is excluded under section 777(a)(2)\u2019s \u201cnot amounting to a crime\u201d language, the Court of Appeal decided that the latter probation violation must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Finally, and critical here, the court used its analysis of section 777(a)(2) to find a fatal flaw in the gang registration requirement. The court observed that Penal Code section 186.30(b)(3) applies by its own terms to anyone who has had \u201ca petition sustained in a juvenile court\u201d for \u201c[a]ny <em>crime </em>that the court finds is gang related\u201d at disposition. (Italics added.) Relying on the definition of the italicized term provided in Penal Code section 15, the Court of Appeal noted that a \u201ccrime\u201d is any <em>\u201cact committed </em>... in violation of a [penal] law.\u201d (Italics added.) The Court of Appeal explained that, while Emiliano\u2019s possession of ammunition actually involved a crime, the corresponding probation violation could not stand, because section 777(a)(2) only covers noncriminal acts under Proposition 21. Insisting no gang-related crime was properly sustained in a juvenile court petition under Penal Code section 186.30(b)(3), the court felt compelled to strike the registration requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>In sum, the Court of Appeal reversed the section 777 order insofar as it found that Emiliano violated probation by possessing ammunition, and required him to register as a gang member under Penal Code section 186.30(b)(3). In all other respects, the juvenile court\u2019s order was affirmed. The Attorney General petitioned for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">C. ANALYSIS ON REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The Attorney General contends the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision under Penal Code section 186.30(b)(3) was based on an erroneous interpretation of section 777(a)(2), to wit, that the latter statute, as amended by Proposition 21, cannot be used to allege and sustain probation violations based on criminal acts. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\"><em>Eddie M. </em>holds that section 777(a)(2), as amended by Proposition 21, covers <em>all </em>situations in which new misconduct by a criminal juvenile probationer is alleged only as a probation violation. In other words, a more restrictive disposition can be sought and obtained under the statute regardless of the actual criminal nature of the violation that is pled. <em>(Eddie M., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 480, 486.)  Probation violations alleged under section 777(a)(2) are proven under new procedural rules added by Proposition 21 to subdivision (c) of section 777. Such rules include a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof. (See <em>Eddie M., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 486.)</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\"><em>Eddie M. </em>explains that under a contrary interpretation of section 777(a)(2), unless each new crime could otherwise be proven beyond a reasonable doubt in either juvenile or adult court, \u201creoffense by a section 602 ward and probationer would entail no specific statutory sanction. Such a potentially wide gap in the law would impair the ability of both the executive and judicial branches to guide youthful reform and to ensure accountability for all offenders properly within the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(Eddie M., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 500.) <em>Eddie M. </em>disapproves the decision in <em>Marcus A., supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th 423, to the extent it reached an inconsistent result. <em>(Eddie M., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 502.)</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Here, the Court of Appeal erred in following <em>Marcus </em>A., <em>supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th 423, and in concluding that section 777(a)(2) excluded the act of possessing ammunition because it constitutes a crime. The finding that Emiliano violated probation by possessing ammunition should not have been reversed on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">Moreover, based solely on its erroneous conclusion that the ammunition-possession count was not properly alleged and sustained under section 777(a)(2), the Court of Appeal also reversed the gang registration requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>attached to that count under Penal Code section 186.30(b)(3). Our decision invalidates the Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning on this point. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal on remand should reconsider this issue and address any other issue concerning Penal Code section 186.30(b)(3). We have no occasion to do so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">D. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment is reversed insofar as it (1) reversed the probation violation involving the possession of ammunition, and (2) on that basis, reversed the gang registration requirement. The matter is remanded to the Court of Appeal for further proceedings consistent with both this opinion and <em>Eddie M., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 480. In all other respects, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">George, C.
