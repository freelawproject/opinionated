These are summarized in art 9, \u00a7 25 and implemented in the following sections. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>There are three main elements. Section 26 limits any changes in total state revenues to an amount based on changes in personal income in the state. Section 31 prohibits units of local government from levying any new tax or increasing any existing tax above authorized rates without the approval of the unit\u2019s electorate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The third element of the Headlee system is summarized in art 9, \u00a7 25, which states in part, \u201cThe state is prohibited from requiring any new or expanded activities by local governments without full state financing, from reducing the proportion of state spending in the form of aid to local governments, or from shifting the tax burden to local government.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These requirements are implemented in \u00a7\u00a7 29<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 30.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The application of the general, even vague, concepts of these sections to the complexities of state-local relations has proven a difficult task, as illustrated by the history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>HISTORY OP PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">This case is a consolidation of three groups of original actions filed in the Court of Appeals under art 9, \u00a7 32.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The first of these, the <em>Durant </em>case, was filed on May 7, 1980, on behalf of seven taxpayers who were residents of the Fitzgerald School District and that district. Defendants are the Department of Education, the Department of Management and Budget, and the State Treasurer. Plaintiffs alleged that the state was violating its duty under art 9, \u00a7 29 to maintain the state-financed proportion of the necessary costs of activities that state law orders plaintiff school district to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The Court of Appeals is an appellate court that has not been set up to conduct trials, much less trials involving complex factual questions. It initially ruled that the plaintiffs must first exhaust administrative remedies under the act passed by the Legislature to implement the Headlee Amendment, 1979 PA 101, MCL 21.231 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.3194(601) <em>et seq.;</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>110 Mich App 351; 313 NW2d 571 (1981). This Court reversed, ruling that plaintiffs were not required to exhaust administrative remedies before the local government claims review board. 413 Mich 862 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>On remand from this Court, the Court of Appeals ruled on a number of significant points in the continuing progress of the case. The most basic substantive question at that time was whether elementary and secondary education as a whole was a state-mandated activity<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> within the requirements of \u00a7 29. The Court of Appeals determined that it was not and that the proper focus was on more specific programs, listing special education as an example of such an activity. 129 Mich App 517, 526; 342 NW2d 591 (1983).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court also ruled that it was unable to grant relief, particularly mandamus because there were disputed facts and again dismissed the case. <em>Id. </em>at 534. This Court affirmed the substantive holding of the Court of Appeals concerning education as a whole. 424 Mich 364; 381 NW2d 662 (1985). However, we reversed the Court of Appeals procedural dismissal, noting that \u00a7 32 gave the taxpayers the right to proceed in the Court of Appeals. We remanded the case to the Court of Appeals, suggesting the appointment of a Special Master to act as factfinder. 424 Mich 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The Court of Appeals accepted the suggestion and appointed Macomb Circuit Judge George R. Deneweth as Special Master. The case was submitted on live testimony, depositions, extensive stipulations of facts, and lengthy briefs. Among the many issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>raised by the parties and addressed in the Special Master\u2019s report are the four issues raised by defendant in this appeal. On each of these issues, the Special Master and Court of Appeals have consistently ruled in favor of plaintiffs. The Court of Appeals accepted the Master\u2019s holdings that special education, special education transportation, driver\u2019s education, and school lunch and supplemental milk programs were state-mandated activities within \u00a7 29. All these were the beneficiaries of specific categorical state aid. The Court rejected a claim by plaintiffs on the basis of activities mandated by statute that had not been supported by specific \u201ccategorical\u201d aid. It disagreed with some of the Master\u2019s recommendations on how to compute \u201cnecessary costs.\u201d It remanded for recalculation of the amounts involved. 186 Mich App 83; 463 NW2d 461 (1990). Defendants filed an application for leave to appeal with this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In the meantime, a second group of plaintiffs, consisting of fifty-one taxpayers and fifty-one school districts, filed their own original action in the Court of Appeals, <em>Schmidt v State of Michigan </em>(Docket No. 132677). Their complaint for relief was modeled on the first amended complaint in <em>Durant. </em>In the context of the multiple school districts, a question appeared that had been hidden in <em>Durant, </em>which had only one school district plaintiff. In <em>Schmidt, </em>the proportional support that the state had provided in base year 1978-79 varied from district to district, even for the same activity. The assumption of the complaint was that these built-in variances would be maintained. The complaint asked for a money judgment for each school district on the basis of the state\u2019s failure to maintain funding at each district\u2019s base-year level.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>The Court of Appeals dismissed the <em>Schmidt </em>claim in an unpublished order, entered November 9, 1990 (Docket No. 132677).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The order stated that a claim for underfunding under the first sentence of art 9, \u00a7 29 must be based on a decrease in the funding for an activity \u201cacross all school districts in the state.\u201d That is, as long as the state aid for a program given to all school districts across the state did not fall below the proportion of necessary costs supported in the base year (statewide), it did not matter if some school districts saw their individual levels of support fah.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">On appeal, this Court reversed. Unlike art 9, \u00a7\u00a7 26 and 31, which specify corrections for anticipated problems, \u00a7 29 does not address remedy, or even the problem noted by the Court of Appeals, whether an individual unit of government has an enforceable right to have its own level of support maintained.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In an effort to devise a solution most likely to effectuate the will of the electorate that adopted \u00a7 29, we decided that each unit of local government should have a right to continued state support for state-mandated activities, but that use of different base-year proportions for each unit of government would build in undesirable anomalies. Thus, we held that the base-year proportion would be computed on a statewide level and each local unit could count on that base level of support in each ensuing year. 441 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>236; 490 NW2d 584 (1992). We remanded <em>Schmidt </em>to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The result of <em>Schmidt </em>was that all the computations in <em>Durant </em>were inaccurate. We remanded <em>Durant </em>to the Court of Appeals in light of <em>Schmidt. </em>441 Mich 930 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">On remand, the Court of Appeals consolidated <em>Durant </em>and <em>Schmidt </em>and added a third group of thirty-three cases raising similar issues that had been filed at the Court of Appeals and held in abeyance pending our decision in <em>Schmidt. </em>The Court of Appeals, 203 Mich App 507; 513 NW2d 195 (1994), appointed Wayne Circuit Judge James E. Mies as Special Master.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Judge Mies decided a number of post-<em>Schmidt </em>issues not relevant to this appeal. The Court of Appeals accepted his recommendations, 213 Mich App 500; 541 NW2d 278 (1995). After initially denying leave to appeal, 453 Mich 892 (1996) (Boyle, J., dissenting), we granted reconsideration and leave to appeal, 453 Mich 952 (1996) (Cavanagh, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">I. SPECIAL EDUCATION AND SPECIAL EDUCATION TRANSPORTATION</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Article 9, \u00a7 29 indicates, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Defendants concede that special education<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> is required by state law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, they argue that when an activity is required or imposed by federal law, it is not required by state law within the meaning of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29, citing <em>Schmidt, supra, </em>441 Mich 262 and, by analogy, <em>Sacramento v California, 50 </em>Cal 3d 51; 266 Cal Rptr 139; 785 P2d 522 (1990). They further argue that the federal requirement is found in three sources: the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (eahca) (now called the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \u2014 idea), which provides financial assistance for states that have complying special education programs, 20 USC 1401 <em>et seq.; </em>\u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 USC 794, which prohibits discrimination against the handicapped in programs receiving federal aid; and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Because we reject defendants\u2019 argument that there is an exception in \u00a7 29 for federal mandates, we do not address the argument that federal law mandates special education.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Plaintiffs argue that defendants are misreading <em>Schmidt. </em>There is no exception in art 9, \u00a7 29 for state mandates that are also subject to a federal mandate, and that such an exception would be contrary to the intent of the electorate in adopting the Headlee Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The Court of Appeals, on second remand, 186 Mich App 105, rejected defendants\u2019 arguments \u201cbecause state law imposes a stricter obligation on the state and its local units of government and because these governmental entities are charged with the duty of establishing and implementing specific programs and related services . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">We first consider and reject defendants\u2019 arguments that we recognized a federal exception in <em>Schmidt. </em>We then consider whether we should now recognize such an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Defendants do not base their argument for a federal-mandate exception on the language of art 9, \u00a7 29. Rather, they argue that this Court recognized such an exception in part m of our opinion in <em>Schmidt. </em>This part of <em>Schmidt </em>concerned the employer share of federal social security taxes. Before 1989, the state paid the employer share of federal social security taxes for school districts.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Beginning in 1989, the state decreased or eliminated that aid. Plaintiffs in <em>Schmidt </em>alleged that this violated art 9, \u00a7 29. We rejected that claim, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">Plaintiffs sought to frame their social security costs claim as though social security coverage constituted a separate state-required activity or service. However, social security coverage is directly imposed by federal law and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>not required by state law within the meaning of \u00a7 29. Second, social security coverage does not constitute an activity or service within the meaning of \u00a7 29. [441 Mich 262.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Neither of these reasons helps defendants here. First, special education is \u201crequired ... by state law\u201d within the language of art 9, \u00a7 29.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Second, special education is an \u201cactivity or service\u201d within that provision.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The question remains whether there is such an exception. In deciding that question, we are guided by very basic rules of constitutional interpretation. In <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390, 405; 185 NW2d 9 (1971), we stated that the primary rule of constitutional interpretation is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>rule of \u201ccommon understanding\u201d described in 1 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (8th ed), p 143:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">\u201cA constitution is made for the people and by the people. The interpretation that should be given it is that which reasonable minds, the great mass of the people themselves, would give it. \u2018For as the Constitution does not derive its force from the convention which framed, but from the people who ratified it, the intent to be arrived at is that of the people, and it is not to be supposed that they have looked for any dark or abstruse meaning in the words employed, but rather that they have accepted them in the sense most obvious to the common understanding, and ratified the instrument in the belief that that was the sense designed to be conveyed.\u2019 (Cooley\u2019s Const Lim 81.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Chief Justice Cooley also stated for this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">[I]n seeking for its real meaning!,] we must take into consideration the times and circumstances under which the State Constitution was formed \u2014 the general spirit of the times and the prevailing sentiments among the people. Every constitution has a history of its own which is likely to be more or less peculiar; and unless interpreted in the light of this history, is liable to be made to express purposes which were never within the minds of the people in agreeing to it. This the court must keep in mind when called upon to interpret it; for their duty is to enforce the law which the people have made, and not some other law which the words of the constitution may possibly be made to express. <em>[.People v Harding, </em>53 Mich 481, 485; 19 NW 155 (1884).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">So, the question is whether the great mass of the people would have meant the following language to convey an exception for state mandates that are also federal mandates \u2014 or whether such an exception is a dark and abstruse meaning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law. A new activity or service or an increase in the level of any activity or service beyond that required by existing law shall not be required by the legislature or any state agency or units of Local Government, unless a state appropriation is made and disbursed to pay the unit of Local Government for any necessary increased costs. The provision of this section shall not apply to costs incurred pursuant to Article VI, Section 18. [Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">There is certainly nothing in the language to suggest to the reader that there is an exception for federal mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Nothing in \u00a7 29 relieves a local unit of government of its state-mandated duty to provide an activity, here special education, if federal law creates a similar obligation. The state statutes requiring special education, MCL 380.1701 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 15.41701 <em>et seq. </em>do not refer to, and are not dependent on, the corresponding federal law. If the federal government rescinded the idea, Michigan school districts would still have an obligation to provide special education under state law. These services are required <em>independently </em>by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">There are, moreover, three suggestions in the language of \u00a7 29 and other provisions of the Headlee Amendment that the voters did not intend an exception for federal mandates: (1) \u00a7 29 itself contains one exception to its coverage, costs pursuant to art 6, \u00a7 18 (on judicial salaries); (2) the revenue and tax limit on state government in \u00a7 26 is subject to three listed exclusions, \u201cfederal aid,\u201d \u201cprincipal and interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>on bonds,\u201d and \u201cloans to school districts\u201d;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and (3) the definition of total state revenues in \u00a7 33 is \u201call general and special revenues, excluding federal aid . It seems very unlikely that the voters would have thought that \u00a7 29 implied such a huge exception as one for federal mandates when the section specified only one very trivial exception (judicial salaries). It is even more unlikely that the voters would have thought the role of the federal government too obvious to mention in \u00a7 29, when the amendment mentions that very topic in \u00a7\u00a7 26 and 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">While defendants urge a federal-mandate exception only for \u00a7 29, that argument has further implications that provide insight. The rationale for having a federal-mandate exception would be that the state had no free choice in passing the parallel state mandate.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, there would be no reason not to apply that same rationale (1) on behalf of local governments who might seek to raise taxes without a vote of the people to pay for a federal or state mandate, contrary to the language of \u00a7 31, and (2) in favor of the state if it sought to exceed the tax and revenue limits of \u00a7 26 because of federal mandates. If there is one thing that is clear from the language of the Headlee Amendment and the historical context in which it was passed, it is that the voters intended to limit taxes. Thus, accepting defendants\u2019 argument here could eventually cause us to prune away the wide branches of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Headlee Amendment, until the taxpayers\u2019 sheltering oak was but a shrub.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Although of lesser import, we think the following three items suggest that a federal-mandate exception can only be found by a \u201cdark or abstruse\u201d reading of \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">First, in at least two other states where courts have considered whether special education is a state-mandated activity under constitutional limits that do not have an express federal limitation, the parties did not even think to argue for such an exception. One of these states, Missouri, has a tax-limitation provision modeled directly on our Headlee Amendment. See <em>Rolla 31 School Dist v Missouri, </em>837 SW2d 1 (Mo, 1992), <em>Fort Zumwalt School Dist v Missouri, </em>896 SW2d 918 (Mo, 1995), and <em>Worchester v Governor, </em>416 Mass 751; 625 NE2d 1337 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Second, defendants did not start arguing in favor of a federal-mandate exception until the hearings before Special Master Deneweth, eight years after the commencement of these proceedings.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> A meaning \u201cmost obvious to the common understanding\u201d would have certainly made its appearance before that. Before that time, defendants had stated to this Court that special education was a state-mandated activity under \u00a7 29. Also before that time, the Legislature had begun funding all the \u201cnecessary costs\u201d of local and intermediate school district compliance with revisions in the \u201cadministrative rules for special education,\u201d effective July 1, 1987. 1987 PA 220, subsection 51(3), MCL 388.1651(3); MSA 15.1919(951)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Third, the drafters\u2019 notes comment on whether there are exceptions to the Headlee requirements for federal mandates. Because the drafters\u2019 intent might have been different than the meaning given by the great mass of the people and the notes were published after passage of the amendment and were not available when the people voted, the notes are not authoritative. <em>Durant, supra, </em>424 Mich 382, n 12. They are one tool available to the courts. <em>Schmidt, supra, </em>441 Mich 257, n 24. In particular, the notes are one indication of a contemporaneous reading of the amendment. They state, with regard to \u00a7 29:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">It was the drafters\u2019 intent to include all necessary state mandated cost increases in this provision, including but not limited to: changes in general law which increase local governmental costs, e.g., increases in the state minimum wage law; changes in the civil and criminal statutes, e.g., mandatory sentencing; <em>federally encouraged changes in state law, e.g., unemployment compensation coverage; </em>collective bargaining or compulsory arbitration mandates, land use regulations, etc. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">With regard to \u00a7 26, the notes indicate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">Directly or indirectly federally mandated spending increases are not exempted from the provisions of this section. It is the concensus [sic] that any problems arising from such federal requirements would be cured later on by a federal tax limitation amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Both of these suggest the absence from \u00a7 29 of any exception for federal mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">H STATE MATCH SCHOOL LUNCH PAYMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">State law has long authorized local school districts to provide free and full-cost meals to students. 1927 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>PA 319, part 2, ch 5, \u00a7 6; 1929 CL 7424, now MCL 380.1272; MSA 15.41272. Since 1946, the federal government has provided financial aid for the national school lunch program, 42 USC 1751 <em>et seq. </em>Unlike the idea, the various permutations of the National School Lunch Act have not required that states, as a condition for receipt of federal funds, require that all local school districts participate in the federal program. It was not until 1977 PA 43, MCL 380.1272a through 380.1272d; MSA 15.41272(1) through 15.41272(4),<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> that the Michigan Legislature mandated that all K-12 school districts in Michigan operate a school lunch program<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> providing free and reduced price meals and meeting the nutritional standards of 42 USC 1758 beginning October 1, 1978.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Under MCL 380.1272d; MSA 15.41272(4), the state committed itself to pay each school district up to five cents for each free meal served and up to two cents for each reduced price meal served. Defendants refer to this as the \u201cstate supplemental payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Defendants admit that the school lunch program is mandated by state law within the meaning of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29, and they admit that they must continue the proportionate support of the state supplemental payments.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> They contend, however, that the state\u2019s obligation to maintain funding under art 9, \u00a7 29 does not extend to what is called \u201cthe state match payment.\u201d This payment can be traced back to \u00a7 7 of the National School Lunch Act, 42 USC 1756, which conditions federal grants to a state on that state supporting the program with a match equal to at least thirty percent of the prior year\u2019s federal grant to that state.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Defendants argue that the school districts voluntarily participate in the federal school lunch program, in the sense that they do not have to apply for and receive federal funds. They receive the state match payment only because they choose to accept federal funds. Defendants note that the amount of the state match payment is fixed and required by federal law and not subject to state control. Defendants argue that federal programs are not required by state law and are not activities or services within the meaning of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29, citing <em>Schmidt, supra, </em>441 Mich 262. They argue that, implicit in the requirement of art 9, \u00a7 29 that the state maintain the \u201cstate financed proportion\u201d is the assumption that the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>chose to make the payment to the local unit and had control over the amount and manner of distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">We reject defendants\u2019 arguments. We have already concluded that there is no exception in art 9, \u00a7 29 for federal mandates, as long as the activity or service is mandated by state law.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Even if there were such an exception, we would not find a federal mandate here, because the National School Lunch Act does not require that all local school districts in a state participate in the program in order for the state and participating districts to receive federal aid. Indeed, defendants do not contend that the National School Lunch Act constitutes a federal mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">In applying the provision to the school lunch program, there are two questions. First, is school lunch an activity or service mandated by state law? Defendants admit it is. MCL 380.1272a; MSA 15.41272(1). Second, is the state match payment part of the state-financed proportion of necessary costs? It is obvious that it is. Defendants make no argument that plaintiff school districts have not used the state match pay-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>merits to help meet the necessary costs of the school lunch program.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The defendants are really asking us to create an exception to art 9, \u00a7 29 for instances where the state did not \u201cchoose to make the payment to the local unit in the first instance and [does not have] the ability to control the amount and manner of distribution of the payment in subsequent years.\u201d This argument fails for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">First and most important, no such exception is apparent in art 9, \u00a7 29. The language focuses on one act of state decision making: the decision of the state to mandate an activity. In this case, the state chose to make the former option of local districts to provide a school lunch program into a mandate that, by coincidence, took effect only thirty-eight days before the election at which the people adopted the Headlee Amendment. The state could have, and still can, return to the local districts the option to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Second, once the people adopted Headlee, the state lost direct control over the amount of all Headleerequired aid to local units of government. The state lost its freedom to reduce aid below the base-year proportion. This was the clear intent of art 9, \u00a7\u00a7 29 and 30. Section 29 requires that the state maintain its proportionate financing for the necessary costs of a state-mandated activity. If these criteria are met, it does not matter that a portion of the base-year aid was designed to maximize the benefits of a local district\u2019s voluntary choice to receive federal aid. The \u201cstate match\u201d payment was part of \u201cthe state financed proportion of the necessary costs\u201d of the state-mandated lunch program in 1978-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Defendants argue that the state match payment has made well in excess of $100,000,000 a year in federal funds available to local school districts without any increase in costs to the local districts. Defendants argue that treating the state\u2019s cost in obtaining this benefit turns art 9, \u00a7 29 on its head and is irrational. We think that defendants are confusing the merits of the state match program with the requirements of art 9, \u00a7 29. Nothing in the constitutional provision addresses the merits of the state-mandated programs. The amendment leaves to the state the ability to adopt or continue those state mandates that the state deems meritorious, on condition that the state bear the necessary costs of new programs and maintain its support of continuing programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">m. EXECUTIVE ORDER REDUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Defendants argue that state payments required by art 9, \u00a7 29 are subject to reduction under art 5, \u00a7 20, which provides:<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">No appropriation shall be a mandate to spend. The governor, with the approval of the appropriating committees of the house and senate, shall reduce expenditures authorized by appropriations whenever it appears that actual revenues for a fiscal period will fall below the revenue estimates on which appropriations for that period were based. Reductions in expenditures shall be made in accordance with procedures prescribed by law. <em>The governor may not reduce </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>expenditures of the legislative and judicial branches or from funds constitutionally dedicated for specific purposes. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Plaintiffs argue that art 9, \u00a7 29 moneys are \u201cfunds constitutionally dedicated for specific purposes\u201d within the meaning of the language emphasized above. Defendants argue that the passage refers to funds specially earmarked by the constitution, such as the one percent of the payroll of the classified service that art 11, \u00a7 5 requires be appropriated for use by the Civil Service Commission and the fuel taxes that art 9, \u00a7 9 requires be used for various transportation purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">We agree with plaintiffs. Art 5, \u00a7 20 does not use \u201cfunds\u201d in a technical sense. The two constitutional provisions cited by defendants as creating protected funds do not use the word \u201cfund.\u201d Art 9, \u00a7 9 refers to certain tax revenues; art 11, \u00a7 5 requires appropriation of a \u201csum.\u201d All that is required by art 5, \u00a7 20 is that the funds be \u201cconstitutionally dedicated for specific purposes.\u201d The funding required by art 9, \u00a7 29 is dedicated for the purpose of fulfilling the state\u2019s obligation to support state-mandated activities and services.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Defendants imply that the state\u2019s ability to deal with impending deficits will be impeded by this aspect of today\u2019s decision and that it will force the state to impose educational cuts most heavily on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>districts that are least able to afford it, because those are the districts who receive unrestricted aid not protected by art 9, \u00a7 29. The latter portion of this is outdated in light of the substantial reform in school financing made by adoption of Proposal A at the general election on March 15, 1994, amending art 9, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 5, 8, and 11. The rest of the argument is answered by the fact that the state would be free to reduce or eliminate state mandates and, thus, reduce its obligations under art 9, \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">IV. ATTORNEY fees</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Defendant argues that the Court of Appeals erred when it concluded that attorney fees are included in \u201ccosts\u201d recoverable by a successful taxpayer in a suit under art 9, \u00a7 32:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">Any taxpayer of the state shall have standing to bring suit in the Michigan State Court of Appeals to enforce the provisions of Sections 25 through 31, inclusive, of this Article and, if the suit is sustained, shall receive from the applicable unit of government his costs incurred in maintaining such suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">We have recently addressed this question in <em>Macomb Co Taxpayers Ass\u2019n v L'Anse Creuse Public Schools, </em>455 Mich 1; 564 NW2d 457 (1997). For the reasons stated there, we affirm the award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">We note that plaintiffs submitted their claim for costs before the Special Master. Defendants disputed whether all the costs were incurred regarding matters on which plaintiffs\u2019 suit was \u201csustained.\u201d The Special Master issued a decision with regard to all cost issues up to the date of his decision, June 16, 1995. The decision gave substantial relief to defendants on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>issue raised. We further note that defendants did not appeal that recommendation in the Court of Appeals or here. We regard that amount as finally resolved. Costs incurred after June 16, 1995, remain open.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">V. REMEDY</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">This is the first case of underfunding under art 9, \u00a7 29 to come to judgment. After oral argument, we directed the parties to brief questions related to the remedy. Having received and considered the briefs of the parties and amici curiae, we are convinced that the correct remedy is not full compensatory damages for underfunding for the plaintiff school districts, the basis of the Court of Appeals judgment. While we anticipate that monetary relief typically will not be necessary in future \u00a7 29 cases, defendants\u2019 prolonged recalcitrance in this case necessitates a substantial recovery aimed primarily at providing a remedy for the harm caused by underfunding.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">We begin, as always, with the words of the constitution, in this case, art 9, \u00a7 32:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">Any taxpayer of the state shall have standing to bring suit in the Michigan State Court of Appeals to enforce the provisions of Sections 25 through 31, inclusive, of this Article and, if the suit is sustained, shall receive from the applicable unit of government his costs incurred in maintaining such suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">The question is what did the great mass of the people intend in directing the Court of Appeals \u201cto enforce\u201d \u00a7 29. While we must answer this question from the perspective of the voters in 1978, we would be foolish if we did not keep in mind all the questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>that this Court and the Court of Appeals have had to address and resolve in reaching the point of judgment. See \u201cHistory of Proceedings\u201d above and the prior decisions in this case. For instance, it would be a fiction to say that the great mass of the people anticipated use of special masters to enable the Court of Appeals to act as a trial court or that the people had in mind the <em>Schmidt </em>formula as the way to alleviate idiosyncratic differences in state funding of the same activity in different school districts. We conclude that the people\u2019s directive \u201cto enforce\u201d \u00a7 29 was intended as a general directive, giving the Court the duty and authority to enforce \u00a7 29 in the way that would most effectuate the balances struck by the people in the Headlee Amendment.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We have followed that directive in the past and now must apply it to the remedy in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Art 9, \u00a7 32 authorizes taxpayers to file suit in the Court of Appeals to enforce the provisions of \u00a7 29. As arduous as the proceedings in this case have been, we have succeeded in deciding many points of law that will guide future decisions. Thus, there is every reason to hope that future cases will be much more straightforward. We anticipate that taxpayer cases filed in the Court of Appeals<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> will proceed to rapid decision on the issue whether the state has an obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>tion under art 9, \u00a7 29 to fund an activity or service. The Court of Appeals would give declaratory judgment on the obligation of the state. If there was such an obligation, we anticipate that the state would either comply with that obligation no later than the next ensuing fiscal year, unless it could obtain a stay from this Court, or remove the mandate. In such an instance, we anticipate that the obligation of the Court to enforce \u00a7 29 would not include any grant of money damages. This is not such a case. We turn to the proper remedy in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Declaratory relief coupled with an award of damages is appropriate in this case as a result of the prolonged \u201crecalcitrance\u201d of the defendants, and the damage award can, on this basis, be limited to the years 1991-1994.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Any other remedy, particularly one that would grant declaratory relief alone, would authorize the state to violate constitutional mandates with little or no consequence. The intent of the people in enacting art 9, \u00a7 32 of the Michigan Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>tion was not to enact a constitutional provision that could not be effectively enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The enactment of art 9, \u00a7 29 evidenced an intent on the part of the electorate to limit the Legislature\u2019s ability to shift funding obligations for state-mandated services from the state to local government, after state revenues were limited by the Headlee Amendment, in an effort to save the state money it would otherwise have been obligated to expend. <em>Durant, supra, </em>424 Mich 379. One of several implementing acts under the general provision of art 9, \u00a7 25,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> \u00a7 29 of the Headlee Amendment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by-state law. A new activity or service or an increase in the level of any activity or service beyond that required by existing law shall not be required by the legislature or any state agency of units of Local Government, unless a state appropriation is made and disbursed to pay the unit of Local Government for any necessary increased costs. The provision of this section shall not apply to costs incurred pursuant to Article VI, Section 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Although a remedy was not established under the express provisions of \u00a7 29, the need for a remedy for harm occasioned by a violation of \u00a7 29 was indeed considered and approved by the public by way of art 9, \u00a7 32. In accordance with that provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">Any taxpayer of the state shall have standing to bring suit in the Michigan State Court of Appeals to enforce the provisions of Sections 25 through 31, inclusive, of this Article and, if the suit is sustained, shall receive from the applicable unit of government his costs incurred in maintaining such suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">By authorizing the Court of Appeals to \u201cenforce\u201d the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 25 through 31, the people meant to authorize monetary damages when damages would be necessary to enforce compliance. The common understanding of the term \u201cenforce\u201d is \u201c[t]o compel observance of or obedience to . . . [to] reinforce; to make strong.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary: Second College Edition </em>(1982). A constitution is made of the people, by the people, and for the people; \u201c \u2018[t]he interpretation that should be given it is that which reasonable minds, the great mass of the people themselves, would give it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Traverse City School Dist, supra </em>at 405. The term \u201cenforce\u201d would be interpreted by the mass of people to require a remedy that would \u201ccompel observance of or obedience to\u201d the constitutional mandate. Simply put, if declaratory relief is not sufficient to compel obedience to the constitutional mandate, and it was not in the present case, then the electorate has authorized that additional relief be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Even if one departs from the common understanding of the people and examines declaratory judgment as practiced in the courts, the result is the same: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>declaratory judgment actions can result in monetary relief. Actions for declaratory relief are intended to minimize avoidable losses and the unnecessary accrual of damages.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> MCR 2.605 authorizes declaratory relief where other relief is also available. \u201cThe existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a judgment for declaratory relief in an appropriate case.\u201d MCR 2.605(C). MCR 2.605(F) provides that \u201c[f]urther necessary or proper relief based on a declaratory judgment may be granted, after reasonable notice and hearing, against a party whose rights have been determined by the declaratory judgment.\u201d The choice to use declaratory relief is discretionary, yet declaratory relief is cumulative relief, not intended to be exclusive or extraordinary.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The Michigan Court Rules contemplate that, after entry of a judgment for declaratory relief, additional relief may be granted if necessary or proper, against any party whose rights were determined by the declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> As provided by MCR 2.605(F), reasonable notice and a hearing are necessary for the granting of additional relief. Parties to this case have had both reasonable notice and a hearing on the issue of rem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>edy,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and there is no reason to limit the remedy to declaratory relief alone. Given the facts of this case, the people who enacted this amendment would conclude that to require only declaratory relief would be to negate, rather than effectuate, the protection intended by \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Having concluded that damages are not precluded where declaratory relief is used, we farther conclude that the instant case is one in which damages are \u201cnecessary or proper.\u201d The prolonged \u201crecalcitrance\u201d of the state in shirking its obligations to fund state-mandated services clearly cannot be cured by declaratory relief alone. Had it been possible to resolve this issue by declaratory judgment, the state would have funded the services in question after the 1990 Court of Appeals decision, while at the same time seeking a declaratory judgment from this Court on its continuing obligation under the Headlee Amendment to fund those services.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Having chosen instead to ignore the Court of Appeals ruling, we see no choice but to award damages against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>To deny monetary relief here might provide incentive for protracted litigation in the future. Here, defendants did not interject the issue on which most of the damages turned (special education, issue i) until eight years into the litigation.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The argument, when raised, contradicted prior statements by defendants (that special education was a state mandated activity under Headlee). The argument was not based on the language of Headlee. When the Court of Appeals resolved that issue against defendants, defendants declined to honor the Court of Appeals decision for almost seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">We now turn to the question of who should receive the judgment. The Headlee Amendment is a taxpayers\u2019 amendment. Art 9, \u00a7 29 was adopted to allow local taxpayers freedom from constant pressure to approve increases in local property taxes to pay for activities forced on local units of government by the state government and the benefit of local government discretion on how to spend local tax revenues. Instead of having that freedom, plaintiff taxpayers had to dedicate literally hundreds of millions of dol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>lars<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> of local tax revenues from 1979-80, the first year Headlee was in effect, until 1994-95. Then, in the aftermath of the people\u2019s approval of Proposal A,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> the Legislature overhauled the method of financing schools to substantially reduce dependence on local taxation.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> This shift substantially reduced the pressure on local taxpayers to make up for state underfunding of mandated activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">To deny taxpayers relief would be to deny the reality that they have suffered real dollar losses throughout this protracted litigation. It would also ignore that, where the Headlee Amendment anticipated specific compliance problems, it provides specific relief for the taxpayers.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">While the Headlee Amendment is a taxpayers\u2019 amendment, the requirement of \u00a7 29 adopted by the people does not directly mention the taxpayers. It directly protects the units of local government. It serves the overall purpose of the people by protecting units of local government from actions of the state government in foisting underfunded and unfunded mandates on local government, thus frustrating local discretion over local tax revenues. In this case, the underfunding certainly affected the level of regular educational services that the locally elected and, until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>1994, mostly locally funded boards of education could provide to all current students and many who have graduated or dropped out over the last almost two decades. Local boards have been faced with a dizzying variety of choices on how to deal with underfunding and rising costs. Many, perhaps most, districts have had larger class sizes. Others have dropped programs such as elementary music. Perhaps none have had as much access to computer equipment as they would have liked. Many may have had no money for targeting and helping potential dropouts. The potential list is endless. While there is no way at this remove to compute with exactitude the number of sacrifices suffered by the general education population, we are sure that the sacrifice has been significant and its effect continuing. These students, no less than taxpayers have suffered the adverse consequence of defendants\u2019 underfunding.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">While we conclude that plaintiffs must be given some relief in this case, we also conclude that affirming the full judgment of the Court of Appeals would be inconsistent with the balances struck by the Headlee Amendment and by Proposal A. Any judgment would be paid out of state funds, collected from state taxpayers. The taxpayers of the eighty-four districts represented by plaintiff taxpayers are, in turn, state taxpayers. State taxpayers were also to be protected by provisions of the Headlee Amendment, albeit not \u00a7 29. There is a point at which granting more relief to the local taxpayers creates more potential for harm to the state taxpayers than it would provide additional benefit to the local taxpayers. Our aim is to give the local taxpayers and students meaningful redress (to \u201cenforce\u201d \u00a7 29) without undermining the current security enjoyed by the state taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">We affirm that portion of the Court of Appeals judgment that awards money damages, without interest,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> to plaintiff school districts for the full amount of underfunding to each district during 1991-92, 1992-93, and 1993-94.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> We conclude that any award of damages should be distributed to the plaintiff school districts and apportioned to taxpayers within each district, if appropriate. Unlike the dissenters, who express concern over awarding monetary relief to taxpayers, we are not concerned that taxpayers are not appropriate parties to receive an award. Headlee is fundamentally a taxpayers\u2019 amendment, enacted for the primary purpose of relieving the electorate from overwhelming and overreaching taxation. Who better to receive a monetary award than those who the amendment was enacted to protect?</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Although we have no concern regarding the correctness of awarding damages to the taxpayer, we stop short of ordering any particular method of distribution because each of the affected districts and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>respective taxpayers have sustained discrete harms that are beyond the capability of the Court to evaluate. Instead, we award damages to the plaintiff school districts with the expectation that the democratic process will inform and shape distribution of the award. In so doing, each board of education will exercise its discretion to determine and tailor its award in a manner that best fits the needs of its constituents. Appropriate remedies include, but are not limited to, distributing the award to taxpayers in relation to the amount of increased taxes they paid during 1991-92, 1992-93, and 1993-94 as a result of the increase in millage over base year 1978-79, due to underfunding, distributing the award to all property-owning taxpayers, to all local taxpayers, or use of the award by the district for other public purposes. We have full confidence that the checks and balances of democratic decision making in each local unit of government will effectively assess the harm to be redressed and the method of addressing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Justice Brickley makes a number of thoughtful points in his dissent from our decision to award money damages in this case which deserve a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The dissent accurately notes that \u00a7 29 does not specify the remedy for a violation of its requirements. Rather, \u00a7 32 provides the remedy that the courts \u201cenforce\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 25 through 31. It states that the ordinary person would read \u201cto enforce\u201d in the context of \u00a7 29 as conferring authority on the court to order the state to fund the activity in the future or to enjoin the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>from requiring the local unit of government to provide the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">We think this analysis unnecessarily focuses the question of the scope of enforcement under \u00a7 32 on problems which might arise under \u00a7 29. The ordinary person reading \u00a7 32 would view a broader range of measures appropriate to the wide range of possible violations of \u00a7\u00a7 25 through 31. A good example is found in the suit involved in <em>TACT v Wayne Co, </em>450 Mich 119; 537 NW2d 596 (1995). There, the defendant increased its real estate transfer tax without a vote of the people. Plaintiff paid the increased tax when selling property and later filed a class action for declaratory and injunctive relief as well as refunds. The question before this Court concerned the application of the one year period of limitation, MCL 600.308a; MSA 27A.308(1), not the propriety of a refund. Nonetheless, the obvious merit of that remedy led us to conclude, \u201cTaxpayers may sue for a refund within one year of the date the tax was assessed.\u201d 450 Mich 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The point is that \u00a7 32 does not mention a refund for taxes unconstitutionally collected under \u00a7 31. Yet the remedy of a refund is so obvious that the ordinary person would say that, without such a remedy, the court would not be enforcing \u00a7 31. We continue to be of the belief that the command of \u00a7 32 is general and empowering and contemplates a money judgment where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The dissent also cites the Missouri case, <em>Fort Zumwalt, </em>as support and we do not dispute that there is some support for the partial dissent there. We note, however, that the dissent significantly disagrees with <em>Fort Zumwalt. </em>The partial dissent is willing to issue an order to the state to fund the activity in question. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>The Missouri court was only willing to free the local unit of government from the duty to obey the state mandate. While this might be effective relief for new mandates, it would hardly be practicable in the case of a continuing mandate such as special education where the school districts are under contract with thousands of staff, have massive capital investments and have established portions of the student body relying on the continuity of services.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In replying to our opinion, the dissent indicates that the people ratifying the Headlee Amendment would have anticipated situations, under \u00a7 29, when the state might pass a new mandate without funding or reduce funding for an existing mandate and that the people would have further anticipated an expeditious order to end the violation. Again, we have no disagreement with the basic point. For that reason, we do not foresee a likely need for money relief for cases filed in the future. However, what happened here was not one of the situations which the people may have anticipated. Here, the state interposed a new legal argument eight years into the litigation and refused to abide by rapid rejections of that argument by the Special Master and Court of Appeals. The question is not so much what violations the people might have anticipated, but whether the people intended the court to provide a remedy when things did not go as anticipated. We think the people\u2019s use of the emphatic word \u201cenforce\u201d shows their intent that the courts provide effective remedies for unanticipated as well as anticipated problems.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Our remedy here, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>being idiosyncratic, is tailored to fit what we hope is a very unusual violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The dissent observes, accurately, that the remedy in this case has been fashioned, in part, because the state has been derelict for so long in its duty. The history of defendants\u2019 conduct justifies the conclusion that the state has been derelict too long. Not only did defendants argue to this Court in 1985 that we ought to hold that \u00a7 29 applied to specific activities like special education (in order to escape a larger burden for education as a whole) but, having received the favorable response on the larger burden, they reversed their position on special education. Even when defendants got a ruling from the Court of Appeals on the special education issue fairly promptly after defendants first raised it, defendants did not comply with that ruling, insisting on a ruling by this Court. While the pendency of appeals and further trial proceedings to establish the amount of injury gave defendants an opportunity to take the risk that we might eventually take the case and reverse the Court of Appeals, the cost of that risk and the cost of noncompliance should be borne by defendants. Defendants\u2019 ignoring the existence of the Court of Appeals ruling through the last seven years while technically not contemptuous, surely falls short of the respect we should demand for that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The dissent argues that the appropriate response is political, not judicial. The suggestion that the appropriate response is political ignores both the fact that the state\u2019s dereliction has persisted through three administrations and the fact that the people have directly ordered the courts to enforce \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>The dissent notes, with some eloquence, the tension that flows from the fact that local taxpayers are also state taxpayers. It is this tension that has caused us to conclude that we should not affirm the entire judgment of the Court of Appeals that would be approaching $800,000,000.00. Instead, we limit the award to an amount which should be slightly over a quarter of that. What the dissent fails to acknowledge is that tension is created by the opposition of two forces. In trying to accommodate the interests of state taxpayers, it forfeits completely the interests of the local taxpayers and their local government, as if it were advising a holder of a mutual insurance policy not to file a claim because it would reduce the worth of the insured\u2019s interest in the company. Given the amounts involved, our judgment is sufficient to give meaningful recovery to plaintiffs without adding costs for individual state taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The dissent argues that the Court may do no more than interpret the law and we \u201cmust presume that the other branches of government, once informed of their constitutional duties, will execute them to the letter and the spirit of the law.\u201d We reply that \u00a7 32 requires that we \u201cenforce\u201d \u2014 not just interpret \u2014 \u00a7 29. We note that defendants were fully aware of their constitutional duties in 1985 when they advised us that special education is a mandated service within the meaning of \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The dissent minimizes the continuing effect that underfunding has on the continuing operation of plaintiff school districts, while it acknowledges that regular education programs have probably been reduced to divert local resources to cover the state underfunding. All students in plaintiff school dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>tricts have, for their entire careers as students, been potentially subject to innumerable consequences of local budgetary constraints, such as: larger class sizes, decreased access to librarians, loss of enrichment programs, use of outdated books and archaic physical plants and delays in purchase of new equipment, for instance computers. While we can no more quantify the dollar value of these losses than we can give an objective figure to recompense the loss of an arm, we regard this harm as real and deserving of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The dissent argues, \u201cAlthough taxpayers may have had their millage increased at a local level, all Michigan taxpayers benefited from lower state taxes made possible, in part, by the state\u2019s declining responsibility for special education costs.\u201d Thus, \u201ctaxpayers did not necessarily suffer \u2018real dollar losses.\u2019 \u201d This argument is no more than a judicial disagreement with the electorate over the validity of the policy behind \u00a7 29. In \u00a7 29, the people have said that shifting of the tax burden to local taxpayers is a matter of constitutional dimension; it is banned; and, through \u00a7 32, the ban must be enforced. The people having spoken through their constitution, the policy debate is no longer open.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Lastly, the dissent indicates that \u201cthe local taxpayer would not want this kind of relief.\u201d We believe the taxpayers would appreciate relief both in the form of a direct benefit to plaintiffs and, as the electorate which adopted Headlee, with the courts\u2019 willingness to abide by the direction to enforce \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>F</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">We are acutely conscious of the limitations of judicial competence in developing workable standards to regulate government conduct. We acknowledge also that the Legislature, no less than this Court, interprets the document that binds both institutions and is obligated and entitled to make its own good faith judgments regarding the implications of the Headlee Amendment when enacting policy as the people\u2019s representatives. However, for the reasons stated above, we find the only viable remedy to be one that awards declaratory relief coupled with monetary damages for the years 1991-1994. In this way, \u201cthe great mass of people\u201d will be better assured that the Court effectively \u201cenforced\u201d the provisions of art 9, \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">213 Mich App 500 affirmed except as to remedy; remedy affirmed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b547-6\">Mallett, C.J., and Cavanagh, Boyle, and Kelly, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-10\"> <em>The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law. </em>A new activity or service or an increase in the level of any activity or service beyond that required by existing law shall not be required by the legislature or any state agency of units of Local Government, unless a state appropriation is made and disbursed to pay the unit of Local Government for any necessary increased costs.

However, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision in part v regarding the remedy it contends is authorized by the Michigan Constitution under art 9, \u00a7 32. Although I appreciate the appeal of awarding financial relief to the school districts for the amount of the state\u2019s shortfall from fiscal years 1991-92, 1992-93, and 1993-94, I do not believe that we have the power to create this solution under art 9, \u00a7 32.1 would apply the provision as written and order the state of Michigan henceforth to meet its financial obligations under art 9, \u00a7 29 by paying its proportionate share of the cost for special edu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>cation and for the state lunch program. This Court does not have authority to order monetary damages for a violation of \u00a7 29 of the Headlee Amendment because \u00a7 32, the enforcement provision, only gives the courts authority to order declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">I. REMEDY FOR A VIOLATION OF ART 9, \u00a7 29</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The people enacted art 9, \u00a7 29 to forestall any attempt by the Legislature to shift financial responsibility for services to the local government once the state\u2019s revenues were limited by other provisions of the Headlee Amendment. <em>Durant v State Bd of Ed, </em>424 Mich 364, 379; 381 NW2d 662 (1985). Section 29 provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law. A new activity or service or an increase in the level of any activity or service beyond that required by existing law shall not be required by the legislature or any state agency of units of Local Government, unless a state appropriation is made and disbursed to pay the unit of Local Government for any necessary increased costs. The provision of this section shall not apply to costs incurred pursuant to Article VI, Section 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Examined by itself, this section only describes the obligations of the state for financing new and existing services that it mandates. There is no description in \u00a7 29 of a remedy for a violation of these obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">The purposes of this section are vindicated by the general enforcement provision, art 9, \u00a7 32, which provides a general statement regarding the implementation of the different sections of the Headlee Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ment, \u00a7\u00a725 through 31. Section 32 of art 9 states in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">Any taxpayer of the state shall have standing to bring suit in the Michigan State Court of Appeals to enforce the provisions of Sections 25 through 31, inclusive, of this Article and, if the suit is sustained, shall receive from the applicable unit of government his costs incurred in maintaining such suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Section 32 does not anticipate that the Court will order the state, under art 9, \u00a7 29, to pay a school district, or the taxpayers of that school district, the cost of complying with a state mandate from past years. Rather, the provision only appears to contemplate the fact that the Court will issue an order directing the state to pay its proportionate share of the necessary costs of the state-mandated activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">This conclusion is not only supported by the language of the amendment, but also by the fact that the people expressly included a financial remedy in a different provision, \u00a7 26. Section 26 creates a ceiling for the level of taxes the state may impose by limiting the total revenue the state may generate. In \u00a7 26, the people established a <em>refund </em>in the event that the state exceeded its revenue limit by more than one percent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">For any fiscal year in the event that Total State Revenues exceed the revenue limit established in this section by 1% or more, <em>the excess revenues shall be refunded pro rata </em>based on the liability reported on the Michigan income tax and single business tax (or its successor tax or taxes) annual returns filed following the close of such fiscal year. If the excess is less than 1%, this excess may be transferred to the State Budget Stabilization Fund. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Similarly, \u00a7 29 could have included a guarantee for monetary relief for the taxpayer if the state failed to pay for its mandated services. There is a maxim of construction that <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>or, in other words, the express mention of one thing implies the exclusion of similar things. <em>Jennings v Southwood, </em>446 Mich 125, 142; 521 NW2d 230 (1994). The fact that the people included a revenue refund for a violation of \u00a7 26, but not for \u00a7 29, indicates that the people did not envision monetary relief for a violation of \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">This conclusion is further supported by the analysis of the Missouri Supreme Court in addressing the same issue under its constitutional amendments. See <em>Fort Zumwalt School Dist v Missouri, </em>896 SW2d 918 (Mo, 1995). The state of Missouri adopted the virtually identical reform of its tax system in its constitution in 1980 on the basis of Michigan\u2019s Headlee Amendment. We directed the parties in our June 10, 1997, order to provide further briefing on the issue of remedy, including the issue whether declaratory relief was the appropriate relief as in <em>Fort Zumwalt. </em>The Missouri Supreme Court examined a case in which the state of Missouri had failed to provide funding for special education services (a state-mandated service) and concluded that the state was protected by sovereign immunity because its enforcement provision, art X, \u00a7 23 (the parallel to Michigan\u2019s art 9, \u00a7 32), did not authorize money damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">Article X, Section 23, authorizes taxpayer suits to enforce the provisions of Section 21 [parallel to Michigan\u2019s art 9, \u00a7 29] without saying what remedies are available other than attorneys fees and costs. If Section 23 is a consent by the state to be sued for general money damages to enforce Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>tion 21, the consent exists by way of inference or implication. This Court will not infer or imply that a waiver of sovereign immunity extends to remedies that are not essential to enforce the right in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">Other equally effective but less onerous remedies than permitting a money judgment against the state are available to enforce a taxpayer\u2019s interests under Section 21. Specifically, a declaratory judgment relieving a local government of the duty to perform an inadequately funded required service or activity is an adequate remedy. <em>[Fort Zumwalt, supra </em>at 923.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">I agree with the basic point. There are other less onerous remedies available to the plaintiff school districts. We should not conclude that there is a grant of authority to bring an action for monetary damages against the state of Michigan without an express statement by the people or Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">n. THE MAJORITY\u2019S DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">The majority has drawn a different conclusion in the instant case, reasoning that an ordinary person would understand \u00a7 32\u2019s directive to enforce \u00a7 29 as giving the Court \u201cthe duty and authority to enforce \u00a7 29 in the way that would most effectuate the balances struck by the people in the Headlee Amendment.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 205. I disagree with this basic point because it is unclear what the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u201cenforce\u201d means. Through this vague understanding of \u201cenforce,\u201d the majority has created a license to fashion any remedy that it deems fit. I am convinced that the ordinary person would understand \u00a7 32 to only confer authority on the courts to provide declaratory relief for a violation of \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">The people ratifying these amendments, in my opinion, likely believed that it would be easy to identify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>when the state either (1) enacted a new program but failed to provide for the funding or (2) reduced funding for an existing state-mandated service, and that the courts would then expeditiously order the end of the violation. Hence, with this understanding, there would be no reason to provide for monetary damages because there would not be a situation in which the state had failed to comply in past years. The drafters of the Headlee Amendment, and the people ratifying it, did not likely anticipate that it would take seventeen years for this Court to issue a definitive ruling on the amendment\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In reaching its conclusion, the majority has not attempted to root its pragmatic decision in the amendment. The majority has limited the relief to three years, 1991-92, 1992-93, and 1993-94. The Court awards a money judgment to the school districts to use for refunds to the taxpayers, tax relief, or other public purposes. This effectively gives the school districts complete discretion in deciding how to use the funds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This Court has not been empowered, in my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>opinion, to create this novel solution. By virtue of the fact that the majority apparently only intends to apply this ruling to plaintiffs in this controversy, the majority reveals the idiosyncratic nature of its decision. The majority has improperly arrogated to itself the power to fashion what it believes to be a fair remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Moreover, I am not persuaded that the result is consistent with the basic point of the Headlee Amendment, which is to provide relief for taxpayers. See <em>Durant, supra </em>at 378. The majority has indicated that it anticipates that this monetary relief \u201ctypically will not be necessary in future \u00a7 29 cases.\u201d See <em>ante, </em>p 204. In other words, these eighty-four school districts will receive the benefit of a monetary damage award for the underfunding for these three years but no other school districts will. This relief will come from the state, and, thereby, it will come from all the taxpayers of the state. In other words, the practical effect of this relief is to give these school districts relief at the expense of the taxpayers of the rest of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The majority\u2019s decision to only give tax relief to these taxpayers suggests to me that the majority is really punishing the state of Michigan for its dereliction in failing to meet its obligations. See <em>ante, </em>p 204. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Although I believe that the state must meet its constitutional duties, if there is a fear that the state may fail to comply in the future because we are only able to give declaratory relief, I believe that the appropriate response is political, not judicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The sad irony of this final chapter in the <em>Durant </em>saga is that the result of the \u201ctaxpayers revolt\u201d \u2014 the 1978 Headlee Amendment \u2014 is an award of damages against the taxpayers of Michigan. Whether the Court awards damages to the school districts, local taxpayers, or both, state taxpayers will ultimately foot the bill. The magnitude of the Court\u2019s judgment is staggering. The Court awards $211 million to the plaintiff school districts. And yet, not even a single child has claimed to have been denied special education services during the pendency of this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Although I acknowledge the state\u2019s \u201cprolonged recalcitrance\u201d in resolving this matter, it hardly justifies foisting what may be the largest damage award in state history upon the very parties \u2014 taxpayers\u2014that the Headlee Amendment was intended to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The Court\u2019s award of damages rests uneasily on the following two arguments. The first is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">[t]o deny taxpayers relief would be to deny the reality that they have suffered <em>real dollar losses </em>throughout this protracted litigation. <em>[Ante, </em>p 212 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">With the best of intentions, the Court aspires to give relief to taxpayers for their \u201creal dollar losses.\u201d However, this justification overlooks one simple fact: local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>taxpayers are state taxpayers. A damage award against the state is a damage award against the state taxpayer. Contrary to the majority\u2019s apparent belief, taxpayers cannot be compensated by making them pay money to themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The same principle that explains why a damage award against the state cannot give taxpayer relief\u2014 local taxpayers are state taxpayers \u2014 also suggests another fact. State taxpayers benefited from the state\u2019s ability to shift special education expenses to the local level. In other words, even though a taxpayer\u2019s local millage may have risen, that taxpayer was also enjoying the benefits of reduced state spending, which resulted in a lower state tax burden. Thus, as the local tax burden rose, the corresponding state tax burden fell. Therefore, it would appear that the net effect of declining state special education funding on taxpayers was neutral. Accordingly, the majority\u2019s reliance on the \u201creal dollar losses\u201d of local taxpayers is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The majority\u2019s second reason for requiring the taxpayers to, in effect, pay for special education twice is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">[t]o deny monetary relief here might provide incentive for protracted litigation in the future. <em>[Ante, </em>p 210.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">This argument assumes that it is the Court\u2019s role to remove \u201cincentives\u201d for protracted litigation on the part of the state. The Court\u2019s place is to interpret the law, not to guide, control, or direct the activities of the other branches of government. We must presume that the other branches of government, once informed of their constitutional duties, will execute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>them to the letter and spirit of the law. In the unfortunate event that they choose to diverge from their explicit constitutional obligations, the remedy must be political, not judicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Further, in its attempt to exact a penalty from the state for its transgressions, the Court inadvertently punishes the taxpayer, the party who will ultimately pay the bill in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The school districts\u2019 claim to damages is unconvincing because the school districts exist in a representative capacity, acting on behalf of local taxpayers and students. Because a school district stands in relation to the state as does a subsidiary to its parent corporation, it does not have an inherent right to damages. Its claim to damages can only be as worthy as that of whom it represents, the students and the taxpayers. For divergent reasons, neither of these groups warrants financial relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The students can be organized into two groups on the basis of the educational services they received\u2014 special education and general education. Special education students were not affected by reduced state funding because each of the school districts made accommodations in other areas to ensure that special education programs met state requirements. For example, the school districts may have increased local millages or cut other programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">General education programs, on the other hand, may have suffered cutbacks resulting from the shifting of resources from general education to special education. In such cases, however, it is impossible to unring the bell, given the passage of time. Those general education students who were affected have moved ahead to the next grade, and many have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>graduated. Indeed, many of these new graduates will be helping to pay for the state\u2019s \u201cprolonged recalcitrance.\u201d Notwithstanding the folly of trying to estimate the value of such damages, retroactive damages simply cannot replace a missed educational opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Thus, the school districts can have no claim to damages through the taxpayers they represent. Although taxpayers may have had their millages increased at a local level, all Michigan taxpayers benefited from lower state taxes made possible, in part, by the state\u2019s declining responsibility for special education costs. Consequently, as discussed above, taxpayers did not necessarily suffer \u201creal dollar losses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Michigan voters, through their elected representatives, have chosen to maintain a system of special education that is a model for the rest of the country. By deciding to have such an exemplary program, the citizens of this state also agreed to pay for it. That the money for special education came from the average citizen\u2019s \u201cproperty tax pocket,\u201d as opposed to his \u201cstate income tax pocket,\u201d makes little difference to his net worth. The reality is that the programs were paid for once, albeit not at the constitutionally prescribed level of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">It is undisputed that those programs were maintained during the pendency of this lawsuit. Local taxpayers paid for them, either through higher local taxes or reduced regular education programs. Awarding damages to the school districts asks the taxpayers to pay for those programs a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Even though local taxpayers may receive token payments from their school districts, everyone knows where the funds for those payments come from: the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>State Treasury, which is funded by tax dollars. The state taxpayer will also be funding the administrative costs to distribute this \u201crelief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In my view, the taxpayer can do without this kind of relief. Most likely, the local taxpayer would not want this kind of relief, especially when that \u201crelief\u201d comes out of his own pocket \u2014 deducting, of course, administrative expenses. The sure, simple, and most direct way in which to give the taxpayers relief is to award a declaratory judgment. This acknowledges the state\u2019s future obligations under the Headlee Amendment. It also recognizes that this lawsuit is simply not susceptible to damages. And, it avoids a misguided, cumbersome award of damages that confers no net benefit on the taxpayers. Instead, the majority\u2019s remedy will punish the Michigan taxpayers whom the Headlee Amendment was intended to protect, by requiring an increase in state taxes, cuts in state programs, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Accordingly, this Court should limit the scope of its relief to a declaratory judgment for the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b558-7\">Riley and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-6\"> The majority provides the boards of education of the school districts the discretion on how to spend this award and relies on the democratic process to safeguard that they shall do so wisely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">We conclude that any award of damages should be distributed to the plaintiff school districts and apportioned to taxpayers within each district, <em>if appropriate.

Further, if the majority wishes to insure taxpayer relief, see <em>ante, </em>p 216, with their judicially created, arbitrary award of money damages, it should mandate that the school districts directly return all the money damages to the taxpayers rather than rely on \u201cthe expectation that the democratic process will inform and shape distribution of the award.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 215. The majority\u2019s instructions leave the door open for a recalcitrant or well-meaning school district not to refund even a penny to the taxpayer and to create for itself a windfall from the money damages. Meanwhile, the average taxpayer on the street (who may not even know about the case and probably at most wall be entitled to a $100 refund) will have neither the knowledge, the time, nor the energy to try through \u201cthe democratic process\u201d to get a refund that the majority says he is entitled to without having to argue with the school board or file another lawsuit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The \u201cdemocratic process\u201d has already made clear, through the taxpayer-initiated enactment of the Headlee Amendment and through Proposal A, that the taxpayer is tired of being burdened by state and local governments.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-6\"> Contrary to the majority\u2019s misleading statement, <em>ante, </em>p 214, that the dissenters believe that the taxpayers are not the appropriate recipients of monetary relief in these cases, it is precisely the taxpayer\u2019s wallets that the dissenters seek to reheve with a declaratory judgment.
