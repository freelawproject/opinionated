The circuit court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We granted leave to appeal to determine whether a security interest in personal property given as collateral to secure payment under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>a lease agreement for which defendant executed a personal guaranty was subject to ucc filing requirements and, if so, whether the failure on the part of the plaintiffs to perfect their security interest in the personal property under state law constitutes impairment of the collateral so as to discharge the obligation of the guarantor and release him from further liability upon default of the lessee. We hold that the lien granted in the underlying lease agreement falls within the coverage of article 9 of the ucc and that \u00a7 9207 does not discharge the defendant\u2019s obligation under the guaranty agreements. We affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">The relevant facts of this case as set forth by the Court of Appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-7\">In 1991, plaintiffs and the predecessors of Market Place Media, Inc. (mpm), entered into a series of commercial leases for office space. In these leases, the predecessors granted plaintiffs a landlord\u2019s lien covering personal property located on the leased premises. As an inducement for these leases, Bonthuis, an officer for the predecessors, executed two personal guaranty agreements promising to secure the predecessors\u2019 performance under the leases. However, plaintiffs failed to do anything to perfect their lien on the personal property in question. Additionally, MPM terminated Bonthuis\u2019 employment soon after its purchase of the business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-8\">In 1993, MPM failed to pay rent due under the leases. As a result, plaintiffs filed suit in the district court against MPM and Bonthuis, and they received a judgment of possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>and a money judgment for $9,354.32 against mpm and Bonthuis. Subsequently, plaintiffs filed this case against mpm and Bonthuis for additional damages. However, mpm and Bonthuis filed bankruptcy petitions seeking protection from their creditors under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. As a result, the trial court stayed this case pending the resolution of the bankruptcies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-5\">The bankruptcy trustee sold mpm\u2019s personal property for $34,929.50. Plaintiffs filed a claim against the bankruptcy estate for $22,758.93, claiming secured status pursuant to the landlord\u2019s lien in the lease and the district court judgment. Notwithstanding this claim, the bankruptcy court subordinated plaintiffs\u2019 claim to the interest of mpm\u2019s bankruptcy trustee. Because of this subordination, plaintiffs received no proceeds from the sale of mpm\u2019s personal property by the bankruptcy trustee. After the rejection of plaintiffs\u2019 claim in the bankruptcy court, Bonthuis withdrew his bankruptcy petition, and the trial court lifted the stay that had suspended the proceedings in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-6\">Subsequently, Bonthuis moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8) and (10), claiming that plaintiffs\u2019 failure to file a financing statement in accordance with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which would have perfected their landlord\u2019s lien, impaired the collateral consisting of mpm\u2019s personal property, and freed Bonthuis from any obligation under his personal guaranties. Plaintiffs argued that their landlord\u2019s lien was exempted from the coverage of Article 9 by MCL 440.9104(b); MSA 19.9104(b), so Bonthuis was not protected under Article 9 from plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Alternatively, plaintiffs argued that even if their landlord\u2019s lien fell within the coverage of Article 9, MCL 440.9207; MSA 19.9207 did not free Bonthuis from his obligations under the guaranty agreements. The trial court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 arguments and granted summary disposition in Bonthuis\u2019 favor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-7\">It is from the Court of Appeals affirmance of the trial court\u2019s grant of defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition that the plaintiffs now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">We address first plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the lien granted in the underlying lease agreement was a landlord\u2019s lien and thus not subject to the provisions of the ucc under MCL 440.9104(b); MSA 19.9104(b). A landlord\u2019s lien is the right of a landlord to levy upon the goods of a tenant in satisfaction of unpaid rents or property damage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although landlords\u2019 liens may arise by statute, common law, or contract,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> commonly these liens take the form of statutory liens that give the lessor the status of a preferred creditor with regard to the lessee\u2019s property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is without dispute that subsection 9104(b) excludes landlords\u2019 liens from article 9 coverage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> What is at issue in this appeal is whether subsection 9104(b) contemplates consensual security interests embodied in a contract, or whether it excludes only those landlords\u2019 liens that arise by operation of law or by common law. Arguing that Michigan recognizes neither statutory nor common-law landlords\u2019 liens, plaintiffs claim that the clear intent of the Legislature was to apply the exclusion of subsection 9104(b) to contractual landlord\u2019s liens such as the one at issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The standard of review is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>de novo with regard to questions of law. <em>People v Carpentier, </em>446 Mich 19; 521 NW2d 195 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">Article 9 of the UCC provides a comprehensive scheme by which security interests in personal property and fixtures are regulated. All transactions intended to create a security interest in personal property and fixtures are contemplated under this article.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Generally, security interests that are not consensual but that arise by operation of law are excluded under this article.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Substance predominates over form in determining article 9 applicability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the determinative factor is not the form of the transaction as much as it is the intent of the parties in entering into the transaction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">The scope of article 9 of the ucc as embodied in \u00a7 9102 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-6\">(1) Except as otherwise provided in section 9104 on excluded transactions, this article applies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-7\">(a) To any transaction (regardless of its form) which is intended to create a security interest in personal property or fixtures including goods, documents, instruments, general intangibles, chattel paper or accounts; and also</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-8\">(b) To any sale of accounts or chattel paper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-9\">(2) This article applies to security interests created by contract including pledge, assignment, chattel mortgage, chattel trust, trust deed, factor\u2019s lien, equipment trust, conditional sale, trust receipt, other lien or title retention contract, and lease or consignment intended as security. This article does not apply to statutory liens except as provided in section 9310.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1062-10\">Despite the broad scope of \u00a7 9102, plaintiffs argue that article 9 is inapplicable to the lien in question because of an express provision in subsection 9104(b) excluding landlord\u2019s liens from article 9 coverage.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-11\">While a literal reading of subsection 9104(b) supports plaintiffs\u2019 argument, we cannot ignore the clear intent of article 9, which is to bring all consensual transactions within the scope of ucc coverage. Paragraph 12 of the underlying lease agreement between plaintiffs and the lessees provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-12\">Lessor\u2019s Lien. In the event Lessee shall fail to pay the rent provided for herein or other wise default in the performance of Lessee\u2019s obligations hereunder, Lessor shall have a lien on the property of Lessee located on the Premises to secure the payment or performance due Lessor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>The ucc \u201cis to be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies.\u201d MCL 440.1102; MSA 19.1102.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In construing the act in accordance with its purposes, the text of each section should be read in the light of the purpose and policy of the rule or principle in question.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There is no dispute that the lien in question was a consensual contractual hen. To effectuate the intent of \u00a7 9102 to bring all consensual security interests in personal property and fixtures under article 9 coverage, it follows that article 9 applies to the hen in question. Indeed, comment 1 to \u00a7 9102 provides further support for this position by stating: \u201cSection 9-104 excludes certain transactions where the security interest . . . arises under statute or common law by reason of status and not by consent of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Af2\">Courts in other jurisdictions addressing this same question have reached similar results.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>In re King Furniture City, Inc, </em>240 F Supp 453 (ED Ark, 1965); <em>In re Leckie Freeburn Coal Co, </em>405 F2d 1043 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>(CA 6, 1969); <em>Dunham\u2019s Music House, Inc v Asheville Theatres, Inc, </em>10 NC App 242, 245; 178 SE2d 124 (1970); <em>United States v Globe Corp, </em>113 Ariz 44, 50; 546 P2d 11 (1976); <em>Todsen v Runge, </em>211 Neb 226, 232-233; 318 NW2d 88 (1982). Plaintiffs argue that most of, if not all, these cases are distinguishable insofar as they involve states that enacted statutory landlords\u2019 liens or recognize common-law landlords\u2019 liens. However, plaintiffs\u2019 argument does not alter our view that article 9 encompasses the hen in question, nor does it persuade us that the act should not be construed in accordance with its underlying purposes and policies.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that the UCC applies to the lien in question.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">Having concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 consensual hen in personal property falls within the scope of article 9 of the ucc, it follows that plaintiffs held a security interest in the personal property of the lessees that they had not perfected.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As guarantor of that secured interest, defendant contends that the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence in failing to perfect their secured interest released him from obhgation under the guaranty agreements pursuant to \u00a7 9207. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">Defendant asserts that as a guarantor of the secured interest in the commercial lease agreement between plaintiffs and lessees, he is a \u201cdebtor\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 9105.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As such, defendant claims he is entitled to all the protections afforded a debtor under the UCC, including the duty of a creditor to protect and preserve the collateral securing the underlying debt. In effect, as guarantor, defendant contends that he steps into the debtor\u2019s shoes and gains the right to assert article 9 defenses. Defendant relies on \u00a7 9207 and on the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Nat'l Bank of Detroit v Alford, </em>65 Mich App 634; 237 NW2d 592 (1975), to support his position that his liability under the personal guaranty agreements was discharged as a result of plaintiffs\u2019 negligence in failing to perfect their secured interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">The UCC recognizes a secured party\u2019s duty to preserve and protect collateral pursuant to \u00a7 9207. Section 9207 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-8\">(1) A secured party must use reasonable care in the custody and preservation of collateral in his possession. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>case of an instrument or chattel paper reasonable care includes taking steps to preserve rights against prior parties unless otherwise agreed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-3\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-4\">(3) A secured party is liable for any loss caused by his failure to meet any obligation imposed by the preceding subsections but does not lose his security interest. [MCL 440.9207; MSA 19.9207,.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">In <em>Nat\u2019l Bank of Detroit, supra, </em>the defendant guarantors were relieved of any obligation under a guaranty agreement because of the plaintiffs failure to promptly record a chattel mortgage on an airplane. Rejecting plaintiffs claim under MCL 440.3606; MSA 19.3606, the Court concluded that \u00a7 9207 provided an additional, independent duty on the part of the creditor to promptly record the chattel mortgage. Failure on the part of the creditor to perfect its interest resulted in the unjustifiable impairment of the collateral on which the guarantors had a right to rely and spoiled the guarantors\u2019 right of subrogation. Accordingly, defendant guarantors were discharged from any liability under the guaranty agreement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>A determination whether \u00a7 9207 discharges defendant\u2019s guaranty here requires careful consideration of the scope and definitions of article 9. Subsection 9207(1) provides that when the collateral is an instrument or chattel paper, \u201creasonable care includes taking necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties unless otherwise agreed.\u201d MCL 440.9207(1); MSA 19.9207(1). Reasonable care in this context might mean that the secured party in possession of instruments or chattel paper may be required to \u201cfile a financing statement, provide notice of default, and inform accommodation parties of a failure on the part of the maker of a note to make payment.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Chattel paper, as defined by subsection 9105(l)(b), is \u201ca writing or writings which evidence both a monetary obligation and a security interest in or a lease of specific goods . . . .\u201d However, chattel paper as defined under subsection 9105(l)(b) must not be confused with chattel paper that is itself collateral.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Collateral is \u201cthe property subject to a security interest, and includes . . . chattel paper which [has] been sold.\u201d MCL 440.9105(l)(c); MSA 19.9105(l)(c). A security interest in chattel paper is an interest in the paper itself, not the goods represented by the paper.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>The Court of Appeals erroneously assumed that any document that fits within the definition of \u201cchattel paper\u201d triggers article 9\u2019s provisions regarding chattel paper. However, article 9 by its terms applies only when documents that otherwise fall within the definition of chattel paper are used by the creditor as security for further financing or are otherwise sold or transferred. MCL 440.9102; MSA 19.9102.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Here, no assertions were made that indicate that the lease and guaranty agreements were sold, pledged, or otherwise assigned as security in any transaction. Thus, while these documents may fit within \u00a7 9105\u2019s definition of \u201cchattel paper,\u201d they are not subject to article 9\u2019s provisions regarding security interests in chattel paper until they are used by the creditor as collateral or are otherwise transferred. MCL 440.9102; MSA 19.9102. That is, it is a condition precedent for application of article 9 to chattel paper that the chattel paper be used as collateral or otherwise transferred. This condition precedent was not met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the lease agreement, coupled with defendant\u2019s guaranties, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>not constitute the collateral subject to a security interest. MCL 440.9105(l)(c); MSA 19.9105(l)(c). Rather, the collateral was at all times the personal property of the lessee, and there has been no assertion by the parties or evidence offered that warrants a conclusion that plaintiffs had possession of that property.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals erred in holding that \u00a7 9207 could be invoked here to provide a remedy for defendant. Accordingly, we do not believe that summary disposition was properly granted in favor of the defendant under \u00a7 9207 of the act.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-3\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-4\">For the reasons stated, we hold that the lien granted in the underlying lease agreement falls within the coverage of article 9 of the ucc and that \u00a7 9207 does not discharge the defendant\u2019s obligation under the guaranty agreements. Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1069-5\">Mallett, C.J., and Brickley, Cavanagh, Weaver, Kelly, and Taylor, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1058-9\"> 218 Mich App 142, 143-144; 553 NW2d 366 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1060-6\"> Barron\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d ed), p 278.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1060-7\"> 218 Mich App 143, n 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1060-8\"> Barron\u2019s, n 2 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1060-9\"> Subsection 9104(b) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-10\">This article does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-11\">(b) To a landlord\u2019s lien ....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1060-12\"> Defendant argues that Michigan has recognized a common-law landlord\u2019s lien in <em>SS Kresge Co v Twelve Seventy-five Woodward Ave Corp, </em>270 Mich 218, 221; 258 NW 252 (1935).
