A trial judge does not sit as the thirteenth juror in ruling on motions for a new trial and may grant a new trial only if the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict so that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow the verdict to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">FACTS AND PROCEDURE</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">Defendant Joseph Lemmon was convicted of five counts of criminal sexual conduct following a jury trial held before Judge Carole F. Youngblood. He was found guilty of one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and two counts of second-degree crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>nal sexual conduct<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against one daughter and two counts of esc n against the other daughter of his former girlfriend, Deborah Buell. Ms. Buell met and then lived with Joseph Lemmon for a short time in 1988. During that time, Mr. Lemmon fathered a son, the youngest child of Ms. Buell; however, the relationship ended before James was bom. The couple later resumed their relationship in 1992 and Joseph Lemmon moved in with Ms. Buell and her three other children, two daughters, ages eleven and eight, and a son, age six. He lived with them as a member of the family from November, 1992, until August, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">The older daughter testified that, on four different occasions, when her mother was not in the home, the defendant sexually abused her. The separate incidents occurred on different days and involved defendant lifting her bra and playing with her breasts when putting cream on her pimples, putting his finger into her vagina, attempting penile penetration of her vagina, and sucking her breast. She testified that defendant was responsible for discipline during the time he lived in the house and that while he never physically disciplined her, he did ground her for bad report cards. She further testified that she did not tell anyone what had happened because defendant told her that it was just between the two of them and \u201cnot to tell no one\u201d and that if she did, she \u201cwould get hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">The younger daughter testified that she had been the victim of the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse on two occasions. Both incidents, which were similar in nature, occurred when her mother was not present in the home and took place in the bedroom Mr. Lemmon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>shared with her mother. She stated that, on different days, defendant called her into the bedroom telling her he wanted to show her something. When she went into the room, defendant pulled down his pants, exposed himself, and told her to touch his penis. When she refused, he grabbed her hand, placed it on his penis, and forced her to rub it. She further testified that defendant disciplined her during the time he lived with her mother and would sometimes whip her or confine her to her room. She also testified that defendant told her not to tell anyone what had transpired and that if she did, he \u201cwould do something\u201d and she would \u201cbe in big trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Both girls testified that they did not tell their mother what had happened until after Mr. Lemmon and their mother had separated and both parties had moved out of the house they shared. Their mother confirmed this portion of the girls\u2019 testimony, stating that the girls had not indicated that any type of sexual abuse had occurred during the time she was living with Mr. Lemmon. Ms. Buell testified that it was her decision to break off the relationship with Mr. Lemmon, but that it was not until after the relationship had ended, and she and her children had moved into her parent\u2019s home that she was informed of the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Defense counsel for Mr. Lemmon cross-examined the girls in an attempt to impeach their testimony. He obtained admissions from the older daughter that there were times that she had not told the truth and later admitted to the lie by telling the truth. Specifically, defense counsel elicited from her falsehoods that included instances such as lying about stealing a candy bar, smoking in the woods, not giving notes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>from her teacher to her parents, taking food off her brothers\u2019 plates, going places with friends, riding her bike in the street, and saying she had finished homework when she had not, or cleaned her room when she had not. On cross-examination of the younger daughter, defense counsel obtained admissions that she had not told the truth only when she said she had cleaned her room, but had not, and told her mother she was going one place, but went another. She denied other allegations that she had lied about homework or lied to get her sister in trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Defendant presented several witnesses and testified in his own defense. He stated that his relationship with Ms. Buell had its ups and downs, that she was very jealous, and wanted everything her own way. In contrast to the testimony of Ms. Buell, the defendant claimed that he initiated the breakup. He further indicated that when he moved out of the house he was still on speaking terms with Ms. Buell. Additionally, he denied ever sexually abusing either girl and stated that Ms. Buell was present the one time he had put cream on the older daughter\u2019s spots. He agreed that he was involved in disciplining the girls but that he had never hit either of them. He could give no reason for either of the girls to be angry with him, hold anything against him, or make up allegations against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">At the close of the people\u2019s proofs, the prosecutor agreed to dismiss a third count of CSC H concerning the older daughter because she could only recall two specific instances of sexual contact, although there might have been three. There was no motion for a directed verdict regarding the other counts. After Mr. Lemmon presented his defense, the case was submit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>ted to the jury who found the defendant guilty on all five remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">At sentencing, the defendant submitted a motion for a directed verdict or new trial, which was denied. The trial judge imposed a two- to fifteen-year term for one conviction of CSC I<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and two- to ten-year terms for each conviction of esc n,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to run concurrently. In July, 1995, defendant obtained new counsel and filed another motion for a directed verdict or a new trial. The motion was granted by Judge Youngblood on the basis of <em>People v Herbert, supra. </em>The court noted that <em>Herbert </em>allowed a new trial when the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence or to prevent an injustice and stated that the new trial motion was granted after reviewing the whole body of proofs, particularly the contradictory testimony and demeanor of the girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">The prosecutor filed a delayed application for leave to appeal the decision to grant a new trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals stayed the new trial and remanded the case to Judge Youngblood \u201cfor a full statement of the court\u2019s reasons for granting the motion for new trial, including a specific explanation of why the court found the witnesses\u2019 testimony not credible and the verdict against the great weight of the evidence.\u201d Unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered November 20, 1995 (Docket No. 189329).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>In the written opinion reviewed here, the trial court observed that both prosecution witnesses \u201clacked credibility.\u201d She cited their \u201cpoor memory of any details\u201d as to time or events, the \u201cillogic\u201d of their description of the circumstances surrounding the sexual assaults, their \u201cpoor reputation for truthfulness,\u201d and the fact that the information regarding the assaults had not been disclosed until months after their occurrence and \u201cafter the defendant had rejected the family relationship.\u201d The judge also found the demeanor of the witnesses questionable in that the older daughter \u201cgiggled at times, but not at embarrassing moments when one might expect a child to giggle,\u201d that \u201c[b]oth children appeared to look at the prosecutor and others in the courtroom for approval rather than candidly testifying as to their memory,\u201d and used sexually explicit words and phrases \u201cwithout any hesitation or embarrassment.\u201d The judge indicated that \u201c[t]he only evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was the testimony of [the girls]. There were no medical records, counseling records, or corroborating testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Finally, the judge reaffirmed her opinion that the verdict had resulted in a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d stating that the \u201ccredibility of the orally-testifying witnesses and their demeanor leaves this court with a firm belief that the defendant should be tried by a different jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">The Court of Appeals denied the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal. However, Judge Corrigan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>observed that she had consistently questioned the principle of <em>People v Herbert </em>that a trial court may sit as a thirteenth juror. Judge Corrigan stated that, in her view, the credibility of the two witnesses had not been significantly impugned but could not say that the trial judge had abused her discretion in granting a new trial. Judge Markman agreed that, given the authority vested in the trial courts under <em>People v Herbert, </em>there was no \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d on the part of the trial judge and joined Judge Corrigan in questioning the merits of <em>Herbert. </em>Unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered March 12, 1996 (Docket No. 189329). The prosecutor appealed, and we granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">The issue presented is rooted in the difference between the standard for granting a new trial and that required to grant a directed verdict of acquittal. Due process commands a directed verdict of acquittal<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>when \u201csufficient evidence to justify a rational trier of fact in finding guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d <em>People v Hampton, </em>407 Mich 354, 366; 285 NW2d 284 (1979), citing <em>Jackson v Virginia, </em>443 US 307; 99 S Ct 2781; 61 L Ed 2d 560 (1979), is lacking. If the evidence presented by the prosecution in the light most favorable to the prosecution, up to the time the motion is made, is insufficient to justify a reasonable trier of fact to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, a directed verdict or judgment of acquittal must be entered.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Hampton, supra </em>at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">Under statute,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as well as the court rule,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the operative principles regarding new trial motions are that the court \u201cmay,\u201d in the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d or to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>vent a \u201cmiscarriage of justice,\u201d grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In Herbert, we noted that, in addition to preventing injustice, a new trial may be granted if the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence. While the great weight of the evidence standard for granting a new trial is traceable to longstanding case law, <em>People v Henssler, </em>48 Mich 49, 51; 11 NW 804 (1882),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Herbert </em>is the first opinion decided by this Court requiring consideration of the standard for granting new trial motions in light of the constitutional mandate announced in <em>Jackson </em>and recognized in <em>Hampton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>In <em>Herbert, supra </em>at 476, we quoted with approval Judge Frank\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Dyer v MacDougall, </em>201 F2d 265, 271-272 (CA 2, 1952), that \u201c \u2018[o]n a motion for new trial, the judge acts \u201cas the thirteenth juror,\u201d i.e., he evaluates the credibility of the orally-testifying witnesses and therefore their demeanor. But on a motion for a directed verdict he does not.\u2019 \u201d Today we clarify that a judge may not repudiate a jury verdict on the ground that \u201che disbelieves the testimony of witnesses for the prevailing party.\u201d <em>People v Johnson, </em>397 Mich 686, 687; 246 NW2d 836 (1976).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">The issue whether a state trial court judge in a jury trial \u201cmay assess evidence as a \u201813th juror\u2019 is a question of state law.\u201d <em>Hudson v Louisiana, </em>450 US 40, 45, n 5; 101 S Ct 970; 67 L Ed 2d 30 (1981).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The his-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>tone division of functions between the court and the jury needs no citation of authority. It is the province of the jury to determine questions of fact and assess the credibility of witnesses. \u201cAs the trier of fact, the jury is the final judge of credibility.\u201d <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 687.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The approach that would allow a trial judge to sit as a thirteenth juror<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and overrule the credibility determinations of the jury suggests that a judge may freely repudiate the jury\u2019s findings. Although <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 687, indicates that a trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>may grant a new trial because he disbelieves witness testimony, explicit reference to the judge as thirteenth juror does not appear in Michigan jurisprudence before <em>Herbert, </em>a per curiam opinion issued without benefit of oral argument. Having had the advantage of oral argument, full appellate briefing, and review of additional state and federal cases, a better view emerges.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Appellate reluctance to interfere with the grant of a new trial is soundly rooted in the proposition that \u201c[t]he judge was \u2018there\u2019 [w]e were not.\u201d <em>Adler v Flint City Coach Lines, Inc, </em>364 Mich 29, 39; 110 NW2d 606 (1961). It is also based on the pragmatic expectation of appellate courts that the trial courts will sparingly exercise such authority and that expansion of appellate oversight would simply invite an increase in claims for review. <em>Spalding v Spalding, </em>355 Mich 382, 384; 94 NW2d 810 (1959). That disputed issues of fact are for the jury is a fundamental tenet of our jurisprudence, <em>Rizzo v Kretschmer, </em>389 Mich 363, 371-372; 207 NW2d 316 (1973), and it is the trial judge who presumably will bear the practical consequence of a conclusion that a case needs to be retried.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">The conundrum is that, in motions for a new trial based on the claim that the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence, the issue of credibility of the witnesses is implicit in determining great weight or overwhehning weight of that evidence. <em>Sloan v Kramer-Orloff Co, </em>371 Mich 403, 412; 124 NW2d 255 (1963). The problem has been addressed by abstract formulations that caution against overturning verdicts and, less frequently, by an attempt to give concrete guidance to a judge asked to review \u201cthe whole body of proofs,\u201d which necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>includes an evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Herbert, supra </em>at 475. New trial motions based solely on the weight of the evidence regarding witness credibility are not favored.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">This formulation of the standard is, in turn, founded on the principle that the preservation of the jury by constitutional amendment was designed as a limitation on judicial power. As Justice Taylor recently observed, the \u201cspecial role accorded jurors under our constitutional system of justice\u201d has been acknowledged for centuries. <em>People v Bart (On Remand), </em>220 Mich App 1, 12; 558 NW2d 449 (1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-6\">\u201cNow let any man of sense consider, whether this method be not more proper for bolting out the truth, for finding out the guilty, and preserving the innocent, than if the whole decision were left to the examination of a judge, or two or three, whose interests, passion, haste, or multiplicity of business may easily betray them into error.\u201d [Quoting Care, English Liberties, pp 205-209, written in 1680 (and cited in 2 Few, In Defense of Trial by Jury, p 278, published in 1993 by the American Jury Trial Foundation).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Justice Taylor further observed that \u201cthe hurdle a judge must clear to overrule a jury is unquestionably among the highest in our law. It is to be approached by the court with great trepidation and reserve, with all presumptions running against its invocation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">The thirteenth juror standard posits that the authority of the trial judge is equal to, or greater than, that of the other jurors when the court does not agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>with the outcome.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It follows that the oft repeated statement, the \u201cpower to grant a new trial on this ground should be invoked only in exceptional cases in which the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict,\u201d <em>Dorman v State, </em>622 P2d 448, 454 (Alas, 1981), citing 3 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 553, pp 245-248, cannot be understood to endorse the concept of the judge as thirteenth juror. The trial judge who posits the authority to determine whether the evidence is so evenly balanced that reasonable jurors might come to different conclusions, as Justice Cavanagh suggests, may further assume that jurors have unreasonably come to the conclusion they reached. That is why the thirteenth juror approach has a potential to undermine the jury function and why we now reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Were the concept to be applied as expressed, the constitutional method for sifting out the truth, for our finding the guilty and preserving the innocent, would be \u201c \u2018left to the examination of a judge, or two or three.\u2019 \u201d To adhere to this principle and articulate a concept for resolving the conundrum of the trial court, appellate courts have narrowed the inquiry to focus on the defendant\u2019s innocence, that is, whether it would be a manifest injustice to allow the verdict to stand.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>United States v Polin, </em>824 F Supp 542, 551 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>(ED Pa, 1993). Numerous federal circuits<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and other jurisdictions have adopted similar standards: \u201cThe discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction,\u201d <em>State v Martin, </em>20 Ohio App 3d 172, 175; 485 NE2d 717 (1983), or \u201cpreponderates sufficiently heavily against the verdict that a serious miscarriage of justice may have occurred . . . .\u201d <em>State v Kringstad, </em>353 NW2d 302, 306 (ND, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">In accord with these cases, the Vermont Supreme Court stated that a motion for a new trial in the inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>est of justice is a remedy to be used sparingly and \u201conly in exceptional cases\u201d and \u201cshould be granted \u2018only upon a conclusion by the trial court that, weighing all the evidence including the credibility of the witnesses, the verdict is clearly against the weight of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v LaDabouche, </em>146 Vt 279, 283; 502 A2d 852 (1985). The court asserted that this language permits the inference that the trial judge does not sit \u201cmerely as a thirteenth juror, but applies a stricter standard,\u201d and further noted that more recent federal cases have adopted this standard and do not mention the thirteenth juror concept. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">These observations are in full accord with the language of our statute and court rule. Thus, \u201ca new trial based upon the weight of the evidence should be granted only where the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict and a serious miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\u201d <em>LaDabouche, supra </em>at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">We align ourselves with those appellate courts holding that, absent exceptional circumstances, issues of witness credibility are for the jury, and the trial court may not substitute its view of the credibility \u201cfor the constitutionally guaranteed jury determination thereof.\u201d <em>Sloan, supra </em>at 411.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We reiterate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>observation in <em>Anderson v Conterio, </em>303 Mich 75, 79; 5 NW2d 572 (1942), that, when testimony is in direct conflict and testimony supporting the verdict has been impeached, if \u201cit cannot be said as a matter of law that the testimony thus impeached was deprived of all probative value or that the jury could not believe it,\u201d the credibility of witnesses is for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Adding flesh to what is a more refined articulation of the formula that \u201c \u2018[i]n general, conflicting testimony or a question as to the credibility of a witness are not sufficient grounds for granting a new trial,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v Garcia, </em>978 F2d 746, 748 (CA 1, 1992), quoting with approval <em>United States v Kuzniar, </em>881 F2d 466, 470 (CA 7, 1989),<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> federal circuit courts have carved out a very narrow exception to the rule that the trial court may not take the testimony away from the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 470-471. Defining the exception, the federal courts have developed several tests that would allow application of the exception; for example, if the \u201ctestimony contradicts indisputable physical facts or laws,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u201c[w]here testimony is patently incredible or defies physical realities,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number><em>United States v Sanchez, </em>969 F2d 1409, 1414 (CA 2, 1992), \u201c[w]here a witness\u2019s testimony is material and is so inherently implausible that it could not be believed by a reasonable juror,\u201d <em>Garcia, supra </em>at 748, or where the witness\u2019 testimony has been seriously \u201cimpeached\u201d and the case marked by \u201cuncertainties and discrepancies.\u201d <em>United States v Martinez, </em>763 F2d 1297, 1313 (CA 11, 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">This does not mean that \u201c[a] judge\u2019s disagreement with the jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d <em>United States v Arrington, </em>757 F2d 1484, 1486 (CA 4, 1985), or a \u201ctrial judge\u2019s rejection of all or part of the testimony of a witness or witnesses,\u201d entitles a defendant to a new trial. <em>Sanchez, supra </em>at 1414. Rather, a trial judge must determine if one of the tests applies so that it would seriously undermine the credibility of a witness\u2019 testimony and, if so, is there \u201ca real concern that an innocent person may have been convicted\u201d or that \u201cit would be a manifest injustice\u201d to allow the guilty verdict to stand. <em>Id. </em>If the \u201cevidence is nearly balanced, or is such that different minds would naturally and fairly come to different conclusions,\u201d the judge may not disturb the jury findings although his judgment might incline him the other way. <em>Kringstad, supra </em>at 307.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Any \u201creal concern\u201d that an innocent person has been convicted would arise \u201conly if the credible trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>evidence weighs more heavily in [the defendant\u2019s] favor than against it.\u201d <em>Polin, supra </em>at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Formulaic pronouncements are less than successful in giving practical guidance to trial courts regarding when the \u201cmystic borderline\u201d is crossed between credibility issues that must remain with the jury and a court\u2019s authority to overturn that finding. We can state confidently that the judge is not to act as a thirteenth juror when passing on such motions. Justice Cavanagh can state with equal assurance that the trial judge is uniquely situated \u201cto observe the presentation of evidence in court.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 652. Neither statement defines the range of authority that remains.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> A survey of the legal landscape, including federal authority and legal commentary, identifies the practical guidance that a trial judge seeks. Justice O\u2019Hara in <em>Sloan, </em>instructs the trial court to answer the threshold question regarding what issue is actually posed by the motion, that is, to engage in \u201can evaluation of the testimony bearing on the controverted fact,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 409, to determine whether the question is one of \u201c \u2018great\u2019 or \u2018overwhelming\u2019 weight\u201d of the evidence or, rather, \u201ca question of the credibility of witnesses testifying to diametrically opposed assertions of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Justice O\u2019Hara suggests that, unlike Justice Cavanagh\u2019s reference to the unique position of the trial court judge, unless it can be said that directly contradictory testimony was so far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>impeached that it \u201cwas deprived of all probative value or that the jury could not believe it,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 410, or contradicted indisputable physical facts or defied physical realities, the trial court must defer to the jury\u2019s determination. \u201cSo concluding we must, despite any misgivings or inclinations to disagree, leave the test of credibility where our system reposed it \u2014 in the trier of the facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412. To state as does the concurrence that a trial judge sits as a thirteenth juror, that is, to \u201cinvoke this perspective sparingly,\u201d <em>post </em>at 652 is to articulate an unreviewable standard that invites judges so inclined to substitute their views for that of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">In the instant case, the testimony of the victims was in direct conflict with that of the defendant. The defendant was effectively able to cross-examine the girls and attempt to discredit their testimony. The defendant also testified and presented his version of events to the jury. The credibility of a witness is determined by more than words and includes tonal quality, volume, speech patterns, and demeanor, all giving clues to the factfinder regarding whether a witness is telling the truth. <em>State v Turner, </em>186 Wis 2d 277; 521 NW2d 148 (App, 1994). The jury was able to see, hear, and observe both the victims and the defendant and determine the credibility of their testimony. The jury found the defendant guilty of all the charges after viewing all the evidence and all the witnesses. The question being one of credibility posed by diametrically opposed versions of the events in question, the trial court was obligated, \u201cdespite any misgivings or inclinations to disagree,\u201d to leave the test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>of credibility where statute, case law, common law, and the constitution repose it \u201cin the trier of fact.\u201d On the record presented, the jury\u2019s evaluation was not inferior to that of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">The reasons cited by the trial judge in the opinion before us are an inadequate basis for disturbing the jury\u2019s evaluations of credibility under the limitations of <em>Herbert </em>adopted today. Conflicting testimony, even when impeached to some extent, is an insufficient ground for granting a new trial. The reasons cited do not evidence that the testimony contradicts indisputable physical facts or law. Any suggestion that the testimony is patently incredible or is so inherently implausible that it could not be believed by a reasonable juror is undermined by the court\u2019s earlier conclusion that the evidence justified the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">The reasons asserted by the trial judge for granting a new trial were grounded in the erroneous view that she could employ her status as a thirteenth juror to set aside the jury verdict. The trial court\u2019s duty to protect the process encompasses a duty to the defendant, to the public, and to the constitutionally guaranteed role of the jury as determiner of disputed facts. We hold that fidelity to these principles dictates that, in this category of cases, the judge does not sit as a thirteenth juror. The thirteenth juror principle is an erroneous legal standard. It does not establish that an innocent person had been found guilty, or that the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict so that it would be a serious miscarriage of justice to permit the verdict to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>However, because we find that the court did not err in ordering a new trial under the erroneous thirteenth juror standard previously permitted under <em>Herbert, </em>we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and hold that the newly adopted limitations on <em>Herbert </em>apply prospectively to cases not yet final as of the date of this decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b974-5\">Mallett, C.J., and Brickley, Weaver, and Taylor, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-11\"> MCL 750.520b; MSA 28.788(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b954-7\"> MCL 750.520c; MSA 28.788(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b957-7\"> MCL 750.520b(2); MSA 28.788(2)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b957-8\"> MCL 750.520c(2); MSA 28.788(3)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b957-9\"> In the interim, the prosecutor had filed a motion to disqualify Judge Youngblood, citing the judge\u2019s views on witness credibility.

If he or she finds the evidence so evenly balanced, then he or she should defer to the findings of the jury. <em>[State v Warren, </em>624 A2d 841, 843 (RI, 1993) (citations omitted).]<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>It is for these reasons that I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]he thirteenth juror standard posits that the authority of the trial judge is equal to, or greater than, that of the other jurors when the court does not agree with the outcome.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 639-640. The term \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d does not mean that the trial judge substitutes personal judgment for that of the jury; rather, it refers to the trial judge\u2019s unique position, enabling the judge to observe the presentation of evidence in court. Thus, it is entirely consistent to say that a trial judge sits as a thirteenth juror when evaluating the weight of the evidence presented at trial, but that the judge should invoke this perspective sparingly when granting a new trial on the basis of the great weight of the evidence. In short, I believe the holding of the majority is further elaboration of our statement in <em>Herbert, </em>and, therefore, it is unnecessary to overrule any portion of that opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b978-5\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-9\"> As the majority explains, there are some circumstances where a witness\u2019 testimony may be so impeached or illogical that a trial judge may legitimately grant a new trial on the basis of the credibility of such a witness. <em>Ante </em>at 643-644. Moreover, a trial court may also rely on other substantial \u201cnoncredibility\u201d evidence when deciding whether a new trial is warranted under the great weight of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b975-7\"> Under today\u2019s decision, this would still be the case. The majority does not eliminate the consideration of witness credibility by the trial judge. Rather, it clarifies the standard a trial judge must use when deciding whether to grant a new trial on the basis of the credibility of a witness alone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b975-8\"> In contrast, a motion for a directed verdict requires the trial judge to consider the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution. In that instance, a judge must not evaluate the credibility of witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 475, n 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b976-7\"> The majority cites three cases as examples of jurisdictions \u201crecognizing the thirteenth juror concept.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 637, n 16. However, the term \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d does not appear anywhere in these three decisions. See <em>Veitch v Superior Court of Santa Clara Co, </em>89 Cal App 3d 722, 730-731; 152 Cal Rptr 822 (1979), <em>People v Ramos, </em>33 AD2d 344, 347; 308 NYS2d 195 (1970), and <em>State v Hudson, </em>373 So 2d 1294, 1298 (La, 1979) (Tate, J., concurring). Thus, none of these cases appropriately describes the thirteenth juror analogy or the standard we adopted in <em>Herbert.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b976-8\"> \u201cThe judge sees the witnesses, hears the testimony, and has a special perspective of the relationship between the evidence and the verdict which cannot be recreated by a reviewing court from the printed record.\u201d <em>Reeves v Markle, </em>119 Ariz 159, 163; 579 P2d 1382 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[6]\">\n<p id=\"b977-6\">6 See also Seward, <em>The sufficiency-weight distinction </em>\u2014 A <em>matter of life or death, </em>38 U Miami L R 147, 154-155 (1983):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-7\">There is, however, a caveat to the application of the \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d analogy since the standard for upsetting a jury verdict is very strict. It has been argued that allowing the judge to reverse a conviction based upon the weight of evidence permits the judge to usurp a function traditionally within the province of the jury. By invading the province of the jury, the judge then becomes the real trier of fact. Recognizing this danger, courts must use caution when reweighing evidence. Accordingly, courts reversing a jury verdict based upon the weight of evidence couch their decisions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>ternis of \u201cexceptional cases,\u201d \u201cpreventing injustice,\u201d or the \u201cevidence preponderating heavily against the verdict.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
