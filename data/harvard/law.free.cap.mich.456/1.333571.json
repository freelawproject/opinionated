We are also asked to decide whether a discharged employee may challenge an employer\u2019s decision to reduce its work force charging discrimination, even when the reduction in work force (rif) decision has been deemed bona fide.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">We hold that even when an employer\u2019s rif decision is concluded to be bona fide, an employee may still establish a genuine issue of material fact that the employer\u2019s justification for discharging him was not the true reason for its decision to discharge. We also hold that in order for a discharged employee to establish a genuine issue of material fact when an employer contends that its decision to discharge the employee was based on a work-force reduction, the employee may not merely rely on unsubstantiated allegations or denials in the pleadings. Rather, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>must come forward with admissible evidence, affidavits, or other evidentiary materials, demonstrating the existence of a factual dispute that the employer\u2019s articulated reason was merely a pretext to discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In the instant case, we conclude that defendant\u2019s policy statement could have reasonably created a legitimate expectation of just-cause employment. We also conclude that defendant did have just cause to reduce its work force as a matter of law, but not with respect to this plaintiff. Rather, we hold that plaintiff did sufficiently establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether age was a determining factor in defendant\u2019s decision to discharge her. We also conclude that plaintiff presented evidence sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether defendant considered her sex in its decision to discharge her.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals finding that plaintiff could have reasonably had a legitimate expectation of just-cause employment. We also affirm its ruling that plaintiff raised a genuine issue of fact with respect to whether defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her age, as well as its decision concluding that plaintiff raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding her claim of sex discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">On January 29, 1973, plaintiff Nancy Lytle was hired by defendant Howmet Turbine Components <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Corporation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as a general clerk in its human resources department, which at that time served all divisions making up the Whitehall operation. Plaintiff received a manual containing a statement of defendant\u2019s policies and procedures regarding employment. In the section containing defendant\u2019s policy regarding the relationship it sought with each of its employees, defendant expressed that a probationary period existed that afforded it time to decide whether it was in its interest as well as the employee\u2019s interest to continue the relationship following the probationary period. In that same section, the manual also stated that \u201c[n]o employee will be terminated without proper cause or reason and not until management has made a careful review of all facts.\u201d The last two paragraphs of the manual stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">The contents of this booklet are not intended to establish, and should not be interpreted to constitute any contract between the Misco Whitehall Division, Product Support Operations, Reactive Metal Operations or the Technical Center of Howmet Turbine Components Corporation and any employee, or group of employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">For over twenty years we have concentrated on the production of the finest investment castings, with the development of policies and principles which aim at the attainment of pride in every day\u2019s work for every employee, <em>plus </em>the satisfaction of finding opportunities for individual growth and security. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">In 1981, defendant placed a disclaimer in its policy manual: \u201c[T]he Company reserves the right to terminate employees without assigning cause; therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>the employee serves at the will of the employer.\u201d <em>Direct notification of the disclaimer was provided only to new employees, </em>but plaintiff was involved in placing the disclaimer in new employee manuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">At the time of plaintiffs hiring, John Ozar was the human resources director, serving as her immediate supervisor. Under Ozar\u2019s supervision, plaintiff received exemplary performance evaluations and was rewarded with a succession of promotions. In 1979, plaintiff spoke with Ozar about resigning and seeking employment elsewhere. Ozar assured plaintiff that her employment with defendant was secure and that she could expect advancement. Soon after that conversation, plaintiff was promoted to employment manager of the entire human resources department. Additionally, about the same time, Ozar hired Walter Boczkaja. Boczkaja became plaintiffs subordinate trainee. For approximately two years, Boczkaja trained under plaintiff, receiving promotions to various positions within the personnel department, and continued to be one of plaintiffs subordinates until 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">During the 1984-85 fiscal year, Ozar retired and was replaced by William Roof. In March 1987, Roof determined a need to decentralize the human resources department. He planned for each of the Whitehall divisions to have its own human resources representative. Roof hired defendant Michael Malady to head the Whitehall Machined Products Division and to serve as plaintiffs supervisor. Plaintiff was reassigned to serve as human resources representative for defendant\u2019s Ti-Ingot Division.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>A personality conflict between Malady and plaintiff soon developed. In June 1987, Malady requested all female employees under his supervision to wear dresses to a company picnic. Plaintiff wore slacks. Shortly thereafter, in September 1987, Malady submitted an unfavorable evaluation of plaintiffs job performance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">In January 1989, on Malady\u2019s recommendation and with Roof\u2019s approval, plaintiff\u2019s job title was changed from human resources representative to human resources specialist. Plaintiff\u2019s duties, as well as her salary, remained the same. Malady suggests that the change was necessary to reduce the number of direct reports he had to address, in addition to \u201ccentraliz[ing] the total employment function under one person instead of having it split with two different people doing part of it.\u201d He also asserts that he had \u201csome performance concerns . . . with [plaintiff\u2019s] supervisory abilities],\u201d as reflected in his latest performance evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Plaintiff held her new position from January 1989, until her discharge on November 1, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Plaintiff contends defendant\u2019s policy manual created an expectation that her employment would not be terminated unless there was sufficient cause to do so. Also, she claims that she relied on verbal assurances by Ozar that her employment with defendant was secure.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Defendant argues that plaintiff was terminated pursuant to a company-wide reduction in work force. Defendant asserts that as a result of declines in military spending and a downturn in the commercial airline industry between 1988 and 1991, it was forced to institute a series of reductions in its work force. Defendant suggests that it initially sought to cut costs in the 1992 budget without terminating any employees. In an August 21, 1991, intracompany memorandum to all the personnel support departments,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dr. Thomas Wright, vice president in charge of the Whitehall operations, directed all department supervisors to cut their respective 1992 budgets by fifteen percent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">At the same time reductions were being sought, defendant was embarking on a plan that would use work cells as the primary facility structure, where employees would be working in teams instead of in the traditional hierarchical order. Notwithstanding the fact that he had to eliminate fifteen percent of his projected 1992 budget, Roof was told by the Operhall management to somehow compile a list of employees from the human resources department to head an independent department. From that list someone was to be selected to oversee the development of the work-cell plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">After reviewing the qualifications of those listed, Operhall management identified Malady and Boczkaja as the two most promising candidates. Malady was not available and Boczkaja, who was interviewed by Operhall management, later decided to stay on in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>current position. Then Roof went to the private sector and found Andrea Achterhoff.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> She was thirty-one years old and had previous experience as a production supervisor, personnel manager, and human resources manager. Plaintiff never was interviewed for the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">By November 1, 1991, in an effort to comply with Wright\u2019s mandate, Roof had eliminated approximately $300,000. Roof needed to cut $439,950 in costs in order to meet Wright\u2019s directive of a fifteen-percent reduction in expenditures for the human resources department\u2019s 1992 operating budget. Roof eliminated four positions in the human resources department, which included two plant medical staff, the employee assistance program assistant, and plaintiff\u2019s position as human resources specialist. Roof contended that in terminating these four individuals, he focused on \u201cfunctions\u201d rather than \u201cindividuals or relative qualifications.\u201d He suggested that the decision was based on who was absolutely critical and what they could get by without. Roof claimed that he terminated plaintiff because the primary function of her position involved hourly employees, where a substantial portion of the reduction in work force had already occurred, and the fact that little, if any, hiring was forecasted in the near future.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The same day plaintiff was discharged, defendant hired Jeff Billingsley to work in the training program for the work-cell project. As far as plaintiff understood, Billingsley \u201cworked for the corporate office\u201d and was merely assigned to take an office where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>plaintiff previously worked so that he would have a place to work. Moreover, plaintiff admitted that she had no idea how Whitehall\u2019s operation budget and personnel were allocated among all the Pechiney subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">On November 22, 1991, Boczkaja completed a final performance evaluation on plaintiff, which Malady accepted, indicating that she would be rehired in the event a nonsupervisory, administrative position became available. When plaintiff was finally discharged, her duties were assigned to other persons within the human resources department.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">On January 7, 1992, plaintiff filed a complaint in the Muskegon Circuit Court against defendant How-met, alleging: (I) breach of a contract providing for termination for just cause only, (II) age discrimination, and (III) sex discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Following some discovery, defendants Howmet and Malady moved separately for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10), which the circuit court granted on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The Court of Appeals reversed,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and this Court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>A motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10) tests whether there is factual support for a claim or defense. <em>Adkins v Thomas Solvent Co, </em>440 Mich 293, 302; 487 NW2d 715 (1992); <em>General Motors Corp v Detroit, </em>372 Mich 234, 239-240; 126 NW2d 108 (1964). The affidavits, pleadings, depositions, admissions, and other material supporting and opposing the motion must be considered,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> so that it may be decided whether \u201c \u2018it is impossible for the claim or defense to be supported at trial because of some deficiency which cannot be overcome.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stevens v McLouth Steel Products Corp, </em>433 Mich 365, 370; 446 NW2d 95 (1989), quoting <em>Rizzo v Kretschmer, </em>389 Mich 363, 372; 207 NW2d 316 (1973). <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the court concludes that it is impossible for the record to be developed any further, summary disposition is appropriate. <em>Radtke v Everett, </em>442 Mich 368, 374; 501 NW2d 155 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">I. JUST-CAUSE EMPLOYMENT</p>\n<p id=\"ANBb\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Employment contracts for an \u201cindefinite\u201d duration are presumed to be terminable at the will of either party, unless they contain distinguishing attributes or consideration in addition to the services to be rendered. <em>Lynas v Maxwell Farms, </em>279 Mich 684, 687; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>273 NW 315 (1937). This presumption is founded on the fact that the parties technically possess complete freedom to contract before entering into the agreement. <em>Toussaint v Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>408 Mich 579, 600; 292 NW2d 880 (1980). It is not considered substantive in nature, but, rather, was judicially created to serve as a rule of construction in deducing the parties\u2019 intentions when no other indications exist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\">[T]he presumption provides assurance that oral contracts for an indefinite term, which fall outside the statute of frauds, will be recognized only where circumstances suggest both parties intended to be bound. <em>[Rowe v Montgomery Ward &amp; Co, Inc, </em>437 Mich 627, 636; 473 NW2d 268 (1991).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The presumption of employment at will may be overcome by proof of \u201ca contractual provision for a definite term of employment or a provision forbidding discharge absent just cause.\u201d <em>Rood v General Dynamics Corp, </em>444 Mich 107, 117; 507 NW2d 591 (1993), citing <em>Rowe, supra </em>at 636-637. A contract for just-cause employment may be established in three ways. First, it may be formed by an \u201cexplicit\u201d promise. <em>Rowe, supra </em>at 668 (Boyle, J., concurring), citing Perritt, Employee Dismissal Law <em>&amp; </em>Practice (2d ed), \u00a7 4.1, p 173. Second, it may be \u201cmanifested by the words or other conduct\u201d of the parties assenting to the agreement. <em>Rood, supra </em>at 117, n 17. Third, it may be \u201cimplied by law\u201d because the employer\u2019s statement regarding its \u201cpolicies and procedures instillfed] [a] \u2018legitimate expectation!]\u2019 of job security in [the] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>employees.\u201d <em>Rood, supra </em>at 117-118, citing <em>Toussaint, supra </em>at 615.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Under the third, when a policy manual is at issue, the court decides whether those sections that address employee discharge \u201care reasonably capable of being interpreted as promises of just-cause employment,\u201d that is, whether an ordinary individual, marked by reason and sensibility, viewing the objective manifestations of the parties\u2019 intent, could conclude that discharge would be only for just cause. <em>Rood, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>A just-cause obligation will not automatically arise where the manual lists conduct that constitutes a just basis for termination. In <em>Reid v Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co, </em>790 F2d 453, 460 (CA 6, 1986), quoting in part <em>Toussaint, supra </em>at 617, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">The fact that certain acts were identified as conduct that might lead to discharge did not indicate that these acts were the exclusive permissible grounds for discharge. Moreover, the Sears handbook had no language similar to that relied upon in <em>Toussaint: </em>\u201cto treat employees leaving Blue Cross in a fair and consistent manner and to release employees for just cause only.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Any verbal assurances or statements of policy and procedure regarding job security must be clear and unequivocal to overcome the presumption of employment at will. <em>Rowe, supra </em>at 640-641, quoting <em>Bullock v Automobile Club of Michigan, </em>432 Mich 472, 517; 444 NW2d 114 (1989), and Farnsworth, Contracts, \u00a7 7.10, p 492. To reach this threshold, \u201cthe statements must clearly permit a construction which supports the asserted meaning.\u201d <em>Rowe, supra </em>at 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">In evaluating verbal expressions, the court considers \u201call the relevant circumstances surrounding the transaction, including all writings, oral statements, and other conduct by which the parties manifested their intent.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing Farnsworth, Contracts, \u00a7 7.10, p 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">If the employer has manifested a just-cause policy, the employer may unilaterally change it to one of employment at will, regardless of whether such right was reserved by the employer from the outset:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>The very definition of \u201cpolicy\u201d negates a legitimate expectation of permanence ... a \u201cpolicy\u201d is commonly understood to be a flexible framework for operational guidance, not a perpetually binding contractual obligation. In the modem economic climate, the operating policies of a business enterprise must be adaptable and responsive to change. <em>[In re Certified Question (Bankey v Storer Broadcasting Co), </em>432 Mich 438, 455-456; 443 NW2d 112 (1989).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">If the employer so chooses, then <em>reasonable notice must be given to all those affected. </em>\u201cReasonable notification is not necessarily actual notification\u201d;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> rather, <em>the method instituted must be calculated in its objective of providing notice to those affected and not invoke the appearance of bad faith in its assurance of actually giving notice. In re Certified Question, supra </em>at 457 (\u201cfor the revocation of a discharge-for-cause policy to become legally effective, reasonable notice of the change must be uniformly given to affected employees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Plaintiff makes two arguments. First, plaintiff argues that certain representations were made by management regarding job security. She claims that when she was called by another company about employment, Archer and Joseph Sheehan, the persons who originally hired her and Ozar, plaintiffs initial supervisor, told her that \u201cthey did not want [her] to leave .... You do a good job. You\u2019re very secure here. We\u2019d like you to stay for long-term employment . . . .\u201d She adds that individually, Ozar told her that \u201che would really like [her] to stay. [She] had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>very secure job at Howmet. [She] had a lot of potential,\u201d she would be missed, and he and Archer and Sheehan \u201choped\u201d she would decide to stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">We conclude that these claimed assurances plaintiff received from Archer, Sheehan, and Ozar were not sufficiently \u201c \u2018clear and unequivocal to overcome the presumption of employment at will,\u2019 \u201d <em>Rood, supra </em>at 119, quoting <em>Rowe, supra </em>at 645, but, rather, represented that they \u201choped\u201d the employment relationship would \u201chave a significant duration.\u201d <em>Rowe, supra </em>at 640, quoting <em>Carpenter v American Excelsior Co, </em>650 F Supp 933, 936, n 6 (ED Mich, 1987) (\u201cany orally grounded contractual obligation for permanent employment \u2018must be based on <em>more than </em>an expression of an optimistic hope of a long relationship\u2019 \u201d) (emphasis previously supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Second, plaintiff contends that she was told that the disclaimer<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> she helped affix in newly hired employees\u2019 policy manuals in 1981, applied only to new employees and that she \u201creasonably relied upon the written . . . statements and representations made by defendant^\u201d in its policy manual. When plaintiff was originally hired, the policy manual she received expressed that \u201c[n]o employee will be terminated without proper cause or reason.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">This language, standing alone, instilled in plaintiff a legitimate expectation of just-cause employment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>However, the penultimate paragraph of the manual stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">The contents of this booklet are not intended to establish, and should not be interpreted to constitute any contract between the Misco Whitehall Division, Product Support Operations, Reactive Metal Operations or the Technical Center of Howmet Turbine Components Corporation and any employee, or group of employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">We conclude that a question of fact exists regarding whether defendant\u2019s pre-1981 manual permitted plaintiff to have a legitimate expectation of just-cause employment. See <em>Rood, supra </em>at 140-141.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Defendant failed to clearly manifest an intent because of the contradictory language within the manual. The average employee may not have interpreted the penultimate paragraph to contradict the language of the just-cause provision. Furthermore, the penultimate paragraph specifically lists several divisions within defendant\u2019s Whitehall operation. Plaintiff\u2019s division, human resources, was not listed. See n 2. This alone could allow plaintiff to reasonably believe that the penultimate paragraph did not apply to her.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>We conclude that the contradictory provisions are open to differing, but reasonable, interpretations. Thus, a question of fact exists regarding whether plaintiff had a legitimate expectation of just-cause employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Despite the contradictory provisions, defendant asserts that plaintiff had actual knowledge of the disclaimer she helped affix in newly hired employees\u2019 manuals in 1981, extinguishing any expectations she may have had regarding just-cause employment. We agree she had knowledge of the disclaimer. She worked in defendant\u2019s human resource department and helped place the disclaimer in handbooks to be given to new employees. Notwithstanding, it is undisputed that plaintiff did not receive a new handbook, nor was she told that the disclaimer applied to her. At the September 14, 1992, summary proceeding, the following exchange took place between the trial court and defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\"><em>The Court: </em>Did [defendant] give any notice to [plaintiff]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\"><em>[Defense </em>Counsel]: There was no direct notice to her in terms of a memorandum, but she was involved in the company putting the sticker in the book. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\"><em>The Court: </em>Well, she didn\u2019t put it in her book, did she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number><em>[Defense Counsel]: </em>Well, that\u2019s trae.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Accordingly, because defendant could have easily provided notice to all those it intended to be affected by the disclaimer, we conclude that the method of notification instituted was not reasonably calculated to uniformly assure awareness of the change for all defendant\u2019s affected employees,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> as well as hold that plaintiff\u2019s legitimate expectation of just-cause employment was left undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">H. REDUCTION IN WORK FORCE</p>\n<p id=\"AA\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">A reduction in a work force for economic reasons constitutes termination for \u201cjust cause.\u201d <em>McCart v J Walter Thompson USA, Inc, </em>437 Mich 109, 114; 469 NW2d 284 (1991), citing <em>Friske v Jasinski Builders, Inc, </em>156 Mich App 468, 472; 402 NW2d 42 (1986).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In <em>Friske, supra </em>at 472, the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">[Discharge for economic reasons, as determined by and within the complete discretion of the board of directors of defendant corporation, constitutes termination for sufficient cause. To hold otherwise would impose an unworkable economic burden upon employers to stay in business to the point of bankruptcy in order to satisfy employment contracts and related agreements terminable only for good or sufficient cause.<footnotemark>[21]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Layoffs that axe conducted must be bona fide, that is, business conditions must have necessitated the reduction in work force. <em>McCart, supra </em>at 115. In <em>McCart, </em>the defendant sought summary disposition, contending that the plaintiff was discharged as part of a work-force reduction. Despite all the plaintiffs allegations regarding why he was wrongfully discharged, he \u201cconceded\u201d that the \u201cdefendant was instituting layoffs for economic reasons . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court concluded that \u201c[i]n the absence of any sufficient response from [the] plaintiff, [the] defendant\u2019s proofs . . . were adequate to support summary disposition on the ground that [the] plaintiff\u2019s termination was for bona fide economic reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Therefore, where a defendant asserts work-force reduction in defense of its decision to discharge an employee, that employee, to establish a genuine issue of material fact that the employer\u2019s decision was not bona fide, may not merely rely on unsubstantiated allegations or denials in the pleadings, but, rather, must come forward with admissible evidence, affidavits, or other evidentiary materials, demonstrating the existence of a factual dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Having set forth the controlling principles, we now turn to plaintiff\u2019s contention that defendant lacked just-cause to discharge her.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Plaintiff contests the genuineness of defendant\u2019s economic motivation in discharging her. Plaintiff claims that her review of defendant\u2019s corporate salary reports evidences that defendant had actually hired more people from 1988 to 1990. However, this docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>mentation is not part of the record.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In spite of plaintiff\u2019s failure to present this evidence, it would be of no consequence because the evidence related to the period from 1988 through December 1990. Plaintiff was discharged on November 1, 1991. Defendant\u2019s decision to institute a work-force reduction was based on a forecasted economic decline in 1992. See n 5 and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In addition, plaintiff herself admits that defendant had been conducting an rif from January 1988, until the time of her discharge, \u201cas a method of dealing with [the] economic downturn . . . .\u201d Notwithstanding, plaintiff submits that a Pechiney report called \u201cDirect Magazine\u201d published in May 1991, claimed sales figures for defendant corporation in the amount of $973 million, sales backlogs in excess of $1 billion, anticipated sales for 1991 of over $1 billion, as well as projected overall continued upward growth. We conclude, however, that defendant evidenced that Pechiney is a huge French-owned conglomerate. See n 1. Defendant could have overall profitability, yet require reductions in operating and capital expenditures in its subsidiaries.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, our attention is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>directed at the economic disposition of defendant\u2019s Whitehall operation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Plaintiff also asserts that her testimony in a case brought against defendant involving another employee supports her contention. See n 24. But, her allegations are based solely on \u201cinformation and belief\u201d or inadmissible evidence, and, as such, even though we are required to view plaintiff\u2019s case in its most favorable light, we are given nothing to view that would permit us to conclude that the record before us could be developed at trial to the extent that it would leave open an issue on which reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>able minds could differ. <em>Durant v Stahlin, </em>375 Mich 628, 639; 135 NW2d 392 (1965); <em>Rizzo, supra </em>at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Therefore, because we choose not to second-guess employers\u2019 decisions regarding day-to-day management operations,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and because plaintiff failed to present evidence demonstrating the existence of bad faith on behalf of defendant in its aim to reduce costs, we hold that defendant\u2019s decision to conduct a reduction in work force was proper as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">We conclude that plaintiff\u2019s relief, if any, rests in the Civil Rights Act. See MCL 37.2202; MSA 3.548(202).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">In this instance, the Court of Appeals provided relief to plaintiff by concluding that defendant\u2019s decision to reduce its work force was a mere pretext to discrimination. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Bona fide economic reasons are just cause for discharge. <em>McCart [supra </em>at 114]. However, an employer may not use economic necessity as a pretext for unlawful discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 115. When the parties dispute the genuineness of the economic necessity, the question of just cause is one for the trier of fact. <em>Ewers v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>178 Mich App 371, 378-379; 443 NW2d 504 (1989). Here, plaintiff has presented documentary evidence that Howmet was not in an economic downturn during this period and that in reality its sales and net income were increasing and that it continued to hire personnel while it was discharging current employees. Giving the benefit of every reasonable doubt to plaintiff, we find that she has raised a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether Howmet\u2019s proffered economic justification was a mere pretext for discrimination, and this issue is best left to the jury to resolve. <em>McCart, supra </em>at 115-116; <em>Ewers, supra </em>at 373-374. [209 Mich App 179, 198-199; 530 NW2d 135 (1995).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In so holding, the Court of Appeals erred by confusing just-cause analysis with discrimination analysis under the Civil Rights Act. It held that plaintiffs discharge constituted a breach of contract. <em>Id. </em>at 199.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>However, defendant presented evidence of the economic necessity to conduct an rif, e.g., a decline in military and commercial aircraft, as well as a more competitive market. See n 5 and accompanying text, and n 23. Therefore, we are persuaded that the Court of Appeals should have addressed plaintiffs claim in light of the Civil Rights Act, so that it could determine whether defendant relied on prohibited criteria in making its decision to discharge plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Accordingly, we now turn to plaintiffs contention that she presented evidence establishing that, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s claim of economic necessity, its actual motive for discharging her was to discriminate against her on the basis of her age and sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">m. DISCRIMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"AEE\">A. CIVIL RIGHTS ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The Civil Rights Act is codified in MCL 37.2202; MSA 3.548(202). In particular, subsection 202(1) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">(1) An employer shall not do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>(a) Fail or refuse to hire or recruit, discharge, or otherwise discriminate against an individual with respect to employment, compensation, or a term, condition, or privilege of employment, because of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Ever since our decision in <em>Matras v Amoco Oil Co, </em>424 Mich 675, 683; 385 NW2d 586 (1986), we have looked to <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp v Green, </em>411 US 792; 93 S Ct 1817; 36 L Ed 2d 668 (1973), and its progeny for guidance when addressing the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>the Supreme Court promulgated a presumption-based approach that encompassed special rules governing the order of proof when a plaintiff attempts to establish his claim by circumstantial evidence. The <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>approach has been applied to other matters involving employee discharge as well as other types of disparate treatment cases, notwithstanding that <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>arose under the context of title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 USC 2000 <em>et seq. </em>Hence, this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Matras, supra, </em>suggests that <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>applies to plaintiff\u2019s claims of discrimination based on sex as well as age.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The approach was not meant to be inflexible, but, rather, was developed to serve as \u201ca <em>sensible, </em>orderly way <em>to evaluate the evidence in light of common experience </em>as it bears on the critical question of discrimination.\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> See <em>Adama v Doehler-Jarvis, </em>115 Mich App 82, 95; 320 NW2d 298 (1982), citing <em>Loeb v Textron, Inc, </em>600 F2d 1003, 1016-1017 (CA 1, 1979) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>(emphasis added). The underlying purpose in viewing \u201cthe evidence in light of common experience\u201d was set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Furnco Construction Corp v Waters, </em>438 US 567, 577; 98 S Ct 2943; 57 L Ed 2d 957 (1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">[W]e are willing to presume this largely because we know from our experience that more often than not people do not act in a totally arbitrary manner, without any underlying reasons, especially in a business setting. Thus, when all legitimate reasons for rejecting an applicant have been eliminated as possible reasons for the employer\u2019s actions, it is more likely than not the employer, who we generally assume acts only with some reason, based his decision on an impermissible consideration such as race.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>approach, the burden of persuasion always rests with the plaintiff to prove that the prohibited discriminatory treatment by the employer was a determining factor used in its decision to discharge. <em>St Mary\u2019s Honor Center v Hicks, </em>509 US 502, 507; 113 S Ct 2742; 125 L Ed 2d 407 (1993), citing <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v Burdine, </em>450 US 248, 253; 101 S Ct 1089; 67 L Ed 2d 207 (1981).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Thus, the plaintiff must prove that the employer\u2019s explanation was a pretext to discrimination. The plaintiff can rely on the same evidence to prove both pretext and discrimination as long as the evidence would enable a reasonable factfinder to infer that the employer\u2019s decision had a discriminatory basis. <em>Udo v Tomes, </em>54 F3d 9, 13 (CA 1, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The approach involves three stages. In the first stage, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>in order to create the rebuttable presumption of discrimination. The prima facie showing itself involves four parts.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The plaintiff must show that (1) he was a member of a protected class,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> (2) he suffered an adverse employment action, (3) he was qualified for the position, and (4) others, similarly situated and outside the protected class, were unaffected by the employer\u2019s adverse conduct, suggesting that discrimination was a determining factor in defendant\u2019s adverse conduct toward the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In the second stage, following the plaintiff establishing a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant-employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision. <em>McDonnell Douglas, supra </em>at 802. If the employer is unable to satisfy its burden of production, it is presumed that the basis of the employer\u2019s decision was discriminatory. <em>Burdine, supra </em>at 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">If the defendant rebuts the presumption, then, in the third stage, the burden of production shifts back to the plaintiff creating \u201c \u2018a new level of specificity.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States Postal Service Bd of Governors v Aikens, </em>460 US 711, 715; 103 S Ct 1478; 75 L Ed 2d 403 (1983), quoting <em>Burdine, supra </em>at 255; see also <em>McDonnell Douglas, supra </em>at 802-805. At this point, the plaintiff must establish that the employer\u2019s articu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>lation was merely a pretext to discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 804; <em>Burdine, supra </em>at 256.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">B. <em>ST MARYS HONOR CENTER v HICKS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Since the inception of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>approach, for the judiciary, \u201c[f]inding a balance between protecting victims of subtle prejudice on the one hand, and overreaching into legitimate decision-making of business on the other,\u201d has proven itself a difficult task.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This is because in <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>the \u201c[Supreme] Court did not . . . attempt to give any meaningful guidance as to how the specification of the required prima facie proof would be determined\u201d for the third stage. Malamud, <em>The last minuet: Disparate treatment after </em>Hicks, 93 Mich L R 2229, 2245 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s most recent attempt to provide guidance came in <em>Hicks. </em>In that case, the Court addressed whether a trier of fact may issue judgment as a matter of law in favor of a plaintiff when the plaintiff has proven that an employer\u2019s proffered reason for its employment action is false. In ruling that this alone is not adequate, the Court rewrote the third stage of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>approach. According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>to the Court, once the employer rebuts the presumption, <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>is no longer relevant \u2014 having fulfilled its role of forcing the defendant to come forward with some response, the presumption \u201csimply drops out of the picture.\u201d <em>Hicks, supra </em>at 511, quoting <em>Burdine, supra </em>at 255. After the defendant\u2019s rebuttal, \u201cthe trier of fact proceeds to decide the ultimate question: whether plaintiff has proven \u2018that the defendant [was] intentionally discriminated against . . .\u2019 because of his race . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Id. </em>Once the defendant satisfies its burden of production, the factfinder must then decide not whether that evidence is credible but \u201c \u2018whether the rejection was discriminatory within the meaning of Title VIL\u2019 \u201d <em>Hicks, supra </em>at 519. \u201cIt is not enough ... to disbelieve the employer; the factfinder must <em>believe </em>the plaintiff\u2019s explanation of intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Court held, regarding the plaintiff\u2019s establishment of pretext, that \u201cproving the employer\u2019s reason false <em>becomes part of (and often considerably assists) </em>the greater enterprise of proving that the real reason was intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>Hicks, supra </em>at 517 (emphasis added). The Court concluded that the factfinder\u2019s disbelief of the employer\u2019s proffered reasons, together with the elements of the prima facie case, might suffice to show intentional discrimination. <em>Hicks, supra </em>at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Although the <em>Hicks </em>majority appeared to be unambiguous, \u201cmany readers have found it to be otherwise.\u201d 1 Lindemann &amp; Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law (3d ed), p 24. Consequently, it is not surprising that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>[s]ome employers have argued that, in order to defeat an employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment, <em>Hicks </em>requires plaintiffs to offer . . . <em>both </em>that the employer\u2019s articulated reason was false and that the employer\u2019s true reason was discriminatory \u2014 i.e., a \u201cpretext-plus\u201d standard. Some plaintiffs, on the other hand, have argued that once a prima facie case of discrimination is put forward, summary judgment for the employer <em>never </em>is appropriate, even if no evidence is put forward to refute the employer\u2019s articulated nondiscriminatory reason, because the factfinder\u2019s disbelief alone should be enough to permit a finding of pretext. <em>[Id., </em>p 25 (citation omitted; emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">However, the majority in <em>Hicks </em>rejected both extremes. See <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Comm v Yenkin-Majestic Paint Corp, </em>1997 US App LEXIS 4348. Instead, it favored an intermediate position. See <em>Hicks, supra </em>at 510-511. The majority held that \u201c[e]ven though (as we say here) rejection of the defendant\u2019s proffered reasons is enough at law to sustain a finding of discrimination, <em>there must be a finding of discrimination.\u201d Id. </em>at 511, n 4. We, too, favor such a position and hold that when viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, the evidence must create a material issue of fact on which reasonable minds could find that the employer\u2019s stated reason is a pretext for discrimination for summary judgment to be precluded. Furthermore, we hold that \u201cevidence sufficient to discredit a defendant\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions, taken together with the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case, [may be] sufficient to support [but not compel] a finding of discrim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ination.\u201d <em>Combs v Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F3d 1519, 1535 (CA 11, 1997).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In other words, we expressly adopt the intermediate approach endorsed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Hicks. </em>For a plaintiff to survive summary disposition, he must always present an issue of fact regarding whether the defendant impermissibly discriminated. In some contexts, this may be shown merely by disproving the employer\u2019s articulated reason, if, and only if, disproving the employer\u2019s reason also shows discrimination. See <em>Hicks, supra </em>at 511, 519. See also <em>Combs, supra </em>at 1535. In other contexts, merely disproving an employer\u2019s articulated reason will not prove discrimination. The bottom line is that there must always be evidence upon which reasonable minds could conclude that discrimination was the true motive for the decision. At summary proceedings, the evidence must always be taken in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">C. <em>MATRAS v AMOCO OIL CO</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In <em>Matras, </em>the plaintiff was discharged as a result of the defendant\u2019s lay-off plan. In that case, we observed that \u201c[a] jury c[ould] find that the discharge was \u2018because of age\u2019 even if age was not the sole factor\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Evidence that a competent older employee was terminated and a younger employee was retained, is insufficient standing alone to establish a prima facie case when the employer reduces his work force because of economic necessity. The rationale behind the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>formula is that its four-part test alone \u201celiminates the most likely legitimate causes for the employer\u2019s adverse action.\u201d This formulation is incomplete in the work-force-reduction situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">To establish a prima facie case of age discrimination when an employer lays off employees for economic reasons, the . . . employee [must] present sufficient evidence on the ultimate question \u2014 whether age was a determining factor in the decision to discharge the older protected employee. Accordingly, in the instant case, the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>prima facie case approach folds into the traditional directed verdict/judgment notwithstanding the verdict standard. <em>[Id. </em>at 684-685.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">We concluded that the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>approach folds into the traditional summary disposition or directed verdict standard because in the context of an RIF we assume that the burdens of production required by the respective parties under the approach have already been met.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> As a result, because the burdens of production have been satisfied by the respective parties, all its presumptions \u201cdrop out\u201d and the plaintiff is left to prove that reasonable persons could draw differing conclusions regarding whether discrimination was the true moti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>vation underlying the employer\u2019s adverse action rather than an rif.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Even though our decision in <em>Matras, </em>as well as the Supreme Court decisions in <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>and <em>Hicks </em>came after full trials, the principle is the same in summary proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">[O]nce the employer has advanced a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for its adverse employment decision, the plaintiff, before becoming entitled to bring the case before the trier of fact, must show evidence sufficient for the factfinder reasonably to conclude that the employer\u2019s decision to discharge him or her was wrongfully based on age. \u201cDirect or indirect evidence of discriminatory motive <em>may do, but \u2018the evidence as a whole . . . must be sufficient for a reasonable factfinder to infer that the employer\u2019s decision was motivated by age animus. \u2019 \u201d </em>Thus, the plaintiff cannot avert summary judgment if the record is devoid of adequate direct or circumstantial evidence of discriminatory animus on the part of the employer. <em>\\Woods v Friction Materials, Inc, </em>30 F3d 255, 260 (CA 1, 1994) (citations omitted, emphasis added).]<footnotemark>[36]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">We recognize, however, in the context of an RIF, that merely showing someone similarly situated to the plaintiff who is outside the protected class will not be sufficient. In concluding so, we are guided by the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>O\u2019Connor v Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp, </em>517 US 308, 311-313; 116 S Ct 1307; 134 L Ed 2d 433 (1996). In <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>the Court noted that a \u201csubstantially younger [person] than the plaintiff is a far more reliable indicator of age discrimination than is the fact that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>was replaced by someone outside the protected class\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">As the very name \u201cprima facie case\u201d suggests, there must be at least a logical connection between each element of the prima facie case and the illegal discrimination for which it establishes a \u201clegally mandatory, rebuttable presumption,\u201d <em>Burdine, supra </em>at 254, n 7. <em>The element of replacement by someone under 40 fails this requirement. The discrimination prohibited by the adea </em>is discrimination \u201cbecause of <em>[an] individual\u2019s age,\u201d </em>29 USC 623(a)(1), though the prohibition is \u201climited to individuals who are at least 40 years of age,\u201d \u00a7 631(a). <em>This language does not ban discrimination against employees because they are aged 40 or older; it bans discrimination against employees because of their age, </em>but limits the protected class to those who are 40 or older.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">Because the [Civil Rights Act] prohibits discrimination on the basis of age and not class membership, the fact that a replacement is <em>substantially younger than the plaintiff is afar more reliable indicator of age discrimination than is the fact that the plaintiff was replaced by someone outside the protected class. [Id. </em>at 311-313 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">For these reasons, to survive a motion for summary disposition, once \u201cthe employer articulates a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason [for laying off the plaintiff,] . . . [t]he plaintiff <em>must </em>then introduce sufficient evidence to support two additional findings: (1) that the employer\u2019s articulated reason for [laying off the plaintiff] is a pretext, and (2) that the true reason is discriminatory.\u201d <em>Smith v Stratus Computer, Inc, </em>40 F3d 11, 16 (CA 1, 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Under some circumstances, however, as we previously observed, a plaintiff may not need to introduce additional evidence, aside from the evidence he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>presented to support these findings in the first stage under <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>because (1) the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case may establish that the employer\u2019s articulated reason for its adverse employment action is a pretext and (2) in establishing that the articulated reason was pretext, the plaintiff may have created a question of fact regarding whether the true reason is discriminatory. In other words, under such circumstances, simply disproving the employer\u2019s articulated reason will suffice if, and only if, disproving the employer\u2019s reason also proves discrimination.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In other instances, however, simply disproving an employer\u2019s articulated reason will not establish discrimination, and, as such, the plaintiff would then have to introduce additional evidence, aside from that which had already been presented in the first two stages of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>approach, to support these two findings. We recognize that additional evidence may be necessary because a plaintiff <em>will not always present \u201ca triable question of pretext simply because the plaintiff disputes the employer\u2019s stated reason(s); </em>put differently, that there may be a triable question of <em>falsity </em>does not necessarily mean that there is a triable question of discrimination.\u201d Employment Discrimination Law, <em>supra, </em>p 26 (emphasis added and in original), citing, e.g., inter alia, <em>Udo, supra </em>at 13 (\u201cto avoid summary judgment, the plaintiff [must prove both] that the employer\u2019s articulated reason ... is a pretext, and . . . that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>the trae reason is discriminatory\u201d). Therefore, we hold that in all actions involving claims of discrimination, there must always be evidence upon which reasonable minds could conclude that discrimination was the true motive for the employer\u2019s adverse conduct against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">D. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We will assume that plaintiff established a prima facie case under <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>because her claim centers on defendant\u2019s assertion that it was conducting an RIF. Accordingly, we must give the benefit of every reasonable doubt to plaintiff and determine whether she might sufficiently develop the record now before us to permit a jury to find that defendant\u2019s proffered explanation as applied to her<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> was a pretext to discrimination.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">As evidence of age discrimination, plaintiff notes that it was only when Ozar retired and was replaced by Malady that problems arose. Thus, for approximately the first thirteen years with defendant corporation it is undisputed that she excelled in her duties as employment manager. We are unpersuaded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>this permits an inference of discriminatory animus on the basis of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Aside from plaintiffs problems with Malady, it is undisputed that approximately six weeks before plaintiff\u2019s discharge, defendant hired Achterhoff for the new position created at defendant\u2019s Operhall Research Center. Achterhoff was a thirty-one-year-old woman who was paid ten thousand dollars more a year than plaintiff.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Conversely, plaintiff, who was forty-four years old at the time of her discharge, had nineteen years of experience in the human resources department.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Further, over those nineteen years, it is undisputed that she had been awarded a succession of promotions. Yet, in September before her formal discharge, defendant, while conducting an RIF, decided to hire Achterhoff and discharge plaintiff.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Furthermore, defendant\u2019s hiring of Achterhoff must be considered in light of the fact that plaintiff and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Achterhoff both \u201chad very similar employment histories . . . [with] comparative qualifications.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> <em>Post, </em>pp 71-72. Hence, if both had similar qualifications, the fact that Achterhoff received greater pay than that of plaintiff at a time defendant asserts it was conducting an RIF creates a question of fact regarding defendant\u2019s motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Plaintiff also evidenced defendant\u2019s inconsistency in its hiring Billingsley.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Roof testified that he discharged plaintiff to reduce the 1992 fiscal budget for the human resources department, yet it is undisputed that at least part of Billingsley\u2019s salary was paid out of that budget.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> We note that plaintiff\u2019s proofs regarding Billingsley standing alone would present a rather weak case. Nevertheless, we consider it along with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>the other evidence she presented with respect to her age-discrimination claim.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Plaintiff need not show that age was <em>the </em>determining factor in defendant\u2019s decision to discharge her. Rather, she need only prove that it was \u201c\u00ab determining factor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, we are persuaded that, despite defendant\u2019s claim that it based its decision on economic necessity, plaintiff produced evidence that would permit reasonable persons to conclude that age more likely than not was a determining factor in the adverse employment action defendant took against plaintiff. She presented proof that defendant hired individuals, Achterhoff and Billingsley, who were younger and, thus, along with the inconsistencies in defendant\u2019s proffered explanation, created a reliable indication that \u201cbut for\u201d plaintiff\u2019s age, she would not have been discharged. See <em>O\u2019Connor, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Thus, this case is distinguishable from <em>Matras, supra, </em>in which there was a lack of \u201cevidence that management favored younger workers . . . , tended to fire older workers ... , or suggested that older <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>workers were disfavored\u201d and where the defendant employer\u2019s RIF was felt by workers of all ages. <em>Matras, supra </em>at 713 (Riley, J., dissenting). Rather, here, defendant contends it discharged plaintiff out of economic necessity, but it then hired substantially younger persons at higher rates of pay with markedly less experience than that possessed by plaintiff, despite its claim that it was reducing its work force out of economic necessity. Plaintiff demonstrated the anomaly in defendant\u2019s assertion that it was conducting an RIF.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Accordingly, this evidence suggests that defendant\u2019s reason for discharging plaintiff was only a pretext for favoring the younger hirees over the older plaintiff.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> We axe persuaded that plaintiff\u2019s proofs make it more likely than not that \u201c[defendant\u2019s] proffered explanation [as applied to this plaintiff] is unworthy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>credence.\u201d <em>La Montagne v American Convenience Products, Inc, </em>750 F2d 1405, 1409 (CA 7, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">As evidence of sex discrimination, plaintiff points to her dealings with Malady. The Court of Appeals agreed that this evidence was sufficient to raise \u201ca genuine issue of material fact with respect to a prima facie case of gender discrimination, i.e., that she was treated more harshly than similarly situated male employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">While we agree that these facts raise suspicion, we are persuaded that the Court of Appeals erred by exclusively focusing on the confrontations plaintiff had with Malady. We conclude that it failed to properly determine whether defendant considered plaintiffs sex in its decision to discharge her. This is not to say that plaintiffs confrontations with Malady are irrelevant. Instead, these confrontations must be considered in light of the ultimate question \u2014 whether plaintiff\u2019s sex was a determining factor in defendant\u2019s decision to discharge her.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Hence, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to plaintiff and drawing every reasonable inference in her best regard, we conclude that plaintiff created a genuine issue of material fact whether defendant considered her sex in its decision to discharge her. Plaintiffs confrontations with Malady were not isolated incidents. Before Roofs hiring of Malady in March 1987, plaintiff had a succession of promotions, culminating in her appointment to the position of \u201cEmployment Manager.\u201d When Roof became plaintiffs direct supervisor in 1985, because of Ozar\u2019s retirement, she continued to receive favorable employment evaluations, indicating that her performance was outstanding. Then, in March 1987, Roof hired Malady as his direct subordinate and plaintiffs supervisor. Plaintiff retained her job title as \u201cEmployment Manager,\u201d even though Malady only served as a supervisor of the Whitehall Machined Products Division. See n 2. In June 1987, defendant corporation\u2019s annual picnic was held. Before the picnic, Malady requested that all female employees in the human resources department wear dresses. Plaintiff, having attended the picnic in previous years, was aware of no company requirement that mandated that all female employees wear dresses. Accordingly, because she had never worn a dress in the past, and being unhappy with the inconvenience of being forced to wear a dress to an outdoor picnic, plaintiff wore slacks. Soon after the picnic, Malady inexplicably conducted a performance evaluation of plaintiff. He did so despite standard operating procedures for the human resources department, recognizing that performance evaluations were to be conducted in December of each calendar year as a precursor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>evaluations and decisions regarding merit pay raises, as well as promotions. Malady\u2019s negative evaluation of plaintiff was the first she ever received while employed by defendant corporation, i.e., from the time plaintiff was hired in 1973 until this evaluation, fourteen years, she had never received a negative performance appraisal. Other confrontations between Malady and plaintiff soon ensued,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> which finally culminated with Boczkaja replacing plaintiff as employment manager and plaintiff being given the new title of human resources specialist. This is in light of the fact that Boczkaja was trained by plaintiff and had been her subordinate for the previous ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Standing alone, we believe that plaintiff\u2019s confrontations with Malady do not create a question of fact regarding whether sex was a determining factor in defendant corporation\u2019s decision to discharge her. However, these facts must not be viewed in a vacuum, but, rather, in light of the other facts now before us. The same day plaintiff was discharged, defendant hired Billingsley to work in the training program for the work-cell project. Billingsley had worked several different jobs, mostly involving manufacturing, yet was promoted to manager of training. Moreover, Roof stated that Billingsley\u2019s new position was to be included in his budget, despite defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>assertion that the human resources department had to reduce its budget by over $400,000 for the 1991 fiscal year. In light of defendant\u2019s contention that it was conducting an rif, a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that its hiring of Billingsley, at a higher rate of pay, even though he had substantially less experience than that possessed by plaintiff, was merely a pretext to discrimination. It is uncontested that a portion of Billingsley\u2019s salary was paid out of the human resources department\u2019s budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Reinforcing the genuineness of plaintiff\u2019s claim is the fact that plaintiff was not considered fairly for the position Achterhoff ultimately assumed. Inexplicably, plaintiff, who was fully qualified and possessed substantially more experience than Boczkaja, who had been her subordinate at one time, was not even considered for the new position the management of defendant\u2019s Operhall Research Center sought to create.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> In his deposition, Roof admitted that he never considered plaintiff for the new position, even though it included duties she could have assumed considering her nineteen years of experience at Howmet, as well as her \u201ccomparative qualifications\u201d to those of Achterhoff, who <em>eventually </em>was hired.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Of course, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>are not ruling that the Civil Rights Act mandates that employers establish an interdepartmental transfer program during the course of an RIF. See <em>Jameson v Arrow Co, </em>75 F3d 1528, 1532-1533 (CA 11, 1996).<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Rather, we observe, in the face of the evidence presented by plaintiff, that it appears pretextual that defendant would only consider Boczkaja and defendant Malady as candidates for the new position and ultimately hire Achterhoff. Moreover, it appears pretextual that defendant would hire Billingsley over the more qualified plaintiff to assume responsibility regarding training and development for the \u201cWhitehall training function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Thus, the record as a whole suggests, in light of common experience, that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether defendant\u2019s proffered explanation for discharging plaintiff was merely a pretext to age and sex discrimination.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>In this case, we conclude that defendant\u2019s policy statement could have reasonably created a legitimate expectation of just-cause employment. However, defendant\u2019s reduction in work force was bona fide as a matter of law. Notwithstanding, we conclude that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether age was a determining factor in defendant\u2019s decision to discharge plaintiff. Also, we conclude that a genuine issue of fact exists regarding whether defendant considered plaintiff\u2019s sex in its decision to terminate her.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Thus, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision holding that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing plaintiff\u2019s claim for breach of contract of just-cause employment. We affirm both the decision of the Court of Appeals concluding that plaintiff raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether defendant considered plaintiff\u2019s age as a determining factor in its decision to terminate her and its decision that a genuine issue exists regarding whether defendant considered plaintiff\u2019s sex in its decision to terminate her.</p>\n<judges id=\"b374-7\">Mallett, C.J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\"> Defendant is a subsidiary of Pechiney, a government-owned French conglomerate.

We disagree. In <em>Krantz, </em>the plaintiff deposed expert Dr. William King. He testified against defendant Howmet. Dr. King stated that \u201cthe corporation Howmet located in Greenwich, Connecticut, has been showing increased net worth, increased retained earnings, and increased sales over the past five years . . . so . . . pleading that they have financial difficulties seems unreasonable.\u201d Nevertheless, on being asked whether \u201cit [was] true that a business can be experiencing a decline in orders for its products and taking reasonably prudent business actions to reduce its work force so that the work force is in proportion to the work that it has,\u201d Dr. King answered \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Hence, Dr. King\u2019s testimony supports the conclusion that a company can have overall profitability and, yet, in order to maintain profitability, it may also need to reduce its work force. Even if Dr. King were to testify in this case, we are persuaded that his testimony would be of no consequence to invalidating defendant\u2019s company-wide rif. Moreover, he would have an insurmountable burden in demonstrating that defendant\u2019s discharge of approximately fifty percent of its work force at its Whitehall operation was merely a pretext to discharging plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b350-10\"> This Court had long ago decided that courts should be reluctant to second-guess management in its day-to-day operations.

See <em>Matras, supra </em>at 707 (Riley, J., dissenting), quoting <em>McDonnell Douglas, supra </em>at 802. Second, the evidence produced by the plaintiff in <em>Matras, supra, </em>was weaker, not stronger, than the evidence produced by plaintiff Lytle. For example, in <em>Matras, supra </em>at 713 (Riley, J., dissenting), \u201c[w]hat the record [did] show [was] that two younger people whose performance was rated the same as plaintiff\u2019s were also discharged.\u201d Accordingly, as compared to plaintiff Lytle, plaintiff Matras presented considerably weaker proof establishing that he was treated differently than others situated similarly to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\"> We must remember that the issue we now decide is not whether plaintiff was in fact discharged because of her age, that remains to be determined at trial.

The dissent itself ignores the fact that sex discrimination centers on whether one sex has been treated differently than a similarly situated individual from the opposite sex. Hence, because Achterhoff is female, we briefly reference that she was the individual eventually hired for the new human resources position at defendant Operhall Research Center. Because Malady and Boezkaja are male, they are more significant to our discussion. Roof testified that Malady and Boezkaja were the only ones considered from a list he compiled of potential candidates for the position. Moreover, in compiling the list, Roof admitted that plaintiff was not even considered. Thus, when Malady and Boezkaja were selected as possible candidates by Operhall management, plaintiff\u2019s name was nowhere to be found. Notwithstanding, the dissent contends that because \u201cseveral of [plaintiff\u2019s] former duties were assigned to female employees,\u201d that this \u201cis inconsistent with sex discrimination.\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 75. On the basis of the dissent\u2019s reasoning, plaintiff could only establish her claim if defendant corporation had discharged all its female employees. Such reasoning is misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b371-6\"> Plaintiff\u2019s responsibility as \u201cEmployment Manager\u201d was to administer defendant corporation\u2019s affirmative action program. In September 1987, Malady, without conferring with plaintiff, made a hiring for a job opening that was to be filled by plaintiff from her affirmative action/EEO file. She confronted Malady by telling him that he was undermining her affirmative action responsibilities. When Malady did not respond, plaintiff went to Roof and complained. Roof issued a memorandum objecting to his interference with plaintiff\u2019s responsibilities. Shortly thereafter, Malady published another negative written evaluation of plaintiff\u2019s performance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b372-6\"> See, e.g., <em>Jameson v Arrow Co, </em>75 F3d 1528, 1532-1533 (CA 11, 1996). Although the plaintiff in <em>Jameson, </em>applied for the position available before her discharge, it is clear plaintiff here wanted to be fairly considered for the position Achterhoff eventually assumed. Hence, \u201cwhere a job for which the plaintiff is qualified, and for which the plaintiff applies, is available at the time of termination, and the employer offers the job to an individual outside the protected age group, an inference of intentional discrimination is [sometimes] permissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1532.

After reviewing the qualifications of those listed, Operhall management identified Malady and Boczkaja as the two most promising candidates. Plaintiff\u2019s name never made the list.

See <em>ante </em>at 22. Furthermore, the lead opinion holds that plaintiff\u2019s \u201callegations are based solely on \u2018information and belief\u2019 or inadmissible evidence\u201d and \u201cwe are given nothing to view that would permit us to conclude that the record before us could be developed at trial . . . <em>\"Id. </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">I respectfully disagree. In a similar case against the same defendant, plaintiff was allowed to proceed to the jury regarding whether defendant\u2019s RIF was bona fide. In <em>Krantz v Howmet Coup </em>(Circuit Court No. 90-026815-CK; Court of Appeals No. 159045), defendant Howmet was sued under a wrongful discharge theory. Defendant maintained the same arguments and presented the same evidentiary material regarding the RIF as it has done here. However, plaintiff here has not had the same opportunity to present her evidence that the RIF was not bona fide.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Economic expert William King, Ph.D., provided key testimony in <em>Krantz </em>that, in his opinion, the RIF was not bona fide. However, before Dr. King had the opportunity to be deposed in this case, the court prematurely granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary disposition. Dr. King\u2019s discovery deposition was scheduled for October 10, 1992, but was canceled in conjunction with the trial court\u2019s decision on summary disposition, received by plaintiff on October 7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>1992. Ongoing discovery of defendant\u2019s experts was likewise scheduled for the same date. Furthermore, the parties stipulated to extend discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">It is premature for this Court to decide whether defendants\u2019 alleged rif was bona fide because it is clear that discoveiy in this matter was not complete, and, as indicated by the jury verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor in Krantz, it is certainly possible that a record may have been developed so that summary disposition for defendants should have been precluded. Therefore, I would remand this issue to the trial court for the completion of discovery so that plaintiff can have an equal opportunity to present evidence that defendants\u2019 alleged RIF was not bona fide.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">I also respectfully dissent from portion n(c) of the lead opinion, which states that \u201cthe Court of Appeals erred by confusing just-cause analysis with discrimination analysis under the Civil Rights Act.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 25. The Court of Appeals stated that \u201can employer may not use economic necessity as a pretext for unlawful discrimination. <em>[McCart v J Walter Thompson USA, Inc, </em>437 Mich 109, 115; 469 NW2d 284 (1991).] When the parties dispute the genuineness of the economic necessity, the question of just cause is one for the trier of fact.\u201d 209 Mich App 179, 198; 530 NW2d 135 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">In <em>McCart, </em>we stated that in order for a defendant to show that it discharged plaintiff for bona fide economic reasons, it must demonstrate two things: that \u201cadverse business conditions existed <em>and </em>that the elimination of plaintiff\u2019s position was necessitated by those conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115 (emphasis added). Therefore, where a plaintiff\u2019s proofs show that the elimination of his position was not motivated by the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>RIF, but rather by some other illegal reason, summary disposition should be precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">My position has been supported by two state supreme courts. In <em>Coelho v Posi-Seal Int\u2019l, Inc, </em>208 Conn 106, 122; 544 A2d 170 (1988), the Connecticut Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">We conclude that the question of whether an employer has terminated an employee because of a legitimate reduction in force or for other reasons is an issue to be determined by the trier of fact. An employer\u2019s contention that some employees were terminated as a result of a legitimate reduction in force does not necessarily establish that all employees were discharged for the same reason. <em>An employer may not use a reduction in force as a pretext to terminate other employees in violation of </em>contractual obligations, public policy <em>or statutory rights. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Further, in <em>Flanigan v Prudential Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>221 Mont 419, 426; 720 P2d 257 (1986), the Montana Supreme Court held that it was a matter for the trier of fact to determine whether an employee had been terminated as a result of a legitimate reduction in force or because of other factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Therefore, even if under the lead opinion\u2019s reasoning that the RIF was bona fide, where plaintiff has presented sufficient facts to show that she was not fired because of a legitimate RIF, but, rather, she was fired because of other illegal reasons, her claim for wrongful discharge should go to the jury.</p>\n<judges id=\"b377-9\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b377-10\">Boyle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AI2\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I write separately because I agree that plaintiff\u2019s wrongful-discharge claim fails, but disagree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>the lead opinion\u2019s rationale. I would not conclude, as does the lead opinion, that plaintiff had a legitimate expectation of just-cause employment on the basis of the statements in the handbook. The contractual disclaimer in the employee handbook belies this expectation, and there is no other record evidence sufficient to create a question of fact with regard to plaintiff\u2019s expectations of just-cause employment at the time she joined Howmet. With regard to plaintiff\u2019s employment discrimination claims, I concur with Justice Riley\u2019s statement of the legal standard a plaintiff must meet in order to survive summary disposition, but I dissent from her result. Because plaintiff did not present evidence sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact that her position would not have been eliminated \u201cbut for\u201d her age, <em>EEOC v Clay Printing Co, </em>955 F2d 936, 940 (CA 4, 1992), I agree with Justice Brickley that summary disposition for the defendant was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The lead opinion concludes that plaintiff had a legitimate expectation of just-cause employment on the basis of a statement in the employee handbook, that stated, \u201cNo employee will be terminated without proper cause or reason and not until management has made a careful review of all facts.\u201d Absent any qualifying language, this language would be sufficient to raise a legitimate expectation that employees would not be terminated without good cause. However, in an equally conspicuous segment, the final page of the handbook stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">The contents of this booklet are not intended to establish, and should not be interpreted to constitute any con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>tract between the Misco Whitehall Division, Product Support Operations, Reactive Metal Operations or the Technical Center of Howmet Turbine Components Corporation and any employee, or group of employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The lead opinion apparently concludes that the disclaimer of contractual obligation was ineffective with respect to plaintiff because she was employed by Howmet in the human resources department, which is not specifically mentioned in the disclaimer. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The handbook\u2019s title appeared on the cover substantially as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">YOUR FUTURE WITH HOWMET</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">MISCO WHITEHALL DIVISION PRODUCT SUPPORT OPERATIONS REACTIVE METAL OPERATIONS TECHNICAL CENTER</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">These are the same divisions mentioned in the disclaimer. It is true that plaintiff\u2019s department is not specifically mentioned in the disclaimer. However, plaintiffs department is also not mentioned anywhere else in the handbook. In short, plaintiff cannot have it both ways. Either the handbook applied to her employment relationship, in which case the just-cause language and the disclaimer must be read together, or it did not apply to her because the handbook was only intended to apply to those divisions specifically mentioned on the cover and in the disclaimer. In the latter case, of course, plaintiff could not assert the handbook as evidence of a just-cause policy for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>employees of the human resources department.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reading the handbook as a whole, I would conclude that no reasonable jury could conclude that plaintiff had a reasonable expectation of just-cause employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, plaintiff has not created a reasonable question of fact that the handbook was intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>apply only to the designated employees of one of the named divisions, as opposed to all employees of How-met Turbine Components Corporation. Instead, plaintiff contends that the just-cause language applied to her employment, which could be viewed as existing outside the specified divisions. Under these circumstances, she cannot assert that one part of the handbook applies to her while another does not. Thus, on the basis of a careful review of the record, I would conclude that there is no factual basis for the claim that plaintiff\u2019s <em>department </em>is a separate division of the Howmet Corporation, rather than a department within the company intended to serve several of its divisions. I would therefore conclude that the handbook was intended to apply to all employees of How-met Turbine Components Corporation who received it, including plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The handbook\u2019s language indicates that it was intended to apply to plaintiff\u2019s employment relationship with her employer, just as it was intended to cover defendant\u2019s relationship with all employees to whom the handbook was distributed out of plaintiff\u2019s human resources department. On page 4 the handbook states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">Welcome!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">We are pleased to have you <em>with Howmet Turbine Components Corporation. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">On page 5 the handbook states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">Our Pledge</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">We believe <em>Howmet is a good place to work. </em>We pledge that we will honor the following principles in our relations with you ....

It must be worn in a visible position at all times while you are on <em>Company property. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Finally, just before the contractual disclaimer on page 25, the handbook states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">This handbook briefly outlines your privileges, benefits and responsibilities <em>as an employee of Howmet. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-11\">It is not possible in any one booklet to list all the benefits and mutually helpful regulations, which come to or govern all types of employees. <em>If any portion of the information given is not completely clear to you, tell your foreman or supervisor what further information you want. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">Throughout the handbook, the terms \u201cHowmet,\u201d \u201cthe Company,\u201d and \u201cHowmet Turbine Components Corporation\u201d are used interchangeably, indicating an intent to describe Howmet\u2019s relationship with the industry, its neighbors, and its employees, without differentiating among the various divisions or depart-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>merits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff provides no evidence that this was one handbook used for the employees in the specified divisions, while other similar handbooks applied to other divisions or departments. Rather, the fact that plaintiffs human resources department served several Howmet divisions located in Whitehall is uncontested.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">I would conclude that the relevant statements in the handbook, the just-cause language and the disclaimer of contractual obligation, when read together, do not (1) \u201cjustify [an employee] in understanding that a commitment ha[d] been made,\u201d and (2) \u201cinstill[] a legitimate expectation of just cause employment . . . .\u201d <em>Rood v General Dynamics Corp, </em>444 Mich 107, 139; 507 NW2d 591 (1993). In <em>Rood </em>we stated, \u201c[W]e need not reach the question whether a disclaimer of intent to create contractual liability contained in an employee handbook is sufficient to disclaim liability under the legitimate expectations theory of <em>Toussaint.\u201d Id. </em>at 142. See <em>Toussaint v Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>408 Mich 579; 292 NW2d 880 (1980). I would reach the question here and conclude that the disclaimer was effective to protect defendant from this type of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>As we recognized in <em>Rood, </em>\u201c[t]he first step in analyzing a legitimate expectations claim under <em>Toussaint, </em>is to determine, <em>what, </em>if anything, the employer has promised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138. There, we quoted the Second Restatement of Contracts, \u00a7 2(1), for the proposition that \u201ca \u2018[p]romise [is] a manifestation of intention to act or refrain from acting in <em>a specified way, </em>so made as to justify a promisee in understanding that a commitment has been made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rood </em>at 138-139. We also observed that \u201cnot all policy statements will rise to the level of a promise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139. We continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">[W]e therefore hold that, in all claims brought under the legitimate expectations theory of <em>Toussaint, </em>the trial court should examine employer policy statements, concerning employee discharge, if any, to determine, as a threshold matter, whether such policies are reasonably capable of being interpreted as promises of just-cause employment. If the employer policies are incapable of such interpretation, then the court should dismiss .... If, however, the employer\u2019s policies relating to employee discharge are capable of two reasonable interpretations, the issue is for the jury. <em>[Id. </em>at 140-141.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In this case, the employer\u2019s relevant manifestations amounted to two separate representations. One demonstrated its termination policy; the other demonstrated that it intended no expression of a binding obligation to adhere to any stated policy. Thus, it cannot be said that the employer\u2019s actions were sufficient to justify an \u201c \u2018understanding that a commitment ha[d] been made.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 139. Moreover, although <em>Rood </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>leaves the question of determining the meaning of policies capable of two reasonable interpretations to the jury, it does not authorize the jury to simply choose between two clear representations. Rather, under these circumstances, where the employer clearly manifests an intent to avoid being legally obligated by its handbook, the court should find that the absence of a promise compels the conclusion that the employer did not create \u201ca situation \u2018instinct with an obligation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rood </em>at 138, n 30. The <em>Toussaint </em>legitimate-expectations approach, as an exception to the presumption of at-will employment, is an equitable approach to just-cause employment claims, which is rooted in public policy. Where the employer manifests a clear intent not to bind itself, however, the policy considerations in favor of binding the employer give way to its clearly manifested intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In <em>Heurtebise v Reliable Business Computers, Inc, </em>452 Mich 405; 550 NW2d 243 (1996), we held that an arbitration clause in an employee handbook was unenforceable where the handbook also included a disclaimer of contractual intent. A conclusion that similar language does not protect a defendant from a just-cause claim would be logically inconsistent. In <em>Edwards v Whirlpool Corp, </em>678 F Supp 1284, 1291 (WD Mich, 1987), relying on <em>Dell v Montgomery Ward &amp; Co, Inc, </em>811 F2d 970 (CA 6, 1987) (holding that a disclaimer of contractual intent and reservation of right to terminate at will is sufficient to overcome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>just-cause termination language in the employee manual), the federal district court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">The <em>Toussaint </em>holding created an exception to the general rule that employment relationships are terminable at the will of either party .... The Michigan Supreme Court suggested that a company could protect itself from liability by expressly disclaiming its intent to create anything but an at-will employment relationship. It did not find, however, that a company creates a just cause contract if it issues an employee handbook without including the magical phrase that the employment relationship remains an \u201cat will\u201d relationship. In this case, I find that defendant adequately protected itself by stating that it did not intend for the employee handbook to create a contract of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Additionally, in <em>Rowe v Montgomery Ward &amp; Co, Inc, </em>437 Mich 627, 649-650; 473 NW2d 268 (1991), this Court approved the reasoning offered by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in <em>Dell, </em>while holding that a reservation of at-will termination is sufficient to defeat any language that might give rise to an expectation of just-cause termination. In <em>Dell, </em>the employer disclaimed contractual intent regarding a progressive discipline process, stating that \u201c[t]his procedure does not form an employment contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 972. The employer\u2019s clear disclaimer of contractual intent here, as in <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Dell, </em>was sufficient to defeat any expectation of just-cause termination arising out of other language in the handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">In <em>In re Certified Question (Bankey v Storer Broadcasting Co), </em>432 Mich 438, 441; 443 NW2d 112 (1989), \u201cthis Court held that a company\u2019s written policy statements, which created legitimate expectations in the employee of discharge for cause only, could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>unilaterally modified by the employer.\u201d <em>Rowe </em>at 647-648. Such change is subject only to the requirement \u201cthat the employer gives affected employees reasonable notice of the policy change.\u201d <em>In re Certified Question </em>at 441. <em>Certified Question </em>thus endorsed the proposition that an employer could prospectively limit its liability by expressly disclaiming contractual intent with regard to the policies and procedures outlined in its employment manual or handbook. Such a disclaimer is consistent with the policy based doctrine preventing an employer from disavowing the creation of \u201cpromises\u201d instinct with obligation, because it provides the employees with actual notice of the employer\u2019s clear intent not to obligate itself by the policies outlined in the manual in the same manner as the employees are notified of everything else in the manual. Under the instant circumstances, the employee cannot contend as a matter of law that she has a legitimate expectation that the employer should not be allowed to disavow.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Thus, I would conclude plaintiff is not entitled to assert a legitimate expectation of just-cause employment where the handbook on which she relies disclaims any intent on the part of the employer to bind itself to the contents of the handbook. In conjunction with the disclaimer of contractual obligation, the policy language is insufficient to overcome the presumption of at-will termination. Finally, I note again that if the disclaimer were found to be inapplicable because it does not expressly mention plaintiff\u2019s department, then the entire handbook must be found inapplicable for the same reason.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">I concur with part in of Justice Riley\u2019s opinion to the extent that she adopts the \u201cintermediate position\u201d set forth in <em>St Mary\u2019s Honor Center v Hicks, </em>509 US 502, 510-511; 113 S Ct 2742; 125 L Ed 2d 407 (1993), and explained in the excerpts she references from 1 Lindemann &amp; Grossman, Employment Discrimination (3d ed), <em>ante </em>at 30-33. I also concur with Justice Brickley\u2019s analysis of the civil rights claims. As noted by Justice Riley, the intermediate position we adopt today is the majority rule in the circuit courts of appeal. In <em>Hicks, </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">The factfinder\u2019s disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the prima facie case, suffice to show intentional discrimination. Thus, rejection of the defendant\u2019s proffered reasons will <em>permit </em>the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination, and the Court of Appeals was correct when it noted that, upon such rejection, \u201c[n]o additional proof of discrimination is required\u201d .... <em>[Id. </em>at 511.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">I understand this language, especially the reference to \u201csuspicion of mendacity,\u201d and its application by both Justice Riley and Justice Brickley, to refer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>probative strength </em>of the inference that a reasonable mind could draw from the proffered proof. As noted by Justice Riley, \u201c[U]nder such circumstances, simply disproving the employer\u2019s articulated reason will suffice if, and only if, disproving the employer\u2019s reason also proves discrimination.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 37.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, in following the United States Supreme Court and the federal circuit courts in the area of employment discrimination, we apply the standard for summary disposition of <em>Anderson v Liberty Lobby, Inc, </em>477 US 242; 106 S Ct 2505; 91 L Ed 2d 202 (1986). <em>Skinner v Square D Co, </em>445 Mich 153, 178; 516 NW2d 475 (1994) (Levin, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">While I generally concur with Justice Riley\u2019s statement of the law, I dissent from her application of the law in this case. For unknown reasons, her opinion eschews any analysis of plaintiff\u2019s proofs regarding pretext in the context of the civil rights claim. <em>Ante </em>at 28. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence rebutting defendant\u2019s presentation of its reasons for eliminating plaintiff\u2019s position was the overall profitability of the parent organization. As the majority recognizes, it was insufficient, standing alone, to raise a triable issue of falsity. At this point in the analysis, the question becomes whether a reasonable trier of fact could find from plaintiff\u2019s remaining proofs that, more likely than not, plaintiff\u2019s age or gender was a reason for the elimination of her position, i.e., that defendant\u2019s reduction in force was a pretext for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>In <em>Smith v Stratus Computer, Inc, </em>40 F3d 11, 17 (CA 1, 1994), a gender discrimination case, the court found the plaintiff\u2019s evidence of discriminatory animus . inadequate to prove disparate treatment. The court aptly noted that \u201cthe plaintiff has the burden of showing that she was treated differently from \u2018persons situated similarly \u201cin all relevant aspects.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The court observed that in order \u201cto compare [the plaintiff\u2019s] treatment with that of terminated or transferred male executives in a meaningful way, [the plaintiff] would have to show that she was similarly situated to those men in terms of performance, qualifications and conduct, \u2018without such differentiaiity or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish\u2019 their situations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court also observed that \u201c[t]he biases of one who neither makes nor influences the challenged personnel decision are not probative in an employment discrimination case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18. As in <em>Smith, </em>the plaintiff here has \u201cutterly failed\u201d to produce sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s proofs consisted at best of equivocal evidence that she was more qualified than younger persons who were paid from different budgets. While an employer may not hide behind a termination by parceling out plaintiff\u2019s jobs, there is no dispute that defendant engaged in a work force reduction. Although some of plaintiff\u2019s duties were reassigned among other employees, the younger persons she points to also performed some different tasks from those involved in the eliminated position. Some of plaintiff\u2019s duties appear to have been assigned to persons other than those she references as evidence of discrimination, and some of plaintiff\u2019s duties, for example, hourly training, appear to have been elimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>nated altogether. Additionally, plaintiff has not shown that her qualifications were really similar to those of the other employees. As noted by Justice Brickley, for example, \u201cMs. Achterhoff received a degree in a human resources related field [while] [t]he plaintiff had no such degree . . . .\u201d <em>Post </em>at 71. Moreover, the statistical evidence established that between 1987 and 1992, the number of employees in Whitehall declined almost fifty percent, from 4,100 to 2,450, and the RIF resulted in termination of ninety-one employees in 1991, fifty-four of whom were under the age of forty and sixty-eight of whom were men.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, with regard to the personnel decision itself, the decision to eliminate plaintiff\u2019s position was not made by Mr. Malady, the alleged source of gender bias. Mr. Roof, who made the decision, is ten years older than plaintiff. Roof did not make the decisions to hire Achterhoff and Billingsley, or to promote Boczkaja. Thus, the evidence is too disjointed to warrant an inference that discriminatory animus, rather than economic factors, caused the elimination of plaintiff\u2019s position. In light of these facts, I agree with Justice Brickley that plaintiff\u2019s evidence \u201cis irrelevant to Ms. Lytle\u2019s termination and does not present evidence of discrimina[tion] . . . <em>Id. </em>at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Certainly, if Justice Riley believed that the evidence produced by the plaintiff in <em>Matras v Amoco Oil Co, </em>424 Mich 675; 385 NW2d 586 (1986), was insufficient to show \u201cage was a determining factor in [the plaintiff\u2019s] discharge,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 715 (Riley, J., dissenting), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>considerably weaker evidence in this case could not support a finding of discriminatory animus. There, the plaintiff was originally referred to as \u201can \u2018aggressive young man,\u2019 \u201d but years later was nicknamed \u201cGramps\u201d and given \u201can unwanted party ... to celebrate [his] fortieth birthday . ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 680-681. When the plaintiff was discharged as a part of an RIF shortly after his forty-first birthday, he sued Amoco for age discrimination, alleging that Amoco\u2019s termination plan divided employees by age, that he was told he was \u201clow man in the over age 40 group,\u201d that younger persons replaced him, and that \u201cage discrimination was designed into the evaluation process . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713. Viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, Justice Riley was unable to conclude that the plaintiff had produced evidence of discriminatory animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">I fail to understand how plaintiff\u2019s evidence here shows discriminatory animus. Rather, because the evidence of the RIF proves \u201cthe discharge . . . would have taken place without regard to age [or gender] discrimination, age [and gender were] not . . . determining factor[s] in [plaintiff\u2019s] discharge.\u201d <em>Matras </em>at 691. Given the fact that Justice Riley concluded in <em>Matras </em>that the civil rights laws were \u201c \u2018not intended as a vehicle for judicial review of business decisions,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 715, I am unable to understand how she can find this plaintiff\u2019s evidence sufficient to survive summary disposition under the articulated standard. In short, plaintiff\u2019s evidence does not create \u201ca genuine dispute about [defendant\u2019s] intent or motive . . . sufficient ... to permit a jury to find that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason [the RIF] is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>merely a pretext for intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>Krenik v Le Sueur Co, </em>47 F3d 953, 959 (CA 8, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">If the plaintiff chooses to rebut defendant\u2019s offer of a legitimate business reason with evidence of falsity, she must do more than create a triable question of falsity. Stripped to its essentials, plaintiff\u2019s proofs, when viewed in a light most favorable to her, consist of evidence that she was replaced during a reduction in force by employees who were younger and possibly less qualified than she was.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The proofs raise no suspicion of mendacity and are not sufficient to survive summary disposition. Therefore, I dissent from the lead opinion\u2019s result and would conclude that summary disposition was proper on all counts.</p>\n<judges id=\"b393-6\">Weaver, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\"> The lead opinion erroneously relies on the rule of contract analysis that requires that ambiguous terms be construed against the drafter to find a question of fact regarding legitimate expectation. <em>Ante </em>at 18, n 17. The lead opinion thus unfortunately confuses the contract prong of <em>Toussaint v Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>408 Mich 579; 292 NW2d 880 (1980), with the pure legitimate-expectations public policy theory, impermissibly fusing two approaches which this Court so long sought to independently identify. In <em>Rood v General Dynamics Corp, </em>444 Mich 107, 118; 507 NW2d 591 (1993), Chief Justice Cavanagh observed that legitimate-expectation analysis is not a contract analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">In other words, there are two alternative theories of enforceability that may support a claim of wrongful discharge in Michigan. While the first theory is grounded solely on contract principles \u201crelative to the employment setting,\u201d <em>Rowe [v Montgomery Ward &amp; Co, Inc, </em>437 Mich 627, 632; 473 NW2d 268 (1991)], the second theory is grounded solely on public policy considerations. As Justice Boyle noted in her concurring opinion in <em>In re Certified Question (Bankey v Storer Broadcasting Co), </em>432 Mich 438, 458; 443 NW2d 112 (1989), \u201cthe pure legitimate expectations leg of <em>Toussaint </em>was founded on the Court\u2019s common-law authority to recognize\u201d enforceable obligations that arise \u201c \u2018outside the operation of normal contract principles.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Whether a legitimate expectation arises is an equitable issue that inquires into whether it is unjust to allow the defendant to deny the existence of just-cause employment. The issue is whether the language of the handbook would permit reasonable jurors to find that the employer created an expectation that employees would not be discharged except for cause. By its own terms the handbook expressly stated that no binding obligation was created by any statement therein. Thus, since the defendant did not manifest a clear intent, the plaintiff could not have had a legitimate expectation on the basis of statements in the handbook.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b383-7\"> The handbook describes how Howmet relates to the industry at large, how its divisions are broken down, its relationship with the neighboring community, its equal opportunity/affirmative action program, and its policies and procedures as they relate to employees of Howmet. Nothing in the handbook indicates that terms apply to anything other than the corporation at large. Moreover, the handbook observes that the corporation was founded in 1950 in Whitehall, where plaintiff worked. I fail to understand how, when reading the handbook as a whole, the handbook or its various parts could be understood to apply to some employees and not to others. However, as noted above, if that were the case, plaintiff could not reasonably rely on one part of the handbook while ignoring another.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\"> Nor may it be said that a question of fact is created as to \u201cwhat, if anything, the employer has promised.\u201d <em>Rood </em>at 138. The unambiguous expression of intent manifested by the defendant in the disclaimer of contractual obligation was designed to prevent any statement in the handbook from being interpreted as a promise. The disclaimer of obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>does not contradict the termination policy any more than it contradicts any other policy statement in the handbook. Rather, it <em>limits </em>the statements in the handbook by expressly providing that no employee may reasonably interpret them as binding on the employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b387-6\"> I also disagree with the lead opinion\u2019s treatment of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>claim that the plaintiff\u2019s position was eliminated as part of a general reduction, insofar as it relates to the just-cause claim. We have not decided that a defendant must demonstrate economic reasons not only for the elimination of a just-cause employee position, but also for the termination of a plaintiff as an individual. <em>McCart v J Walter Thompson USA, Inc, </em>437 Mich 109, 116; 469 NW2d 284 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Assuming arguendo the plaintiff had a legitimate expectation that she would be discharged only for cause, in my view the proofs were insufficient to permit a rational juror to conclude that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason for the discharge was false.

WRONGFUL TERMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">I agree with the lead opinion\u2019s resolution of the plaintiff\u2019s wrongful termination claim. The plaintiff created a question of fact whether she was a just-cause employee because she had a legitimate expectation of just-cause employment under <em>Rood v General Dynamics Corp, </em>444 Mich 107; 507 NW2d 591 (1993). However, the plaintiff failed to raise a question of material fact that the defendant had just cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>to terminate the plaintiff as part of its reduction in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">H. DISCRIMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">I am unable to agree with the lead opinion\u2019s disposition of the plaintiff\u2019s claims of age and sex discrimination. As an initial matter, I do agree with the lead opinion\u2019s adoption of the intermediate approach. <em>Ante </em>at 32-33. I also agree that \u201c \u2018[t]he plaintiff <em>must </em>then introduce sufficient evidence to support two additional findings: (1) that the employer\u2019s articulated reason for [laying off the plaintiff] is a pretext, and (2) that the true reason is discriminatory.\u2019 <em>Smith v Stratus Computer, Inc, </em>40 F3d 11, 16 (CA 1, 1994).\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Though I agree with the lead opinion\u2019s statement of the law, I disagree with its application of the law to the facts of this case. The lead opinion finds that the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence of both age and sex discrimination to survive the defendant\u2019s summary disposition motion. Although I agree with the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion that this plaintiff has stated a prima facie case, she has offered little evidence which shows that the defendant\u2019s proffered business reason is false. Rather, she must rely on her evidence of the prima facie elements to prove that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason was a pretext for discrimination.

The lead opinion concludes that this \u201canomaly in defendant\u2019s assertion that it was conducting an RIF\u201d provided sufficient evidence that the plaintiff was terminated as a result of age discrimination. <em>Id. </em>However, this finding greatly oversimplifies the facts and ignores the defendant\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">As the lead opinion points out, the plaintiff has stated a prima facie case, and the defendant has met its burden of production by stating a nondiscriminatory business reason for the plaintiff\u2019s termination. Thus, all presumptions have \u201cdropp[ed] out of the picture.\u201d <em>St Mary\u2019s Honor Center v </em>Hicks, 509 US 502, 511; 113 S Ct 2742; 125 L Ed 2d 407 (1993). At this point, the plaintiff must show discrimination in one of two ways. First, she may offer direct or circumstantial evidence showing that the defendant was motivated by discriminatory animus. If persuasive, this will show that the employer\u2019s real reason was discrimination, thus disproving the proffered nondiscriminatoiy reason. Second, the plaintiff may also meet this burden by presenting evidence of falsity sufficient to show that the employer possessed a discriminatory intent. 1 Lindemann &amp; Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law (3d ed), pp 26-27. However, because this defendant has stated a nondiscriminatory business justification for its actions, the plaintiff will only survive summary disposition if there is sufficient evidence to create a question of material fact that the defendant acted out of a discriminatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>intent. At this point, the analysis is identical to the federal standard for summary judgment. <em>Anderson v Liberty Lobby, Inc, </em>477 US 242; 106 S Ct 2505; 91 L Ed 2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">1) THE HIRING OF ANDREA ACHTERHOFF</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The hiring of Ms. Achterhoff does not provide evidence of age discrimination. Indeed, it is irrelevant for several reasons. First, Ms. Achterhoff took a newly created position as human resources representative for the Operhall Research Center.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, Ms. Achterhoff was hired six to eight weeks before the plaintiff was terminated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s claims amount to an assertion that she should have been given Ms. Achterhoff\u2019s position rather than being laid off. However, civil rights laws do not require an employer to retain older workers during a reduction in force at the expense of younger employees with less seniority.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Barnes v GenCorp, Inc, </em>896 F2d 1457, 1471 (CA 6, 1990) (\u201cAn employer is free to retain the younger, less senior employee if the employer reasonably believes he or she is better qualified for the position\u201d). The retention of younger employees during a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>reduction in force is not evidence of discrimination. <em>Matras v Amoco Oil Co, </em>424 Mich 675, 688; 385 NW2d 586 (1986). Thus, the hiring of Ms. Achterhoff does not show any evidence of discriminatory animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Second, crucial decisions regarding the hiring of Ms. Achterhoff were made by people other than those who terminated the plaintiff. The plaintiff does not contest Mr. Roofs narration of the events surrounding this decision. Accordingly, it is undisputed that Operhall was not interested in any of the human resources staff, save Mr. Malady and Mr. Boczkaja. Thus, the decision not to consider Ms. Lytle for this position was made by individuals at Operhall, not Mr. Roof. Therefore, any discrimination was not committed by the person who terminated the plaintiff, and is not relevant to this case. <em>McDonald v Union Camp Corp, </em>898 F2d 1155, 1161 (CA 6, 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Even if Ms. Achterhoff\u2019s hiring was relevant to the plaintiffs claims, the lead opinion oversimplifies the facts and ignores crucial evidence that removes any suggestion of age discrimination. The lead opinion rests its conclusion on the fact that Ms. Achterhoff was less qualified than the plaintiff. However, this conclusion is based solely on the fact that Ms. Lytle had been with the defendant for a longer period. This ignores the fact that Ms. Achterhoff had ten years of supervisory human resources experience with other firms. The plaintiff had a similar number of years in a supervisory capacity with the defendant. Thus, the record actually shows that Ms. Achterhoff and the plaintiff had very similar employment histories. Moreover, Ms. Achterhoff received a degree in a human resources related field. The plaintiff had no such degree and had only partially completed a steno<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>graphic course at a business college. Thus, I disagree that the comparative qualifications<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of Ms. Achterhoff and Ms. Lytle show evidence of intentional discrimination sufficient to survive summary disposition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Finally, the lead opinion also focuses on the fact Ms. Achterhoff received greater pay than the plaintiff. However, Ms. Achterhoff was compensated from the Operhall budget, whereas Ms. Lytle was paid from the human resources budget.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The fact that the plaintiff was chosen for termination is consistent with the defendant\u2019s claim that it was motivated by a desire to reduce human resources costs. The lead opinion\u2019s reliance on the comparative salaries of these individuals fails to account for the significant fact that they were paid from different budgets. Indeed, this point removes the aberration that the lead opinion sees in the defendant\u2019s presentation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>I believe that Ms. Achterhoff\u2019s hiring is irrelevant to Ms. Lytle\u2019s termination and does not present evidence of discriminatory intent, even if considered. Thus, I cannot agree with the lead opinion that this created a question of fact concerning either the falsity of the defendant\u2019s proffered business reason or the presence of intentional discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">2) THE HIRING OF JEFF BILLINGSLEY</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Similarly, the assignment of the training responsibilities at the Whitehall Division to Mr. Billingsley does not constitute evidence of discrimination. The lead opinion finds discrimination in the retention of Mr. Billingsley. <em>Ante </em>at 41, 47. However, this ignores several crucial facts. First, Mr. Billingsley was only five years younger than the plaintiff. I fail to see how this difference provides evidence of age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Second, Mr. Billingsley had been working with a different department of the corporation since 1986. Thus, he was not hired into the corporation as Ms. Lytle left. Rather, he was merely given a new position as head of training as an expansion of his existing duties. While the lead opinion is correct that Mr. Billingsley had production experience, he had been training and development manager for the year preceding his promotion. Even the plaintiff acknowledged that Mr. Billingsley\u2019s previous job had been in training and that the new position focused on training as well. Further, the lead opinion ignores testimony that the defendant was changing its production methods, and that this process was going to require exten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>sive retraining. Mr. Roof gave uncontroverted testimony that Mr. Billingsley had been conducting this type of training with other divisions of the corporation. It is unclear that the plaintiff had comparable qualifications. Rather, the lead opinion simply assumes that the plaintiff could have performed this job solely on the basis of her nineteen years working in the human resources department. However, even assuming that the plaintiff was qualified, Mr. Billingsley\u2019s previous training experience with the company\u2019s new production methods provides ample justification for the defendant\u2019s decision. I fail to see how the plaintiff has offered evidence of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The lead opinion also finds evidence of discrimination in the fact that Mr. Billingsley earned a greater rate of pay. However, this ignores the fact that only a part of Mr. Billingsley\u2019s salary came from the human resources budget. In contrast, the plaintiff\u2019s salary was paid entirely out of that budget, and she was terminated in an effort to reduce the costs of the human resources department. Thus, despite the lead opinion\u2019s description of events, Mr. Billingsley was given a newly created post that consolidated functions previously held by different departments. This type of personnel change is inherent in corporate restructuring and does not constitute evidence of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">I cannot agree that the defendant\u2019s treatment of Ms. Achterhoff and Mr. Billingsley evidences age discrimination. This defendant was reducing its work force\u2014 a process that involved the elimination of jobs and the reassignment of employees. The mere fact that two of the people retained happened to be younger than the plaintiff should not allow the plaintiff to raise a material question of fact concerning age discrimination. <em>Matras, supra </em>at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>B. SEX DISCRIMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">I also disagree that the record reveals evidence of sex discrimination. I agree with the lead opinion that the isolated confrontations with Mr. Malady are insufficient to constitute evidence of discrimination. However, for the same reasons as discussed abov\u00e9, I do not feel that the hiring of Mr. Billingsley shows evidence of sex discrimination. Further, I fail to understand why the lead opinion ignores the employer\u2019s evidence that six of the eight people who took over the plaintiff\u2019s job duties were women. The plaintiff does not dispute this. Indeed, she testified that she was uncertain who had taken over her job duties and acknowledged that several of her former duties were assigned to female employees. This distribution of the plaintiff\u2019s job duties is inconsistent with sex discrimination. Rather, it is consistent with the employer\u2019s desire to reduce its payroll by eliminating the number of people working in its human resources department.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, I do not believe that the plaintiff has shown that the defendant\u2019s nondiscriminatory business reason was false or that discrimination on the basis of sex was the true motive for its actions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>m. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">While I agree that summary disposition of the wrongful-termination claim was properly awarded to the defendant, I disagree with the lead opinion\u2019s finding on the discrimination claims. That finding misapplies the governing law and oversimplifies the facts of this complex case. Essentially, it allows a plaintiff to overcome summary disposition if the plaintiff can identify anyone who: 1) has less seniority, 2) receives greater compensation, and 3) does not share in the plaintiff\u2019s characteristics. Apparently, it is irrelevant if the retained individual\u2019s job was different than that held by the plaintiff or if that individual was qualified for the job. Rather, the lead opinion second-guesses the employer\u2019s decisions on the basis of its assumptions concerning which employee was more qualified. Under this holding, I fail to see how any employer could conduct a reduction in force without facing an employment discrimination trial for each and every individual it terminates. I cannot agree that this is the correct application of current employment discrimination law.</p>\n<judges id=\"b402-5\">Weaver, J., concurred with Brickley, J., only with respect to the discussion of age and sex discrimination.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\"> The lead opinion asserts that I have improperly engaged in fact finding and credibility determinations. <em>Ante </em>at 38, n 39. However, a court must consider \u201caffidavits, together with the pleadings, depositions, admissions, and documentary evidence\u201d when examining a motion made under MCR 2.116(0)(10). MCR 2.116(G)(5). Citing unrefuted deposition testimony does not constitute an impermissible credibility determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> The plaintiff has failed to offer any evidence that this position was created as a pretext for her termination.

Once Ms. Achterhoff was hired, the defendant was required to make its decision on the basis of neutral criteria. Mr. Roof testified at length that the decision was based on the decreased need for the position held by the plaintiff. The plaintiff fails to offer any evidence that rebuts this analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\"> The lead opinion apparently reads this phrase to mean comparable qualifications. <em>Ante </em>at 39-40, 46. However, I do not mean that the qualifications of the plaintiff and Ms. Achterhoff were similar. Rather, when compared, their qualifications reveal no evidence that discrimination motivated the decision to retain Ms. Achterhoff. See <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary </em>(3d college ed), p 283.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b398-8\"> It is not sufficient for the employee to merely show a question of fact concerning qualifications. Rather, a plaintiff must offer proof that she was more qualified than the employee who received the position in order to present evidence of intentional discrimination at this stage of the analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b398-9\"> Again, the plaintiff has not presented any proof suggesting that this arrangement was fraudulent. Rather, it is uncontroverted that this arrangement was a legitimate effort to reduce the human resources budget.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b398-10\"> The fact that Ms. Achterhoff\u2019s salary was not paid from the human resources department\u2019s budget is consistent with the employer\u2019s stated business reason that it terminated Ms. Lytle as part of a reduction in the human resources budget. Rather than show evidence of falsity, this supports the employer\u2019s proffered explanation. Thus, the lead opinion\u2019s reliance on the retention of Ms. Achterhoff as evidence of falsity and discrimination is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\"><em>Martin v Teledyne Brown Engineering, </em>924 F Supp 1131, 1138, n 4 (SD Ala, 1996) (finding that only employees within the plaintiff\u2019s department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>should be considered similarly situated because the defendant had conducted its reduction in force on a \u201cdepartment-by-department basis\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b401-5\"> I also question the lack of importance that the lead opinion gives to Ms. Achterhoffs hiring in its discussion of the sex discrimination claim after finding it relevant on the question of age discrimination. The lead opinion also misinterprets my reference to the number of females who assumed the plaintiff\u2019s job duties. I do not feel that the \u201cplaintiff could only establish her claim if defendant corporation had discharged all its female employees.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 43, n 49. Rather, I simply would not ignore the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s job responsibilities were awarded to mostly female employees. This evidence mitigates against a finding that \u201cone sex has been treated differently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the lead opinion\u2019s reliance on the retention of one male employee amounts to a finding of discriminatory animus because the defendant did not fire all its male employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b401-6\"> The lead opinion repeatedly refers to the need to review all the circumstances of the plaintiff\u2019s discharge.
