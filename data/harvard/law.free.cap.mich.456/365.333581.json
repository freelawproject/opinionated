We hold that plaintiff failed to meet that burden and that the trial court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">In Michigan, prosecution is initiated in the sole discretion of the prosecutor. There was no evidentiary basis for the claim that the prosecution was initiated or maintained by defendant\u2019s agents. An independent investigation conducted by the state police supported probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed. There was no evidence to dispute probable cause, and the trial court should have directed a verdict for the defendant and determined that probable cause was established as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Because the issues involved in the claim of malicious prosecution turn on which issues are or might be controverted, we begin our analysis with the following undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">Dr. Robert Matthews, a dentist specializing in orthodontics, was charged and acquitted in a bench trial of three counts of false pretenses with intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>defraud over one hundred dollars<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and two counts of filing false health care claims<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> involving surgeries performed at Sinai Hospital. The prosecution had alleged that Dr. Matthews had been paid by Blue Cross for services he did not perform or for which he was not entitled to claim reimbursements. Dr. Matthews had billed technical surgical assistance (tsa) under the regular business classification for Blue Cross physician providers<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for participation in oral orthognathic surgeries performed at Sinai Hospital by several dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ferent oral surgeons on a number <em>of </em>orthodontic patients.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Technical surgical assistance was described by Blue Cross in the regular business section of the physician\u2019s instruction manual, p 2-20, as \u201c[t]he professional, active assistance given the operating physician ... for an eligible surgical or obstetrical procedure.\u201d Surgical benefits are \u201cavailable wherever provided when medically necessary.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>p 2-19. The manual specifies that claims for billings submitted under the regular business program are subject to the following restrictions: (1) the location of service must be \u201cinpatient\u201d hospital; (2) the service can \u201conly be billed when surgical assistance by a hospital intern, resident or house officer is not available,\u201d (3) in \u201cinstitutions with an approved intern resident training program, the surgeon in charge must certify that ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>rices of interns, residents or house officers were not available;\u201d (4) such certification is to \u201cbe submitted with the tsa claim.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The section of the policy manual dealing with copayments under the Blue Cross cost-sharing programs was added to the Physician\u2019s Manual in 1984. It covers subscriber contracts that require both deductibles and copayments.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As with the regular business program, the cost-sharing policy provided that \u201c[a]ll services that are listed as benefits are only payable if they are medically necessary.\u201d The section of the manual setting out the policy for reimbursing claims under the regular business program used the word \u201cactive\u201d in describing the surgical assistance services that would be reimbursed under that program. The word \u201cactive\u201d was not included in describing technical surgical assistance services in the cost-sharing programs. However, both programs had identical limitations regarding payment for technical surgical assistance for surgeries performed in a teaching hospital. Because Sinai Hospital was a teaching hospital and had interns and residents, the claims were not reimbursable under either program without a certification by the surgeon in charge that the services of a resident, intern, or house officer was unavailable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The criminal charges against Dr. Matthews were initiated by the Oakland County prosecutor following an investigation by the state police on the basis of information submitted by Dennis Drake, a Blue Cross and Blue Shield financial investigator. Mr. Drake\u2019s investigation of billing irregularities was precipitated by a call to the Blue Cross fraud hot line by LeAnne Pierce, a former employee of Dr. Matthews, who alleged that she had altered surgical reports while billing services for his dental practice. Drake completed an internal investigation that included a review of sixty technical surgical assistance claims submitted by Dr. Matthews,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> consultation with Blue Cross consultants, and interviews with oral surgeons in the community. Drake then turned over his report to Detective Wayne Waldron of the Michigan State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Police. Waldron undertook a three-month independent investigation in which he personally interviewed Ms. Pierce, the employee who had alerted Blue Cross to the existence of possible fraud; the five oral surgeons who had operated on the five patients for whom Dr. Matthews claimed payment from Blue Cross that became the basis for the criminal charges; Dr. Jeffrey Topf,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> chairman of Sinai Hospital\u2019s oral surgery department; Dr. Byron Attenson, oral surgeon and Blue Cross dental consultant; and Diane Freilich, Dr. Matthews\u2019 attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Pierce advised Waldron that she had falsified surgical reports to represent that Dr. Matthews had assisted at surgeries. She stated that at Matthews\u2019 direction, she had aligned his name on the operative note directly below the operating physician\u2019s name, using a special typing ball. Pierce then copied the altered report and submitted it with the claim form to Blue Cross for payment. Review of the hospital surgical register and copies of the reports on the five patients identified in the charge revealed that Dr. Matthews\u2019 name did not appear on any of the documents as having been part of the original surgical team. Ms. Pierce also told Waldron that the operative notes were received from various oral surgeons\u2019 offices because the hospital had refused to send them<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>that Dr. Matthews personally reviewed all claims sent to Blue Cross for completeness.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Waldron interviewed Doctors William Aughton, Myron Kaufman, Jonathan Anderson, James Lepczyk, and Robert Macintosh, each of whom told Waldron that they had not given Dr. Matthews permission to type his name on their surgical reports. Additionally the doctors provided information that 1) Dr. Matthews did not scrub or assist in performing the surgical operation, 2) Dr. Matthews stayed only for a short time during the lengthy surgery if he appeared at all,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 3) there was no valid medical reason for Dr. Matthews to be in the operating room, and 4) that most doctors were not aware that Dr. Matthews was billing for technical surgical assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Waldron was also advised by Blue Cross consultant Dr. Attenson, that he had informed Dr. Matthews in July, 1984, that it was error for him to bill for technical surgical assistance because it required hands-on assistance, that at no time were payments for such benefits paid to orthodontists, that there was no medical reason for an orthodontist to be present at oral surgery, and that Dr. Matthews was the only orthodontist currently attending the surgeries and billing for such \u201cassistance.\u201d Dr. Attenson also stated that because Sinai had interns and residents, oral surgeons on staff must use them for technical surgical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>assistance and that where in-house assistance was not available for this service, lack of availability must be certified in writing and submitted with the claim for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Dr. Matthews declined to be interviewed, and his attorney, Diane Freilich, responded to Waldron\u2019s questions on behalf of Dr. Matthews. She stated that Mr. Jack Hill, a Blue Cross employee, had furnished Dr. Matthews with a medical provider number and had told him how to apply for technical surgical assistance benefits. She maintained that Dr. Matthews was unaware of the Blue Cross definition of technical surgical assistance because he was never given a provider manual by Blue Cross and that he only billed technical surgical assistance on surgeries where he stayed for his part of the surgery, which lasted from one half to one hour and that if he just briefly stopped by he did not bill. Additionally she claimed that Dr. Matthews put his name on the surgical report because Blue Cross asked him to do so (although he could not remember who so advised him) and that there were other orthodontists claiming payment for technical surgical assistance in the area (although she could not provide their names). Attorney Freilich stated that Dr. Matthews also denied talking to any oral surgeons about filing technical surgical assistance fees on their cases and denied being told by Dr. Attenson not to claim technical surgical assistance benefits. Assistant Oakland County Prosecutor Ralph Charles Claus, Jr., authorized issuance of a warrant. Waldron signed and swore to the complaint, which was issued by an Oakland County judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>m</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Testimony at the preliminary examination basically replicated the information in Waldron\u2019s report.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant was bound over for trial in circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>A bench trial was held before the Honorable Frederick Ziem. The prosecution\u2019s proofs apparently consisted of testimony similar to that adduced at the preliminary examination, supplemented by that of additional witnesses. Dr. Matthews testified in his own defense, contending essentially that he lacked criminal intent to file false claims or to defraud. The trial judge denied Dr. Matthews\u2019 motion for a directed verdict of acquittal. The trial court found that guilt had not been established beyond a reasonable doubt and acquitted the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Dr. Matthews filed the instant action of malicious prosecution against Blue Cross and Blue Shield. As far as can be determined, Dr. Matthews\u2019 theory of liability was that the agents of Blue Cross acted improperly because they had not informed the prosecutor that the cost-sharing programs did not include the word \u201cactive\u201d in describing the policy concerning reimbursement for claims of technical surgical assistance. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict at the close of the proofs. The jury found in favor of Dr. Matthews and awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>$1,275,000 in damages. The defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">The Court of Appeals affirmed. Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued April 13, 1995 (Docket No. 145934). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal \u201climited to whether there was a question of fact that required the issue of probable cause to be submitted to the jury.\u201d 453 Mich 960 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Probable cause involves a determination of both the historical facts and whether the rule of law as applied to the facts is violated. As the Supreme Court recently observed in the context of reviewing a question of reasonable suspicion or probable cause under the Fourth Amendment, \u201cas a general matter determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause should be reviewed de novo on appeal.\u201d <em>Ornelas v United States, </em>517 US 690, 699; 116 S Ct 1657; 134 L Ed 2d 911 (1996). Because the inquiry before us concerns a question of law, the existence of probable cause, our review is de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Malicious prosecution is a tort that \u201cruns counter to obvious policies of the law in favor of encouraging proceedings against those who are apparently guilty, and letting finished litigation remain undisturbed and unchallenged.\u201d Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 119, p 876. However, the interests of persons wrongfully prosecuted must also be protected. Balancing the interests involved, actions for malicious prosecution have historically been limited by restrictions that make them difficult to maintain. <em>Id. Renda </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>v Int'l Union, UAW, </em>366 Mich 58, 75; 114 NW2d 343 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The plaintiff has the burden of proving (1) that the defendant has initiated a criminal prosecution against him, (2) that the criminal proceedings terminated in his favor, (3) that the private person who instituted or maintained the prosecution lacked probable cause for his actions, and (4) that the action was undertaken with malice or a purpose in instituting the criminal claim other than bringing the offender to justice. <em>Rivers v Ex-Cell-O Corp, </em>100 Mich App 824, 832; 300 NW2d 420 (1980), citing <em>Weiden v Weiden, </em>246 Mich 347, 352; 224 NW 345 (1929).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Before turning to the issue of probable cause, we initially address several propositions advanced at trial and on appeal that seem to have obscured proper analysis of this case. In his opening statement, plaintiffs counsel maintained that there was an absence of probable cause to prosecute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">Probable cause means that there is a reason to believe that someone has committed a crime, and that\u2019s a simplistic way of putting it, but I submit to you and will argue to you later, that you can\u2019t have probable cause if you don\u2019t make a full disclosure. If you don\u2019t tell the prosecuting authority all of the facts and give them the right definition, and if you distort what\u2019s being said, then you can\u2019t possibly have\u2014 have a reasoned decision being made by the prosecuting authority. So that\u2019s what happened here. There will be \u2014 we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>will show you an absence of probable cause because they didn\u2019t make full disclosures and because the disclosures that they made were untruthful. And I think I mentioned to you that they ignored the court\u2019s order to produce exculpatory information. ... It shows that they intended to \u2014 to prosecute this man without any regard to whether they were bringing someone to justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">However, the plaintiff\u2019s burden in a malicious prosecution case is to make a prima facie showing that the defendant\u2019s agents lacked probable cause to believe that the plaintiff had committed a crime. Whether the prosecutor might have made a different decision is irrelevant to that issue.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">A public prosecutor is not liable for malicious prosecution.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> A plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case against a private person requires proof that the private person instituted or maintained the prosecution and that the prosecutor acted on the basis of information submitted by the private person that did not constitute probable cause.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Additionally, the plaintiff\u2019s contention that defendant was obligated to make full and fair disclosure or be liable for malicious prosecution confused the elements of plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case with the affirma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>tive defense of reliance on advice of an attorney. A private person who institutes or maintains a prosecution without probable cause may avoid liability on the ground that he instituted the prosecution at the direction or on the advice of the prosecutor, where he offers proof sufficient to permit a finding that he made a full and fair disclosure of the material facts.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>This defense is simply not in issue unless the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case. Thus, unless the plaintiff presents a prima facie case that the private defendant instituted or maintained the criminal proceeding and that it was instituted or maintained without probable cause the question of the defendant\u2019s reliance on legal advice is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Finally, and assuming arguendo that plaintiff\u2019s proofs make out a prima facie case, want of probable cause is a question of law to be determined by the court.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Modla v Miller, </em>344 Mich 21; 73 NW2d 220 (1955).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Where the facts on which the issue turns are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>in dispute,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the question is for the jury. The jury resolves factual disputes regarding the circumstances under which the private person who initiates, procures, or maintains a prosecution might be found to have acted without probable cause. Whether the facts constitute probable cause is a matter for the court to determine.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Koski v Vohs, </em>426 Mich 424, 431; 395 NW2d 226 (1986).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Although further discussion of the first and third observations is unnecessary, additional explanation is in order regarding the plaintiffs obligation to show that the defendant initiated, continued, or maintained the prosecution and that probable cause is a question of law. We discuss them seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The plaintiff failed to show that defendant\u2019s agents instituted the proceeding or maintained it.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The prosecutor authorized the warrant, and Detective Waldron <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>was the complainant The warrant request was based on Waldron\u2019s independent investigation, not on the information the defendant\u2019s agent submitted. As the chief law enforcement officer of the county, a prosecutor has independent authority to initiate criminal prosecutions. MCL 764.1; MSA 28.860. A warrant may not be issued without the prosecutor\u2019s written authorization unless security for costs is given. <em>Bloss v Williams, </em>15 Mich App 228, 233; 166 NW2d 520 (1968).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, in Michigan, the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of his independent discretion in initiating and maintaining a prosecution is a complete defense to an action for malicious prosecution. <em>Christy v Rice, </em>152 Mich 563, 565; 116 NW 200 (1908).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>In <em>Christy, </em>the Court held that the trial judge erred in refusing to direct a verdict where the prosecutor conducted \u201chis own investigation, and acted in his official capacity upon that investigation, independent of defendant\u2019s statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567-568. Unless the information furnished was known by the giver to be false and <em>was the information on which the prosecutor acted, </em>the private person has not procured the prosecution.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In <em>Renda v Int\u2019l Union, UAW, supra, </em>the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in charging the jury that it could find liability if it found that the defendants were the \u201cproximate cause,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 91, of the prosecution, in the sense that the prosecution was a natural and probable consequence of an agreement between the private persons and an informer to pay the informer for his testimony and in refusing to charge that if the prosecutor acted on his own judgment the verdict must be for the defendants. We held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>that there was a total lack of evidence that the defendants by improper pressure or inducement<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> on the prosecutor succeeded in securing the warrant for the plaintiffs arrest and that the prosecution came into being after the prosecutor\u2019s interview and investigation of the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\"><em>Christy </em>and <em>Renda </em>confirm two long-established rules that negate an element of plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case. The independent exercise of prosecutorial discretion establishes that the private defendant did not initiate the prosecution. The prosecutor\u2019s independent investigation is not in law attributable to the private defendants. The information developed by Officer Waldron was submitted to the prosecutor who authorized issuance of a warrant on grounds that established probable cause to believe that Dr. Matthews had committed a felony. Thus, Blue Cross did not initiate or maintain the prosecution as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Finally, there was no disputed issue of material fact regarding the existence of probable cause. A private person\u2019s mistake of fact or law is relevant to whether he acted reasonably in initiating or maintaining a criminal proceeding.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> However, as noted, defendant did not initiate, continue, or maintain the prosecution.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Because there was no basis for disputing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>there was probable cause for the prosecution, the trial court should have resolved the question as a matter of law.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In <em>Koski, supra </em>at 432, we recognized that the question of probable cause is an objective test<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> that \u201cinvolves only the conduct of a reasonable man under the circumstances.\u201d The cause by which a criminal proceeding is initiated, is objectively measured. \u201cIn so doing, it was correct to view the facts, not as a legal technician would view them, but as the prudent, cautious person would see the situation.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In <em>Wilson v Bowen, </em>64 Mich 133, 138; 31 NW 81 (1887), we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">\u201cTo constitute probable cause . . ., there must be such reasonable ground of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant an ordinarily cautious man in the belief that the person arrested is guilty of the offense charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u201cA person may have probable cause for making a criminal complaint from information received from others merely; but in such case, he must honestly believe the information there obtained to be true, and the information must be of that character, and obtained from such sources, that business men generally, of ordinary care, prudence, and discretion, would act upon it under such circumstances, believing it to be reliable. But a man\u2019s mere belief that another is guilty is not probable cause, unless that belief is founded upon reasonable grounds of suspicion, or upon information of such a reliable kind, and from such reliable sources . . . such as would induce an impartial and reasonable mind to believe in the guilt of the accused.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Dennis Drake\u2019s report to the state police was based on information from reliable sources, namely operating surgeons. The doctors\u2019 statements that plaintiff\u2019s assistance was not medically necessary and that none of them authorized him to represent that he provided surgical assistance corroborated the allegation of improper billing made by LeAnne Pierce. It was information that would cause a reasonable mind to believe in the guilt of the accused. Thus, assuming arguendo that there was evidence Drake initiated or maintained the prosecution, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, there is simply no basis to conclude that a reasonable person would not have believed that Dr. Matthews probably had submitted false claims.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s argument that lack of full and fair disclosure of a material fact, that fact being the policy regarding payment for technical surgical assistance under the copayment programs, is inapposite to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>whether plaintiff\u2019s proofs made out a prima facie case of the absence of probable cause. Plaintiff\u2019s burden was to show that defendant instigated the investigation or continued it and that the prosecution was based on false information.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, there was no disputed issue of fact that technical surgical assistance was not reimbursable at Sinai Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">In <em>King v Arbic, </em>159 Mich App 452, 466; 406 NW2d 852 (1987), the plaintiff filed a malicious prosecution claim against the state trooper who had signed the complaint against the defendant. The Court of Appeals upheld the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition, observing that the \u201c[defendant has invoked a traditional defense to malicious prosecution, namely, the defense of advice of counsel.\u201d The Court of Appeals adopted the opinion of the trial court, which recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">In cases similar to the one we are faced with here, that legal principle reduces to the following rule: \u201c. . . the only situation in which an action for malicious prosecution would properly lie is where a police officer knowingly swears to false facts in a complaint, without which there is no probable cause.\u201d <em>Belt v Ritter, </em>18 Mich App [495] 503 [171 NW2d 581 (1969)]. The argument supported by that rule is sometimes characterized as an attack on the first ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>merit of the cause of action, that defendant instituted the previous prosecution. Alternatively, there is a good deal of case literature which views the defense as an attack on the \u201clack of probable cause\u201d prong. This Court is in agreement with the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Wilson v Yono, </em>65 Mich App 441, 444 [237 NW2d 494] (1975), which said, \u201c[ajlthough the cases seem to talk in terms of probable cause, it is clear that the rule is based upon the idea that defendant has not in fact instituted the prosecution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See also <em>Rivers v Ex-Cell-O Corp, </em>100 Mich App 824, 832-833; 300 NW2d 420 (1980).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">In the final analysis then, we are brought back, quite conveniently, to a question which has already been addressed in this opinion, albeit in slightly different form. The question is this: Is there any evidence in the record, as it exists, which would give rise to the inference that defendant Arbic knowingly included false facts in his incident report, without which the prosecutor could not have concluded there was probable cause? The answer is clearly no. This question is a slightly different form of the one answered earlier regarding defendant\u2019s lack of good faith. It has never been pled or argued by plaintiff that defendant did anything worse than fail to include certain arguably exculpatory items. In fact, those items which plaintiff has consistently labeled as \u201cexculpatory\u201d (i.e. that it was dark, that the victim only saw part of his assailant\u2019s legs, etc.), are not really exculpatory in nature. An exculpatory fact would be something such as an eye witness who saw plaintiff elsewhere or the fact that plaintiff had a broken ankle on the night in question. See, e.g., <em>Rivers, supra, </em>pp 832-833. While the distinction is concededly a fine one, plaintiff is really arguing certain ameliorating circumstances, not exculpatory facts. This court has determined that it would place too much of a burden upon investigating police officers to require that they include all possibly mitigating items in their police reports in order to avoid potential liability. <em>[Id. </em>at 466-467.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Simply stated, Dr. Matthews\u2019 contention that the claims were reimbursable under the copayment pro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>grains was, at best, a mitigating or ameliorating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Because it was undisputed that Sinai Hospital is a teaching facility and that reimbursement for technical surgical assistance was not available under either the regular business program or the copayment programs unless the operating surgeon certified the unavailability of an \u201cin-house\u201d assistant, there was no nondisclosure of information that was material, and no disputed fact regarding the information on which the prosecutor relied to make his independent determination of probable cause. There being no evidence negating the existence of defendant\u2019s reasonable belief that Dr. Matthews had submitted claims for reimbursement to which he was not entitled, the trial court erred in submitting the issue of probable cause to the jury and denying defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Blue Cross clearly had probable cause to believe that Dr. Matthews had probably made false claims for reimbursement.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The fact that Blue Cross was aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>that a policy under the copayment programs deleted the word \u201cactive,\u201d might constitute an ameliorating circumstance bearing on whether Dr. Matthews had fraudulent intent, but it does not make false the fact that the plaintiff made claims for payment that were not reimbursable under any definition. The alteration of the surgical records was itself sufficient to raise the suspicions of any prudent businessperson. Combined with advice from the oral surgeons that Dr. Matthews provided no services and did not have their permission to make a contrary representation, a reasonable person would have concluded that Dr. Matthews probably had committed a felony. There was no evidence that the prosecution was initiated other than at the sole discretion of the prosecutor on the basis of an independent investigation.

Enos testified that he did not have any recollection that he had any conversations with Price regarding the statement. While the defendant offered testimony tending to show that Enos had told another person that he was not required to furnish a tax statement, there was nothing to substantiate that the defendant had spoken to Enos personally before making the complaint.

Because the evidence supported Blue Cross and Blue Shield\u2019s assertion that Dr. Matthews was improperly billing technical surgical assistance at a teaching hospital, as that term is defined in either the 1979 or the 1984 Physician\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Manual, I concur in the result reached by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">At the civil trial, Officer Rumbly was asked whether finding out about the 1984 definition caused him to question whether the police had a case against Dr. Matthews. He answered, \u201cWell, at the time that it came out, obviously I wanted to know exactly what the definition was, and where it was, and why it wasn\u2019t in my file. However, given the other evidence in the case, it did not cause me any hesitation in terms of the issue of probable cause . . . .\u201d When asked what those other factors were, and what was argued in the criminal trial, Rumbly replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">The defendant was charged with having submitted false health care claims to Blue Cross and Blue Shield. . . . Our theory of the case is that the defendant was not entitled to be paid for the benefit of having acted as a technical surgical assistant. It went beyond the definition to the extent that either definition existed, there were conditions that were attached to that definition. Now, I can\u2019t recite them word for word, but there were conditions that existed because of the fact that these procedures took place in what Blue Cross defined as a teaching hospital. It was at Sinai Hospital. Because that was a teaching hospital, there had to be some certification that at the time of the procedure, there was no intern or resident available to assist the surgeon who was in charge of the procedure before this provider, Dr. Matthews, could claim the benefit of tsa. There was no evidence to indicate that at any time, anybody ever certified that there was a resident or intern unavailable. That was one item.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">On the basis of this factor, specifically relied on by both Blue Cross and the prosecutors, I find that probable cause existed to bring charges against Dr. Matthews for improper billing practices. I do not express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>any opinion regarding the other matters raised in the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
