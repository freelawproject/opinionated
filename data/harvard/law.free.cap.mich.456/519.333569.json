We hold that the due process guarantees of the Michi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>gan and United States Constitutions, Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, and US Const, Am XIV, do not create a right to preclude retrial of this defendant in these circumstances.

Trial began in June, 1993, and a mistrial was declared after the jury was unable to reach a verdict. In February, 1994, a second trial was commenced against the defendant in which substantially the same evidence was offered. Again, the jury was unable to reach a verdict, and a mistrial was declared.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">The defendant moved for dismissal of the charges. Acknowledging that the earlier mistrials had not been the result of procedural or substantive errors in the trial process, defendant contended that retrial after two hung juries would be so fundamentally unfair that it would violate the constitutional guarantee of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>due process.

We interpret the state provision as coextensive with the federal provision for purposes of this appeal. Absent definitive differences in the text of the state and federal provision, common-law history that dictates different treatment, or other matters of particular state or local interest, courts should reject the \u201cunprincipled creation of state constitutional rights that exceed their federal counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>parts.\u201d <em>Sitz v Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>443 Mich 744, 763; 506 NW2d 209 (1993).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The defendant relies on five cases in support of the contention that retrial would violate the substantive guarantees of due process: <em>United States v Ingram, </em>412 F Supp 384 (D DC, 1976), <em>State v Witt, </em>572 SW2d 913 (Tenn, 1978), <em>State v Moriwake, </em>65 Hawaii 47; 647 P2d 705 (1982), <em>State v Abbati, </em>99 NJ 418; 493 A2d 513 (1985), and <em>People v Thompson, </em>424 Mich 118; 379 NW2d 49 (1985). However, none of these cases except <em>Thompson </em>addresses the Due Process Clause in the context of a retrial after a properly declared mistrial,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and <em>Thompson </em>does so only in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>dicta.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The prosecutor may not abort a trial over a defendant\u2019s objection absent manifest necessity, <em>People v Dawson, </em>431 Mich 234, 252; 427 NW2d 886 (1988), retry a defendant on higher charges after mistrial in an effort to penalize the defendant, <em>People v Ryan, </em>451 Mich 30; 545 NW2d 612 (1996), nolle prosequi charges at trial without leave of court, MCL 767.29; MSA 28.969, or retry a defendant after having one full and fair opportunity at obtaining a conviction. <em>Dawson, supra </em>at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Neither the cases cited nor our independent research supports the proposition that the protections of substantive due process require recognition of a remedy for the harm incident to one or more mistrials.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Some courts have declared the inherent author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>ity to preclude retrials following mistrials attributable to jury deadlock. However, we reject the rationale that the administration of justice confers authority on this Court to allocate resources available to law enforcement, <em>Abbati, supra </em>at 429, or to assess the relative priority of discrete charges in a given community.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">The United States Supreme Court has declined to expand substantive due process as an independent source of limitation on government.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">In <em>Hurtado v California, </em>110 US 516, 527; 4 S Ct 111; 28 L Ed 232 (1884), it was held that the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause did not make applicable to state governments the Fifth Amendment\u2019s requirement of indictment and presentment to a grand jury. The Court posited that Fourteenth Amendment due process encompassed only those safeguards not specifically found in the Bill of Rights. 1 LaFave &amp; Israel, Criminal Procedure (2d ed), \u00a7 2.4(b), p 55. However, the Court eventually concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated and made applicable to the states numerous protections contained in the Bill of Rights.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Other than in matters relating to marriage, family, procreation, and the right to bodily integrity, the Court has been reluctant to expand the scope of substantive due process beyond the explicit textual source of constitutional protection. <em>Albright v Oliver, </em>510 US 266, 272; 114 S Ct 807; 127 L Ed 2d 114 (1994). Rather than approaching issues of restriction of government authority in areas of criminal proceedings from the unstructured perspective of \u201cwhether, in the view of the Court, the governmental action in question was \u2018arbitraiy,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>the Court has deemed restriction of government authority appropriately encompassed by the remedy the framers of the Bill of Rights created.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Although it is unclear at this stage whether the Court will ultimately conclude that substantive due process has been supplanted by specific provisions of the Bill of Rights, see <em>Lewis v Sacramento Co, </em>98 F3d 434 (CA 9, 1996), cert gtd 520 US 1250; 117 S Ct 2406; 138 L Ed 2d 173 (1997), it is clear that the Court will not rely on substantive due process to sanction new remedies that duplicate the protections of specific constitutional provisions. Thus, in <em>Graham v Connor, </em>490 US 386; 109 S Ct 1865; 104 L Ed 2d 443 (1989), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>the Court refused to recognize a constitutional remedy under 42 USC 1983 on the basis of the assertion that the use of excessive force in making an arrest constituted a violation of substantive due process. The Court held that the remedy for a claim of excessive force during arrest must be determined with reference to the Fourth Amendment as the explicit constitutional standard protecting the asserted interest, rather than the abstract claim of a violation of substantive due process.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">In <em>Collins v Harker Heights, supra, </em>the Court again underscored its reluctance to expand the doctrine of substantive due process, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-7\">As a general matter, the Court has always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended. . . . The doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field. <em>lid. </em>at 125.]<footnotemark>[16]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">In <em>Albright v Oliver, supra </em>at 268-271, the Court similarly declined to recognize a substantive right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>due process to be free from criminal prosecution except upon probable cause. Because the first step in alleging a constitutional violation is to identify the specific right infringed, the Court began by reiterating that substantive due process rights have for the most part accorded to \u201cmatters relating to marriage, family, procreation, and the right to bodily integrity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272. Although the lead opinion was signed by only a plurality of the justices, a majority of the Court joined in the rationale limiting the scope of substantive due process on the ground that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-5\">[w]here a particular amendment \u201cprovides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection\u201d against a particular sort of government behavior, \u201cthat Amendment, not the more generalized notion of \u2018substantive due process\u2019 must be the guide for analyzing th[e] claims.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 273, quoting <em>Graham v Connor, supra </em>at 395.]<footnotemark>[17]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">The contention that the Court should infer a remedy precluding retrial because of \u201cthe anxiety, stress, humiliation, and cost to the defendant of continual reprosecution where no new evidence exists\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>general claim of governmental unfairness. \u201cEvery prosecution ... \u2018is a public act that may seriously . . . disrupt [the defendant\u2019s] employment, drain his financial resources, curtail his associations, subject him to public obloquy, and create anxiety in him, his family and his friends,\u2019 \u201d <em>Albright, supra </em>at 296 (Stevens, J., dissenting), quoting <em>United States v Marion, </em>404 US 307, 320; 92 S Ct 455; 30 L Ed 2d 468 (1971).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Further, if recognized, guidelines for respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>sible decision making in applying the new remedy would be scarce and open-ended. If three trials are too many under substantive due process, why are not two? It could follow that either any retrial after a mistrial is barred as a violation of substantive due process, or that the theory as applied would result in arbitrary assertion of judicial authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The relationship between federal and state governments and that of the state judiciary to its coordinate branches are obviously different. The common concern is the reach and contours of assertion of the power to declare \u201carbitrary\u201d the conduct of government actors. While the focus of this Court\u2019s concern regarding expansive interpretation of our authority has been expressed in terms of separation of powers, rather than the powers reserved for the states under the Tenth Amendment, we have also cautiously responded to requests to recognize new remedies that would limit the authority of the executive or legislative branches of government. We declined the invitation to expand judicial authority in <em>People v Mateo, </em>453 Mich 203, 211; 551 NW2d 891 (1996). There, we abstained from deciding whether the harmless error statute was a legislative attempt to supplant judicial authority. We refused to require compliance with sentencing guidelines because the Legislature had not mandated such compliance, <em>People v Milbourn, </em>435 Mich 630, 656-657; 461 NW2d 1 (1990), and rejected the claim that circuit courts have the authority to nolle prosequi a case. <em>People v Curtis, </em>389 Mich 698, 711; 209 NW2d 243 (1973). \u201c[A]s long as jeopardy has not attached, or the statute of limitations not run, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>law permits a prosecutor to reinstate the original charge on the basis of obtaining a new indictment and thus beginning the process anew.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706. See also <em>People v Gallego, </em>430 Mich 443, 452; 424 NW2d 470 (1988) (enforcing an unauthorized promise by the police not to prosecute would undermine the prosecutorial function); <em>Employees &amp; Judge of the Second Dist Court v Hillsdale Co, </em>423 Mich 705, 723; 378 NW2d 744 (1985) (an administrative order to compel funding in excess of appropriations is an improper exercise of judicial power); <em>Genesee Co Prosecutor v Genesee Circuit Judge, </em>391 Mich 115; 215 NW2d 145 (1974) ; <em>Genesee Co Prosecutor v Genesee Circuit Judge, </em>386 Mich 672, 683; 194 NW2d 693 (1972). Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-5\">The powers of government are divided into three branches: legislative, executive and judicial. No person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch except as expressly provided in this constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">We hold that in dismissing this case in the circumstances here presented, the trial judge violated the doctrine of separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The amorphous claim endorsed by the trial court and the Court of Appeals would inevitably call for courts to decide what policy of retrial is best for all the people of Michigan. In words equally appropriate to the relationship between the branches of state government and our citizens, Judge Easterbrooke has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-8\">Which policy is best for the people ... is a complex question, answered different ways at different times in this nation (and in dramatically different ways by different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>nations today) \u2014 but it is a question about moral and efficient law enforcement for the people to debate and resolve. It is not a question whose only answer must be given by the judicial branch on the basis of \u201csubstantive due process.\u201d <em>[Mays v East St Louis, </em>123 F3d 999, 1003 (CA 7, 1997).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Finally, absent a violation of the constitution or specific statutory authority, we are not persuaded that we have the authority or the wisdom to monitor the performance of the elected prosecutor. Nor has the case been made that harm to an interest not addressed by specific provisions of the Bill of Rights requires a new remedy. Whatever the reach of substantive due process, this claim does not approach the threshold.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In this context, we find no historical, textual, or empirical foundation that requires inferring a new remedy from the penumbras of substantive due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">vn</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">For the reasons stated, we hold that the reprosecution of this defendant is not a violation of the due process guarantees of the Michigan and United States Constitutions, Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, and US Const, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Ana XIV.

While the defendant submits that the juror votes are material to our result, we decline the invitation to decide the issue on this basis. Neither this Court nor any other court has obligated jurors to disclose their votes other than in the context of confirming that they agree with a verdict reported as unanimous. It follows that we have not recognized a right on behalf of either the prosecution or the defense to such information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b848-10\"> The trial court concluded that retrial would be fundamentally unfair because 1) two prior trials had resulted in jury deadlock, 2) the prosecutor had no new evidence to offer against the defendant, 3) the likelihood of a third hung jury was high because there was no new evidence against the defendant, and 4) retrial would be an inefficient use of judicial resources.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b848-11\"> 219 Mich App 127; 555 NW2d 728 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b848-12\"> The dissenting judge agreed that due process guarantees may require dismissal of the charges against a defendant over the prosecutor\u2019s objection under certain circumstances, but argued that this defendant\u2019s right to due process would not be violated to such a degree that dismissal was justified. <em>Id. </em>at 136.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b848-13\"> 454 Mich 873 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b848-14\"> Defendant concedes that his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause have not been violated by the repeated trials.

The Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial is thus not primarily intended to prevent prejudice to the defense caused by passage of time; that interest is protected primarily by the Due Process Clause and by statutes of limitations. The speedy trial guarantee is designed to minimize the possibility of lengthy incarceration prior to trial, to reduce the lesser, but nevertheless substantial, impairment of liberty imposed on an accused while released on bail, and to shorten the disruption of life caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal charges. . . .

The majority\u2019s opinion today attempts to reach a conclusion that decides far more than the case before us. Instead of merely focusing on the task at hand, the majority seeks to effectively sound a death knell for the concept of substantive due process under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, and, for that matter, the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, in the law of Michigan. Because I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s result, or support its far-ranging dicta, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">In <em>People v Thompson, </em>424 Mich 118; 379 NW2d 49 (1985), we were presented with the question whether a retrial, following a mistrial because of deadlocked jury, which itself followed the reversal of a jury conviction for legal error, violated, inter alia, the defendant\u2019s due process rights. We found that, \u201c[wjhile there may be cases in which repeated retrials after repeated jury deadlock might be so fundamentally unfair as to violate the due process guaranteed by Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, or the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, this case [was] not one of them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">In this case, the trial court, relying on our guidance in <em>Thompson, </em>believed that such a case was before it, and dismissed the charges against the defendant following two successive trials that resulted in jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>deadlock. The majority, rather than simply correcting the perceived error in the trial judge\u2019s application of <em>Thompson, </em>instead beats a wholesale retreat from it, and effectively holds that, in fact, there can never be a case such as we contemplated in <em>Thompson.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Defendant was the owner of a sports equipment store in Garden City. After about six months in business, he increased his insurance coverage on the contents of the store from $50,000 to $75,000. Two weeks later, on June 27, 1990, there was a fire at the store. Defendant left the store at approximately 4:15 P.M. to visit relatives out of town. The fire was reported at 7:15 P.M., and investigators determined it had been smoldering for a couple of hours. Defendant\u2019s store suffered considerable damage, and adjacent businesses suffered smoke damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">The investigation revealed no sign of illegal entry, and bum patterns of flammable liquid appeared on the floor in the area of the fire\u2019s origin. At both trials, the defendant pointed out that charcoal grills and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>lighter fluid were stored in this area, and argued that the investigators had not adequately tested to rule out those items as the cause of the markings.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The defendant was charged with one count of burning of real property<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and one count of burning of insured property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant has apparently been out on bond throughout the proceedings. Defendant\u2019s first trial occurred in June 1993 in Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court with Judge Andrea J. Ferrara presiding. The trial lasted over parts of ten days. The prosecution apparently produced five expert witnesses, and the defense produced two. The jury could not reach a unanimous verdict, with the jury split ten to two or eight to four in favor of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The defendant was retried in February 1994, with Judge Samuel A. Turner presiding. The trial lasted approximately the same amount of time as the first, and similar expert witnesses were called by both sides. The jury again deadlocked, this time six to six.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">The prosecution announced its intention to again retry the defendant. The defendant moved to dismiss, arguing the likelihood of yet another hung jury and that he would suffer substantial prejudice if retried again.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">The motion was heard August 5, 1994, before Recorder\u2019s Court Chief Judge Dalton A. Roberson.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defense counsel argued that witnesses\u2019 memories <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>were growing dim, and that defendant had twice been defended by retained counsel and had been forced to retain expert witnesses. The trial court agreed, and dismissed the charges, citing, among other things, the substantial financial prejudice to the defendant. The trial court ruled both on the record and in a written opinion, citing <em>Thompson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">The prosecutor appealed in the Court of Appeals, which affirmed in a published opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A separate opinion agreed with the Court\u2019s underlying holding that a due process analysis applied in this situation, but dissented on its application to the instant facts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">While the majority quotes a collection of familiar authority regarding the common woes that befall a defendant who is charged with a crime under any circumstances, no mention is made of the peculiar facts of this case. The defendant was charged with the crime commonly referred to as arson. There was no direct evidence linking him to the fire, and the only indirect evidence that stood for the proposition that a crime had even been committed was the bum patterns on the floor, which indicated the presence of flammable liquids. The defendant came forward with evidence that flammable liquids were routinely stored in this area. This set the stage for a battle of expert witnesses in the field of fire cause and origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">This case tinned entirely on expert testimony. If the jury believed the prosecution\u2019s experts, a crime had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>occurred, and the defendant was the most logical suspect.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If, however, the jury believed the defense experts, no crime had even occurred. In a case such as this, the availability of expert testimony is crucial. While the state has available to it numerous experts in the field of fire cause and origin, the defendant must turn to the private sector, where the rule of supply and demand favors high expert witness fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">It is here I see a difference between this case and those authorities cited by the majority. It is without dispute that one who is charged with a crime will incur substantial attorney costs. Those who cannot afford an attorney are, of course, provided with assigned counsel. But while the appointment of necessary defense experts is required by statute,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> given the majority\u2019s past hostility toward the appointment of expert witnesses for the defense,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>1 would not fault the defendant for finding no comfort in the slight possibility of obtaining appointed experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">As the Court said in <em>Thompson, </em>due process is violated where there is a \u201c \u2018failure to observe that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because I cannot subscribe to the majority\u2019s implication, throughout the dicta contained in part iv of its opinion, that such a concept has no place in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>criminal law of this state, I would apply a due process analysis here.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Likewise, the majority\u2019s effort regarding the purported applicability of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against double jeopardy to exclude any due process protection strikes me as misguided. The protection provided in the guarantee against double jeopardy is twofold. \u201cThe Clause secures the defendant\u2019s interests in (1) the finality of judgments, and (2) protection against multiple prosecutions.\u201d <em>People v Anderson, </em>409 Mich 474, 482-483; 295 NW2d 482 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">While this case certainly involves multiple prosecutions, the application of the due process analysis is not to the multiple prosecutions per se, but to the underlying result \u2014 will the defendant receive a fair trial? In this case, I am convinced that while yet another trial or two may eventually result in the defendant\u2019s conviction, there is far too great a likelihood that such a result will directly follow the defendant becoming financially unable to retain experts of sufficient qualifications and capabilities as to adequately advance his theory of the case. The end to the concept of trial by ordeal long predates the law of our state, and I find it to be fundamentally unfair to return to it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">The majority, after misconstruing the underlying issue and attempting to insure that this Court never again faces another claim of a substantive due process in a criminal case, continues still further, finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers. It does so following a lengthy list of citations, but scant analysis.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Again, I find this unpersuasive. The majority believes that \u201cabsent a violation of the constitution or specific statutory authority, we are not persuaded that we have the authority or the wisdom to monitor the performance of the elected prosecutor.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 533. While this Court has often made it clear that there are aspects of a prosecutor\u2019s role where the judicial branch has no call to intervene,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> I question the \u201cwisdom\u201d of the majority\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Is the Court saying that, absent a specific violation of a specific constitutional provision, it has absolutely no right or duty to insure that a defendant receives a fair trial, or to prevent the prosecution from engaging in egregious conduct? It seems to me that, in actuality, our inherent constitutional authority to oversee the practice and procedure in our courts, Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5, must include some measure of requiring fairness in proceedings. I do not believe that, when one party is the prosecutor, the doctrine of separation of powers requires us to relinquish the inherent con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>trol we maintain over the conduct of litigants before our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">As we noted in <em>Anderson, </em>when only one of the interests protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated, we engage in a balancing of the defendant\u2019s and the state\u2019s interests. <em>Id. </em>at 483-484. Under the majority\u2019s analysis, it would seem that, because there is not a complete violation of a specific constitutional provision, we could not do such a thing. I cringe at the volume and breadth of precedent potentially impinged by such an analysis, and take solace only in the fact that it is included in repetitive and cumulative dicta.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">The majority cites <em>People v Dawson, </em>431 Mich 234; 427 NW2d 886 (1988), as not allowing the prosecutor to \u201cretry a defendant after having one full and fair opportunity at obtaining a conviction.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 525. I agree, and recall our unanimous decision in that case, which, in adopting this view, reasoned, \u201c[otherwise, the state could repeatedly prosecute persons for the same crime, transforming the trial process itself into a punishment and effectively punishing the accused without his having been adjudged guilty of an offense meriting punishment.\u201d <em>Dawson </em>at 250-251. Where, as here, the prosecution had not one, but two \u201cfull and fair\u201d opportunities to obtain a conviction, and, admittedly, came forward for a third effort with no new evidence, the line marking that transformation of the trial process into an ongoing punishment was crossed.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">I would analyze this case in accordance with our past decisions, and, in this case, find that a third retrial would be so prejudicial to the defendant as to violate his right to due process on these particular, and unusual, facts. I find the remainder of the majority\u2019s opinion to be both unnecessary and unpersuasive. I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b868-6\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-7\"> I note that the author of <em>Thompson </em>is also the author of the majority opinion today. While the majority dismisses the quoted passage of <em>Thompson </em>as dicta, I should make two points. The first is that I argue not that this portion of <em>Thompson </em>is controlling, but rather, that prudence indicates that we take the same course as we did then, i.e., again, if this is not such a case, it still remains possible one might come before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">Second, to the extent those in the majority would dismiss this language as merely ill-advised dicta, an assertion I disagree with, I note they still insist on attempting to stretch the instant opinion to cover a variety of situations not before the Court. To the extent one credits the majority\u2019s disregard of nearly all the analysis included in part in of <em>Thompson, </em>to be at all consistent, one would have to seriously question the inclusion of at least parts IV through vi of the majority\u2019s opinion, all of which are unnecessary to the decision today, as it is already controlled by the analysis in parts n and m of the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b862-10\"> MCL 750.73; MSA 28.268.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b862-11\"> MCL 750.75; MSA 28.270.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b862-12\"> While the motion was argued by the same defense counsel and assistant prosecutor as appeared in the second trial (neither of whom had participated in the first trial), it was argued before Chief Judge Roberson, whose only prior involvement with the case was in hearing some pretrial motions.

If one merely, instead of reading only the sentence quoted, continues on to the following sentence and paragraph, it is apparent that the entire discussion concerned the fact that we, of course, have always allowed departures from the sentencing guidelines.

While the quotation proclaims the virtue of majority rule over court decisions of substantive due process, <em>Mays </em>involved a claim of due process violations by injured and Wiled passengers in a vehicle that crashed while fleeing from a high-speed police pursuit. The context of the quotation is a discussion of weighing the dangers of a police pursuit with the dangers of letting criminals escape.

Two subsequent trials resulted in deadlocked juries. The defendant pleaded no contest just before a fifth trial. The opinion states that a holding for the defendant would mean that, arguably, all retrials where two mistrials have occurred would be prevented. Defendant did not argue this, neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals held this, and I do not believe even the prosecution forecast this gloomy scenario, which would seem objectionable to all and would require as severe an abdication of any analysis of substantive due process as the majority undertakes today, but in the opposite direction. I certainly endorse no such thing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
