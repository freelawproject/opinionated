The County Court reversed holding that \u201cdecedent\u2019s death from heart failure * * * occurred as the result of an unusual strain arising out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d The case is factual and recognized as such by both appellant and respondent. The Deputy Director who heard the case said : \u201cI am completely unimpressed by the testimony of the Petitioner\u2019s witnesses * * *. Putting it very bluntly, I do not believe the testimony of the two laborers, employees of the Respondent company owned by the Petitioner\u2019s brother. 1 had opportunity to observe these witnesses in Court on many occasions and while testifying both on the direct case and when called in rebuttal. Their testimony that they had never discussed the death of the decedent with anyone, particularly the bookkeeper in charge of the office at the time of decedent\u2019s collapse, * * * is utterly unbelieveable.\u201d The County Court on the important element of credibility, arrived at a contrary opinion and, while recognizing the weight to be given a finding of fact of the tribunal that had the opportunity of observing the witnesses, discounted that weight for the reason, among others, that the six hearings were spread over a period of four and a half months, which fact, the County Court believed, prevented the Deputy Director from recalling \u201cas clearly the personalities of the earlier witnesses as those of the later. Obviously therefore this consideration of the personalities of the witnesses by the Bureau, their credibility, instead of being helpful, was in fact misleading from the standpoint of comparing their weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\"> The evidence presents a close question, particularly as to the element of credibility. Bearing in mind the admonition in <em>Gilbert v. Gilbert Machine Works, Inc., </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>533 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1939), that \u201cthere is a natural hesitation on the part of the appellate tribunal, confined as it is to the written word, to disturb factual conclusions of the judicial officer to whom the evidence has been orally presented,\u201d we feel that the Deputy Director should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
