He was jointly indicted with one Erank Esposito, the latter of whom retracted his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of <em>non vult. </em>The trial proceeded against De Ealco alone and Esposito testified as a witness for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">There is no serious dispute between the parties as to the applicable law. Their disagreement revolves around the factual situation. We will limit our discussion to the grounds of appeal which we think are essential for the determination of the issues, viz.: that the court erred in denying motions for acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case and at the end of the entire case, and that the verdict is against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>weight of the evidence. The defendant insists that the State\u2019s proofs were such that the jury could not legitimately infer that De Falco was participating in the unlawful operation of bookmaking; that all the State established was that De Falco was present in the apartment where admittedly Esposito was engaged in bookmaking at the time the police officers made the raid. The State\u2019s proofs at the end of its case were that on February 15, 1949, shortly after 2:00 r. an., Detectives Fisher and Wiener of the Essex County Sheriff\u2019s Office, together with four Orange City detectives, raided an apartment on the third floor of premises No. 409 Minton Place, Orange. The apartment consisted of a living room, kitchen, two bedrooms and a bathroom, tenanted by Mr. and Mrs. Petruzzelli, the latter of whom is De Falco\u2019s sister. Detectives Fisher, Wiener, Savage and Capawanna proceeded up the rear stairway and upon arrival at the apartment, Detective Fisher knocked on the door twice without response. He then observed what appeared to be a \u201cflame on this frosted glass on my left,\u201d which was the reflection on the bathroom window of a fire inside. Fisher thereupon broke the glass in the kitchen door and gained entrance by reaching inside and unlocking it. They proceeded immediately to the bathroom where they saw two men, De Falco and Esposito, attempting to put out the fire that had set the curtains on fire. The officers assisted in extinguishing the flames. Upon inquiry as to the cause of the fire, the officers testified that Esposito said he was attempting to destroy some obscene pictures. There was testimony that both Esposito and De Falco \u201chad their jackets off and they were in their shirt sleeves.\u201d A search was then made of the living room and the following articles pertaining to bookmaking were discovered and seized: a William Armstrong scratch sheet, dated February 14th, containing a list of horses entered at various tracks, and other information pertinent thereto, which was found underneath a child\u2019s school notebook, also two \u201crun-down\u201d sheets used by bettors to make bets, containing bets made on February 14th and 15th, and a scrap of paper containing bets made on an unknown date; another Armstrong scratch sheet dated Feb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>ruary 1, 1949, discovered in the waste paper basket under the kitchen sink. While the officers were in the apartment, two telephone calls were received by Detective Fisher, asking for \u201cFrankie.\u201d One requested the result of the first race at the Hialeah track and one was from a bettor making a bet. Detective Wiener testified that after the officers entered the apartment, De Falco \u201cbrought me outside\u201d and said \u201cYour brother represented me at one time\u201d and requested Wiener to \u201cLet me out of here.\u201d Wiener replied, \u201cYou\u2019re in here and you\u2019re caught, and you will have to take the consequences.\u201d De Falco testified in his own behalf and denied any connection with the bookmaking operation, that he went to his sister\u2019s apartment as a result of a call from his mother that his sister was ill, being driven there by a Mr. Caggiano; that his sister was not home and he was admitted to the apartment through the back by Esposito; that he was only in the apartment five minutes when the raid occurred; that he was \u201con parole\u201d from State Prison and was \u201ca little fidgety\u201d and when asked to explain his presence he stated \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d; that he was in the kitchen from the time of his arrival until the officers entered; that he was never in the bathroom with Esposito to help extinguish the fire. De Falco admitted previous convictions of crime, one for robbery and one in 1946 for maintaining a place for gaming. Caggiano testified for the defendant that he had given him a ride in his car to his sister\u2019s home; that he was to call for De Falco in fifteen or twenty minutes thereafter and when he returned he was confronted by a detective who informed him of the raid; that instead of telling the detective that he had come for De Falco, he claimed he had come to see the sister \u201cabout a job.\u201d Esposito testified for the defendant and assumed full responsibility for the crime and exonerated De Falco completely from any and all connection, therewith. Esposito admitted that he had three Armstrong scratch sheets when he came to the apartment, .one . dated February 1st, another dated February 14th;, and a third one dated February ,15th, the last of which was \u201cmissing.\u201d\" It was the State\u2019s theory that both Esposito and De Falco 'were engaged in the unlawful bookmaking operation. Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>contention is based upon the premise that the only proof against De Falco is that he was present at the scene of the alleged crime and that mere presence there did not render him <em>parti ceps cri minis </em>and thereby constitute him a party to the criminal act. lie insists that the State must prove that the defendant was not only present at the scene of the crime but actually participated and aided and abetted in the crime itself. <em>State v. </em>Fox, 70 <em>N. J. L. </em>353 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1904.). The undisputed rule of law is that those who aid or abet in a misdemeanor are principals and all are equally guilty. If one would escape the penalty denounced against the crime he must cease to act in complicity as soon as he had knowledge of the criminal character of their conduct. <em>State v. Churchill, </em>105 <em>N. J. L. </em>123 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1928). It is also a generally accepted rule of law that proof that a person is present at the commission of a crime without disapproving or opposing it, is evidence from which, in connection with other circumstances, it is competent for the jury to infer that he assented thereto, lent to it his countenance and approval, and was thereby aiding and abetting the same. 1 <em>R. C. L. </em>141. <em>We </em>are satisfied that at the end of the State\u2019s case there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could legitimately infer that De Palco was present and participating with Esposito in the unlawful bookmaking operation. An acquittal should not be directed at the end of the State\u2019s case where there is circumstantial evidence of guilt, which if believed by the jury, would justify a guilty verdict. <em>State v. </em>Sgro, 108 <em>N. J. L. </em>528 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1932) <em>; State v. </em>Cammarata, 12 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>115 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">At the end of the entire case, the proofs consisted of the additional evidence of Esposito\u2019s admission that the Armstrong scratch sheet for February 15th was missing and this coupled with testimony of the police officers that Esposito was seen with De Falco in the* bathroom at the time of the fire created a justifiable inference, if.believed by the jury, that De Paleo participated in the'destruction of the incriminating evidence. The jury was not compelled to accept Esposito\u2019s statement that he was' burning obscene picture cards. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>were entitled to consider the other proven circumstances establishing the bookmaking operation. Any attempt to suppress evidence is a circumstance to go to the jury as a basis from which guilt may be inferred. <em>Wharton\u2019s Crim. Evid. </em>(11th <em>Ed.), Vol. </em>1, \u00a7 115, <em>p. </em>133. This general rule of law is given support in 14 <em>Am. Juris., \"Criminal Law \u201d </em>\u00a7 88, <em>p. </em>828, wherein it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">\u201c* * * But if the abettor was consenting to the crime and in a situation in which he might render any aid by arrangement with the perpetrator, for the purpose of aiding and assisting him in the crime, then it would follow as a necessary legal inference that he was actually aiding and abetting at the commission of the crime. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">There was also the additional evidence of the witness Caggiano who testified he drove De Falco to the apartment and was to return for De Falco in fifteen or twenty minutes; however, when he did return and was confronted by a police officer, he did not tell the officer he was there for De Ealco, but instead, that he came to see Mrs. Petruzzelli about a job. In addition, there was the proof of prior criminal convictions of De Falco, which might have prompted the jury to disbelieve De Falco\u2019s story. The proofs at the end of the entire case were sufficient, if believed by the jury, as they evidently were, to justify the verdict of guilty against the defendant and it would have been improper for the court to have directed an acquittal. . <em>State v. Bricker, </em>99 <em>N. J. L. </em>521 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1924). The court properly denied defendant\u2019s motions for acquittal and our review of the record convinces us that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence. Defendant calls our attention to the recent case of <em>State v. O\u2019Donnell, </em>8 <em>N. J. Super. </em>13 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950), as applicable to the facts here. However, the factual situation in the <em>O\u2019Donnell case </em>is not analogous. The defendant there was not present at the scene of the alleged unlawful bookmaking operation and the only evidence against her was that she was the lessee- of the apartment and that the telephone was listed in her-name.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u25a0\u25a0 <em>We </em>have.reviewed-the other grounds advanced b.y defendant for reversal and find they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">' The judgment of \u25a0 conviction is affirmed. \u2022 \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
