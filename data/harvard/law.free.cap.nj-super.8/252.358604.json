The plaintiff\u2019s action is grounded upon defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>negligence as the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s damages arising out of an automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">We have carefully reviewed the record and are satisfied that the verdict is clearly excessive. It should be reduced to the sum of $3,500 and we so direct. If this is not acceptable to plaintiff, then, in view of the fact that defendant has not raised any question as to the jury\u2019s finding of liability against him, a new trial for damages only is directed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
