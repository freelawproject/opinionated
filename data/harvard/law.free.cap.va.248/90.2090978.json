The primary issue is whether, as a matter of law, the testimony of the scrivener of the wills established a contract between the spouses for the disposition of their property upon the death of the survivor.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">In May or June 1991, James G. Keene and his wife, Rebecca T. Keene, asked Gerald D. Robertson, an attorney, to prepare wills for them leaving their respective properties to the survivor. The wife had no children; the husband had children by a prior marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-13\">When Robertson told the Keenes that the survivor would have the power to dispose of their combined estates, the Keenes responded that they wanted the survivor\u2019s estate divided among eight persons. Thereafter, each spouse designated four relatives as beneficiaries. Robertson then explained to the Keenes that if they signed mutual and reciprocal wills, \u201cthis would be a contract between the two of them, that they would each, the ultimate survivor, would agree to leave the property as the wills were originally drawn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">Robertson testified that he had not drawn a joint will, or a separate contract reflecting such an agreement, nor had he recited the agreement in the wills because he thought the Keenes \u201chad a clear understanding of . . . how the ultimate beneficiaries would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>take the property.\u201d Instead, Robertson prepared a will for each spouse under the terms of which the surviving spouse would receive the entire estate of the first decedent and the eight parties named by the Keenes in their wills would receive the estate of the survivor.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">On June 27, 1991, both wills were executed. The wife died two months later, on August 31. The husband revoked his June 27 will by executing a will on September 10, 1991. That will left his property to his two sons and the same four relatives he had named in his June 27 will. The husband died on November 7, 1991, and shortly thereafter his September 10 will was probated.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The persons named by the wife as beneficiaries in her June 27 will filed this suit against the executor and beneficiaries of the husband\u2019s September 10 will. In this suit, they sought their share of the husband\u2019s estate under the June 27 will.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> At an <em>ore tenus </em>hearing, the plaintiffs presented Robertson\u2019s testimony and other evidence and the defendants presented no testimony. After argument, the court concluded that Robertson\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot sufficient to establish a reciprocal will\u201d and found for the defendants. The plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We recognized the enforceability of contracts to make mutual and reciprocal wills in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>123 Va. 643, 648-49, 96 S.E. 749, 751 (1918). Proof of such contracts may be supplied by \u201ccompetent witnesses who testify to admissions of the testators, or it may result as an implication from the circumstances and relations of the parties and what they have actually provided for by the instrument. Direct evidence is not necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649-50, 96 S.E. at 751. However, such proof must be \u201cclear and satisfactory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649, 96 S.E. at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Further, the standard of review of the evidence in this case has been established by statute and our cases construing that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">When a case is decided by a court sitting without a jury and, as here, parties object to the decision on the ground that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>contrary to the evidence, the judgment of the trial court will not be set aside, \u201cunless it appears from the evidence that such judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\"><em>City of Hopewell v. County of Prince George, </em>239 Va. 287, 296, 389 S.E.2d 685, 690 (1990).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">However, a trial court\u2019s conclusion based on evidence that is \u201cnot in material conflict\u201d does not have this binding effect on appeal. The trier of fact must determine the weight of the testimony and the credibility of the witnesses, but it \u201cmay not arbitrarily disregard uncontradicted evidence of unimpeached witnesses which is not inherently incredible and not inconsistent with facts in the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-7\"><em>Hankerson </em>v. <em>Moody, 229 </em>Va. 270, 274, 329 S.E.2d 791, 794 (1985) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Applying these principles, we conclude that the uncontradicted testimony of Robertson, an unimpeached witness, was \u201cnot inherently incredible\u201d and was consistent with the facts in the case. That testimony clearly and satisfactorily indicated that both spouses understood that, upon execution of their wills, they were contracting to leave the property remaining at the survivor\u2019s death to the eight parties named in those wills. Under these circumstances, the trial court\u2019s decision that the evidence was \u201cnot sufficient to establish a reciprocal will\u201d was plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Even so, defendants note that the marital residence held by the husband and wife as tenants by the entirety was the wife\u2019s only property interest established by the record. Thus, the defendants contend, there was no consideration for the husband\u2019s alleged contractual agreement. We reject this argument because sufficient consideration is supplied by the mutual agreement that the third parties named as beneficiaries in each spouse\u2019s June 27 will would ultimately receive the balance of the survivor\u2019s estate. <em>See Williams, </em>123 Va. at 648-49, 96 S.E. at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">Finally, the defendants argue that the contract cannot be enforced because it was an oral postnuptial agreement which was not in writing, as required by Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-155 and -149. Code \u00a7 20-155 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Married persons may enter into agreements with each other <em>for the purpose of settling the rights and obligations of either or both of them, </em>to the same extent, with the same effect, and subject to the same conditions, as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 20-147 through 20-154 for agreements between prospective spouses, except that such marital agreements shall become effective immediately upon their execution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">(Emphasis added.) Code \u00a7 20-150 provides in pertinent part that parties to a premarital agreement may contract with respect to \u201c[t]he disposition of property upon separation, marital dissolution, death\u201d and the \u201cmaking of a will ... to carry out the provisions of the agreement[.]\u201d Code \u00a7 20-149 requires that a \u201cpremarital agreement shall be in writing and signed by both parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">In support of their expansive reading of \u201cmarital agreements,\u201d the defendants note that their construction of Code \u00a7 20-155 is consistent with \u00a7 2-701 of the Uniform Probate Code, 8 U.L.A. 155 (1983), which requires written evidence of <em>any </em>party\u2019s agreement not to revoke a will. However, Virginia has not adopted such a provision, and we do not think that the legislature intended Code \u00a7 20-155 to require that contracts between spouses be in writing, while permitting other persons to make such contracts orally.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Rather, we are of opinion that the emphasized portion of Code \u00a7 20-155 clearly limits its provisions to those contracts affecting those \u201crights and obligations\u201d that arise from the marital relationship. Here, each spouse\u2019s contractual intent to benefit third parties after the death of both spouses did not affect the \u201crights and obligations\u201d arising from the Keenes\u2019s marital relationship. Thus, we conclude that Code \u00a7 20-155 is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">For these reasons, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b110-10\"> Dorothy Black, Lale Bee Hicks, <em>Larry J. Wright, Curtis J. Wright, </em>and Charles O. Wright are named as complainants in this action. The copy of the husband\u2019s June 27 will in the record lists Dorothy W. Black, Lain Bee Hicks, <em>Larry J. Curtis, </em>and Charles O. Wright as the four persons apparently named by the wife. The record contains no explanation of the insertion of the name of a fifth plaintiff or of the discrepancy between the underlined names in the will and bill of complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
