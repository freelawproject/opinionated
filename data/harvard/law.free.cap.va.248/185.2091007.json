Alexander and his son, Scott S. Alexander, were seriously injured when their vehicle was struck by a car negligently operated by Jerry Lee Jackson. At the time of the accident, Jackson had in effect an automobile liability policy issued by Allstate Insurance Company, with a limit of $50,000 for a single bodily injury claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">In addition, Sherman and Scott Alexander had the benefit of UM coverage under three automobile insurance policies. At the time this accident occurred, Sherman Alexander and his two sons, Scott and John M. Alexander, were residents of the same household in Fairfax. Each Alexander had a separate automobile policy in effect at the time of the accident. The declarations page of Sherman Alexander\u2019s policy, which was issued by United Services Automobile Association (USAA), listed $25,000 UM coverage for each person injured. Scott Alexander\u2019s policy, issued by USAA Casualty Insurance Company (USAA Casualty), provided $100,000 UM coverage per injured person, and John Alexander\u2019s policy, issued by USAA Casualty, provided $50,000 UM coverage per injured person.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Sherman and Scott Alexander filed a motion for declaratory judgment against USAA and USAA Casualty (the insurers), seeking a determination of their rights under the UM endorsements of the three policies issued to the Alexanders. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the trial court ruled that Sherman and Scott each enjoyed $250,000 UIM coverage, before application of a credit for any payment made by Jackson\u2019s liability insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">On appeal, the insurers contend: (1) that the trial court erred in holding that Sherman Alexander\u2019s UM coverage was equal to his liability coverage, despite his execution of a waiver form in 1984 in which he selected $25,000 UM coverage; (2) that because only Scott Alexander\u2019s UM coverage was in an amount greater than Jackson\u2019s liability coverage, the three Alexander policies should not be \u201cstacked\u201d together to produce higher amounts of UIM coverage for the injured parties; and (3) that because Sherman had purchased only \u201cminimum limits\u201d UM coverage, his policy afforded no UIM insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">I. WAIVER OF HIGHER LEVEL OF UM COVERAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A) requires an issuer of an automobile insurance policy to provide UM coverage in limits equal to the limits of liability insurance provided by the policy, unless the insured rejects that level of coverage and chooses to purchase a lesser amount of UM coverage \u201cby notifying the insurer as provided in subsection B of \u00a7 38.2-2202.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-2202(B) requires that each \u201cnew policy or original premium notice of insurance\u201d include a statement advising the insured that UM coverage, equal to the limits of liability coverage, will be provided unless the insured acts within 20 days to notify the insurer that a lesser amount of coverage is desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Code \u00a7 38.2-2202(B) further provides: \u201cAfter twenty days, the insurer shall be relieved of the obligation imposed by this subsection to attach or imprint the foregoing statement to any subsequently delivered renewal policy, extension certificate, other written statement of coverage continuance, or to any subsequently mailed premium notice.\u201d Thus, once the insured has effectively reduced the level of coverage by notifying the insurer, in accordance with Code \u00a7 38.2-2202(B), the waiver and reduction of coverage remains in effect during subsequent renewals of the pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>icy. Code \u00a7 38.2-2202(B); <em>see also Insurance Co. of North America </em>v. <em>MacMillan, </em>945 F.2d 729, 730 (4th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\">In this case, the trial court found that, in 1984, Sherman Alexander had executed and returned a waiver form to USAA by which he requested $25,000 UM coverage and rejected the higher level of coverage, which would have been $100,000. He continued to be insured by USAA from 1984 through the date of the accident in 1991. The declarations pages issued by USAA during this time, as well as the premiums required to be paid, reflected that the renewal policies provided $25,000 UM coverage. In 1990, USAA mailed Sherman a renewal policy for the 1991 period covering the date of the accident; USAA also sent him the notice required by Code \u00a7 38.2-2202(B) and a waiver form by which a lower level of UM coverage could be requested. However, Sherman did not return this waiver form to USAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">The trial court held that \u201cUSAA\u2019s action in sending Sherman Alexander a waiver form triggered a new policy limit selection decision\u201d and that, because Sherman did not return the form, he did not effectively reject the higher UM limits. Because no effective waiver had been made, the court held, the UM coverage available under Sherman\u2019s policy was $100,000, not $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">On appeal, the insurers argue that Sherman\u2019s 1984 waiver of higher UM coverage remained effective through later renewals of his policy, so that his UM coverage at the time of the accident remained $25,000. In response, the Alexanders argue that the trial court\u2019s decision was correct, based on <em>White v. National Union Fire Insurance Co., </em>913 F.2d 165 (4th Cir. 1990). Noting the factual similarities between the present case and <em>White, </em>they contend that Sherman was required to respond to the 1990 waiver form sent him by USAA in order to make an effective rejection of the higher UM limits. Because he failed to return the form, they argue, he was provided with the higher UM limits by operation of law, pursuant to Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In <em>White, </em>the insurer, National Union, had sent its insured a form on which the insured could indicate the desired level of UM coverage. An employee of the insured signed and returned the form, but failed to check any of the options for coverage listed on the form. The Fourth Circuit held that National Union could not rely on a communication by which the insured, in an earlier year, had rejected the higher UM limits, because National Union had chosen to send another coverage selection form, which prompted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>the insured to communicate in return. Because the incomplete coverage selection form was inadequate to constitute a rejection, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the insured had not rejected the higher level of UM coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 169-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The Alexanders contend that here, as in <em>White, </em>the insurer chose to send a waiver form to Sherman Alexander in connection with the policy renewal in 1990, and that, as in <em>White, </em>Sherman took no action that was adequate to constitute a rejection of the higher UM limits. We disagree with the Alexanders\u2019 analysis of <em>White.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We believe that <em>White </em>is distinguishable on its facts because in that case \u201ca subsequent, albeit inadequate, rejection was furnished\u201d by the insured\u2019s employee to National Union. <em>Id. </em>at 170. It was the fact that the insured attempted to respond to the insurer\u2019s request for a selection of coverage, and did so ineffectually, that led to the result in <em>White. </em>Here, in contrast, Sherman Alexander did not respond in any way to USAA\u2019s communication, and we hold that the mere fact that USAA sent him a waiver form was not sufficient to negate Sherman\u2019s earlier decision to reject the higher limits of UM coverage. Thus, the 1984 waiver of higher UM coverage remained in effect through later policy renewals, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 38.2-2202(B), so that Sherman\u2019s UM coverage at the time of the accident was $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">II. STACKING OF UIM COVERAGE UNDER MULTIPLE POLICIES</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Three policies providing UM coverage potentially were available to both Sherman and Scott Alexander. Each was a named insured on his own insurance policy, and each was also an \u201cinsured\u201d because of his status as a relative and resident of the same household under the two additional policies owned by the other members of the Alexander family. The insurers contend that the trial court erred in stacking together the three policies in order to determine the total amount of UIM coverage available. In considering this contention, we are guided by the language of the statutory provisions governing UM and UIM coverage, and by our prior decisions addressing stacking of UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">UM coverage may be available simultaneously from various sources; stacking of that coverage is permitted unless clear and unambiguous language in the insurance policies prevents such multiple coverage. <em>Goodville Mut. Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Borror, </em>221 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>967, 970, 275 S.E.2d 625, 627 (1981). In the case of multiple policies, each providing for UM coverage, the language of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B) mandates stacking of the UM coverage provided under the separate policies. <em>See Bryant </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>205 Va. 897, 901-02, 140 S.E.2d 817, 820 (1965) (construing former Code \u00a7 38.1-381 (b), now recodified as Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B) and containing substantively identical language).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">In addition to its requirements regarding UM insurance, Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A) obligates an insurer to pay a claimant for damages caused by the operation or use of an underinsured vehicle, \u201cto the extent the vehicle is underinsured, as defined in subsection B of this section.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">A motor vehicle is \u201cunderinsured\u201d when, and to the extent that, the total amount of bodily injury . . . coverage applicable to the operation or use of the motor vehicle and available for payment for such bodily injury or property damage, . . . is less than the total amount of uninsured motorist coverage afforded any person injured as a result of the operation or use of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">\u201cAvailable for payment\u201d means the amount of liability insurance coverage applicable to the claim of the injured person for bodily injury ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Thus, Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B) further provides that a motor vehicle is underinsured to the extent that liability coverage on such vehicle is less than the UM coverage available to the claimant on account of the operation of such vehicle. <em>See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Scott, </em>234 Va. 573, 577, 363 S.E.2d 703, 705 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">In this case, the insurers do not contest the Alexanders\u2019 position that the UIM coverage available to them under the three policies at issue should be stacked. They contend, however, that the UIM coverage should be stacked only after it has been determined whether Jackson\u2019s vehicle was in fact \u201cunderinsured\u201d as defined in Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B), and they argue that this threshold question must be answered by a policy-to-policy comparison. Thus, they argue, Jackson\u2019s $50,000 liability policy must be compared with the UM coverage available to Sherman, Scott, and John Alexander under <em>each </em>of the three policies at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>The insurers argue that Sherman Alexander possessed $25,000 UM coverage at the time of the accident, because of the 1984 waiver, and thus, with respect to Sherman\u2019s policy, Jackson\u2019s vehicle was not \u201cunderinsured.\u201d Similarly, because John Alexander\u2019s UM coverage of $50,000 was equal in amount to Jackson\u2019s liability coverage, Jackson\u2019s vehicle was not \u201cunderinsured\u201d as to that policy. The insurers conclude that UIM coverage is available only with respect to Scott Alexander\u2019s policy, which provided UM coverage of $100,000. We disagree with this analysis, because it fails to apply the plain meaning of the language in Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">As we often have stated, \u201cwhen the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, courts must accept its plain meaning and not resort to extrinsic evidence or the rules of construction.\u201d <em>Norfolk Airport Auth. </em>v. <em>Nordwall, </em>246 Va. 391, 394, 436 S.E.2d 436, 438 (1993). The clear and unambiguous language of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B) requires that all the UM coverage available to Sherman and Scott Alexander be aggregated, or stacked, before the <em>total </em>amount of this coverage is compared with the <em>total </em>amount of liability coverage available to Jackson. The relevant portion of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B), set forth above, twice requires a determination of a \u201ctotal\u201d amount. First, the statute requires determination of \u201cthe total amount of bodily injury . . . coverage . . . available for payment,\u201d which \u201cmeans the amount of liability insurance coverage applicable to the claim of the injured person for bodily injury.\u201d In this case, that total amount is the $50,000 available under Jackson\u2019s liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Second, the statute requires the determination of \u201cthe total amount of uninsured motorist coverage afforded any person injured as a result of the operation or use of the vehicle.\u201d In this case, that total amount is the coverage afforded under all three policies, or $175,000. Once these totals have been calculated, it becomes evident that Jackson\u2019s liability coverage is \u201cless than\u201d the total amount of UM coverage afforded to Sherman and Scott Alexander, so that, under the facts of this case, Jackson was operating an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A) and (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>III. UIM COVERAGE WITH \u201cMINIMUM LIMITS\u201d UM COVERAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\">The insurers also contend that, pursuant to language in Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A), Sherman Alexander\u2019s purchase of \u201cminimum limits\u201d UM coverage of $25,000 released them from any obligation to provide him UIM coverage. Thus, they argue that the $25,000 UM coverage provided under Sherman\u2019s policy should not be stacked in determining the extent to which Jackson\u2019s vehicle was underinsured, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">At the time of the accident, the relevant portion of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A) provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">[N]o policy or contract of bodily injury . . . liability insurance relating to the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be issued or delivered in this Commonwealth . . . unless it contains an endorsement or provisiohs undertaking to pay the insured all sums that he is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle, within limits not less than the requirements of \u00a7 46.2-100. Those limits shall equal but not exceed the limits of the liability insurance provided by the policy, unless the insured rejects the additional uninsured motorist insurance coverage by notifying the insurer as provided in subsection B of \u00a7 38.2-2202. <em>Where the insured contracts for higher limits, </em>the endorsement or provisions for those limits shall also obligate the insurer to make payment for bodily injury . . . caused by the operation or use of an underinsured motor vehicle <em>to the extent the vehicle is underinsured, as defined in subsection B of this section.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A) (1990 Repl. Vol.) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The insurers argue that Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A) obligates an insurer to provide UIM coverage only \u201c[wjhere the insured contracts for higher limits\u201d than those required by financial responsibility laws. They contend that Sherman Alexander did not purchase UM coverage in \u201chigher limits,\u201d but in \u201cminimum limits,\u201d that is, the $25,000 minimum required by Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>and 46.2-472.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Therefore, they argue, the statutory qualification that would obligate them to provide UIM coverage has not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We believe that this provision of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A) is ambiguous when read together with other provisions of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A) and (B). Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A) also obligates the insurer to \u201cmake payment for bodily injury . . . caused by the operation or use of an underinsured motor vehicle <em>to the extent the vehicle is underinsured, as defined in subsection B of this </em>section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) However, the definition contained in Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B) provides that \u201cthe extent to which the vehicle is underinsured\u201d is determined not by whether the insured has contracted for higher limits, but by a comparison of the \u201ctotal amount of uninsured motorist coverage afforded any person\u201d with the total amount of liability insurance available for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Because these provisions of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A) and (B) are ambiguous when considered together, we interpret them under settled rules of statutory construction. <em>City of Virginia Beach v. Board of </em>Supervisors, 246 Va. 233, 236, 435 S.E.2d 382, 384 (1993). The ultimate purpose of these rules is to ascertain the intention of the legislature, and \u201c[ejvery statute is to be read so as to \u2018promote the ability of the enactment to remedy the mischief at which it is directed.\u2019\u201d <em>Bulala </em>v. <em>Boyd, 239 </em>Va. 218, 227, 389 S.E.2d 670, 674 (1990) (quoting <em>Board of Supervisors v. King Land Corp., </em>238 Va. 97, 103, 380 S.E.2d 895, 897 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">We have recognized that the statute governing UM insurance \u201cwas enacted for the benefit of injured persons, is remedial in nature, and is liberally construed so that the purpose intended may be accomplished.\u201d <em>Grossman v. Glens Falls Ins. Co., </em>211 Va. 195, 197, 176 S.E.2d 318, 320 (1970). Further, in considering specific provisions relating to UIM insurance, we have held that \u201cthe legislative purpose was to increase the total protection afforded by insurance to claimants injured or damaged by negligent motorists.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>234 Va. at 577, 363 S.E.2d at 705. We therefore resolve the present ambigu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>ity by holding that when, as here, an injured person has purchased only \u201cminimum limits\u201d UM coverage, but has a \u201ctotal amount of uninsured motorist coverage afforded\u201d that is greater than the statutory minimum, an insurer shall be deemed obligated to make payment \u201cto the extent the vehicle is underinsured,\u201d as defined in Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In summary, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 requires each of the three policies at issue here to be \u201cstacked\u201d prior to determining both whether Jackson\u2019s vehicle was \u201cunderinsured\u201d and the amount of UIM coverage available to Sherman and Scott Alexander. We will reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling that Sherman Alexander\u2019s failure to return the waiver form to USAA in 1990 was an ineffective rejection of the higher level of UM coverage. We thus conclude, in accordance with our holdings today, that after stacking the per-person UM limits of the policies issued to Sherman, Scott, and John Alexander, in the amounts of $25,000, $100,000, and $50,000, respectively, Sherman Alexander enjoys $175,000 in UIM coverage, as does Scott Alexander. Any payments made by Allstate, Jackson\u2019s liability carrier, will be credited against this amount, pursuant to Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A) and (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b212-8\"> Code \u00a7 46.2-100 provides in part: \u201c <em>\u2018Financial responsibility' </em>means the ability to respond in damages for liability thereafter incurred arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, or operation of a motor vehicle, in the amounts provided for in \u00a7 46.2-472.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-472 requires every motor vehicle owner\u2019s policy to provide liability insurance \u201csubject to a limit ... of $25,000 because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b213-7\">JUSTICE COMPTON, with whom JUSTICE WHITING joins,</author>\n<p id=\"AJ_\">dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">I disagree with that part of the majority\u2019s ruling, expressed in Part III of the opinion, that Sherman Alexander\u2019s $25,000 policy limit should be stacked when computing available underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">In clear, unambiguous language, the uninsured motorist statute provided: \u201cWhere the insured contracts for higher limits,\u201d the endorsement for those higher limits shall obligate the insurer to make payment for bodily injury resulting from the operation of an underinsured motor vehicle \u201cto the extent the vehicle is underinsured, as defined in subsection B\u201d of the statute.

The basis for turning to subsection (B) hinged on the condition precedent set forth in subsection (A): \u201cWhere the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>sured contracts for higher limits.\u201d In other words, subsection (A) plainly stated that unless the insured had contracted for higher limits, there was no need to turn to subsection (B), which the majority employs to create an ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\">In the present case, the majority ruled correctly that Sherman Alexander did not contract \u201cfor higher limits.\u201d That ends the inquiry, and he is precluded from claiming underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Accordingly, I would hold that $150,000, not $175,000, in underinsured motorist coverage is available, to be reduced by the payments made by Jackson\u2019s liability carrier.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
