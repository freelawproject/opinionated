Travis Lee Shaver, Horton\u2019s minor son, was a passenger in Horton\u2019s car at the time. Both Horton and Shaver were injured in the collision, and each instituted personal injury actions against Morrison.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">In response to Shaver\u2019s action, Morrison filed a third-party motion for judgment against Horton, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that Horton negligently operated her vehicle and claiming that Horton was liable to Morrison for all or part of any sum recovered by Shaver. Horton did not file any responsive pleadings to the third-party motion for judgment. Morrison then filed a \u201cMotion for Default or Summary Judgment.\u201d Shaver moved for a nonsuit which the trial court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">On April 16, 1992, the trial court held a hearing on Morrison\u2019s motion for default or summary judgment. In a letter opinion dated May 14, 1992, the court indicated that it intended to rule in Morrison\u2019s favor on her motion; however, no judgment was entered until October 13, 1992. At that time, the court issued an order, <em>nunc pro tunc </em>for May 29, 1992, sustaining Morrison\u2019s motion. On the same day, the court entered an order dismissing Shaver\u2019s action with prejudice. That order, however, was not entered <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">On December 3, 1992, Morrison filed a plea of res judicata and motion to dismiss in Horton\u2019s action, claiming that Morrison\u2019s success in the third-party action in Shaver\u2019s case precluded Horton from pursuing her own claim against Morrison. The trial court sustained Morrison\u2019s motion, concluding that Horton\u2019s action \u201cha[d] been adjudicated when judgment was granted on behalf of Ms. Morrison against Ms. Horton in the third party action filed in [Shaver\u2019s] case.\u201d Horton appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>We first consider whether Horton\u2019s action is barred on the basis of res judicata. Pursuant to the doctrine of res judicata, a valid, personal judgment on the merits in favor of a defendant bars relitigation of the <em>same cause of action </em>between the same parties and their privies. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Devers, </em>214 Va. 667, 670-71, 202 S.E.2d 917, 920-21 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In the present case, Horton\u2019s personal injury action against Morrison is not the same cause of action as Morrison\u2019s third-party action against Horton for contribution. Thus, res judicata does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Next, we consider whether Horton\u2019s action is barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Collateral estoppel is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">the preclusive effect impacting in a subsequent action based upon a collateral and <em>different cause of action. . . . </em>[T]he parties to the first action and their privies are precluded from litigating any <em>issue </em>of fact actually litigated and essential to a valid and final personal judgment in the first action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 671, 202 S.E.2d at 921 (footnotes omitted); <em>accord Hampton Roads San. Dist. </em>v. <em>City of Va. Beach, </em>240 Va. 209, 213, 396 S.E.2d 656, 658 (1990). The requirement that an issue must have been the subject of actual litigation, rather than potential litigation, is one of the features that distinguishes collateral estoppel from res judicata. <em>Snead </em>v. <em>Bendigo, </em>240 Va. 399, 401, 397 S.E.2d 849, 850 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">In the present case, the trial court rendered a default judgment in favor of Morrison in her third-party action against Horton, and no issues relating to Horton\u2019s negligence were <em>actually litigated. </em>Consequently, we hold that the default judgment cannot be the basis of Morrison\u2019s claim of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing Horton\u2019s action against Morrison. Accordingly, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
