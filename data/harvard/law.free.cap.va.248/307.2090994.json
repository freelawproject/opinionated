Empire denied that the loss was covered under the policy because Hall did not have legal title to the automobile at the time of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The case was submitted to the trial court on stipulated facts, and each party moved for summary judgment. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of Empire, concluding that Hall\u2019s insurance policy covered only an automobile owned by Hall at the time of the loss, meaning one to which Hall had legal title. Hall appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The following facts were stipulated. Hall is a corporation in the business of buying and selling used motor vehicles, and it operates its business in Arlington County. Empire is a Nebraska corporation and is authorized and licensed to write certain types of insurance contracts in Virginia, including the one at issue. Empire issued to Hall a Garage Dealer\u2019s Liability Insurance Policy (the Policy) which was in full force and effect on September 1, 1992, and at other relevant times. The Policy insured \u201ccovered autos\u201d against losses, including losses caused by fire. \u201cCovered autos\u201d were defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">OWNED PRIVATE PASSENGER AUTOS ONLY. Only the private passenger autos [Hall] own[s]. This includes those private passenger autos [Hall] acquire [s] ownership of after the policy begins.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">On August 31, 1992, Edward Clark, Jr., brought a used 1990 Nissan automobile to Hall\u2019s place of business and offered to sell it to Hall. Clark presented an invalid certificate of title purporting to show that he owned the vehicle. Clark, however, did not own the vehicle. Based upon this misrepresentation, Hall, in good faith, paid Clark $17,000.00 and took possession of the vehicle and the invalid certificate of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>A Hall employee accompanied Clark to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) on August 31, 1992, to verify Clark\u2019s title. The DMV\u2019s computer records erroneously showed that Clark was the owner of the vehicle. Unknown to Hall, however, the automobile previously had been stolen from Ronald Weathington. The vehicle identification number had been either altered or replaced, or the DMV had not yet received notice of the stolen automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Weathington had reported the theft to his insurer, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm). State Farm paid Weathington for the loss and was the vehicle\u2019s legal owner at the time Clark brought the vehicle to Hall. Neither State Farm nor Weathington authorized Clark to possess or to sell the vehicle, and Clark did not have legal title to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">On September 1, 1992, the vehicle was destroyed by fire. Hall and Empire agree that, if insurance coverage exists, Empire\u2019s liability for this loss is $16,000.00, as the Policy contains a $1,000.00 deductible clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Hall contends that, although it did not have legal title to the automobile, it did have \u201ca lawful interest enforceable against all the world except the legal owner\u201d and that such interest \u201cis and should be an ownership interest sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the [P]olicy.\u201d Hall further contends that the Policy does not contain \u201cany restrictive definition of the words \u2018own\u2019 or \u2018ownership\u2019 \u201d and that Empire could have specifically excluded coverage for a vehicle such as Hall acquired in the present case. Finally, Hall contends that the Policy is susceptible to two interpretations regarding ownership; one interpretation is that the Policy covers vehicles to which Hall has legal title, and the other interpretation is that vehicles are covered if Hall\u2019s interest is merely lawful and insurable. This ambiguity, Hall asserts, requires us to construe the Policy in favor of coverage. We reject all of Hall\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">We think the controlling language in the Policy, that coverage extends only to the private passenger automobiles Hall \u201cown[s],\u201d is clear and unambiguous. The owner of an automobile is the party who has legal title to it. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-100; <em>see also First Virginia Bank </em>v. <em>Sutherland, </em>217 Va. 588, 593, 231 S.E.2d 706, 709 (1977) (decided under predecessor to Code \u00a7 46.2-100). In the present case, the parties stipulated that State Farm, not Hall, \u201cwas the <em>legal owner </em>of the vehicle at the time Clark brought the vehicle to [Hall\u2019s] lot.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Hall\u2019s reliance upon <em>Castle Cars </em>v. <em>U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>221 Va. 773, 273 S.E.2d 793 (1981), is misplaced. In <em>Castle Cars, </em>as in the present case, an automobile dealer was a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser of a used car that had been stolen. The question presented in <em>Castle Cars, </em>however, was \u201cwhether a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for value has an insurable interest in stolen property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 774, 273 S.E.2d at 793. We held that the dealer, because it had a substantial and economic interest in the automobile acquired in good faith, for value, and without notice of the invalidity of the transferor\u2019s title, had an insurable interest in the automobile. <em>Id. </em>at 778, 273 S.E.2d at 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The issue in the present case, however, is not whether Hall had an insurable interest in the automobile, but is whether Hall had coverage, under the terms of the Policy, for the automobile\u2019s loss. We conclude that, because Hall was not the legal owner of the automobile at the time of the loss, there was no coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Accordingly, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
