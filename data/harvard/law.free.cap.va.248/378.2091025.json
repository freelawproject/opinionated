Following consolidation of the cases, the trial court dismissed both matters. The trial court found that the statute was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority because it failed to include sufficient standards and guidelines to direct or limit the Board in exercising the delegated authority. The sole issue on appeal is the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 40.1-22(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">In considering constitutional challenges to statutes that delegate authority to administrative agencies, we have recognized that such delegation is essential to carry out the legitimate functions of government. If nothing could be left to the judgment and discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>of administrative officers, government could not be efficient and the legislation itself would become \u201ceither oppressive or inefficient.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>155 Va. 367, 379, 154 S.E. 579, 584 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Nevertheless, while statutes enjoy the presumption of constitutionality, \u201cdelegations of legislative power are valid only if they establish specific policies and fix definite standards to guide the official, agency, or board in the exercise of the power. Delegations of legislative power which lack such policies and standards are unconstitutional and void.\u201d <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Town of Painter, </em>239 Va. 343, 349, 389 S.E.2d 702, 705 (1990). Whether the legislative delegation in this instance is constitutional depends on the specific provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Code \u00a7 40.1-22(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">The Board, with the advice of the Commissioner, is hereby authorized to adopt, alter, amend, or repeal rules and regulations to further, protect and promote the safety and health of employees in places of employment over which it has jurisdiction and to effect compliance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-596), and as may be necessary to carry out its functions established under this title. The Commissioner shall enforce such rules and regulations. All such rules and regulations shall be designed to protect and promote the safety and health of such employees. In making such rules and regulations to protect the occupational safety and health of employees, the Board shall adopt the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity. However, such standards shall be at least as stringent as the standards promulgated by the Federal Occupational- Safety and Health Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-596). In addition to the attainment of the highest degree of health and safety protection for the employee, other considerations shall be the latest available scientific data in the field, the feasibility of the standards, and experience gained under this and other health and safety laws. Whenever practicable, the standard promulgated shall be expressed in terms of objective criteria and of the performance desired. Such standards when applicable to products which are distributed in inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>state commerce shall be the same as federal standards unless deviations are required by compelling local conditions and do not unduly burden interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In holding that this statute was unconstitutional, the trial court focused on that part of the legislation directing the Board to adopt standards and concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">it is the legislature and not the Board which must adopt the standards, and that even if the Board could so act, the language of the statute establishes only a floor with regard to the stringency of such regulations and standards but it does not define them adequately and leaves the board free to adopt almost any standards above that floor that it sees fit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Before beginning our analysis, we need to clarify the use of the term \u201cstandard.\u201d In the context of this case, the term has two different applications. First, the statute uses the term \u201cstandard\u201d to mean a rule or regulation which the General Assembly has authorized the Board to enact, such as the VOS standards. The term \u201cstandard\u201d is also used in referring to a limitation or direction placed in the statute by the General Assembly to operate as a constraint on the Board\u2019s exercise of the legislatively delegated authority. This type of standard is a \u201clegislative standard.\u201d An example of a legislative standard in the statute is the provision that the VOS standards adopted by the Board \u201cbe at least as stringent as\u201d those adopted under the federal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Apparently the trial court\u2019s decision was based at least in part on its belief that the language in the statute directing that \u201cthe Board shall adopt the standard\u201d meant that the Board is to adopt the legislative standards, rather than the VOS standards. This is an incorrect application of the term \u201cstandard.\u201d The statute directs the Board to adopt rules, regulations, and VOS standards to implement the policy stated in the statute; it does not direct the Board to adopt legislative standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">The trial court went on to determine that the requirement of sufficient legislative standards was not satisfied by the general direction in the statute that the regulations be designed to protect and promote the safety and health of employees. We agree that the General Assembly cannot delegate its legislative power accompanied only by such a broad statement of general policy. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Board of </em>Supervisors, 200 Va. 637, 641, 107 S.E.2d 445, 448 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>(1959). We have held, however, that delegations of authority are adequately limited where the terms or phrases employed have a well understood meaning, <em>DuVal </em>v. <em>VEPCO, </em>216 Va. 226, 217 S.E.2d 844 (1975), and prescribe sufficient standards to guide the administrator, <em>Ours Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ley, </em>198 Va. 848, 96 S.E.2d 754 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">This statute contains at least three additional directives which, although not addressed by the trial court, sufficiently direct and limit the authority delegated to the Board. Rules, regulations, and VOS standards adopted by the Board must be (1) feasible, (2) based on the best available evidence, and (3) limited to conditions which would materially impair the health or functional capacities of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">All three directives or standards in the statute have meanings which are clear and self-evident, and these directives can be interpreted only in accordance with these meanings. The term \u201cfeasible\u201d means simply that which is \u201ccapable of being done.\u201d <em>See American Textile Mfrs. Inst. </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>452 U.S. 490, 508-09 (1981). The phrase \u201cbest available evidence\u201d is a term of art commonly used in our jurisprudence. \u201cBest evidence\u201d is \u201cthe best evidence which is available to a party and procurable under the existing situation.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>160 (6th ed. 1990). Just as we have found that the term \u201cemergency\u201d is \u201cunderstandable by laymen and lawyers alike,\u201d <em>DuVal, </em>216 Va. at 228, 217 S.E.2d at 846, a \u201cmaterial\u201d impairment is understood easily by the layman as an impairment having \u201creal importance or great consequence.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1392 (1981). Since all three guidelines are \u201cnot easily subject to misunderstanding,\u201d they are not unconstitutionally vague for lack of adequate definition. <em>DuVal, </em>216 Va. at 228, 217 S.E.2d at 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">These directives provide sufficient legislative standards to guide the Commissioner in establishing regulations, and also establish a legally discernible standard by which a court could review subsequent challenges to the Board\u2019s rules. Thus, for example, a VOS standard which required implementation of technology not available in the United States would violate the standard of feasibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">In <em>Ours, </em>we held that \u201csatisfactory evidence\u201d was a sufficient standard. 198 Va. at 853, 96 S.E.2d at 758. A \u201cbest available evidence\u201d standard similarly is directed in limiting that evidence which the Commissioner may use as a basis for the regulations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Thus, a VOS standard based on evidence shown to be faulty or superseded could not be sustained under this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Finally, the rules are limited to addressing those conditions which cause \u201cmaterial impairment of health or functional capacity.\u201d Therefore, a VOS standard which aimed to provide adequate assurances that no employee would suffer <em>any </em>impairment, or one adopted for an employee\u2019s convenience, would violate the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">These legislative standards placed in the statute by the General Assembly provide a ceiling on the type of rules which may be adopted, and, therefore, contrary to the trial court\u2019s conclusion, the Board is not free to adopt any VOS standard it wishes above the \u201cfloor\u201d of the federal act. Furthermore, the final three sentences of the section reinforce the factors which must be utilized by the Board when enacting rules, regulations, and standards under this section-\u2014use of the best scientific evidence, feasibility, and experience gained from other jurisdictions\u2014as well as provide specific standards to be considered for products in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">We conclude that Code \u00a7 40.1-22(5) contains sufficient legislative standards and limitations to direct the Board in the exercise of the authority delegated to it by the legislature. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
