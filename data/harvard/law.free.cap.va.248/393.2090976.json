Plaza One failed to pay for certain work, and Kenbridge filed a memorandum for mechanic\u2019s lien in the principal amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>$316,603.88, later reduced to $315,048.88 to correct a clerical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Kenbridge filed its amended bill of complaint to enforce its mechanic\u2019s lien against numerous defendants, including Dominion Trust Company and Riggs National Bank of Washington, D.C., the trustee and beneficiary, respectively, of a deed of trust upon the property. The cause was referred to a commissioner in chancery. Dominion and Riggs asserted (1) that the memorandum for mechanic\u2019s lien was not filed timely and (2) that the memorandum is invalid because it includes the costs of labor performed and materials used on public roads which are neither located on the property nor described in the memorandum. The commissioner and the trial court rejected both defenses, and the trial judge entered a judgment in favor of Kenbridge. We awarded an appeal to Dominion and Riggs.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">As the commissioner found, the project architect certified that the hotel was \u201csubstantially complete\u201d on May 5, 1989, and the hotel opened for business that day. As of that date, however, Ken-bridge was required to perform other work to fulfill its obligations under the construction contract. Kenbridge was required by the contract to complete work on a swimming pool enclosure, the hotel\u2019s \u201cPresidential Suite,\u201d the employee locker room, the men\u2019s lockers, and the landscape. This work was not correction of previous work or warranty repairs. Kenbridge would have been in breach of its contract if it had failed to perform this work.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Code \u00a7 43-4, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">A general contractor, or any other lien claimant ... in order to perfect the lien given by \u00a7 43-3, . . . shall file a memorandum of lien at any time after the work is commenced or material furnished, but not later than ninety days from the last day of the month in which he last performs labor or furnishes material, and in no event later than ninety days from the time such building, structure, or railroad is <em>completed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">(Emphasis added.) Dominion and Riggs argue that the memorandum for mechanic\u2019s lien was not filed timely because the memorandum was filed more than 90 days from the date that the hotel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>was substantially completed. Dominion and Riggs, relying upon cases from other states, argue that the word \u201ccompleted,\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 43-4, \u201cmust be interpreted to mean the date of substantial completion of the building\u201d and that insignificant work performed after the date of substantial completion \u201cwill not extend the time for filing a memorandum of lien.\u201d Kenbridge, however, asserts that its memorandum for mechanic\u2019s lien is timely because it was filed within 90 days of the date of completion. We agree with Kenbridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">We have repeatedly articulated principles of statutory construction that we must apply when a statute, such as Code \u00a7 43-4, is clear and unambiguous.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">While in the construction of statutes the constant endeavor of the courts is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, that intention must be gathered from the words used, unless a literal construction would involve a manifest absurdity. Where the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\"><em>Barr </em>v. <em>Town &amp; Country Properties, Inc., </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990) (quoting <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>161 Va. 924, 930, 172 S.E. 445, 447 (1934)). Applying this rule of statutory construction, we decline the invitation of Dominion and Riggs to rewrite and change the plain meaning of Code \u00a7 43-4 by adding the word \u201csubstantially\u201d as a modifier to \u201ccompleted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Accordingly, we hold that in the absence of evidence that a contractor acted in bad faith to delay the completion of work on a project, the contractor is required to file his memorandum for mechanic\u2019s lien 90 days from the date of completion. <em>See </em>Burks\u2019 Pleading and Practice \u00a7 459 (4th ed. 1952). Here, there is no evidence that Kenbridge delayed the completion of its work in bad faith to extend the time of filing its memorandum. Kenbridge\u2019s work logs reveal that it completed work on the project on June 8, 1989 and, therefore, its memorandum for mechanic\u2019s lien, filed August 21, 1989, was within the prescribed 90 day statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Dominion and Riggs argue that the lien is invalid because the memorandum for mechanic\u2019s lien includes the cost of labor and materials that Kenbridge furnished on the roads that are not part of the property. Kenbridge asserts that the roads are part of the property. We disagree with Kenbridge. The commissioner found that the labor and materials furnished on the roads constituted \u201coff-site work,\u201d and Kenbridge did not assign cross-error to the trial court\u2019s order confirming the commissioner\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Kenbridge contends, however, that when it began to construct the hotel Kenbridge believed that the roads had been vacated by the County, and when public roads are vacated, the fee simple interest in the roads vests in the party who owns the adjacent real estate. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 15.1-483. Our review of the record reveals, however, that Kenbridge failed to prove either that the roads had been vacated or that the roads were adjacent to and had become a part of the property upon which the hotel was constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Kenbridge also argues that even if the roads are not part of the property, they are permanently annexed to the freehold pursuant to Code \u00a7 43-2 and, thus, the value of work performed on the roads may be included in its mechanic\u2019s lien memorandum. We disagree with Kenbridge because Code \u00a7 43-2 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Code \u00a7 43-2 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\">For the purpose of this chapter, a well, excavation, sidewalk, driveway, pavement, parking lot, retaining wall, curb and/or gutter, breakwater (either salt or fresh water), water system, drainage structure, filtering system (including septic or waste disposal systems) or swimming pool shall be deemed a structure permanently annexed to the freehold, and all shrubbery, earth, sod, sand, gravel, brick, stone, tile, pipe or other materials, together with the reasonable rental or use value of equipment and any surveying, grading, clearing or earth moving required for the improvement of the grounds upon which such building or structure is situated shall be deemed to be materials furnished for the improvement of such building or structure and permanently annexed to the freehold.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>In <em>Rosser </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>237 Va. 572, 379 S.E.2d 323 (1989), we discussed the purpose of Code \u00a7 43-2 and its relation to Code \u00a7 43-3(A).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We observed that Code \u00a7 43-3(A) permits a mechanic to perfect a lien upon the structure he had built and so much land as the enforcing court of equity might apportion to it for \u201cthe convenient use and enjoyment thereof,\u201d but the mechanic would not have a lien on other buildings upon which no work had been performed or upon the residue of the land itself. We noted that historically there were many kinds of construction work unprotected by any lien rights, such as clearing, excavation, and grading, because the work did not contribute to any \u201cbuilding or structure permanently annexed to the freehold.\u201d <em>Rosser, </em>237 Va. at 576-77, 379 S.E.2d at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Beginning in 1922, the General Assembly enacted a series of laws that extended lien rights to those who had furnished labor and materials as described in Code \u00a7 43-2. Only those items specifically enumerated in Code \u00a7 43-2 are \u201cdeemed a structure permanently annexed to the freehold\u201d and, therefore, are subject to lien rights. <em>Rosser, </em>237 Va. at 577, 379 S.E.2d at 326. In <em>Rosser, </em>we specifically held that because subdivision streets are not enumerated in Code \u00a7 43-2, such streets are not permanently annexed to the freehold. <em>Id. </em>Likewise, we hold that the roads upon which Kenbridge performed its work cannot be deemed permanently annexed to the freehold under Code \u00a7 43-2 because roads are not specifically enumerated in this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Kenbridge contends that Riggs and Dominion stipulated at trial that all work included in the mechanic\u2019s lien memorandum, including labor and material furnished on the roads, had been performed on the property described in the memorandum. We disagree with Kenbridge. Our review of this stipulation reveals Riggs and Dominion only agreed that Kenbridge furnished labor and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>materials in an amount equal to or greater than $316,603.88 and that Kenbridge has not been paid for such labor and materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">Kenbridge argues that \u201c[e]ven if the work was not performed on a single parcel, and such work is not subject to the protection of [Code] \u00a7 43-2, the evidence established that Kenbridge was paid for all . . . the alleged off-site work except for $10,842.30, and thus [this] Court should . . . issue final judgment in favor of Kenbridge in the amount of $304,206.58.\u201d Relying upon <em>West Alexandria Properties </em>v. <em>First Virginia Mortgage and Real Estate Investment </em>Trust, 221 Va. 134, 141-42, 267 S.E.2d 149, 153-54 (1980), and <em>The First National Bank of Martinsville </em>v. <em>Roy N. Ford Company, </em>219 Va. 942, 945, 252 S.E.2d 354, 356 (1979), Kenbridge argues that in the event this Court decides that the memorandum for mechanic\u2019s lien includes work performed on the roads and the roads are not part of the property, then this Court should simply reduce the lien by deducting the amount attributable to the work performed off-site.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We disagree. It is true that in <em>West Alexandria Properties </em>and <em>Bank of Martinsville, </em>we have held that a trial court, in certain limited circumstances, may reduce the amount of a mechanic\u2019s lien rather than invalidate the lien. Here, however, we are of opinion that Kenbridge is not entitled to such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Even though Kenbridge had the opportunity to request that the trial court reduce the lien to reflect only the value of labor and materials performed on the property, Kenbridge failed to do so. Indeed, the evidence of record reveals that Kenbridge probably could not have done so. Douglas B. Sauer, Kenbridge\u2019s vice president and project manager, testified that he was \u201cnot sure\u201d if the amount of Kenbridge\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien included work performed \u201coff-site.\u201d Sauer also testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">[Question]: With regard to your testimony that a portion of the work was done inside the original 5-acre plat with regard to this realignment of Eubank Road, it\u2019s not possible for you to assign a particular dollar value to the work done inside the property line versus any that was done outside, is it?</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">[Answer]: Not at this time. It would take some time to develop the cost. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Certainly, this Court, in its appellate capacity, cannot be expected to ascertain the amount of Kenbridge\u2019s lien when Kenbridge was unable to produce such testimony during the proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In view of the foregoing rulings, we need not discuss the remaining issues raised in this appeal. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court, and we will dismiss the suit to enforce the mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-7\"> Code \u00a7 43-3 (A) states in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">All persons performing labor or furnishing materials of the value of fifty dollars or more, for the construction, removal, repair or improvement of any building or structure permanently annexed to the freehold, and all persons performing any labor or furnishing materials of like value for the construction of any railroad, shall have a lien, if perfected as hereinafter provided, upon such building or structure, and so much land therewith as shall be necessary for the convenient use and enjoyment thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
