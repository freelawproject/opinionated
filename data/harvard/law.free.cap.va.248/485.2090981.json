In the penalty phase of the trial, the jury fixed Wright\u2019s punishment for the capital murders at death, based upon the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">In the same trial, Wright was convicted of robbery, attempted rape, and use of a firearm in the commission of robbery, for which he received sentences of life imprisonment, ten years\u2019 imprisonment, and two years\u2019 imprisonment, respectively. All the convictions were for offenses that were part of a common transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">The trial court sentenced Wright in accord with the jury verdicts. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgments and the sentence of death. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>245 Va. 177, 427 S.E.2d 379 (1993) .</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">Wright petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, and, on June 20, 1994, in a summary disposition, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to this Court \u201cfor further consideration in light of <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>512 U.S__, 114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 133 (1994).\u201d <em>Wright </em>v. Virginia,_U.S__, 114 S.Ct. 2701 (1994) . By order entered July 29, 1994, we placed this case on our September 1994 docket and directed counsel to brief and argue the question of what impact, if any, the <em>Simmons </em>decision has on Wright\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-15\">On appeal to this Court, Wright contended that the trial court erred in refusing to inform the jury about Virginia\u2019s laws regarding parole eligibility. <em>Wright, </em>245 Va. at 197, 427 S.E.2d at 392. We rejected the contention, noting that we repeatedly had rejected the same contention in other capital murder cases. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>In <em>Simmons, </em>the Supreme Court held that, when \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d is at issue in the sentencing phase of a capital murder case, the jury is entitled to be informed of the defendant\u2019s parole <em>ineligibility. Simmons, </em>512 U.S. at _, 114 S.Ct. at 2198. Therefore, in order for the <em>Simmons </em>decision to apply in the present case, Wright must have been ineligible for parole at the time he was before the sentencing jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">To be ineligible for parole in Virginia, a defendant\u2019s criminal record must meet the test prescribed in Code \u00a7 53.1-151(B1), which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">Any person convicted of three separate felony offenses of (i) murder, (ii) rape or (iii) robbery by the presenting of firearms or other deadly weapon, or any combination of the offenses specified in subdivisions (i), (ii) or (iii) when such offenses were not part of a common act, transaction or scheme shall not be eligible for parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">In the present case, the record shows that, in the state of Maryland, Wright previously had been convicted of first degree murder, attempted murder, and two firearms offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Only the Maryland murder conviction is an offense designated in Code \u00a7 53.1-151 (Bl). Further, the Virginia capital murder and robbery with the use of a deadly weapon convictions may not be considered separately and counted as two predicate offenses under Code \u00a7 53.1-151 (Bl) because the offenses were part of a common transaction. Consequently, Wright\u2019s criminal record contained only two offenses that could have been taken into account for purposes of Code \u00a7 53.1-151 (Bl). Therefore, Wright was not ineligible for parole, and the <em>Simmons </em>decision does not affect Wright\u2019s capital murder conviction and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Accordingly, we will reaffirm the trial court\u2019s judgment and reinstate the capital murder conviction and death sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-12\"> Joint Appendix, pp. 1688 and 1705.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-13\"> We do not revisit the second question presented by Wright because it does not relate to the issue on remand. Therefore, our previous holding on that issue stands. <em>See Wright, </em>245 Va. at 198, 427 S.E.2d at 393.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
