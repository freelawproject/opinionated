Swan (collectively, Concerned Residents) filed a bill of complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Board of Supervisors of Gloucester County (the Board) and Waste Management Disposal Services of Virginia, Inc. (Waste Management). Concerned Residents sought to have the trial court declare unconstitutional, unlawful, and invalid a certain contract entered into by the Board and Waste Manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>ment (the Contract). The Contract and supporting documents were filed with and made a part of the bill of complaint. The Board and Waste Management demurred to the bill of complaint, contending that the Contract is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\">The trial court sustained the demurrers and dismissed the bill of complaint with prejudice, holding that the Contract and its accompanying documents do not violate any constitutional provisions or statutes. Concerned Residents appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Prior to the Board\u2019s entering into the Contract, the County\u2019s existing landfill rapidly was filling, and the Board had insufficient funds to close the existing landfill and to open a new one in accordance with newly promulgated state regulations. Consequently, on November 20, 1992, the Board issued a request for proposal (RFP), seeking bids from private firms to construct and operate a new solid waste management facility within the County. Waste Management submitted a proposal and was awarded a contract to construct and operate a facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Consistent with the RFP, the Contract provides that the County shall acquire suitable property for the facility and that Waste Management will reimburse the County for the acquisition costs. The County retains ownership of the property and will lease the property to Waste Management for the term of the Contract, 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Waste Management will construct and operate a solid waste disposal facility on the property and will pay the County a \u201cGuaranteed Annual Rent\u201d of $50,000, which rent may be increased based on the tonnage of solid waste delivered to the facility. Waste Management also will pay the County up to $1.5 million for \u201cuse by the County in the closure of the County\u2019s Existing Landfill\u201d and $75,000 annually for post-closure maintenance of the existing landfill and will permit the County and its residents to dispose of a specified quantity of waste at the new facility free of charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Concerned Residents contend that the Contract is illegal, claiming that it (1) creates \u201cdebt,\u201d in violation of Article VII, \u00a7 10(b) of the Constitution of Virginia; (2) violates the Constitution\u2019s pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>hibition against special legislation, contained in Article IV, \u00a7 14(18); and (3) constitutes a bartering away of legislative powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">At the outset, we note that the General Assembly has declared the public policy of Virginia respecting the collection and disposal of solid waste and has granted local governments extensive powers in the matter. Code \u00a7 15.1-28.01 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">It has been and is continuing to be the policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia to authorize each county, city or town to displace or limit competition in the area of garbage, trash or refuse collection services and garbage, trash or refuse disposal services to provide for the health and safety of its citizens, to control disease, to prevent blight and other environmental degradation, to promote the generation of energy and the recovery of useful resources from garbage, trash and refuse, to protect limited natural resources for the benefit of its citizens, to limit noxious odors and unsightly garbage, trash and refuse and decay and to promote the general health and welfare by providing for adequate garbage, trash and refuse collection services and garbage, trash and refuse disposal services. Accordingly, the governing bodies of the counties, cities and towns of this Commonwealth are directed and authorized to exercise all powers regarding garbage, trash and refuse collection and garbage, trash and refuse disposal notwithstanding any anti-competitive effect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Additionally, Code \u00a7 15.1-28.02 states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">The governing body of any county or municipality is authorized to contract with any person, whether profit or nonprofit, for garbage and refuse pickup and disposal services in its respective jurisdiction and to enter into contracts relating to waste disposal facilities which recover energy or materials from garbage, trash and refuse. Such contracts may make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>provision for among other things (i) the purchase by the county or municipality of all or a portion of the disposal capacity of a waste disposal facility located within or without the county or municipality for its present or future waste disposal requirements, (ii) the operation of such facility by the county or municipality, (iii) the delivery by or on behalf of the contracting county or municipality of specified quantities of garbage, trash and refuse, whether or not such county or municipality collect such garbage, trash and refuse, and the making of payments in respect of such quantities of garbage, trash and refuse, for such garbage, trash and refuse delivered, (iv) adjustments to payments made by the county or municipality in respect of inflation, changes in energy prices or residue disposal costs, taxes imposed upon the facility owner or operator, or other events beyond the control of the facility operator or owners, (v) the fixing and collection of fees, rates or charges for use of the disposal facility and for any product or service resulting from operation of the facility, and (vi) such other provision as is necessary for the safe and effective construction, maintenance or operation of such facility, whether or not such provision displaces competition in any market. Any such contract shall not be deemed to be a debt or gift of the counties and cities within the meaning of any law, charter provision or debt limitation. Nothing in the foregoing powers granted such counties and cities shall include the authority to pledge the full faith and credit of such local governments in violation of Article X, Section 10, Constitution of Virginia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-3\">Where, as here, the General Assembly has authorized the County \u201cto provide for the health and safety of its citizens . . . and to promote the general health and welfare by providing for adequate [waste] disposal services,\u201d Code \u00a7 15.1-28.01, action taken by the County in response thereto is a legislative act in the furtherance of the County\u2019s police powers. <em>See Tidewater Homebuilders </em>v. <em>City of Va. Beach, </em>241 Va. 114, 118, 400 S.E.2d 523, 525 (1991). When a legislative body exercises its police powers, every possible presumption shall be indulged in favor of the validity of its legislative act. <em>Mumpower </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>176 Va. 426, 443, 11 S.E.2d 732, 738 (1940). Additionally, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>emphasize that, in deciding whether a legislative act is valid, a court is not concerned about whether the action is wise.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Article VII, \u00a7 10(b) of the Constitution of Virginia provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">No debt shall be contracted by or on behalf of any county or district thereof or by or on behalf of any regional government or district thereof except by authority conferred by the General Assembly by general law. The General Assembly shall not authorize any such debt except [certain specific classes of indebtedness], unless in the general law authorizing the same, provision be made for submission to the qualified voters of the county or district thereof or the region or district thereof, as the case may be, for approval or rejection by a majority vote of the qualified voters voting in an election on the question of contracting such debt. Such approval shall be a prerequisite to contracting such debt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Concerned Residents contend that the Contract is illegal because it binds future boards of supervisors to pay money to Waste Management, in violation of Article VII, \u00a7 10(b). In support of their contention, Concerned Residents focus upon three provisions in the Contract, <em>i.e., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 14.3(b), 11.4, and 11.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Section 14.3(b) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">In the event the County terminates this Agreement for any reason, except as a result of [Waste Management\u2019s] Default without cure, the County shall pay [Waste Management], in addition to any other damages payable to [Waste Management], within one hundred eighty (180) days after such termination, the fair market value of the Property and all improvements thereon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Concerned Residents assert that this provision of the Contract \u201crequires payment to Waste Management by future Boards over the next twenty years in the event of a breach of contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">We do not think \u00a7 14.3(b) of the Contract constitutes \u201cdebt\u201d within the meaning of Article VII, \u00a7 10(b) of the Constitution. Pursuant to \u00a7 14.3(b), the County\u2019s obligation to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Waste Management arises only in the event the County unilaterally terminates the Contract, a condition that may never occur. This Contract provision, therefore, merely specifies a remedy for a breach of contract. Consequently, the provision does not constitute \u201cdebt\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10(b). <em>See Fairfax-Falls Church </em>v. <em>Herren, </em>230 Va. 390, 393-94, 337 S.E.2d 741, 743 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Next, Concerned Residents direct our attention to \u00a7\u00a7 11.4 and 11.22 of the Contract. Section 11.4 authorizes Waste Management to impose future charges upon the County in the event the County adopts any ordinance that would increase Waste Management\u2019s costs of operating the facility. The section provides that the costs imposed on Waste Management in complying with any such ordinance \u201cshall be credited against the Rent to be paid.\u201d If the costs exceed the rent, Waste Management \u201cshall have the right at [its] sole option ... to charge a Tipping Fee for [the disposal of residential waste] in an amount sufficient to cover such excess.\u201d Section 11.22 of the Contract provides that, in the event certain hazardous waste is delivered for disposal and the owner of the waste cannot be identified, \u201cthe cost of disposing of such waste shall be shared between the County and [Waste Management], with the County paying 25% of such cost and [Waste Management] paying 75% of such cost.\u201d The County\u2019s share of the cost \u201cshall be set off against future Rent due to the County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In <em>Fairfax County </em>v. <em>County Executive, </em>210 Va. 253, 260, 169 S.E.2d 556, 561 (1969) <em>(Massey </em>I), we stated the well-recognized service contract doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">[A] continuing service contract, for which the municipality agrees to pay in installments as the service is furnished, does not create a present debt for the aggregate amount of all the installments throughout the term of the contract within the meaning of constitutional limitations of municipal indebtedness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The doctrine applies not only to contracts entered into by municipal corporations but also to contracts entered into by a county. <em>Fairfax County </em>v. <em>County Executive, </em>210 Va. 680, 683, 173 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1970) <em>(Massey </em>II).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Relying upon this doctrine, in <em>Massey </em>II, we upheld a contract for financial participation in the construction and operation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>of a transit system. <em>Id. </em>at 685, 173 S.E.2d at 873. Specifically, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-4\">The record . . . shows that the agreements of the County and City with the [Transit] Authority are for an essential public service for the benefit of their residents; that the obligations of the County and City to pay for the transit service are conditioned upon the service being rendered; and that their obligations are to pay over a period of years in periodic annual installments as service is rendered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">In the present case, the County\u2019s obligation to pay additional costs to Waste Management under \u00a7\u00a7 11.4 and 11.22 of the Contract do not arise, if ever, until the services have been rendered by Waste Management. Therefore, the challenged provisions do not constitute \u201cdebt\u201d within the meaning of Article VII, \u00a7 10(b) of the Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Concerned Residents contend that the Contract also violates the constitutional prohibition against special privileges. Their attack focuses upon \u00a7\u00a7 2.2 and 9.3 of the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Section 2.2, the exclusivity provision of the Contract, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">The County and [Waste Management] agree that from the date of this Agreement .until the expiration of the Term of this Agreement, the Facility is intended to be the only landfill or solid waste management facility located in the County of Gloucester, Virginia and that the exclusivity of the Facility is a major consideration for this Agreement. The County agrees to use its best efforts to the maximum extent permitted by law to maintain such exclusivity with [Waste Management] until the end of the Term.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Section 9.3, relating to taxes and assessments, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-3\">[Waste Management] acknowledges that it will be subject to the County\u2019s ordinance providing for taxes on personal property, machinery and tools (\u201cPersonal Property Taxes\u201d) and the County\u2019s ordinance providing for taxes for [Waste Management\u2019s] business and professional operating license (\u201cBusiness License Taxes\u201d) and agrees to pay all applicable taxes in accordance with such ordinances. The County represents and warrants to [Waste Management] that the Property is not subject to any real estate taxes under applicable statutes and ordinances and that there are no other taxes in effect as [of] the date of this Agreement which would apply to the revenues, earnings or operation of the Facility. During the Term, if the County assesses, imposes or adopts (i) any real estate taxes on the fee or leasehold interests in the Property, (ii) any taxes on the personal property used in the operation of the Facility other than the Personal Property Taxes, (iii) any taxes on the revenues from the Facility or (iv) any other tax, fee or other charge upon the revenues, earnings or operation of the Facility or to landfills other than the Business License Taxes or other than taxes uniformly applicable to all businesses in the County of Gloucester, or in the event [Waste Management] is required to pay a state mandated host fee which is, directly or indirectly, paid to the County, the County shall credit the amount of such tax, fee or charge against the Rent to be paid under this Agreement. If the total amount of all such taxes, fees or charges and the increased costs described in \u00a711.4 of this Agreement exceeds the total Rent which would be due if such taxes, fees or charges had not been imposed or such costs incurred, [Waste Management] shall have the right, at [Waste Management\u2019s] sole option, to terminate this Agreement or to charge a Tipping Fee on Solid Waste received from the County pursuant to \u00a711 hereof in an amount sufficient to cover such excess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Article IV, \u00a7 14 of the Constitution provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he General Assembly shall not enact any local, special, or private law . . . [g] ranting to any private corporation, association, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>or individual any special or exclusive right, privilege, or immunity.\u201d Article IV, \u00a7 15 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[n]o private corporation, association, or individual shall be specially exempted from the operation of any general law, nor shall a general law\u2019s operation be suspended for the benefit of any private corporation, association, or individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The thrust of Concerned Residents\u2019 argument is stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">Because the Agreement between the Board and Waste Management waives taxes, it deters the free exercise of the police power of future Boards for the benefit of Waste Management, and encourages the Board to prevent legitimate competition for the benefit of Waste Management, the Agreement constitutes special laws in violation of the Virginia Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The constitutional prohibitions against special laws do not forbid legislative classifications. <em>Holly Hill Farm Corp. </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>241 Va. 425, 430, 404 S.E.2d 48, 50 (1991). Legislative classifications, however, \u201cmust be natural and reasonable, and appropriate to the occasion.\u201d <em>Martin\u2019s Ex\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>126 Va. 603, 612, 102 S.E. 77, 80 (1920). Therefore, a classification will survive a special-laws constitutional challenge if it bears \u201ca reasonable and substantial relation to the object sought to be accomplished by the legislation.\u201d <em>Mandell </em>v. <em>Haddon, </em>202 Va. 979, 991, 121 S.E.2d 516, 525 (1961). The reasonableness of and necessity for a classification are primarily issues for a legislature, and, \u201c[i]f any state of facts can be reasonably conceived that would sustain [the classification], that state of facts at the time the law was enacted must be assumed.\u201d <em>Martin\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, </em>126 Va. at 612-13, 102 S.E. at 80. The burden is upon the assailing party to show that a classification is unreasonable and arbitrary. <em>Id. </em>at 614, 102 S.E. at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The safe and proper disposal of garbage, trash, and refuse is a serious problem for the Commonwealth and her localities. Indeed, the problem is so serious that the General Assembly has directed and authorized local governing bodies \u201cto exercise all powers\u201d regarding the collection and disposal of such waste \u201cnotwithstanding any anti-competitive effect.\u201d Code \u00a7 15.1-28.01. To that end, a local governing body is authorized to enter into a contract relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>to waste disposal facilities. Code \u00a7 15.1-28.02. Such contract may make \u201csuch . . . provision as is necessary for the safe and effective construction, maintenance or operation of [a disposal] facility, whether or not such provision displaces competition in any market.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\">When the exclusivity provision of the Contract is viewed in light of the public policy enunciated by the General Assembly and the object sought to be accomplished by the County, we cannot say that the provision is unreasonable and arbitrary. To the contrary, we think the provision is natural and reasonable in the circumstances of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">We also think that the Contract provision relating to taxes and assessments is not unreasonable and arbitrary. The provision acknowledges that the property, because it is owned by the County, is not subject to real estate taxes and that the County may impose additional taxes on the facility. Contrary to Concerned Residents\u2019 claim, the Contract does not waive taxes. The Contract simply provides that, if the County should impose real estate taxes on the County-owned land, or if other taxes should be assessed in addition to those presently imposed, payment of such taxes would result in a credit against Waste Management\u2019s obligation to pay rent. Such a credit is valid if the amount of taxes the County forgoes is fair consideration for the services received. <em>City of Richmond </em>v. <em>Virginia R. &amp; P. Co., </em>124 Va. 529, 541, 98 S.E. 691, 695 (1919); <em>accord Bristol </em>v. <em>Dominion Nat. Bank, </em>153 Va. 71, 77-78, 149 S.E. 632, 634 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">We hold, therefore, that the Contract does not violate the constitutional prohibition against special laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Concerned Residents also contend that, in executing the Contract, the County has \u201cbartered away\u201d its legislative powers. Concerned Residents\u2019 core argument is that the Contract \u201cbinds future Boards, thus interfering with the ability of future Boards to exercise their legislative discretion.\u201d The Contract, they assert, \u201crestricts unconstitutionally the future prerogatives of boards of supervisors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">It is firmly established that \u201ca county is capable of contracting and has the power to make all contracts which are proper and reasonably necessary to the execution of its corporate objects and purposes.\u201d <em>South Hampton Apts. </em>v. <em>Elizabeth City Co., </em>185 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Va. 67, 79, 37 S.E.2d 841, 847 (1946). Additionally, \u201c[g]eneral rules of the law of contracts are applicable in determining the validity of a contract to which a county is a party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80, 37 S.E.2d at 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">In the present case, as previously noted, the General Assembly has authorized the County to contract for the collection and disposal of solid waste. Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-28.01 and -28.02. The legislative intent could not be more clear. Pursuant to this grant of authority, the County has entered into a 20-year lease with Waste Management.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Code \u00a7 15.1-261.1 authorizes a county to execute a lease after a public hearing and to prescribe the \u201cterms and provisions\u201d of the lease. When the General Assembly has made an express grant of power to a county without prescribing the method of execution, the county is permitted to utilize its discretionary authority in exercising the granted power, provided the selected method is reasonable. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arlington County Bd., </em>217 Va. 558, 574, 232 S.E.2d 30, 40 (1977); <em>Kirkham </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>76 Va. 956, 961 (1882).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In the present case, within the framework of the powers granted to the County, we find nothing in the method selected by the County in exercising the granted power that is unreasonable or constitutes a bartering away of the County\u2019s legislative powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">In sum, we hold that the Contract does not (1) create \u201cdebt,\u201d in violation of Article VII, \u00a7 10(b) of the Constitution; (2) violate the Constitution\u2019s prohibition against special legislation; or (3) constitute an unlawful bartering away of legislative powers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\"> Concerned Residents contend that Code \u00a7 15.1-28.01 is not applicable to Gloucester County. We think, however, that the above-quoted declaration of public policy applies to \u201ceach county, city or town\u201d of this Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-11\"> In support of their position, the Board and Waste Management rely, in part, upon the following provision in Code \u00a7 15.1-28.02: \u201cAny [waste disposal] contract shall not be deemed to be a debt. . . within the meaning of any law ... or debt limitation.\u201d In reaching our conclusion that the Contract does not create debt within the meaning of the Constitution, we do not rely upon or express an opinion regarding the effect of this Code provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b518-10\"> Concerned Residents also claim that the Contract authorizes the County to alienate County property, in violation of the public hearing requirement of Code \u00a7 15.1-262. The Contract, however, provides that the County cannot act upon Waste Management\u2019s purchase option without first \u201cundertaking all necessary notices and public hearings required for such action.\u201d The County has not undertaken to sell the property, and, therefore, Concerned Residents\u2019 claim is not ripe for consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
