Kayani immediately preceding his trial for the capital murder of Kayani. The capital murder charge was predicated on Ramdass\u2019s alleged murder of Kayani in the commission of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon, Code \u00a7 18.2-31(4), and the use of a firearm in the commission of Kayani\u2019s murder, Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. The trial court deferred action on Ramdass\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">In a bifurcated jury trial conducted under the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.3 and -264.4, Ramdass was convicted of Kayani\u2019s capital murder. In the second phase of the trial, the jury fixed Ramdass\u2019s punishment at death, based upon the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate of Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">Following consideration of a probation officer\u2019s report, the court imposed the death sentence fixed by the jury. The court also imposed a life sentence based upon its finding of Ramdass\u2019s guilt for Kayani\u2019s robbery and imposed the four-year sentence fixed by the jury for the firearms violation. We affirmed those judgments and the sentence to death. <em>Ramdass </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 413, 437 S.E.2d 566 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">In a summary disposition, the Supreme Court granted Ramdass\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari on June 20, 1994, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to this Court \u201cfor further consideration in light of <em>Simmons v. South Carolina, </em>512 U.S__, 114 S.Ct. 2187 (1994).\u201d <em>Ramdass </em>v. Virginia,_ U.S._, 114 S.Ct. 2701 (1994). Accordingly, by order entered July 29, 1994, we placed this case on our September 1994 docket with directions for appropriate briefing and argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-16\">We rejected Ramdass\u2019s contention in his earlier appeal that the trial court erred in not answering the jury\u2019s question, \u201cIf the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>defendant is given life, is there possibility of parole at some time before his natural death?\u201d <em>Ramdass, </em>246 Va. at 425, 437 S.E.2d at 573. We did so because of our established rule that \u201ca jury should not hear evidence of parole eligibility or ineligibility because it is not a relevant consideration in fixing the appropriate sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426, 437 S.E.2d at 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In <em>Simmons, </em>the Supreme Court held that when \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d is an issue in the sentencing phase of a capital murder case, the jury is entitled to information concerning the defendant\u2019s parole <em>ineligibility. Simmons, </em>512 U.S. at_, 114 S.Ct at 2198. Hence, <em>Simmons </em>applies only if Ramdass was ineligible for parole when the jury was considering his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"AO2v\">Code \u00a7 53.1-151 (Bl) establishes a person\u2019s ineligibility for parole as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">Any person convicted of three separate felony offenses of (i) murder, (ii) rape or (iii) robbery by the presenting of firearms or other deadly weapon, or any combination of the offenses specified in subdivisions (i), (ii) or (iii) when such offenses were not part of a common act, transaction or scheme shall not be eligible for parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">At the time that the jury was considering Ramdass\u2019s penalty on January 30, 1993, Ramdass was not ineligible for parole since he had only two \u201cseparate felony offenses\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 53.1-151(B1). They were:</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">(1) Ramdass\u2019s January 22, 1993, convictions and sentences for the armed robbery of two persons on August 25, 1992, at a Pizza Hut in Fairfax County. Since both convictions arose from the same transaction, they are considered as one felony offense under the express provisions of Code \u00a7 53.1-151 (Bl).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">(2) Ramdass\u2019s convictions for Kayani\u2019s capital murder and robbery arising from the same transaction and, thus, considered as one felony offense under Code \u00a7 53.1-151 (Bl).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">We do not agree with Ramdass\u2019s contention that his January 7, 1993, conviction by a jury of an armed robbery in Alexandria also made him ineligible for parole under the statute. Judgment had not been entered on that verdict; therefore, it cannot be considered as a conviction under Code \u00a7 53.1-151 (Bl). <em>See Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>134 Va. 589, 592-93, 113 S.E. 707, 709 (1922) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>(jury\u2019s verdict of conviction upon which no judgment had been entered not conviction within meaning of statute disqualifying person from holding public office). Since Ramdass was not ineligible for parole when the jury was considering his sentence, the <em>Simmons </em>decision does not affect his death sentence. Therefore, we will reaffirm the trial court\u2019s judgment, and reinstate the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
