The testator\u2019s will, dated October 27, 1983, was probated by the clerk of the court below on September 6, 1989. John W. Newton, nominated in the will, qualified as executor of the estate giving bond in the sum of $1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">In September 1990, the executor filed the present suit seeking aid and direction in ascertaining the estate\u2019s distributees. The executor, a beneficiary under the will, joined as defendants the 15 other beneficiaries originally named in the will. Also joined as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>defendants were the testator\u2019s seven heirs at law, none of whom were beneficiaries under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In October 1991, the chancellor removed the executor and substituted appellee Anita O. Poston as administrator d.b.n.c.t.a. of the estate. Following hearings in January and May 1993, and upon consideration of a stipulation of facts, the chancellor sustained the validity of the will, rejecting the heirs\u2019 contention that the decedent died intestate. We awarded the appellants, Diane Goriczynski and the testator\u2019s other heirs, this appeal from the July 1993 final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Labelled \u201cLast Will And Testament Of Charles Roach Mc-Cowen,\u201d the typewritten document contains two pages of substantive provisions and is attested by two witnesses. Following a preamble, the writing contains four Articles. Article I directs payment of debts, funeral expenses, and taxes. Article II appoints an executor and a substitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Article III contains paragraphs A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, and L. Paragraph A gives the testator\u2019s Norfolk business, \u201cMac\u2019s Cycle Shop,\u201d to Newton. Paragraphs B through K contain a devise of the testator\u2019s Norfolk residence, the gift of an airplane, and gifts of specific sums of money to named individuals. Paragraph L is the residuary clause naming \u201cthe Salvation Army, Heart Fund, and American Cancer Society\u201d as residuary beneficiaries. Article IV grants to the personal representative the powers specified in the applicable statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The following additional facts are not disputed on appeal: The will was drawn by an attorney; no handwritten marks, except signatures and dates, were on the will at the time of its execution; the testator had testamentary capacity when the will was executed; the testator had continuous possession of the document from its execution until his death; and, the will was found at the testator\u2019s residence \u201cat or near the time of his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">As found, the will contains certain handwritten markings. There is no dispute on appeal that the handwriting and marks on the will were made by the testator and that he had testamentary capacity on the date or dates these changes were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">We shall now describe the markings made on the original document that give rise to this controversy. Subsequent to the execution of the will, the testator drew with a pen some red lines and some black lines through a number of the provisions. The lines mostly are wavy and run horizontally over the typewritten words.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The words in paragraphs A, B, C, D, G, and I of Article III are marked through virtually in their entirety. The testator also drew a horizontal line through the words \u201cSalvation Army\u201d in paragraph L, the residuary clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In addition, along the left margin of the first and second pages of the document, the testator wrote the word \u201cDelete\u201d in seven places adjacent to paragraphs A, B, C, D, G, I, and L of Article III. Also, where the words \u201cDelete\u201d were written in the margin, the testator signed his name and placed the date \u201c1-20-89\u201d at each signature. The writings in the left margin do not touch any typewritten portions of the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In paragraphs J and K of Article III, the testator had given to Henry Driver and Virginia Driver the sum of \u201cTwenty Thousand ($20,000.00) Dollars\u201d and to Gary (Red) Chandler the sum of \u201cFive Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars,\u201d respectively. After execution of the will, the testator drew mostly straight, horizontal lines through the words and figures representing the dollar amounts in each paragraph. In the Driver paragraph, he inserted \u201c10,000\u201d and in the Chandler paragraph he inserted \u201c$10,000.\u201d Both insertions were made at the end of each paragraph on the blank parts of the page.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Rejecting the heirs\u2019 contention for total revocation, the chancellor ruled the testator had accomplished a partial revocation of the will. The chancellor decided that the deletions without substitutions in paragraphs A, B, C, D, G, I, and L of Article III caused those devises and bequests to fail. The chancellor also ruled that the gifts of cash in the unchanged paragraphs, that is, paragraphs E, F, and H, are valid bequests, and that the residuary legatees under paragraph L are the Heart Fund and the American Cancer Society by virtue of the deletion without substitution of the Salvation Army.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The chancellor also ruled that the deletions with substitutions of the numerical amounts in the Driver and Chandler paragraphs are ineffective, and that those provisions, under the doctrine of dependent relative revocation, will be read as if no changes were attempted. According to the doctrine, if a testator performs any act to vitiate a will with the present intention of making a new will immediately, and the new one is not made, or if made fails for any reason, then the old will, having been conditionally revoked, still stands. <em>Bell </em>v. Timmins, 190 Va. 648, 659, 58 S.E.2d 55, 61 (1950). The basis for the rule is that if a testa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>tor\u2019s whole testamentary intent cannot be carried out in making the new will, or in making changes to the old one, then the law presumes that the testator prefers the old will to intestacy and that the revocation was conditioned upon the new testamentary disposition being effective. <em>Id. </em>at 659-60, 58 S.E.2d at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">On appeal, the heirs\u2019 first contention is the trial court erred in ruling that the testator\u2019s markings on the will constituted only a partial rather than a total revocation of the will, and erred in ruling that the will, as partially revoked, was properly admitted to probate. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The principal issue is whether the testator effected a partial revocation of his will by the physical acts of drawing lines through the typed words of the will. That query must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Code \u00a7 64.1-58.1, dealing with revocation of wills generally, provides, as pertinent: \u201cIf a testator having an intent to revoke . . . cuts, tears, burns, obliterates, cancels or destroys a will or codicil . . . , or some provision thereof, such will, codicil or provision thereof is thereby void and of no effect.\u201d Plainly, because the statute refers to acts directed to a \u201cprovision\u201d of the testamentary document, it permits partial revocation of a duly attested will without further formalities. <em>See Etgen </em>v. <em>Corboy, </em>230 Va. 413, 416-18, 337 S.E.2d 286, 288-89 (1985). And, whenever any of the foregoing statutory methods are employed by the testator with an intent to revoke, the changes are effective, even though made after execution of a duly attested will, provided \u201cthey sufficiently support an inference of cancellation.\u201d <em>Triplett\u2019s Ex\u2019r </em>v. <em>Triplett, </em>161 Va. 906, 917, 172 S.E. 162, 166 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">In the present case, the physical act of drawing lines through the typed provisions of Article III unambiguously supports an inference of cancellation. Furthermore, there is the unrebutted presumption that the testator- made these changes with the intent to revoke. When, as here, the will presented for probate had been in the testator\u2019s custody after execution and was found among his effects at death with provisions marked through that constitute a sufficient act of cancellation within the meaning of the applicable statute, a rebuttable presumption arises that such marks were made with the intention of revoking the affected provisions. <em>See Franklin </em>v. <em>McLean, </em>192 Va. 684, 689, 66 S.E.2d 504, 506 (1951); <em>see generally </em>Brockenbrough Lamb, <em>Virginia Probate Practice </em>77-80 (1957) (employing examples identical to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>facts of this case). In addition, even though the marginal notes are of no legal effect, they do support the conclusion drawn from an examination of the document left by the testator that he meant a partial, not complete, revocation of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Also, despite the cancellations made in Article III, the will that remains is complete and has \u201cthe finality of testamentary intent.\u201d <em>Jessup </em>v. <em>Jessup, </em>221 Va. 61, 73, 267 S.E.2d 115, 122 (1980). The will, still carrying the label of \u201cLast Will And Testament,\u201d provides for payment of debts'* expenses, and taxes; names a personal representative with specified powers; provides for specific gifts to named individuals; .and leaves the residue of the estate to named charitable organizations. Indeed, the will carries out the testator\u2019s manifest intention, that is, he did not want his estate to pass to his heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The heirs\u2019 second contention is that the chancellor erred in applying the doctrine of dependent relative revocation to the Driver and Chandler bequests. We do not reach the merits of that assignment of error because the heirs lack standing to raise the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The heirs will inherit the testator\u2019s estate only if the will is declared entirely revoked and of no effect. The doctrine of dependent relative revocation was applied to only two specific bequests in which the testator retained the named legatees, but attempted to change the amount given to each. The chancellor\u2019s ruling impacts only the size of the residuary estate <em>under the will. </em>The heirs receive nothing under the will and thus have no cognizable interest in this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Consequently, the decree of the trial court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
