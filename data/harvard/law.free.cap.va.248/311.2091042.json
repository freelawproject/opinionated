Rigney, (2) the robbery of Rigney, (3) the use of a firearm in the commission of Rigney\u2019s murder, and (4) the use of a firearm during Rigney\u2019s robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">In the first stage of a bifurcated trial conducted pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.3 and -264.4, a jury convicted Chichester of all four charges and fixed his punishment at imprisonment for the following terms: life for the second charge; two years for the third charge; and four years for the fourth charge. In the second stage of the capital murder trial, the jury fixed his punishment at death based on a finding of \u201cfuture dangerousness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">After the jury returned its verdicts, the court found Chichester guilty of the four offenses and referred the cases to the probation officer of the court \u201cto thoroughly investigate and report to the Court on December 2, 1993.\u201d After considering the probation officer\u2019s report covering all four charges, the court imposed the sentences fixed by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Chichester is before this Court for automatic review of his death sentence, Code \u00a7 17-110.1 (A), and we have consolidated that review with the appeal from his capital murder conviction. We have also certified Chichester\u2019s appeal of his robbery and firearm convictions from the Court of Appeals. Code \u00a7 17-116.06. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-110.1(F), we have consolidated those appeals with our automatic review of the sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">I. EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">Since the Commonwealth prevailed in the trial court, we state the evidence and all reasonable inferences arising therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Mueller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 386, 390, 422 S.E.2d 380, 383 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S._, 113 S.Ct. 1880 (1993); <em>Cheng </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 42, 393 S.E.2d 599, 608 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">Near 10:30 p.m. on August 16, 1991, just before Little Caesars Pizza Restaurant (Little Caesars) in the Manaport Shopping Center in Manassas, was to close, two black men wearing dark clothing, \u201chome-made\u201d masks, and gloves entered the restaurant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>One man was about three inches taller than the other and both men were armed with semi-automatic pistols.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The shorter man immediately jumped over the service counter, ordered Denise Matney, a restaurant employee, to open one cash register. The shorter man took at least $100 from the register. When Matney was unable to open the second register, the shorter man went into a back room and returned with Rigney, the manager. Although both Matney and Rigney tried to open the register, they were unable to do so. When Rigney indicated that they could not open the register, the taller man, who was standing in front of the counter, shot Rigney in the left upper chest. The bullet pierced a major artery of Rigney\u2019s heart, causing him to bleed to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">After shooting Rigney, the taller man bent down and retrieved the ejected cartridge case from the floor. Both men then ran from Little Caesars toward the rear of the shopping center.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">On the night of Rigney\u2019s murder, no one at the scene could identify the two men. However, shortly after the murder, Detective William Van Cuyk canvassed the neighborhood for possible witnesses. In doing so, Van Cuyk ascertained from Jack Gill Burdette, Jr., who was walking behind the Manaport Shopping Center between the hours of 10:00 and 11:00 on the night of Rigney\u2019s murder, that Burdette had seen two men running in the rear of the shopping center from the area of Little Caesars \u201cdressed in practically black.\u201d On February 18, 1993, Burdette told Van Cuyk that he had recognized one of the two men as Chichester, a person with whom he had had \u201cdealings.\u201d Burdette testified that in his first interview he had not told Van Cuyk that he had recognized Chichester because he was concerned about the safety of his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The bullet that killed Rigney was examined by Julian J. Mason, Jr., a forensic scientist specializing in firearms identification. Mason testified that it was a \u201cWinchester Western brand 380 auto, silver tip hollow-point bullet.\u201d The police also took an impression of a latent shoe print left on the counter by the shorter man\u2019s right shoe. That print was later processed by Robert B. Hallett, a forensic scientist specializing in the examination and comparison of shoe print impressions left at crime scenes. The police then furnished Hallett with a pair of shoes they had seized from the home of Shelton McDowell, a suspect in the robbery. Hallett compared the design, size, and evidence of wear \u201caccording to the manner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ism of the principal wearer of that shoe,\u201d and a particular \u201cidentifying\u201d small cut in the shoe. Hallett identified the right shoe of the pair seized from McDowell\u2019s home as the shoe that made the shoe print on the counter.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Police also suspected that McDowell and Chichester were the two armed, masked black men involved in the robbery of employees of Joe\u2019s Pizza, another pizza restaurant in the Manassas area, just before it closed the night of August 7, nine days before Rigney\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">No one at the scene of the August 7 crime could identify either man. However, Rebecca Sue Hamilton, an employee of Joe\u2019s Pizza who had been working during an earlier shift that day, but who was not present at the robbery, identified both men from a photographic spread. Their photographs indicated that they were black. Hamilton testified that Chichester entered the restaurant in the afternoon before the robbery, used the rest room, asked when the restaurant closed, took a menu, and left. Hamilton further testified that less than 30 minutes later, McDowell entered the restaurant, used the rest room, and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Near 10:30 p.m. on August 7, two armed and masked black men entered Joe\u2019s Pizza just before closing time. One man was taller than the other. Mark Thomas Walls, then 16 years old, was working at Joe\u2019s Pizza and had his back to the customer area. Walls became aware of the entry when the taller man put his hand on his shoulder. When Walls pushed him, the man \u201csaid something like, \u2018You think I\u2019m joking with you\u2019. . . . Then he pulled out a gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The taller man grabbed Walls by the hair on the back of his head and held the gun to his head. As Walls saw the man start to pull the trigger, Walls jerked his head and the bullet missed him. The taller man then retrieved the ejected cartridge casing from the floor. However, on the way out, he apparently dropped the casing because Hamilton found it under a counter several days later and gave it to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">The police later recovered the spent bullet from the wall of a nearby building. Mason compared that bullet and the cartridge casing with the bullet and casing from his test firing of a nine millimeter semi-automatic pistol which police seized on December 12, 1991, from a motel room occupied by Chichester and Mercedes Brown, Chichester\u2019s girl friend. Mason opined that this pistol had fired the bullet from the casing found at Joe\u2019s Pizza.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Brown, who had lived with Chichester in three different Manassas area motels from October to December 1991, testified that Chichester kept the nine millimeter pistol in the room, and that sometimes he took it with him when he left the room. On one occasion, when police came to the motel room looking for a juvenile, Chichester threw the pistol out the window. After the police left, at Chichester\u2019s request, Brown retrieved it. After the police had seized his nine millimeter pistol on December 12, Chichester told Brown that they had taken \u201cone of his best guns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Christopher Jose McLean stayed with Chichester and Brown in one of the motel rooms for one or two weeks in November and December 1991. McLean testified that the gun the police had seized from Chichester\u2019s motel room appeared to be the same gun he had seen in the motel room and in Chichester\u2019s car. When Chichester discovered that the police had seized the pistol, he told McLean, \u201cThey got my baby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">At some time in November or December of 1991, Chichester asked Richard Fairfax to sell a gun for him. Fairfax agreed to do so, and they drove to McDowell\u2019s house some time after midnight. McDowell was standing outside when they arrived and Fairfax heard Chichester tell McDowell that, \u201c[W]e was going to take care of this.\u201d Chichester got out of the car, walked away from it with McDowell, and had a further conversation out of Fairfax\u2019s hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Fairfax and Chichester then went to Maryland, where Fairfax knew he could sell the gun. As they were proceeding on the Capital Beltway, a police officer overtook them with his cruiser\u2019s blue lights flashing. After the cruiser passed them, Chichester told Fairfax that \u201che would have to do [the officer]\u201d if the officer stopped them because \u201che had a body on the gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Although Fairfax testified that Chichester and the man who bought the gun in Maryland referred to it as a nine millimeter gun, Fairfax said that the gun he sold did not look like the nine millimeter gun that was seized from Chichester and shown to Fairfax during his testimony. Fairfax testified the seized nine millimeter gun looked \u201csomewhat\u201d like another gun he had seen in Chichester\u2019s car during the trip. Mason testified that because of similarities in appearance, 380 semi-automatic pistols are often mistakenly referred to as nine millimeter semi-automatic pistols.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">When he was arrested on January 7, 1992, Chichester told Detective Clifford R. Sowards that he did not know McDowell. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>However, other testimony established a close relationship between the two men. Chichester\u2019s mother testified that McDowell and her son were friends. Barbara Schoelles, the manager of an apartment complex in Prince William County, testified that Chichester, McDowell, and Tamara Brooks were all listed as occupants on a one-year apartment lease beginning November 1, 1989. Schoelles also testified that she had heard that Chichester lived there.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Brown testified that McDowell came to the motel room she and Chichester were occupying two to three times a week, that they frequently went into the bathroom and talked \u201cprivately,\u201d and that the two men occasionally had left the motel room together. Brown also testified that both men had pagers and that she had heard Chichester returning McDowell\u2019s pager calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Franklin Alexander Binnaman, who was married to Chichester\u2019s first cousin, testified that McDowell and Chichester had stopped at his house \u201conce in a while\u201d and that they played ball together. On August 1, 1991, Chichester and McDowell were together and borrowed dark-colored sweat shirts from Binnaman.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Beginning on January 8, 1992, the day following Chichester\u2019s arrest, and extending through March 22, 17 collect telephone calls were made to McDowell\u2019s unpublished home telephone number from the cell block Chichester occupied with 7 or 8 other persons. Those telephone calls lasted for a total of over seven hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">When arrested by Sowards, Chichester denied ever being in Joe\u2019s Pizza or robbing the restaurant employees. However, Sowards testified that he later heard Chichester admit that he committed the offenses at Joe\u2019s Pizza.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Three weeks prior to Chichester\u2019s arrest, while executing a search warrant for the nine millimeter gun, Officer Deborah Twomey noticed a pair of dark cotton gloves in Chichester\u2019s motel room. Thereafter, when Chichester was arrested, Twomey executed search warrants for his motel room and the car he usually drove. Among the articles she discovered in the car were a pager, a dark-colored nylon stocking mask, and five Remington 380 caliber cartridges. Among the items discovered in his motel room were a black, hooded sweat shirt and a black long-sleeved turtleneck shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Although Chichester\u2019s mother testified that she had employed him on a part-time basis cleaning office buildings in the Washington, D.C. area, Chichester told Sowards that he had not been employed since his discharge from the Marine Corps in 1988. Addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>tionally, Mrs. Chichester produced a calendar which she said indicated that Chichester worked for her on the evening of Rigney\u2019s murder. However, neither Mrs. Chichester nor her daughter, Vivian, who would have been working with Chichester on that evening, had any independent recollection that he did work on the evening of Rigney\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">II. ISSUES PREVIOUSLY DECIDED</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Chichester raises several legal issues that we have previously decided adversely to his contentions. Chichester advances no persuasive reasons to modify our previous conclusions, and we perceive none. Accordingly, we adhere to our previous rejections of those contentions and will not discuss them beyond citing representative cases in which the contentions have been expressly rejected. These contentions are:</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">A. The death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 8 of the Virginia Constitution. Rejected in <em>Satcher v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 220, 227-28, 421 S.E.2d 821, 826 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>_ U.S. _, 113 S.Ct. 1319 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">B. The provision for death by electrocution is cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 8 of the Virginia Constitution. Rejected in <em>Ramdass </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 413, 419, 437 S.E.2d 566, 569 (1993), <em>vacated on other grounds and remanded, </em>_ U.S. -, - S.Ct. _ (1994); <em>Poyner v. Commonwealth, </em>Order entered in Record No. 930301 on March 10, 1993; <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 192, 215, 402 S.E.2d 196, 209-10, <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 902 (1991); and <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 436, 439, 271 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">C. The trial court should have granted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether death by electrocution is cruel and unusual punishment. Rejected in <em>Poyner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>Order entered in Record No. 930301 on March 10, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-15\">D. The trial court should have permitted individual and sequestered <em>voir dire </em>examination of the prospective jurors. Rejected in <em>Swann </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 222, 228, 441 S.E.2d 195, 200 (1994); <em>Stewart v. Commonwealth, </em>245 Va. 222, 229, 427 S.E.2d 394, 399, <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S__, 114 S.Ct. 143 (1993); and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 403, 410-11, 374 S.E.2d 46, 50 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1028 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">E. The trial court should have permitted Chichester to make additional peremptory challenges of prospective jurors. Rejected in <em>Swann, </em>247 Va. at 227-28, 441 S.E.2d at 199-200; <em>Beavers v. Commonwealth, </em>245 Va. 268, 273, 427 S.E.2d 411, 416, <em>cert. denied, </em>_U.S__, 114 S.Ct. 171 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">F. The trial court\u2019s failure to provide investigative assistance at state expense violated Chichester\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights. Rejected in <em>Ramdass, </em>246 Va. at 418, 437 S.E.2d at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">III. ISSUES PROCEDURALLY DEFAULTED</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Rule 5:25 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\">Error will not be sustained to any ruling of the trial court . . . before which the case was initially tried unless the objection was stated with reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">Since Chichester did not object to the trial court\u2019s rulings when they were made, we will not consider assignments of error 20 (exclusion of prospective juror Roger Pearce), 22 (sequestration of jury), and 26 (alleged prejudice of jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">IV. PRETRIAL MOTIONS FOR CONTINUANCE AND INVESTIGATOR</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">Chichester, an indigent, complains of the trial court\u2019s denial of his motions to continue the case and to appoint an investigator at state expense to assist his two lawyers in finding two witnesses who might have provided exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">The trial court\u2019s ruling on both requests is a matter within its sound discretion. <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 1, 13, 419 S.E.2d 606, 612-13, <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. _, 113 S.Ct 421 (1992) (continuance motion); <em>Poyner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 229 </em>Va. 401, 412-13, 329 S.E.2d 815, 824, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 888 (1985) (continuance motion); <em>see Quintana </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 127, 135, 295 S.E.2d 643, 646 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1029 (1983) (appointment of investigator is act of judicial grace not constitutionally required).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>We review the record to determine if that discretion has been abused. On April 2, 1993, the court appointed two lawyers to represent Chichester. The court later set the trial date for July 6. On May 14, Chichester\u2019s lawyers moved the court to appoint an investigator to assist them in locating and interviewing witnesses. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney pointed out that McDowell had already been tried and convicted for his roles in both the Joe\u2019s Pizza and Little Caesars robberies and that the records in those cases, which were available to defense counsel, contained most of the evidence the Commonwealth would present in this case. Thereafter, the court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">On June 11, on Chichester\u2019s motion, the court continued the trial from July 6 to September 14 to give the defense more time to interview witnesses and make other trial preparations. Shortly thereafter, without objection, the trial date was changed to September 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">On July 30, Chichester\u2019s counsel again sought the appointment of an investigator for the limited purpose of locating two witnesses who were described in an August 28, 1991 affidavit of Detective Sowards that had been filed in support of a search warrant. In pertinent part, the affidavit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">On 8/27/91,1 received information from a concerned citizen that the citizen was present when a subject identified as Billy Cain, white male, sixteen years of age, made a statement that he and a subject known as \u201cL.A.\u201d went into Little Caesar\u2019s Pizza Shoppe and that he, Billy Cain, shot the man because he thought he was \u201cgoing for a gun\u201d. Through my investigation of police department and juvenile court records, I have learned the subject known as \u201cL.A.\u201d has a real name of Nathanial Dixon, black male, sixteen years of age. According to those records, Mr. Dixon resides at 7687 Callan Drive, Manassas, Virginia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Although Chichester\u2019s counsel had talked to Sowards about the affidavit, they did not ask him what his informant said about the circumstances under which Cain\u2019s alleged statement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Chichester\u2019s counsel indicated to the court that they had been unable to find either Cain or Dixon and requested the assistance of an investigator in trying to locate them. The Commonwealth noted that there was no reason to believe that a private investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>tor could do any more than the police investigators had done in trying to locate either of the parties named in the affidavit. Concluding that Chichester had not sufficiently shown the need for an investigator, the court denied Chichester\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">On September 10, Chichester\u2019s counsel asked the court to reconsider its ruling on their motion for the appointment of an investigator, and also moved that the trial be continued a second time in order to give defense counsel additional time to attempt to locate Cain and Dixon. Opposing both motions, the Commonwealth pointed out that Sowards\u2019s affidavit was filed in support of one of a number of investigative leads which were found to be groundless, and that the Commonwealth was obliged to disclose any exculpatory information to Chichester in the event that it had discovered any. The court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Chichester contends that the trial court should have granted his motion for a continuance \u201cto enable [Cain and Dixon] to be found.\u201d Considering that neither the police nor Chichester\u2019s counsel had been able to locate either Cain or Dixon in the extended periods before the trial, it is doubtful that they could have been located even with the assistance of an investigator during the additional period of any continuance. And it is also unlikely that, if located and present at trial, either Cain or Dixon would have admitted that they, rather than Chichester and McDowell, had committed the Little Caesars crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The burden is on the party seeking a continuance to show that it is likely that the witness would be present at a later date, <em>Piccolo </em>v. <em>Woodford, </em>184 Va. 432, 440, 35 S.E.2d 393, 396 (1945), and would testify in the manner indicated in the proffer. <em>See Stewart </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 563, 569, 394 S.E.2d 509, 513 (1990) (court denied motion for continuance based on defendant\u2019s \u201cspeculation\u201d that missing witness might be potentially valuable). Given the circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s denial of Chichester\u2019s motion for a continuance and the appointment of an investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Next, Chichester asserts that his Sixth Amendment rights to a fair and impartial trial were violated by the court\u2019s failure to appoint an investigator. However, he fails to state in what way the lack of investigative help violated those rights, and he refers to no authority supporting his assertion. Accordingly, we find no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>V. JURY MATTERS</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\n<em>A. Commonwealth\u2019s Peremptory Strikes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">In <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 89 (1986), the Supreme Court held that purposeful discrimination based upon race in the selection of jurors was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Chichester maintains that the Commonwealth engaged in such discrimination by striking two prospective jurors solely because they were members of the black race.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">We recently set forth the principles applicable to such challenges as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">The defendant must make a <em>prima facie </em>showing that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory strikes on the basis of race. <em>Powers </em>v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 409-10 (1991). If this showing is made, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to articulate a racially neutral explanation for striking the jurors in question. Batson, 476 U.S. 96-97. If the court determines that the proffered reasons are race-neutral, the defendant should be afforded an opportunity to show why the reasons, even though facially race-neutral, are merely pretextual and that the challenged strikes were based on race. <em>United States </em>v. Joe, 928 F.2d 99, 103 (4th Cir. 1991). But, ultimately, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 98. On appeal, the trial court\u2019s findings will not be reversed unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 368 (1991).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-9\"><em>James </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 459, 461-62, 442 S.E.2d 396, 398 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">As in <em>James, </em>we will assume that Chichester made a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>However, Chichester does not assert that the Commonwealth\u2019s explanation was insufficient to rebut the presumption or that it was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\"><em>Voir dire </em>examination of prospective juror Angela Holland indicated that she had testified as a defense witness in a criminal case involving a family member or a friend and felt that the defendant had been unfairly convicted. Likewise, prospective juror Linda Allen testified that she had been charged with writing a \u201cbad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>check\u201d and that her son had been shot and nothing had been done about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The Commonwealth explained that its strikes were based upon its assumption that both jurors\u2019 experiences might have created a bias or a feeling of resentment against the Commonwealth. In our opinion, this explanation amply rebuts any presumption of purposeful discrimination, and nothing in the record shows that the reasons.were pretextual. Accordingly, we reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\n<em>B. Racial Composition of Jury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Next, Chichester contends that since only one black person served on the jury, he did not \u201creceive a fair trial representative of the percentages of the number of black [sic] residing in the community.\u201d However, Chichester cites no authority to support the contention that the law requires a representative percentage of blacks on the jury. Nor does he distinguish or discuss <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 341, 347, 385 S.E.2d 50, 53 (1989), <em>cert, denied, </em>494 U.S. 1074 (1990), in which we said that \u201c[a]ll that is required is a fair selection system which does not systematically exclude any distinctive group in the community.\u201d (Citing <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>419 U.S. 522, 538 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">There is no evidence that there was a systematic exclusion of blacks from the venire selection process, and Chichester makes no such claim. Hence, we find no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">\n<em>C. Limitation of Defendant\u2019s Voir Dire Questions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">Although the court permitted Chichester to ask a number of questions, he claims that the court erred in refusing to permit him \u201cto ask all of his proffered <em>voir dire </em>questions and to ask many of those questions in the form so proffered. . . . [that were] relevate [sic] to the proper discovery of attitudes, back grounds [sic] and beliefs of prospective jurors as may be germane to the crime as charged.\u201d Chichester refers to no authority supporting this broad proposition and fails to identify any particular question the court amended or refused to permit him to ask.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">Counsel has the right to ask \u201cany relevant question to ascertain whether [the prospective juror] is related to either party, or has any interest in the cause, or has expressed or formed any opinion, or is sensible of any bias or prejudice therein.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>358. However, the court must exercise its discretion in determining the relevancy of such questions and in deciding whether any questions that go beyond the statutory requirements should be asked. <em>LeVasseur </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 581, 304 S.E.2d 644, 653 (1983), <em>cert, denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063 (1984). \u201cA party has no right, statutory or otherwise, to propound any questions he wishes, or to extend <em>voir dire </em>questioning <em>ad infinitum A Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Since Chichester failed to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion in its limitation of his proposed <em>voir dire </em>questions, we find no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\n<em>D. Change of Venue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Without specifying how the \u201clocal media coverage\u201d prejudiced his right to a fair trial, Chichester claims that the court erred in denying his motion for a change of venue. The court denied the motion when it was made some time before trial, but invited Chichester to renew the motion if and when it became difficult to select an impartial jury. The record does not disclose that \u201clocal media coverage\u201d caused difficulty in selecting a fair and impartial jury, and Chichester did not renew his motion for a change of venue during the jury selection process. Accordingly, we will not consider this claim. Rule 5:25.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">VI. GUILT PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"Ag4\">\n<em>A. Admission in Evidence of Photographs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">On brief, Chichester argues that the \u201cthe gory colored photographs\u201d had no real value other than to infuriate the jury so it would be prejudiced against him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">At trial, Chichester objected to the introduction of two photographs. One photograph was of Rigney\u2019s body, showing his chest wound, an extensive surgical cut across his chest that was made during rescue efforts, and evidence of his profuse bleeding. The other photograph illustrated Rigney\u2019s extensive bleeding in the area behind the cash register where he was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">The admission in evidence of photographs of a crime scene is a matter within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 295, 312, 384 S.E.2d 785, 796 (1989), <em>cert, denied, </em>493 U.S. 1093 (1990). We think that these two photographs were relevant because, as was the case in <em>Spencer, </em>they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u201ctended to show motive, intent, method, malice, premeditation and the atrociousness of [Chichester\u2019s] crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>They were not inadmissible simply because they are gruesome or shocking. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the two photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\n<em>B. Evidence of Gun in Chichester\u2019s Possession when Arrested</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Chichester claims that the court erroneously admitted testimony of his possession of a hand gun when he was arrested, but makes no reference to that testimony. We find no such testimony; as a matter of fact, the officers who arrested Chichester listed the articles found in his possession and made no mention of any hand gun in his possession. Under these circumstances, we find no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">C. <em>Evidence of Chichester\u2019s Role in Joe\u2019s Pizza Crimes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Chichester contends that the court erred in admitting evidence linking Chichester to the robberies at Joe\u2019s Pizza. The principles controlling this issue are articulated in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">Generally, evidence of other offenses should be excluded if offered merely to show that the accused is a person likely to commit the crime charged. But there are important exceptions to that rule. Evidence of other crimes is admissible if it tends to prove any fact in issue, even though it also tends to show the defendant guilty of another crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">[ O ]ne of the issues upon which \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence may be admitted is that of the perpetrator\u2019s identity, or criminal agency, where that has been disputed. Proof of <em>modus operandi </em>is competent evidence where there is a disputed issue of identity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\">[ E ]vidence of other crimes, to qualify for admission as proof of <em>modus operandi, </em>need not bear such an exact resemblance to the crime on trial as to constitute a \u201csignature.\u201d Rather, it is sufficient if the other crimes bear \u201ca singular strong resemblance to the pattern of the offense charged.\u201d That test is met where the other incidents are \u201csufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>idiosyncratic to permit an inference of pattern for purposes of proof,\u201d thus tending to establish the probability of a common perpetrator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 78, 89-90, 393 S.E.2d 609, 616, <em>cert, denied, </em>498 U.S. 908 (1990) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">If the evidence of other crimes bears sufficient marks of similarity to the crime charged to establish that the defendant is probably the common perpetrator, that evidence is relevant and admissible if its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect. <em>Id. </em>at 90, 393 S.E.2d at 617. The trial court, in the exercise of its sound discretion, must decide which of these competing considerations outweighs the other. <em>Id. </em>Unless that discretion has been clearly abused, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s decision on this issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Chichester contends that the only similarities between the two crimes were \u201cthat they both were committed by two individuals, who were masked wearing dark clothing. That evidence would have the same similarity of just about 100% of all robberies throughout the Nation let alone Virginia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">However, he overlooks additional significant similarities between the two robberies: Both robberies occurred within nine days and in close geographic proximity to each other; both robbers were black, one was taller than the other, both were armed; both robberies appeared to have been carefully planned to minimize the victims\u2019 opportunity to identify the robbers; both robbers wore masks and gloves; on each occasion, the taller man retrieved the spent cartridge after firing his gun; and in both robberies, the robbers fled from the scene on foot, rather than in a vehicle, to minimize the possibility of its identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Further, each robber appeared to be familiar with the premises and the role he was to play in the crimes. In both instances, the shorter man immediately went behind the counter to get the money from the cash register and appeared to know how to gain immediate access to the areas behind the counter.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">In the Joe\u2019s Pizza robbery, the two men had visited the restaurant shortly before the robbery and had probably observed that nothing blocked immediate access to the area behind the counter. In contrast, a locked door barred customer access to the area behind the counter at Little Caesars. The shorter man seemed to know this because, immediately upon entering Little Caesars, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>jumped onto and over the counter to gain access to the area behind the counter. He also appeared to know that the door could be opened from behind the counter, because he opened it in his flight from that area after Rigney was shot. Other evidence in the case showed that McDowell\u2019s cousin was employed on another shift at Little Caesars, but was not working on the night of Rigney\u2019s murder. Further, the evidence indicated that the employees were instructed to lock the door to bar customer access to the area behind the counter, but the door was kept unlocked on the side behind the counter to permit employee access to the customer area.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In our opinion, the two robberies were sufficiently idiosyncratic and similar to each other to support an inference of a pattern of operation and the probability of common perpetrators. And given the evidence in this case, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the prejudicial effect of admitting evidence of Chichester\u2019s involvement in the Joe\u2019s Pizza robberies was outweighed by the probative value of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Chichester also contends that the evidence should not have been admitted because (1) it was admitted in violation of an understanding between the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and Chichester\u2019s attorney giving rise to Chichester\u2019s guilty plea to some of the Joe\u2019s Pizza charges, and (2) the prosecutor was guilty of misconduct in presenting such evidence in violation of his agreement. The understanding was reflected in a letter that states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">In the event that your client is charged with other crimes in the future, in this jurisdiction, the fact that he entered a plea of guilty in these cases will not be admissible in that trial, except to impeach his testimony. However, the facts and circumstances surrounding these offenses (including the cases which were nolle prosequied) and his conviction thereof may be introduced into evidence if relevant and otherwise admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Although Chichester\u2019s counsel had seen this letter, he did not assert these grounds of objection during either phase of the trial; rather, he asserted them for the first time on a motion for a new trial. We will not consider grounds for an objection to evidence that were not timely asserted during trial. Rule 5:25.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>In sum, we find no error in the admission of the evidence of Chichester\u2019s involvement in the Joe\u2019s Pizza robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\n<em>D. Sufficiency of Evidence of Guilt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Chichester argues that the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction and that the trial court erred in failing to set aside the verdict on this ground. In another criminal case in which the defendant contended that the circumstantial evidence was insufficient to identify him as the perpetrator of a crime, we articulated the controlling principles in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">Applying well-established principles of appellate review, we must consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. The burden is upon the Commonwealth, however, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [the defendant] was the perpetrator of the crimes. Additionally, circumstantial evidence is as competent, and entitled to the same weight, as direct testimony if such evidence is sufficiently convincing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\"><em>Derr </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 413, 424, 410 S.E.2d 662, 668 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Chichester\u2019s argument is that \u201c[a]t no time during the Little Caesar\u2019s Pizza trial was Carl Chichester ever identified as the perpetrator of the murder.\u201d However, Chichester overlooks the following substantial circumstantial evidence: (1) his role with McDowell in the Joe\u2019s Pizza robberies in which he was shown to be the taller of the two men; (2) his position as the taller man in front of the counter and McDowell\u2019s position behind the Little Caesars counter when Rigney was shot; (3) his identification by Burdette near the scene, shortly after Rigney\u2019s murder; and (4) his admission to Fairfax that \u201che had a body on the gun\u201d Fairfax sold for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">And, as in <em>Derr, </em>we consider the evidence as a whole in deciding whether it is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s findings that Chichester was the perpetrator of the crimes. \u201cWhile no single piece of evidence may be sufficient, the \u2018combined force of many concurrent and related circumstances, each insufficient in itself, may lead a reasonable mind irresistibly to a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 273, 257 S.E.2d 808, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>818 (1979), <em>cert, denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980) (quoting <em>Karnes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>125 Va. 758, 764, 99 S.E. 562, 564 (1919)). <em>See Derr, </em>242 Va. at 425, 410 S.E.2d at 669. Considering the evidence as a whole, we hold that it is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s findings that Chichester committed the crimes. Therefore, we reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">VII. PENALTY PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Chichester argues that the court erred in admitting evidence of his arrest and conviction on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon in March 1990. The arresting officer testified that the concealed weapon was a .38 caliber revolver loaded with six hollow-point bullets, four of which were teflon coated. According to the arresting officer, teflon-coated bullets are designed to pierce bullet-proof vests.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">This evidence was relevant and admissible as probative of Chichester\u2019s future dangerousness. <em>Pruett v. Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 266, 285, 351 S.E.2d 1, 12 (1986), <em>cert, denied, </em>482 U.S. 931 (1987) (evidence of prior unadjudicated criminal conduct relevant to determination of future dangerousness). Hence, we reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">VIII. CHICHESTER\u2019S CONCLUSORY AND GENERAL ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">In summary fashion and stating no grounds, Chichester argues that all of his motions and objections made before, during, and after trial should have been sustained. We will not consider these general and conclusory assignments of error. Rule 5:25; <em>Spencer, </em>240 Va. at 99-100, 393 S.E.2d at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">IX. SENTENCE REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"ARB\">\n<em>A. Passion and Prejudice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Chichester argues that Rigney\u2019s mother and other family members were seated near the jury box for the purpose of \u201cinfluencing the jury with passion.\u201d Chichester cites and we find nothing in the record to support his contention that the presence of these persons was designed to influence the jury. Hence, we find no merit in this contention. Rule 5:25.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">Chichester also contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s peremptory strikes of the two prospective jurors who were black \u201cwas for no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>other reason other than prejudice, because the defendant was black.\u201d For the reasons already stated, we conclude that these strikes were not made to prejudice Chichester.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">One of Chichester\u2019s assignments of error is that \u201c[cjertain members of the jury were prejudiced toward a verdict of guilt and did not deliberate presuming appellants [sic] innocence.\u201d In support of that assignment he says only that he \u201cdoes not believe that a jury of even make-up could review the evidence of his trial as quickly as they did in rendering a decision.\u201d However, Chichester cites nothing in the record to indicate how long the jury deliberated on the issue of guilt. The transcript indicates that the jury retired at 12:20 p.m. to begin deliberation on th\u00e1t issue. At times not shown in the record, the jury recessed for lunch and returned to deliberate that afternoon. Nor does the record indicate when the jury recessed that afternoon. On the second day it deliberated, the jury resumed at 9:03 a.m. and returned with a verdict at 10:06 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Given these facts, the record does not provide a predicate for either of Chichester\u2019s conclusions. Thus, we find no merit in this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In addition to our consideration of Chichester\u2019s assigned errors, we have reviewed the record pursuant to the provisions of Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(1) to determine whether Chichester\u2019s death sentence was \u201cimposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\u201d Following our review, we conclude the record contains no indication that the jury was influenced by any of these factors in fixing his punishment at death.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\n<em>B. Excessiveness and Proportionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Chichester argues that his sentence of death was excessive and disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. To support this argument, he contends McDowell\u2019s charge for his role in Rigney\u2019s murder was \u201creduced to first degree murder,\u201d which \u201cprevented him from receiving a death sentence.\u201d However, as we have pointed out,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">comparisons between the penalties imposed upon codefendants may be unproductive. A determination of proportionality of punishment requires only that a defendant\u2019s death sentence not be incommensurate with his conduct, measured by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>other jury decisions, on a statewide basis, involving similar conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 243, 258-59, 257 S.E.2d 797, 808 (1979), <em>cert, denied, </em>444 U.S. 1103 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Consistent with <em>Coppola, </em>we have repeatedly held that imposition of a sentence less than death upon an accomplice does not establish that a defendant\u2019s death sentence is excessive or disproportionate. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 136, 145, 431 S.E.2d 48, 53, <em>cert, denied, </em>510 U.S__, 114 S.Ct. 336 (1993); <em>Thomas, </em>244 Va. at 26, 419 S.E.2d at 620; <em>King </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 353, 371, 416 S.E.2d 669, 679, <em>cert, denied, </em>506 U.S__, 113 S.Ct. 417 (1992); <em>Stamper, </em>220 Va. at 283-84, 257 S.E.2d at 824. Thus, we find no merit in Chichester\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Pursuant to the mandate of Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(2), we must also consider whether Chichester\u2019s \u201cdeath sentence is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">The defendant\u2019s record demonstrates his propensity for violence. On July 2, 1990, he was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon. The weapon, a revolver, was loaded with six cartridges with hollow-point bullets, four of which were teflon coated. Hollow-point bullets are designed to do the maximum damage to the person struck and teflon-coated bullets are designed to pierce bullet-proof vests.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">Chichester pled guilty and was convicted of the attempted murder of Walls, a robbery charge, and a charge of the use of a firearm stemming from the Joe\u2019s Pizza incident, nine days before he murdered Rigney in the course of the robbery at Little Caesars. Additionally, Chichester used bullets designed to do maximum damage to the defenseless victims in his cold-blooded and unprovoked offenses against Rigney and Walls.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">Keeping in mind the particular circumstances of this crime, we have reviewed the records in all capital murder cases pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-110.1(E), paying particular attention to those cases in which the underlying felony was robbery and the death penalty was based on \u201cfuture dangerousness.\u201d Those cases are compiled in <em>Yeatts </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 121, 143, 410 S.E.2d 254, 267-68 (1991), <em>cert, denied, </em>503 U.S__, 112 S.Ct. 1500 (1992). The following additional cases involving robberies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>and findings of \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d were decided after <em>Yeatts </em>and have been considered by us. <em>Swann, </em>247 Va. at 239, 441 S.E.2d at 206-207, <em>Ramdass, </em>246 Va. at 426-28, 437 S.E.2d at 573-74, and <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 260, 267-68, 435 S.E.2d 636, 640 (1993), <em>cert, denied, </em>511 U.S__, 114 S.Ct. 1389 (1994). We also reviewed the records in those cases in which life imprisonment was imposed under similar circumstances. <em>Whitley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 66, 81, 286 S.E.2d 162, 171, <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 882 (1982). Following our review, we conclude that Chichester\u2019s death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate to sentences generally imposed by sentencing bodies in Virginia for crimes of similar nature committed by defendants with records comparable to that of Chichester.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">X. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">We find no error in these cases, nor do we find any basis in the record to commute Chichester\u2019s death sentence to life imprisonment. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgments entered in the capital murder, robbery, and firearms cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Record No. <em>940130\u2014Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Record No. <em>940131\u2014Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
