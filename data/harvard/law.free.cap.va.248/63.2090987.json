Moore, individually, and as co-executor of the estate of Royce Moore, deceased, and others (the Moores), seeking specific performance of a contract to sublease certain coal lands. The Moores demurred to the bill of complaint, the trial court sustained the demurrer, and we awarded Powell Mountain an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The case having been decided by demurrer, we must consider the facts alleged in the bill of complaint and contained in the exhibits filed therewith. The Moores are lessees under two coal mining leases (the Mining Leases) on properties in Lee County, Virginia, and Harlan County, Kentucky. Prior to September 8, 1989, the Moores initiated litigation with the lessors of the properties regarding the continued validity of the Mining Leases. On September 8, 1989, the Moores and Powell Mountain entered into an agreement whereby the Moores agreed to sublease to Powell Mountain the Mining Leases upon the satisfaction of certain express terms and conditions (the Agreement). The sublease agreement was attached to and made a part of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">One of the conditions, set forth in Section 1(a) of the Agreement, required the Moores to resolve in their favor, on or before December 31, 1989 (the Resolution Date), the litigation pending against their lessors. The Agreement provided that, in the event the litigation is not concluded by the Resolution Date, Powell Mountain could either terminate the Agreement or</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">extend the Resolution Date for up to two (2) additional six-month periods under the same terms and conditions as . . . contained [in the Agreement]. [Powell Mountain] shall advise [the Moores] in writing within thirty (30) days after the Resolution Date or within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the first six-month extension if it desires to extend the Resolution Date for an additional six-month period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The Agreement also gave Powell Mountain the right to \u201cwaive satisfaction of any or all of the conditions\u201d and to require the Moores, in the event of such waiver, to execute the sublease at Powell Mountain\u2019s request. The Agreement further provided that any notice or communication required or permitted by the Agreement would become effective when sent by Powell Mountain, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to Ronald L. Moore at the specified address.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">On or about January 29, 1990, Powell Mountain exercised its first six-month extension. On July 6, 1990, prior to the expiration of the 30-day period to again extend, Powell Mountain\u2019s attorney wrote a letter to the Moores\u2019 attorney. In that letter, sent by regular, not certified, mail, Powell Mountain\u2019s attorney referred to prior discussion between the two attorneys, stated that Powell Mountain \u201cwill agree to extend the Agreement'provided that two changes are made,\u201d and set forth the suggested changes. The Moores\u2019 attorney did not respond to the July 6, 1990 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">On July 26, 1990, still within the 30-day extension notification period, Powell Mountain\u2019s counsel sent a letter by certified mail to Ronald L. Moore. This letter stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">Notwithstanding my July 6, 1990, letter to [your attorney], Powell Mountain Joint Venture hereby notifies you of its election to extend the Agreement pursuant to Section 1(a), for an additional six-month period until December 31, 1990.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">Powell Mountain Joint Venture will continue to work with you in order to amend the Agreement to address concerns raised by both parties. Accordingly, I plan to prepare an amended agreement to send to you and [your attorney] for your review in the near future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">On December 21, 1990, Powell Mountain\u2019s attorney sent another letter by certified mail to Ronald L. Moore, stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that it \u201chereby exercises its right to sublease the Moore\u2019s [sic] interest in [the Mining Leases].\u201d The Moores, however, refused to execute the sublease, and the present litigation ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">The trial court sustained the Moores\u2019 demurrer on two grounds. First, the court ruled that Powell Mountain terminated its right to extend the Agreement for a second six-month period because \u201cthe July 6th communication . . . was an expression of an intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>not to accept or extend the option contained in the agreement but sought new terms constituting a counter offer.\u201d We think the trial court erred in this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The Moores assert that \u201cthe September 8 agreement terminated on December 31, 1989, and neither party was bound to its terms during the period from January 1 through January 29.\u201d Thus, they assert, \u201c[t]he relationship had to be a new contract and not an <em>extension </em>of the September 8 agreement . . . and Powell Mountain\u2019s July 6 correspondence was an attempt to create a new agreement.\u201d These assertions, however, are expressly contradicted by the Agreement, which states that it \u201cshall terminate as of the Resolution Date <em>unless [Powell Mountain] elects to extend the term of the agreement consistent with Section 1 (a) in which case [the] agreement shall terminate after the expiration of any extensions.\u2019\u2019'\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Powell Mountain\u2019s right to extend the Resolution Date, as set forth in Section 1(a) of the Agreement, was an integral and material provision of the contract and was fixed and determined by the parties when the Agreement was formed. Therefore, the court\u2019s \u201ccounter offer\u201d rationale is inapplicable because the principles of offer and acceptance relate only to contract formation, and the Agreement in the present case already had been formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Pursuant to the Agreement, Powell Mountain had an unqualified right to extend the term of the Agreement, provided that notice was timely given. Moreover, Powell Mountain had the right to propose modification of the Agreement without forfeiting its right to extend. <em>See Stanley\u2019s Cafeteria </em>v. <em>Abramson, </em>226 Va. 68, 72-73, 306 S.E.2d 870, 872-73 (1983). A modification cannot occur, however, without the express mutual agreement of the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 72, 306 S.E.2d at 872. Furthermore, \u201cwhen one party claims that the other party has surrendered a right guaranteed by the contract, the party asserting such [surrender] must prove either passage of valuable consideration, estoppel <em>in pais, </em>or waiver of the right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73, 306 S.E.2d at 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">We also reject the Moores\u2019 contention that Powell Mountain\u2019s right to extend was not supported by valuable consideration. As previously noted, the extension provisions were a part of the initial agreement, and the Agreement not only recited a consideration but was based upon the parties\u2019 mutual promises. Under the circumstances, therefore, the right was supported by valuable con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>sideration. <em>See Major </em>v. <em>Price, </em>196 Va. 526, 530-31, 84 S.E.2d 445, 448 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">The trial court also ruled, in the alternative, that Powell Mountain, by its letter of July 26, 1990, failed to effectively exercise its election to extend the term of the Agreement. The court concluded that the letter \u201cwas not an unconditional acceptance on the \u2018same terms and conditions\u2019,\u201d as provided in the Agreement. This ruling also is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The first paragraph of the July 26 letter clearly and unequivocally states that Powell Mountain elects \u201cto extend the Agreement pursuant to Section 1(a), for an additional six-month period until December 31, 1990.\u201d Nothing contained in the second paragraph makes the first paragraph ambiguous. All that the second paragraph states is that Powell Mountain \u201cwill continue to work with [the Moores] in order to amend the Agreement to address concerns raised by both parties.\u201d This expression of Powell Mountain\u2019s desire to enter into negotiations for a modification of the Agreement in no way alters or vitiates Powell Mountain\u2019s unequivocal election to extend the Agreement, as set forth in the first paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In sum, we hold that Powell Mountain effectively exercised its right to extend the term of the Agreement. Accordingly, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
