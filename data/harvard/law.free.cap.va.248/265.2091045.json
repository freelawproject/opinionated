The trial court sustained Crestar\u2019s demurrer to the original bill of complaint and allowed the plaintiff to amend. The plaintiff filed a three-count amended bill, to which Crestar also demurred. The court sustained the second demurrer. We awarded the plaintiff this appeal from a June 1993 order dismissing the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">Because a demurrer admits the truth of all material facts that are well pleaded, we shall summarize the plaintiff\u2019s allegations as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>if they are true, although Crestar \u201cdisagrees strongly with and denies the allegations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\">In July 1986, the plaintiff obtained a loan from Crestar in the amount of $300,000 secured by a first deed of trust on property in Norfolk owned by the plaintiff that included an apartment building. Crestar subsequently obtained a second deed of trust on the same property in the amount of $45,000. The first deed of trust was \u201ccalled\u201d by Crestar in April 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Subsequently, the plaintiff \u201cnegotiated\u201d with Crestar to prevent a foreclosure on the property and, in June 1990, Crestar agreed to forebear its right to commence foreclosure until September 1, 1990. When \u201cthe forbearance period approached expiration,\u201d the plaintiff obtained a contract with one David Marshall and a loan commitment from \u201cEssex First Mortgage\u201d to finance the sale of the real estate to Marshall. This sale would have produced proceeds sufficient to retire all Crestar\u2019s claims against the plaintiff and would have resulted \u201cin net proceeds\u201d to plaintiff. Crestar commenced to foreclose on the property even though the sale to Marshall was \u201cimminent,\u201d and even though Crestar \u201cwas fully advised of both the sale contract and the commitment letter\u201d prior to the day of the scheduled foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">At that time, a representative of Crestar \u201cassured\u201d the plaintiff that if Crestar subsequently sold the property after foreclosure, \u201cCrestar would not \u2018double profit\u2019 if it received .more than the amount bidded in,\u201d but would credit the plaintiffs \u201caccount.\u201d The plaintiff was \u201cdiscouraged by Crestar in obtaining bidders for the foreclosure sale, or taking any other action to protect its interest, by oral assurances by Crestar representatives that the proceeds of any future sale . . . would be credited to the [plaintiffs] account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">In spite of the plaintiffs continued request that the foreclosure sale be postponed \u201ca few days\u201d so plaintiff could close with Marshall, Crestar conducted the sale on October 4, 1990. Crestar was the sole bidder and purchased the property for $345,000. On the next day, Crestar entered into a sales contract with Marshall \u201cfor $448,000, the exact same amount which had been contracted for by Mr. Marshall\u201d with the plaintiff. That sale closed on October 31, 1990 \u201cwith net proceeds of $389,145.30, plus additional escrows which remained unaccounted for, being paid to Crestar\u201d that Crestar refused to credit to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>In the first count of the amended bill, the plaintiff alleges that \u201cthe agreement concerning the application of funds of the second sale constituted a contract between the parties,\u201d and that \u201cthe failure to credit and properly account for the proceeds of sale constituted a breach of contract.\u201d The plaintiff alleges that this breach of contract caused it to suffer a loss of $104,000, \u201cminus any reasonable expenses attributable to\u201d the October 4 sale, \u201csaid sum being the difference in the amount that was actually credited and the amount which should have been credited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">In the second count, plaintiff seeks an order requiring Crestar to provide plaintiff with an accounting. Several months prior to the foreclosure, Crestar \u201ctook over the collection of rents from the subject property.\u201d The plaintiff asserts that during this time, when it was the owner of the property, it was \u201centitled to an accounting of rents received and disbursements,\u201d which Crestar has refused to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">In the third count, the plaintiff asserts that Crestar\u2019s actions \u201cconstituted an intentionally misleading course of conduct towards\u201d the plaintiff \u201cinsofar as it failed to properly apply the sale proceeds\u201d of the subject property \u201cwhile assuring\u201d the plaintiff \u201cthat it would do so.\u201d The plaintiff alleges that this course of conduct constituted \u201ca breach of its covenant of good faith and fair dealing imposed upon it under the Uniform Commercial Code,\u201d and seeks damages in the amount of $104,000 for this alleged breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff summarizes its claim under the first count as follows: \u201cGreenwood alleged that an oral promise was made by Crestar. This promise was an assurance by Crestar that it would not double profit on any sale of the Property subsequent to foreclosure and that any surplus from such a sale would be credited to Greenwood\u2019s account.\u201d Crestar maintains that the alleged contract is unenforceable because its terms are vague and uncertain, it lacks consideration, and it is void under the Statute of Frauds because not in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">We will assume, but not decide, that the allegations of the amended bill set forth the terms of the contract with sufficient specificity. Nonetheless, we hold that the alleged oral contract fails for lack of consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The plaintiff correctly notes that a promise to forebear the exercise of a legal right is adequate consideration to support a contract, <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>222 Va. 361, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>363, 281 S.E.2d 818, 819 (1981), and that an agreement to forebear may be implied from the parties\u2019 conduct and the nature of the transaction. <em>Troyer v. Troyer, </em>231 Va. 90, 94, 341 S.E.2d 182, 185 (1986). The plaintiff argues that \u201cGreenwood had a number of options available prior to foreclosure which would have protected its interests. Among those options were obtaining other bidders for the Property, seeking an injunction in state court or filing Chapter 11 Bankruptcy to stay the foreclosure proceedings.\u201d Further, the plaintiff contends that it is \u201clegally sufficient that Crestar\u2019s assurance or promise should have reasonably induced forbearance and that it did, in fact, result in forbearance on the part of Greenwood, the promisee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\">We do not agree with the plaintiff. Mere forbearance, without an agreement to that effect, is not sufficient consideration for a promise, even though the fact of forbearance was induced by the promise. <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Bank of Mecklenberg, </em>112 Va. 443, 453-54, 71 S.E. 714, 717 (1911), <em>cited in Troyer, </em>231 Va. at 94, 341 S.E.2d at 185. The fact of forbearance to act does not establish consideration for the undertaking, unless there was an agreement, express or implied, that the plaintiff would forebear to act. \u201cSuch an agreement is absolutely essential.\u201d <em>Saunders, </em>112 Va. at 454, 71 S.E. at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">In the present case, nowhere has the plaintiff alleged that Crestar made the alleged \u201cassurances\u201d not to \u201cdouble profit\u201d on the resale of the property in exchange for the plaintiffs promise to forebear from exercising legal rights. The plaintiff merely has alleged that Crestar made \u201cassurances\u201d that it foreseeably relied upon to its detriment. The \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d agreement is lacking in the plaintiffs allegations. Thus, the plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action for breach of contract to support its claim for damages under the first count of the amended bill. Because an enforceable contract has not been pled, we do not reach the Statute of Frauds question.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Proceeding to the second count, we hold that the plaintiffs allegations support entitlement to the accounting that it requests in the amended bill, that is, an accounting of all funds Crestar received and disbursed from rents collected during the period prior to foreclosure. Based on the allegations, Crestar was acting in a fiduciary capacity during that period and was under a duty to account to the property owner. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-31 (\u201cAn accounting in equity may be had against any fiduciary ... for receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>more than comes to his just share or proportion. . .\u201d). Therefore, the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the second count of the amended bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Turning to the third count, we conclude that this transaction is not controlled by the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.). The alleged oral contract involves the foreclosure, sale, and resale of real property as a precondition to its performance. The U.C.C. expressly excludes the transfer of realty from its provisions. Code \u00a7 8.9-104 specifies: \u201cThis title does not apply ... to the creation or transfer of an interest in or lien on real estate, including a lease or rents thereunder. . . .\u201d Thus, the plaintiff has failed to state a claim against Crestar based upon any cause of action that may exist for breach of the \u201cobligation of good faith\u201d set forth in Code \u00a7 8.1-203. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.1-201(19).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Consequently, that portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing the first and third counts of the amended bill will be affirmed. The portion dismissing the second count will be reversed and the cause will be remanded for further proceedings under that count of the amended bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
