According to the record, House Mountain \u201cis a striking natural feature\u201d that provides \u201cthe scenic backdrop\u201d to the west for the city of Lexington. The record shows that generations of citizens, including college students, \u201chave enjoyed hiking and climbing, nature study, hunting, and other outdoor activities on the mountain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">The facts, which are undisputed, will be summarized along with the material proceedings, some of which are rather tangled. In 1985, appellees Vernon A. Eagle and his wife bought 100.36 acres of land at the foot of the southeastern slope of House Mountain. Later that year, Eagle sought to purchase the property in controversy. The almost triangular parcel contains 103.270 acres and is located above the Eagles\u2019 property on the mountainside. David A. White owned the land, according to a composite plat that E\u00e1gle had seen. White refused to sell. In 1986, Eagle, who is not an attorney at law, examined some of the county land records and began to question whether White actually owned the 103-acre triangular tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">In late Spring 1988, property owned by White on House Mountain \u201ccame on the market for sale.\u201d White purportedly owned approximately 919 acres of the mountain, including the 103-acre tract, and offered to sell the entire acreage for $325,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">The Eagles and other owners of land on the mountain wished to insure preservation of the land in its natural state and prevent its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>development. Commencing in July 1988, a series of meetings was held attended by persons interested in the White property, including Eagle; Laurence A. Mann, a Lexington attorney; and members of the Rockbridge Area Conservation Council (RACC), an organization concerned with continuing the traditional uses of the mountain \u201cwhile emphasizing the preservation of the natural features and essential character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">During the first meeting, Eagle, who was a member of RACC\u2019s board of directors, told the group that, in his opinion, White did not own the 103-acre parcel and that he (Eagle) \u201chad long had an interest in it.\u201d In July and August 1988, Eagle told White\u2019s real estate agent that White did not own the parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">In the meantime, RACC formed a special committee to conduct a drive to raise funds to purchase the White property. Mann, representing RACC, obtained an option on July 8, 1988 to purchase the entire property for the asking price. This was an effort \u201cto save the property\u201d pending the fund-raising effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Because there was concern that RACC could not \u201ccarry the whole project to fruition,\u201d Mann involved the Virginia Outdoors Foundation (VOF) in the effort to purchase the property. VOF, a state agency, \u201cis established to promote the preservation of open-space lands and to encourage private gifts of money, securities, land or other property to preserve the natural, scenic, historic, scientific, open-space and recreational areas of the Commonwealth.\u201d Code \u00a7 10.1-1800.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">VOF, through its Executive Director, Tyson Van Auken, agreed to \u201cpick up\u201d RACC\u2019s option. Subsequently, the option was transferred to VOF by an October 1988 assignment giving VOF the right to purchase the White property. At this time, neither Mann nor anyone on behalf of RACC or VOF had examined the title to the 919 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">During the period December 1988 to February 1989, Eagle conducted a thorough title examination of much of the House Mountain land and \u201cmanaged to account for almost all of it\u201d by tracing title back to grants and patents from the Commonwealth. During the course of this work, Eagle encountered Mann in the record room of the circuit court clerk\u2019s office and advised Mann that the 103-acre triangle \u201cjust doesn\u2019t show up anywhere.\u201d Eagle also determined that White never had paid taxes on the parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">In a March 17, 1989 letter to White\u2019s realtor, Mann stated \u201cthere have been some distressing developments\u201d regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>White\u2019s House Mountain property. Mann, expressing confidence \u201cthat this project will go to closing,\u201d suggested that White convey the 103-acre tract \u201cnow\u201d as an \u201cadvance sale prior to the exercise of the option.\u201d Mann later testified that this was an effort to \u201cstall Mr. Eagle\u201d by establishing title in VOF. Within two weeks, White purportedly conveyed the 103-acre parcel to VOF by quitclaim deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Subsequently, White and VOF executed an agreement in April 1989 in which VOF exercised the option and promised to purchase the White property, including the 103-acre parcel. No title examination had yet been undertaken by anyone for RACC or VOF. Van Auken testified that, although he was aware of the questions raised about the title to the 103-acre parcel, he and the assistant attorney general advising him \u201csimply made an administrative decision that the title has got to be . . . either in the Commonwealth or with Mr. White,\u201d and that VOF would proceed with acquiring the property as agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In the meantime, Eagle, convinced that \u201cno chain of title existed\u201d for the 103-acre parcel, consulted an attorney at law for advice. Counsel advised him to proceed under Code \u00a7 41.1-16 to have the parcel sold as \u201cwaste and unappropriated\u201d land.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">From that time until the present suit was filed in October 1990, Eagle, Mann, Van Auken, and White\u2019s realtor attempted to reach a compromise settlement of the matter. As part of the negotiations, Eagle emphasized that his sole interest in the disputed parcel was to preserve and protect the property. During these discussions, Eagle offered to provide VOF with a conservation easement in the event he obtained fee simple title to the parcel. The evidence showed that VOF routinely acquires such easements to protect open-space areas that are privately owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Eagle was mainly interested in a tract of 34.84 acres that was a part of the 103-acre parcel. During the negotiations, Eagle proposed to Mann, RACC, and Van Auken that if VOF conveyed the 34-acre tract to him, then he would execute a conservation easement to VOF and make a cash donation to the \u201cHouse Mountain fund,\u201d reiterating his desire \u201cto protect the land, and to clear up the title.\u201d The negotiations failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">In May 1989, at the request of VOF, the Attorney General appointed Anita Filson, a Lexington attorney, to research and report on the title to the 103-acre parcel. By deed dated July 5, 1989, White conveyed the 919 acres, including the 103-acre parcel, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>VOF. VOF obtained a title insurance policy that excluded the 103 acres. VOF paid White the full purchase price and was reimbursed approximately $150,000 from RACC\u2019s fund-raising efforts. Filson had not completed her title examination at the time of the sale. In December 1989, she reported to the Attorney General that she had \u201cexhausted all the logical leads\u201d in an effort to identify \u201cany prior owner of this tract.\u201d She concluded \u201cthat the land has probably never been granted out of the Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">In October 1990, the present suit was filed under Code \u00a7 41.1-16. As pertinent, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">\u201cAny citizen, resident of this Commonwealth, who has reason to believe that there are waste and unappropriated lands in this Commonwealth . . . , shall have the right to file a proceeding in the name of the county or city seeking the sale and disposition of such land. . . . The proceeding shall be instituted by motion signed by the party who institutes the proceeding, or on his behalf .... Each landowner adjoining the tract in question shall be made a party to the proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u201cHe shall file with the motion a copy of a plat prepared by a licensed land surveyor giving the metes and bounds of the land alleged to be waste and unappropriated. A copy of the motion and plat shall be served upon each of the landowners adjoining the tract in question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">In a \u201cMotion To Sell Unappropriated Lands,\u201d the Eagles named the County of Rockbridge and themselves as complainants and VOF and Eugene R. Hostetter as respondents. The Eagles sought sale of the 34-acre tract, of which VOF and Hostetter were adjoining landowners. The Eagles asked that the tract \u201cbe determined to be unappropriated property\u201d and that it \u201cbe sold as provided by law.\u201d Code \u00a7 41.1-18 specifies that \u201con motion of any party the sale of such land shall be public\u201d and that the proceeds, after payment of costs and expenses, \u201cshall be paid into the treasury of the county or city, as the case may be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Hostetter filed an answer taking \u201cno position\u201d on the relief requested in the suit. He died during the course of the proceedings and eventually one Timothy Rogers Smith, Hostetter\u2019s devisee, was substituted as a party respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The then Attorney General, on behalf of VOF, filed a motion to dismiss asserting that the property was not \u201cwaste and unappropriated land.\u201d She also asserted that the Eagles \u201care equitably estopped from asserting interests adverse to the Foundation because Complainant Vernon A. Eagle was a member of the Board of the Rockbridge Conservation Council . . . the original holder of the option to purchase the subject real estate.\u201d The Attorney General asserted, \u201cGiven . . . Eagle\u2019s prior knowledge of the status of the parties and of the property, one would have thought, in equity, that he would have expressed his interest in the property prior to the Foundation\u2019s expenditure of funds to purchase the disputed parcel.\u201d The Attorney General also asserted that the Commonwealth \u201cand its political subdivision,\u201d VOF, are entitled to sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">After the trial court denied the motion to dismiss and VOF filed an answer, the County filed a petition asking that the net proceeds of any sale of the subject property be paid to the County\u2019s treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">On December 18, 1992, the trial court conducted an ore tenus hearing. The only parties appearing were the Eagles and VOF. By agreement, VOF presented its evidence first in an attempt to establish the validity of its title. The parties had produced approximately 50 exhibits during pretrial discovery; these exhibits were received in evidence by agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">At the conclusion of VOF\u2019s evidence, the trial court sustained a motion for summary judgment made on behalf of the Eagles. The court ruled from the bench that Eagle \u201cis not estopped here\u201d because \u201che actually is the one that discovered the non-existence of the title to this property. It was not something he did as an insider on the board.\u201d The court noted that the evidence failed to show that Eagle\u2019s \u201cposition on the board brought any benefit to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">The court also ruled that White failed to perfect any title to the subject property by adverse possession and, further, that the property had \u201cnever been properly entitled to anybody.\u201d The court directed that an order be prepared for sale of the 34 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">At that point in the hearing, the Attorney General moved that the entire 103-acre parcel be included in the sale. The court responded that its \u201cfinding pertains to the whole 103 acres,\u201d and indicated, without objection by the Eagles, that the remainder of the 103 acres be sold. The trial court again rejected the Attorney General\u2019s sovereign immunity argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>On February 12, 1993, the trial court entered an order adjudicating the principles of the cause holding that the 34 acres as well as the remaining part of the 103 acres, except a small part owned by Hostetter, \u201chave never been patented or set apart for a specific purpose by the Commonwealth.\u201d The order further recited that VOF acquired no interest in the 34 acres or the remainder tract, and that such property is waste and unappropriated land subject to sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Noting a written motion filed by the Attorney General following the hearing to expand the sale to include the remainder tract and to add new parties because they adjoined the remainder tract, the order also provided for appointment of a special commissioner to conduct a public sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Accordingly, appellants Thomas R. Black, Thomas H. Black, and Rebecca Black Bennett (collectively, the Blacks) were joined as parties. On March 15, 1993, VOF filed a notice of appeal. Two days later, the new parties filed an answer stating that they were not \u201cinformed of the pendency of this action until now\u201d because they were not served with the initial Motion instituting the suit. The Blacks, implicitly denying the allegations of the Motion, stated they did not \u201cwish to disrupt the proceeding by causing a full rehearing. Instead they generally accept the recitation of facts included in the Court\u2019s . . . Order dated February 12, 1993, and seek the right to submit argument or memoranda, with reservation of the right to present only supplementary new evidence.\u201d A week later, the Blacks filed a praecipe asking the clerk of court \u201cto place the case back on the docket ... for supplementary proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Thereafter, an issue arose between the County and the Commonwealth about the disposition of the proceeds of sale. On May 5, 1993, the trial court entered an order declaring unconstitutional that portion of Code \u00a7 41.1-18 providing for the proceeds of sale to be paid to the County. The court ruled that this provision is in conflict with Article VIII, Section 8, of the Constitution of Virginia, which provides that the proceeds \u201cof all waste and unappropriated lands\u201d shall be set apart and paid to the Literary Fund. The court also stayed the order directing the sale \u201cuntil the appeal is determined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Counsel for the Blacks noted objection to the May 5 order with the following statement: \u201cTo preserve my clients\u2019 right to appeal, I object to the Court\u2019s holding that the subject property is \u2018waste <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>and unappropriated\u2019 and thus subject to sale. I object to that holding as stated in the order of February 12, 1993, to which we were not parties, and also, as used, implicitly, to support the instant order. Otherwise, I agree.\u201d No supplementary hearing was held after the Blacks filed their answer and the Blacks filed a notice of appeal on May 14, stating they appealed \u201cthe decision ... entered February 12, 1993, and reaffirmed by final order entered May 5, 1993.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In May 1993, the Attorney General filed a petition for appeal on behalf of VOF, naming the County, the Eagles, Smith, and the Blacks as respondents. VOF assigned error to the trial court\u2019s ruling on sovereign immunity and to the court\u2019s \u201cholding that land which an agency of the Commonwealth bought and occupied for a public purpose pursuant to its statutory authority was waste and unappropriated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">On August 4, 1993, the Blacks filed a petition for appeal assigning only two errors: \u201c1. The trial court erred in finding Eagle was not equitably estopped even though he at least shifted from a fiduciary corporate director\u2019s position to a position favoring himself in competition with the corporation;\u201d and \u201c2. The Trial Court erred in labelling the land \u2018waste and unappropriated\u2019 even though it was maintained as a recreation area by VOF, an agency of the State, under a plan for quieting title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">On August 12, 1993, this Court refused VOF\u2019s petition for appeal. In December 1993, this Court awarded the Blacks the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">In February 1994, during the pendency of this appeal, the Attorney General on behalf of VOF filed a brief amicus curiae raising precisely the same issues raised in VOF\u2019s petition for appeal that was refused in August 1993. On the same day, RACC filed a brief amicus curiae addressing the issues raised by the Blacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">A number of procedural problems stem from the tangle of this proceeding. The most obvious is that the appellants, the Blacks, were not parties to the suit when the trial court adjudicated the principles of the cause. This problem has not been directly addressed by the Eagles, although they have filed several motions to dismiss and still urge the Court that the appeal should not have been awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">Because of the peculiar circumstances in this proceeding, we refuse to hold that the Blacks are not proper parties appellant. From the moment they were added as parties, they asked to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>heard and for a supplemental hearing, which was never granted. Throughout the proceedings after they were added, they took the position that the order ruling on the statute\u2019s constitutionality, from which they appealed, implicitly reaffirmed the trial court\u2019s prior ruling on the merits of the cause. Accordingly, we hold that the Blacks are persons aggrieved within the meaning of Code \u00a7 8.01-670(A) and are entitled to appeal. <em>See Jones </em>v. <em>Rhea, </em>130 Va. 345, 361-62, 107 S.E. 814, 820 (1921) (litigant who seeks to become a party, and is entitled to become a party to proceedings in which he is interested, and is rejected, should be regarded, for purposes of appeal, \u201cas possessing the status of one who is a formal party to the proceedings in which his rights and interests are being litigated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Next, the issue of sovereign immunity has been raised in this appeal. We will not address it further because it has been finally decided against the Commonwealth in the rejection of VOF\u2019s appeal. We will not revisit that decision as the result of an amicus brief filed by the Attorney General in this, a separate appeal in the same case.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Moreover, we reject the Blacks\u2019 effort to have sovereign immunity revisited. On appeal, the Blacks impermissibly have supplemented their assignments of error. In their petition for appeal, neither of the two assignments of error mentioned sovereign immunity. Yet, printed in the appendix, pursuant to the Blacks\u2019 designation, is a third assignment of error relating to sovereign immunity. Appeals are awarded based on assignments of error and the language of the assignments may not be changed after the appeal is awarded. <em>Hamilton Dev. Co. </em>v. <em>Broad Rock Club, Inc., </em>248 Va. 40, 44, 445 S.E.2d 140, 143 (1994), decided today.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Next, the Blacks present an argument ostensibly drawing on their assignment of error asserting that Eagle was \u201cequitably es-topped\u201d from obtaining relief in this suit. The evidence utterly fails to establish all the elements of equitable estoppel, that is, representation, reliance, change of position, and detriment, even assuming that an estoppel can operate in this case in favor of the Blacks. But the Blacks do not argue the elements of equitable estoppel. Instead, their argument dwells entirely on the law relating to the fiduciary duty owed by a corporate director to the corporation. The assignment of error does not sufficiently reach the issue argued, and we will not address it further. \u201cOnly errors assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>in the petition for appeal will be noticed by this Court.\u201d Rule 5:17(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The only substantive issue that we are able to address is whether the land is waste and unappropriated within the meaning of Code \u00a7 41.1-16 (the Eagles have not argued that this issue has been precluded by the ruling on the same issue in VOF\u2019s appeal). As a general rule, all lands that have never been patented are to be considered waste and unappropriated, susceptible to location and to being sold under the statute. <em>French </em>v. <em>Bankhead, </em>52 Va. (11 Gratt.) 136, 168 (1854). <em>See James River and Kanawha Power Co. </em>v. <em>Old Dominion Iron and Steel Corp., </em>138 Va. 461, 472, 122 S.E. 344, 347 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The Blacks\u2019 argument is that the property has been appropriated due to the public\u2019s use of the land, White\u2019s claim of possessory rights, the quitclaim deed, and the subsequent deed of White\u2019s entire House Mountain property. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The evidence is clear that the subject property has never been titled by grant or patent from the Commonwealth. White had no title to the 103 acres and thus had nothing to convey to VOF. The mere fact of public use and a claim of possessory rights does not provide anyone, including VOF, with a valid claim of ownership of land of this type in disregard of the law relating to waste and unappropriated land. Hence, we hold that the subject property is such \u201cwaste and unappropriated\u201d land within the meaning of Code \u00a7 41.1-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Consequently, the judgment appealed from will be affirmed and the cause remanded for such further proceedings as may be necessary to accomplish the sale of the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
