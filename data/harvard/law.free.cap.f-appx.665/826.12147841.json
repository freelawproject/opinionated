The Immigration Judge found that Morales had not shown that he faced or faces past or future persecution or torture, and the Bureau of Immigration Appeals dismissed his appeal. Morales now petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The Department of Homeland Security charged Morales as removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00a9. He conceded his removability but applied for withholding of removal based on membership in a particular group and sought CAT relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His application did not state what social group he was a member of, but it indicated that he would be targeted because the Zetas knew he had been making money by working in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">At the hearing on his application Morales stated that he left Mexico because of threats from the Zetas, although his wife and five daughters remained behind. He also described three crimes committed by Zeta members against his family in the last decade. First, a drug-addict and Zeta member named Umberto Solano broke into his house. Morales\u2019 neighbors called the police and Solano was arrested before he could harm Morales\u2019 family. Morales testified that he did not know how long Solano had been jailed on account of that incident. Second, the Zetas kidnapped Morales\u2019 brother\u2019s niece, and the family had to pay a ransom. The family did not contact the police in connection with the kidnapping because the Zetas had threatened them. Third, Morales\u2019 son-in-law, also a member of the Zetas, accosted two of Morales\u2019 daughters (including the son-in-law\u2019s wife). He \u201ctussl[ed] with [their] books, pull[ed] their hair[], and twist[ed] [their] arm[s].\u201d The local prosecutor\u2019s office investigated the battery, interviewing both women. According to Morales, the prosecutor recommended against pressing charges because the son-in-law might want revenge if he were put in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">The IJ denied withholding of removal based on membership in a particular social group and also denied CAT relief. As an initial matter, he found Morales\u2019 testimony credible. But he noted that Morales\u2019 family continued living in Mexico \u201cunencumbered,\u201d and that the police had intervened when Solano broke into his home. As a result, there was no indication in the record that \u201cthe Mexican government is unwilling or unable to provide assistance to the family.\u201d The IJ also found that there was no evidence that Morales would be subjected to torture upon returning to Mexico, precluding CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">The BIA dismissed Morales\u2019 appeal, finding that a generally high level of criminal activity \u201cdoes not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d In addition, it agreed with the IJ that the police\u2019s reaction to the crimes committed against Morales\u2019 family showed that the Mexican government was not \u201cunwilling or unable to protect [Morales].\u201d The BIA also found that Morales had failed to show that he was more likely than not to be tortured by or with the acquiescence of a Mexican public official, so he was ineligible for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Morales contends that the BIA erred by declining to withhold removal or grant him CAT relief. \u201cWhen the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d Lopez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 504 F.3d 1341, 1344 (11th Cir. 2007). We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings for \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 577 F.3d 1341, 1350-51 (11th Cir. 2009). Under that \"highly deferential\u201d standard, we must affirm the decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d Id. at 1351. By contrast, we may only reverse the BIA\u2019s findings if \u201cthe record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d Id</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Regarding his request for withholding of removal based on membership in a particular social group, Morales argues on appeal that he is a member of the social group of \u201cvictims of a crime whom the police/govemment fail[ ] to protect as it is their duty.\u201d But Morales did not raise that argument before the IJ. He did check the box on his initial application that he was seeking withholding of removal based on membership in a particular social group, but he never expressly stated what group he was referring to. Instead, he stated in his application and in his testimony that the Zetas would target him \u201cto obtain any money I may have\u201d from his years of working in the United States. That has nothing to do with the \u201cvictims of crime\u201d social group to which he now claims he belongs. Because Morales failed to raise the \u201cvictims of crime\u201d argument before the IJ, we lack jurisdiction to review it. See Dormescar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 690 F.3d 1258, 1269 n.11 (11th Cir. 2012); Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir. 2006) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1)). We therefore dismiss that portion of Morales\u2019 petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">As for his request for CAT relief, Morales argues that the Mexican government knew about the Zetas\u2019 threats and \u201crefused to step in and give aid to [him].\u201d \u201cIn making out a claim under CAT, \u2018[t]he burden of proof is on the applicant ... to establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u2019\u201d Najjar v. Ashcroft, 257 F.3d 1262, 1303 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2)). For an act to rise to the level of torture, it must involve the infliction of \u201csevere pain or suffering.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). Furthermore, an applicant is not eligible for CAT relief unless he faces torture \u201cwith the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d Id. \u201cAcquiescence,\u201d in turn, \u201crequires that the public official, prior to the activity constituting torture, have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.\u201d Id. \u00a7 208.18(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Morales asserts that he reported the Zetas\u2019 criminal acts against his family and the Mexican government did nothing, so the government has \u201cacquiesced\u201d to acts of torture and would do so again were he to return to Mexico. According to Morales\u2019 testimony, he alerted Mexican authorities to two crimes against his family: Solano\u2019s break-in and Morales\u2019 son-in-law\u2019s battery of two of his daughters. Neither incident falls within the CAT\u2019s definition of torture. First, Solano was arrested and incarcerated after breaking into Morales\u2019 house; there is no evidence of \u201ctorture\u201d or \u201cacquiescence.\u201d Second, Morales\u2019 son-in-law\u2019s \u201ctussling\u201d with Morales\u2019 daughters does not rise to the level of \u201csevere pain or suffering\u201d that the CAT requires, and the fact that the family accepted the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>tor\u2019s recommendation not to press charges does not show the government\u2019s acquiescence to acts of torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Morales points to nothing in the record beyond those past incidents of supposed \u201ctorture\u201d that shows that he is more likely than not to face actual torture with the acquiescence of a public official upon- his return to Mexico. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that he is not eligible for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-8\">. Because he had entered the United States more than one year before he filed his application, Morales conceded that he was not eligible for asylum under the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
