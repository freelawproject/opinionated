After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">On July 25, 2012, Saleem pleaded guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (\u201cCount Two\u201d), and to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) (\u201cCount Four\u201d). Using the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual effective November 1, 2011, the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated the offense levels for Count Two and Count Four separately. First, the PSI determined that Saleem\u2019s base offense level for Count Two was 26 under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, and then applied a 2-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (because he possessed a dangerous weapon) for an adjusted offense level of 28. Second, it determined that Saleem\u2019s base offense level for Count Four was 22 under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3), and then applied the following enhancements: (1) 2 levels under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A), because the offense involved between 3 and 7 firearms; (2) 2 levels under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4), because the offense involved a stolen firearm; and (3) 4 levels under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), because Saleem used or possessed a firearm in connection with another felony. This yielded an adjusted offense level of 30 for Count Four.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The PSI \u201cgrouped\u201d Counts Two and Four together because they were \u201cclosely related counts\u201d under USSG \u00a7 3D1.2(c). This means that, in accordance with \u00a7 3D1.3(a), the PSI calculated one offense level for the entire \u201cgroup\u201d (consisting of Counts Two and Four) by using the higher adjusted offense level of the two counts\u2014 which in this case was Count Four\u2019s adjusted offense level of 30. The 3-level acceptance-of-responsibility reduction under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1 resulted in a total offense level of 27. Based on this total offense level and his criminal history category of IV, Saleem had a guideline range of 100 to 125 months. Neither Saleem nor the government filed written objections to the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court determined that there were no objections to the PSI\u2019s guideline calculation. The court then denied Saleem\u2019s request for a downward variance and sentenced him to 125-months imprisonment as to each count, to be served concurrently, followed by 5 years of supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">In November 2014, Saleem filed a pro se motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines. He argued that Amendment 782 applied to his base offense level for Count Two and requested that his sentence be reduced to 105 months. The district court denied Sa-leem\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in April 2015. In its order, the court observed that Amendment 782 did not apply to Saleem\u2019s sentence because his guideline range was calculated based on Count Four (his firearm-possession conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)), and not on Count Two (his drug-possession conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">A few days after the district court denied his pro se \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, Saleem filed a counseled \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. He again argued that he was eligible for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>sentence reduction based on Amendment 782, and requested that his sentence be reduced to 84 months. Then, about eight months later, Saleem made the same argument in a pro se \u201cDefendant\u2019s Renewed Motion for Reduction of Sentence.\u201d The district court construed this as a motion to reconsider the denial of his original pro se \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. It then denied both the motion for reconsideration and the counseled \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, explaining that Saleem\u2019s offense level was calculated under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 for Count Four, and that Amendment 782 only applied to offense levels calculated under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">On appeal, Saleem argues that Amendment 782 made him eligible for a sentence reduction because his \u201cbase offense level pursuant to USSG [\u00a7 ] 2D1.1 of 22 would now be 20.\u201d We review de novo the district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). United States v. Colon, 707 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir. 2013). We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion. United States v. Simms, 385 F.3d 1347, 1356 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">A district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) unless: (1) the defendant\u2019s sentence was based on a guideline range that the Sentencing Commission later lowered; and (2) a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. The Sentencing Commission can lower guideline ranges through amendments to the guidelines like Amendment 782. But if an amendment does not lower a particular defendant\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range,\u201d any sentence reduction for that defendant based on the amendment would not be consistent with one of the guidelines\u2019 policy statements. USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Thus, a district court is not authorized to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces his base offense level but does not alter the guideline range upon which his sentence was based. United States v. Moore, 541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">The district court correctly denied Sa-leem\u2019s motions because Amendment 782 did not lower his sentencing guideline range. Amendment 782 provided a 2-level reduction in the base offense levels for most drug quantities listed in the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). USSG App. C, amend. 782. Amendment 782 therefore lowered the base offense level of Saleem\u2019s conviction under Count Two\u2014a drug offense\u2014from 26 to 24. This gave him a new adjusted offense level of 26 for Count Two after a 2-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">However, Saleem\u2019s guideline range was a result of the adjusted offense level for Count Four, not Count Two. This is because of the \u201cgrouping\u201d rules in the Sentencing Guidelines. Section 3D1.1 of the guidelines provides that when a defendant has been convicted of several counts, the sentencing court must group them into \u201cGroups of Closely Related Counts.\u201d Sa-leem\u2019s two counts were grouped together under \u00a7 3D1.2(c) because each count involved conduct that was a \u201cspecific offense characteristic\u201d in the guideline applicable to the other count. That is, Count Four\u2014 possession of a firearm by a convicted felon\u2014involved possession of a dangerous weapon, which was an applicable \u201cspecific offense characteristic\u201d of Count Two under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). And Count Two\u2014possession with intent to distribute cocaine\u2014was a felony offense, which was an applicable \u201cspecific offense characteristic\u201d of Count Four under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) if the defendant possessed a firearm in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>that felony. When multiple counts are grouped together under \u00a7 3D1.2(c) like Counts Two and Four were here, the offense level for the group is the highest adjusted offense level of the counts in the group. USSG \u00a7 3D1.3(a). In this case, the higher adjusted offense level belonged to Count Four, which had a level of 30 compared to Count Two\u2019s 28. Thus, the district court properly used Count Four\u2019s adjusted offense level to calc\u00falate Saleem\u2019s guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Because of the grouping rules in the Sentencing Guidelines, Saleem\u2019s guideline range was calculated based on Count Four\u2019s adjusted offense level. Amendment 782 impacted only Count Two\u2019s adjusted offense level, and therefore had no effect on Saleem\u2019s guideline range. And because Amendment 782 had no effect on his guideline range, it did not make him eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); see Moore, 541 F.3d at 1330. Thus, the district court did not err by denying Saleem\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-7\">. The court\u2019s written judgment says that Sa-leem\u2019s 125-month total sentence consists of 125-months imprisonment as to Count Two and 120-months imprisonment as to Count Four, to be served concurrently with each other. This apparent inconsistency with the court\u2019s sentencing-hearing statements does not affect Saleem\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
