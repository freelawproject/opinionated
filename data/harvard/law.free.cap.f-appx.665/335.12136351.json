(Sanderson), and accompanying dismissal of her Title VII claim against Sanderson. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b354-17\">We review the facts in the light most favorable to Carr, the nonmovant. Carr, a white female, and Kevin Webb, an African-American male, were both employed by Sanderson Farms (Sanderson), working the same shift in the same division. Webb was in a relationship with Carr\u2019s cousin, and the two had a child. Carr\u2019s attempt to intercede in a domestic dispute between Webb and Carr\u2019s cousin led Webb to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>threaten Carr outside of work. The incident resulted in the filing of a police report, and Carr notified her supervisors at Sanderson that she did not feel safe around Webb. Sanderson took no action at that time because the incident did not occur on company property. Approximately three weeks later, as Carr returned from a lunch break, Webb struck Carr twice with a pallet jack. Carr believed the incident was motivated by the dispute between Webb and Carr\u2019s cousin. Sanderson undertook an investigation of the incident and terminated both Webb and Carr for gross safety violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Carr filed a complaint with the District Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission based on racial discrimination and received a right-to-sue letter. This lawsuit followed, in which Carr initially alleged that Sanderson fired her because most of the workforce at Sanderson is African-American, and that the African-American employees \u201cwould not [have] tolerate[d]\u201dthe firing of only Webb. Sander-son moved for summary judgment under Rule 56(a). The district court granted the motion and dismissed the case. Carr appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The nature of Carr\u2019s claim has changed over the course of the litigation. The initial complaint alleged a Title VII violation for discrimination on the basis of race. Then, in response to Sanderson\u2019s summary judgment motion, Carr argued a combination of sex- and race-based discrimination and a failure to remedy a hostile work environment. On appeal, Carr argues that (1) Webb was treated more favorably than Carr given his prior attendance record and criminal history, and (2) that Sanderson did not appropriately respond to Carr\u2019s safety concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">We proceed assuming that Carr is making two claims: a hostile work environment claim and a race- and/or sex-based discriminatory action claim. To the extent that Carr is advancing a claim other than one under Title VII, we do not address it, as it was not present\u00e9d to the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">Title VII protects individuals from discrimination by an employer based on the \u201cindividual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For a race-based claim, a plaintiff in a Title VII action must \u201cestablish[ ] a prima facie case of racial discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A prima facie case requires a showing that the plaintiff (1) was a member of a protected class; (2) was qualified for the position at issue; (3) was the subject of an adverse employment action; and (4) was treated less favorably than were other similarly situated employees who were not members of the protected class, under nearly identical circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The elements are the same for a prima facie case of sex discrimination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If a plaintiff makes a prima facie case, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>must then provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the complained-of action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the defendant meets this burden, \u201cthe onus shifts back to the plaintiff\u2019 to provide substantial evidence that th\u00e9 given reason is merely pretext or that the stated reason \u201cis only one of the reasons ... and another \u2018motivating factor\u2019 is the plaintiffs protected characteristic.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Carr has made a prima facie case that she is a member of a protected class,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that she was qualified for the position she held, and that she was subject to an adverse employment action\u2014namely, being terminated. However, Carr offers no factual support for the proposition that she was treated less favorably than similarly situated non-white workers at Sanderson. She does not point to any other individual who was treated more favorably. In fact, the only other individual identified in the lawsuit who committed a gross safety violation, Webb, was also terminated. Carr repeatedly references Webb\u2019s criminal background and attendance records, though without explaining the relationship to the termination decision. At any rate, Carr also had a criminal record and frequent attendance violations. Carr has failed to allege facts sufficient to support an inference that she was treated less favorably than a similarly situated employee who was not a member of the class. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Even assuming that Carr had met her burden to make out a prima facie case of discrimination, she has failed to show that Sanderson\u2019s reason for termination\u2014 commission of a gross safety violation\u2014 was pretextual. This court has recognized that safety concerns are a legitimate basis for taking adverse employment action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Sanderson\u2019s investigation showed that Carr had committed a gross safety violation, which, according to company policy, was grounds for immediate termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Carr alleges only that African-American employees \u201cwould not tolerate\u201d it if only Webb were fired, and that Carr\u2019s termination was undertaken \u201cto keep peace in the plant.\u201d Carr did not provide any supporting facts in her deposition testimony, other than her own feelings, flatly stating \u201cI don\u2019t have any facts\u201d in response to questioning about the basis for her claim of racial bias. There is likewise no evidence in the record to suggest her termination was based on her sex. \u201c[A] subjective belief of discrimination, however genuine, [may not] be the basis of judicial relief.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">Mere \u201cconclusory allegations, speculation, and unsubstantiated assertions,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>without more, are insufficient to satisfy the non-movant\u2019s burden at the summary-judgment stage.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even if Carr had made a prima facie case for racial or sex-based discrimination, she has failed to meet her burden of presenting substantial evidence that Sanderson\u2019s decision to terminate her for a gross safety violation was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Courts also recognize a Title VII violation when discrimination based on membership in a protected class creates a hostile or abusive work environment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In order to establish a hostile working environment, a plaintiff must prove five elements: (1) the employee belonged to a protected class; (2) the employee was subject to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on membership in a protected class; (4) the harassment affected a \u201cterm, condition, or privilege\u201d of employment; and (5) the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt remedial action.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A bare allegation of harassment, unrelated to membership in any protected class, cannot form the basis of a Title VII claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Carr\u2019s claim of harassment centers on Webb\u2019s threat to Carr\u2019s safety and Sanderson\u2019s failure to take any remedial action. Carr points out that Sanderson was aware of Webb\u2019s criminal history, propensity for violence, and his threat against Carr. Carr claims she \u201cworked in fear\u201d of Webb for three weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">Though we do not diminish the reality of the threat Carr may have perceived, she has failed to allege facts that suggest any harassment she encountered at work was based on her membership in any protected class. As mentioned above, she has consistently contended that Webb\u2019s actions were based on his relationship with Carr\u2019s cousin, not on Carr\u2019s race or sex. Further, Carr reported Webb\u2019s threat to Sanderson, but did not provide Sanderson with any suggestion that the conduct was based on race or sex. We do not address any general duty Sanderson might have had toward Carr, because Title VII speaks to discrimination claims, and Carr fails to show any failure on Sanderson\u2019s part to take action to address any allegations of discrimination at its plant. Even if Carr is correct that Sanderson should have fired Webb prior to the pallet jack incident, mere failure to follow internal procedures does not alone create a triable issue of fact as to discriminatory motive.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Carr must show some nexus between the challenged actions and her membership in a protected class.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">Further, Carr has not alleged any facts to support her allegation that Webb\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>threat in any way altered the conditions of her employment prior to the pallet jack incident. Though one incident may be sufficient to show a hostile work environment,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Carr has admitted that Webb\u2019s attack-was not based on her race, but rather on her intervention in a domestic dispute outside of work. Thus, if Carr is pursuing a hostile work environment claim under Title VII, she has failed to carry her initial burden of establishing a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">* \u215c *</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgement of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
