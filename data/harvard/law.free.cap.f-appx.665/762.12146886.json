Herrera-Villarreal first contends the district court clearly erred by not applying a mitigating-role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Second, he asserts his sentence was proeedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and failed to explain its sentence sufficiently for appellate review. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-14\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b781-15\">\n<em>A. Mitigating-role reduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b781-16\">Under the Guidelines, a defendant may receive a reduction for having a limited role in the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. The defendant may receive a four-level reduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>tion if he was a minimal participant, a two-level reduction if he was a minor participant, or a three-level reduction if he was somewhere between a minimal and minor participant. <em>Id. </em>The adjustment applies to defendants that are \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)). The determination of whether to apply a mitigating-role adjustment \u201cis heavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(C)). On November 1, 2015, an amendment to the application notes of \u00a7 3B1.2 took effect, adding the following language to note 3(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-4\">In determining whether to apply subsection (a) or (b), or an intermediate adjustment, the court should consider the following non-exhaustive list of factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-5\">(i) the degree to which the defendant understood the scope and structure of the criminal activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-6\">(ii) the degree to which the defendant participated in planning or organizing the criminal activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">(iii) the degree to which the defendant exercised decision-making authority or influenced the exercise of decision-making authority;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-8\">(iv) the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s participation in the commission of the criminal activity, including the acts the defendant performed and the responsibility and discretion the defendant had in performing those acts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-9\">(v) the degree to which the defendant stood to benefit from the criminal activity-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-10\">For example, a defendant who does not have a proprietary interest in the criminal activity and who is simply being paid to perform certain tasks should be considered for an adjustment under this guideline.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-11\">The fact that a defendant performs an essential or indispensable role in the criminal activity is not determinative. Such a defendant may receive an adjustment under this guideline if he or she is substantially less culpable than the average participant in the criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">U.S.S.G. Supp. App. C., Amend. 794. Because this is a clarifying amendment to the Guidelines, it applies retroactively. <em>United States v. Cruickshank, </em>837 F.3d 1182, 1193-94 (11th Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-14\">The district court did not clearly err in denying Herrerar-Villarreal a mitigating role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. In determining whether a mitigating-role adjustment applies, the district court should consider two principles: first, \u201cthe district court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against [his] relevant conduct\u201d and second, \u201cwhere the record evidence is sufficient, the district court may also measure the defendant\u2019s conduct against that of other participants in the criminal scheme attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>See United States v. De Varon, 175 </em>F.3d 930, 934 (11th Cir. 1999) <em>(en banc). </em>Herrera-Villarreal was sentenced based on the offense conduct of transporting 1,227 kilograms of cocaine as a crewmem-ber aboard a vessel. Because his offense level was calculated using only the amount of drugs found on the boat on which he served, he did not have a minor role compared to his relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 940-41 (explaining the district court must \u201cmeasure the defendant\u2019s role\u201d against all of the relevant conduct that was attributed to him, as \u201csome defendants may be held accountable for conduct that is much broader than their specific acts,\u201d such as in a conspiracy). Rather, Herrera-Villarreal\u2019s actual conduct was identical to the relevant conduct attributable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-15\">Further, Herrera-Villarreal presented no evidence to demonstrate that he was less culpable than the other crewmembers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>who were the only other identifiable participants in his relevant conduct. <em>See id. </em>at 944 (explaining under the second principle, the district court must \u201cmeasure the defendant\u2019s culpability in comparison to that of other participants in the relevant conduct,\u201d to the extent they can be identified or discerned from the evidence). In fact, at his sentencing hearing, Herrera-Villarreal proffered- that he was a mechanic aboard the ship, which arguably made him more culpable than other crewmembers who may have had positions of less responsibility in the enterprise. Ultimately, Herrera-Villarreal had the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that he deserved a mitigating role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Alvarez-Coria, </em>447 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir. 2006) (explaining the defendant bears the burden of establishing his qualification for a minor role reduction by a preponderance of the evidence). There is nothing in the record to show that Herrera-Villarreal met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">The district court correctly concluded the November 2015 amendment to note 3(c) did not change the fact the essential inquiry is whether the defendant was less culpable than the average participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)). The district court did not clearly err in determining Herrera-Villarreal was not entitled to a minor role reduction in light of the amendment. Even considering the new factors added to the application notes, Herrera-Villarreal has not presented any evidence that (1) his actual conduct was less substantial than the conduct attributable to him, or (2) he was less culpable than the other crewmembers. He is not entitled to the adjustment even when applying the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">\n<em>B. Procedural reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">We ensure the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as improperly calculating the guideline range, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or inadequately explaining the chosen sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cAlthough the district court must provide some explanation for the sentence, nothing ... requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7' 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Herrera-Villarreal\u2019s sentence is not procedurally unreasonable, and the district court did not commit any procedural error, plain or otherwise. The district court expressly stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, then specifically addressed and explained its reasoning regarding certain \u00a7 3553(a) factors such as the background and characteristics of the defendant, and the seriousness of the offense. Thus, the district court did not commit a procedural error by failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or inadequately explaining the sentence it imposed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">We affirm Herrera-Villarreal\u2019s 135-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-8\">. We review the district court's factual finding of the defendant\u2019s role for clear error. <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1200 (11th Cir, 2011). When a defendant does not make a procedural reasonableness objection at the time of his sentencing, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Vandergrift, </em>754 F.3d 1303, 1307 (11th Cir. 2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
