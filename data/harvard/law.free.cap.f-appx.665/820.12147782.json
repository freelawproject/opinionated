After careful review, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-16\">In 2011, Levy and several co-defendants were indicted based on a bank fraud scheme. Levy was indicted for: (1) one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349 (\u201cCount One\u201d); (2) six counts of fraud with identification documents in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 1028A(a)(l); and (3) five counts of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 1344.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-17\">Levy pleaded guilty to Count One pursuant to a written plea agreement. His plea agreement contained a section stipulating that the effect of his conviction on his immigration status was uncertain, but that deportation was \u201cpresumptively mandatory.\u201d This section affirmed that Levy \u201cwant[ed] to plead guilty\u201d even if it resulted in his \u201cautomatic removal.\u201d The agreement also contained an appeal waiver allowing him to appeal only if the government did so or if the district court imposed an upward departure from his sentencing guidelines range. At the bottom of the agreement was an acknowledgment, signed by Levy indicating he had carefully reviewed the agreement with defense counsel and understood its terms and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>At his change-of-plea hearing, Levy said (under oath) that he understood the plea agreement and the acknowledgment. The court asked Levy if he had discussed the immigration consequences of his plea with defense counsel, and he responded that he had not spoken with an immigration lawyer but had discussed the issue briefly with defense counsel. Counsel then stated that he told Levy there were \u201cpossible immigration consequences\u201d and had advised him to consult with a specialist because \u201cone day that will become an issue.\u201d The court inquired further, and counsel confirmed he had advised Levy \u201cthat he may face deportation.\u201d The court then took a short recess to give Levy and defense counsel more time to discuss the immigration consequences of Levy\u2019s guilty plea. After the break, Levy confirmed that he had been given sufficient time to discuss the immigration issues with defense counsel and said he still wanted to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">At Levy\u2019s sentencing hearing, defense counsel requested probation in lieu of imprisonment. The court denied this request and sentenced Levy to twenty months in prison, which was below his sentencing guidelines range. The court also ordered him to pay over $200,000 in restitution. Immediately after this hearing, Levy and defense counsel had a brief conversation. Counsel later testified that during this conversation, he told Levy there was no basis to appeal the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Levy then brought this \u00a7 2255 action. He alleged that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel in three ways: (1) counsel explained the elements of the wrong crime to Levy; (2) counsel failed to adequately advise Levy regarding the immigration consequences of Levy\u2019s guilty plea; and (3) counsel failed to file an appeal despite Levy\u2019s instructions to do so. A Magistrate Judge ordered an evidentiary hearing for the third ground only. At this evidentiary hearing, Levy testified that during their brief conversation immediately after the sentencing hearing, he told defense counsel he wanted to appeal his sentence because he was not happy with the amount of restitution he had been ordered to pay. On the other hand, defense counsel testified that when he told Levy he believed there was no basis to appeal, Levy responded not by asking him to appeal, but rather by shrugging and saying \u201cokay.\u201d Further, counsel testified that Levy sent him an email two months after the sentencing hearing asking when and how Levy would pay the restitution, and even in that email, Levy did not ask him to appeal anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">In January 2015, the Magistrate Judge issued a report and recommendation denying Levy relief on all three grounds. As relevant to this appeal, the Magistrate Judge ruled that defense counsel provided constitutionally adequate advice about the immigration consequences of Levy\u2019s guilty plea and in any case, Levy could not show he was prejudiced because his plea agreement said he wanted to plead guilty even if the consequence was automatic removal. The Magistrate Judge also found Levy\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing was not credible because of a number of inconsistencies with earlier testimony. Thus, the Magistrate Judge credited defense counsel\u2019s testimony that Levy did not ask him to file an appeal and did not reasonably demonstrate an interest in appealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Over Levy\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation. In its order, the district court highlighted the inconsistencies in Levy\u2019s testimony as \u201cmore than minor\u201d and noted the \u201crecord of inconsistencies is further weighted\u201d by the fact that the Magistrate Judge made her credibility determinations after personally observing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>Levy and defense counsel at the evidentia-ry hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Levy makes two arguments on appeal. First, he argues the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether defense counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately advise him of the immigration consequences of pleading guilty. Levy acknowledges that the record reflects defense counsel told him he might be deported as a result of his plea. However, he asserts this advice was deficient because it failed to make clear he would face automatic deportation if he could not establish citizenship through a family member. Further, Levy argues he would have refused the plea deal\u2014and would have been willing to risk longer incarceration\u2014if he had been told his ability to remain in the United States rested entirely upon this citizenship claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding for abuse of discretion. Winthrop-Redin v. United States, 767 F.3d 1210, 1215 (11th Cir. 2014). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it applies an incorrect legal standard, applies the law in an unreasonable or incorrect manner, follows improper procedures in making a determination, or makes findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">In order to get an evidentiary hearing, a \u00a7 2255 petitioner need only allege, not prove, \u201creasonably specific, non-conclusory facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief.\u201d Id at 1216 (quotation omitted). However, the district court does not need to grant a hearing if the petitioner\u2019s allegations are \u201cpatently frivolous, based upon unsupported generalizations, or affirmatively contradicted by the record.\u201d Id. (quotations omitted). Put another way, the district court must grant an evidentiary hearing \u201c[ujnless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the petitioner is entitled to no relief.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">To secure relief on the theory that defense counsel\u2019s constitutionally deficient advice induced a guilty plea, a petitioner must show that the advice \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 57, 106 S.Ct. 366, 369, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985) (quotation omitted), and that \u201cthe outcome of the plea process would have been different with competent advice.\u201d Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 156, 132 S.Ct. 1376, 1384, 182 L.Ed.2d 398 (2012). In other words, the petitioner must show not only that defense counsel committed professional error, but also a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the petitioner would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. See Premo v. Moore, 562 U.S. 115, 131-32, 131 S.Ct. 733, 745, 178 L.Ed.2d 649 (2011). So when a \u00a7 2255 petitioner seeks relief under this theory, the district court may deny the petitioner an evidentiary hearing if his \u00a7 2255 motion or the record conclusively shows he cannot meet his burden under one of these two prongs. See Winthrop-Redin, 767 F.3d at 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">In this case, the record conclusively shows that Levy cannot meet his burden under the second prong. He cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for defense counsel\u2019s erroneous immigration advice, he would have insisted on going to trial. Levy\u2019s plea agreement specifically included a section stating: (1) removal was presumptively mandatory because he was pleading guilty to the offense; (2) he understood that neither his attorney nor the district court could predict the effect of his plea on his immigration status; and (3) he wanted to plead guilty even if it resulted in his automatic removal from the Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>ed States. Further, Levy signed an ac-knowledgement at the end of the plea agreement stating that he had read and carefully reviewed every part of the agreement with defense counsel and understood its terms and conditions. Finally, at his change-of-plea hearing, Levy said under oath that he understood the plea agreement and the acknowledgment. Because he stated in a signed plea agreement that he wanted to plead guilty even if the consequence was automatic removal, Levy cannot demonstrate he would have refused to plead guilty if counsel had told him he could face automatic removal. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Levy\u2019s claim regarding defense counsel\u2019s immigration advice without granting Levy an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Levy\u2019s second argument has two parts! First, he argues the district court clearly erred in finding he did not ask defense counsel to appeal. Second, he asserts the district court erred in ruling defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to adequately consult him about filing an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">In a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo. Devine v. United States, 520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir. 2008). Whether counsel was ineffective is a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo. Id. \u201cWe allot substantial deference to the factfinder in reaching credibility determinations with respect to witness testimony,\u201d so we review credibility determinations for clear error only. Id. (quotation and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">In judging whether a lawyer\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient, we apply the two-prong test established by Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). First, we must determine whether the lawyer\u2019s performance was reasonable under prevailing professional norms. Id. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. The petitioner must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his counsel\u2019s performance was unreasonable. Putman v. Head, 268 F.3d 1223, 1243 (11th Cir. 2001). Second, we must determine whether the lawyer\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial. In order to satisfy the prejudice prong, the petitioner \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Id. We must consider the totality of the evidence before the factfinder in making this prejudice determination. See id. at 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">The Strickland test applies to claims of ineffective assistance based on counsel\u2019s failure to file an appeal. Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 476-77, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 1034, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). Counsel acts in a constitutionally unreasonable manner when he \u201cdisregards specific instructions from [a] defendant to file a notice of appeal.\u201d Id. at 477, 120 S.Ct. at 1035. When this happens, we presume the defendant was prejudiced even if he signed an appeal waiver as part of his plea agreement. Gomez-Diaz v. United States, 433 F.3d 788, 790 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">Even when a defendant does not give specific instructions to appeal, his attorney has a constitutional duty to consult with him about an appeal if (1) \u201ca rational defendant would want to appeal,\u201d or (2) the \u201cparticular defendant reasonably demonstrated to counsel that he was interested in appealing.\u201d Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 480, 120 S.Ct. at 1036. In determining whether a lawyer had a duty to consult his client about an appeal, we \u201cmust take into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>account all the information counsel knew or should have known.\u201d Id, Further, one \u201chighly relevant factor\u201d is whether the defendant pleaded guilty, \u201cboth because a guilty plea reduces the scope of potentially appealable issues and because such a plea may indicate that the defendant seeks an end to judicial proceedings.\u201d Id</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">With regard to Levy\u2019s claim that the district court clearly erred in finding he never asked defense counsel to appeal, we conclude to the contrary. The district court determined that Levy lacked credibility based on multiple \u201cmore than minor\u201d inconsistencies between his evidentiary-hearing testimony before the Magistrate Judge and his earlier testimony. In contrast, there did not appear to be any inconsistencies in defense counsel\u2019s testimony. In light of the substantial deference we give to factfinders on issues of witness credibility, we cannot say the district court clearly erred in crediting defense counsel\u2019s testimony that Levy never gave him specific instructions to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Further, Levy\u2019s argument that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately consult him about an appeal fails because Levy cannot show defense counsel was under a duty to consult. First, he has not demonstrated that a rational defendant in his position would have wanted to appeal. Levy signed a plea agreement containing an appeal waiver, which allowed him to appeal only if the government did so or if the district court imposed an upward departure from his sentencing guidelines range. Because neither of these things happened, a rational defendant in Levy\u2019s shoes would not have sought to appeal. See Otero v. United States, 499 F.3d 1267, 1271 (11th Cir. 2007) (per cu-riam) (\u201c[0]n account of the plea agreement\u2019s broad appeal waiver, any appeal taken by Otero would have been frivolous and would have been an appeal that no rational defendant would have taken.\u201d). Levy also received a prison sentence below his guideline range and favorable plea agreement in which the government agreed not to prosecute him on eleven counts. Thus, Levy failed to show that a rational defendant would have wanted to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Second, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Levy did not reasonably demonstrate an interest in appealing his sentence. Once again, in light of the contrast between Levy\u2019s testimony at his \u00a7 2255 hearing and his testimony at the time he entered his plea, the district court found Levy\u2019s later testimony was not credible. The district court therefore accepted defense counsel\u2019s testimony that Levy responded to counsel\u2019s advice that there were no issues to appeal by saying \u201cokay\u201d and shrugging his shoulders, and that Levy never led counsel to believe Levy wanted to appeal. On appeal, Levy argues he was clearly upset by his sentence and was concerned about its effect on his immigration status. Even accepting these allegations as true, they are not enough to show the district court\u2019s finding, and the credibility determinations upon which it was based, were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
