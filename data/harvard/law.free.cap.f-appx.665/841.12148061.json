Tucker\u2019s appeal from a decision of the bankruptcy court for failure to timely file her initial brief. Tucker appealed to the district court for review of two related decisions of the bankruptcy court in Tucker\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a). These decisions granted Defendant-Appellee JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A.\u2019s (\u201cChase\u201d) motion to lift the automatic stay, <em>see </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362, for the limited purpose of allowing Chase to proceed with a foreclosure action against Tucker in Florida state court, and denied Tucker\u2019s motion to vacate the order lifting the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">After filing her notices of appeal, Tucker timely filed with the bankruptcy clerk a designation of the record on appeal and a statement of the issues to be presented, as required by Rule 8009(a)(1), Fed. R. Bankr. P. Chase filed its own designation two weeks later. The bankruptcy clerk then forwarded the completed record to the district court, in compliance with Rule 8010(b), Fed. R. Bankr. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">On November 6, 2015, the district clerk docketed notice of the transmittal of the bankruptcy record. The docket entry explained the. briefing schedule and, in pertinent part, stated that Tucker had thirty days from the docketing of the notice to serve and file her initial brief. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8018(a)(1) (providing that the appellant\u2019s brief is due within thirty days \u201cafter the docketing of notice that the record has been transmitted or is available electronically\u201d). So Tucker\u2019s initial brief was due on or before December 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">On November 16, Tucker filed a \u201cMotion for Stay Pending Appeal or in the Alternative, an Order Granting a Supersedeas Bond and Resetting Briefing Schedule.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>Tucker\u2019s motion challenged Chase\u2019s standing to obtain stay relief and, in turn, the bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction to grant Chase such relief. Tucker did not argue her request for resetting the briefing schedule. The district court denied Tucker\u2019s motion on November 23, stating, \u201cThe Court is not inclined to grant the requested or alternatively requested relief and expects counsel to comply with all deadlines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">On December 7, the date her brief was due, Tucker filed a motion requesting an extension of thirty days to file her initial brief. Tucker asked for an extension in light of the following: (1) the bankruptcy court had not yet ruled on her motion to strike a document from the record; (2) she was not a lawyer and was representing herself in several other pending matters, including three other lawsuits; (3) she needed time to research applicable law and to review the underlying record; and (4) the holiday season was approaching. Also, Tucker asked the court to clarify whether its previous order, which was directed to \u201ccounsel,\u201d applied to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">On December 11, the district court, having \u201cconsidered the motions, the pertinent portions of the record, and being fully advised in the premises,\u201d denied Tucker\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file her initial brief. The court did not explain its decision any further. Five days later, the district court dismissed Tucker\u2019s appeal because, despite the court\u2019s admonishment that it \u201cexpected the parties to comply with all deadlines,\u201d her brief had not been timely filed. This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s dismissal of a bankruptcy appeal for failure to prosecute. <em>See Pyramid Mobile Homes, Inc. v. Speake (In re Pyramid Mobile Homes, Inc.), </em>531 F.2d 743, 746 (5th Cir. 1976) (affirming district court\u2019s dismissal of bankruptcy appeal pursuant to former Bankruptcy Rule 801).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a request for an extension of a filing deadline for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Young v. City of Palm Bay, Fla., </em>358 F.3d 859, 863 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">The abuse-of-discretion standard is deferential and affords a range of choice to the district court. <em>Heffner v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Ala., Inc., </em>443 F.3d 1330, 1337 (11th Cir. 2006). Nevertheless, an abuse of discretion occurs if the court does not apply the proper legal standard, does not follow proper procedures in making the determination, or relies on clearly erroneous factual findings. <em>Id. </em>In cases where the district court applies an improper standard, remand for application of the correct standard is often appropriate where the decision to be made is not \u201cone devoid of any room for the exercise of discretionary judgment.\u201d <em>Advanced Estimating Sys. Inc. v. Riney, </em>77 F.3d 1322, 1325 (11th Cir. 1996) (remanding for application of the correct \u201cexcusable- neglect\u201d standard because \u201cthe district court will often have some range of choice in deciding excusable neglect issues\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">In a bankruptcy appeal to the district court, the appellant has thirty days to file a brief \u201cafter the docketing of notice that the record has been transmitted or is available electronically.\u201d Fed. R. Bankr, P. 8018(a)(1). \u201c[I]n its discretion,\u201d .the district court may extend this time \u201cfor cause shown\u201d either (1) with or without motion before the time to act has expired, or (2) on motion made after the time to act has expired \u201cwhere the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.\u201d Fed. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>Bankr. P. 9006(b)(1); <em>see Rosenberg v. DVI Receivables XIV, LLC, </em>818 F.3d 1283, 1287-89 (11th Cir. 2016) (explaining that the bankruptcy rules apply to cases in both the bankruptcy and district courts). If the appellant fails to file a brief on time or within an extended time authorized by the district court, the court may dismiss the appeal, either on motion of the appellee or on the court\u2019s own motion after providing notice to the appellant. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8018(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">In general, dismissal for failure to prosecute an appeal \u201cis discretionary and should be considered in light of the prejudicial effect of delay on the appellee and the bona tides of the appellant.\u201d <em>In re Pyramid Mobile Homes, Inc., </em>531 F.2d at 746. Rule \u2019 8018(a)(4) authorizes dismissal for failure to file a brief on time, but we have concluded that \u201croutine dismissal for failure to timely file briefs\u201d is not appropriate. <em>Brake v. Tavormina (In re Beverly Mfg. Corp.), </em>778 F.2d 666, 667 (11th Cir. 1985) (rejecting the appellee\u2019s position that this Court adopt a \u201cstringent rule <em>of </em>dismissal for failure to timely file briefs\u201d). Rather, \u201cdismissal is proper only when bad faith, negligence or indifference has been shown.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">We adopted this \u201cflexible standard\u201d\u2014 requiring bad faith, negligence, or indifference for dismissal\u2014in <em>In re Beverly Manufacturing Corp. </em>for two main reasons. First, it was consistent with our approach in non-bankruptcy litigation, where we had held that the failure to timely file briefs \u201cis merely a \u2018non-jurisdictional defect in the prosecution of [an] appeal,\u2019 and such defect does not require dismissal in every case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Marcaida v. Rascoe, </em>569 F.2d 828, 830 (5th Cir. 1978) (\u201c[T]he late filing of briefs is at most (a) non-jurisdictional (defect) in the prosecution of (t)his appeal, which we consider insufficient to warrant dismissal.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Second, we found that the flexible standard better serves the policy underlying the rule requiring timely filing of briefs, which is simply \u201cto encourage swift prosecution of appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cDismissal typically occurs in cases showing consistently dilatory conduct or the complete failure to take any steps other than the mere filing of a notice of appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667; <em>In re Pyramid Mobile Homes, Inc., </em>531 F.2d at 745-46 (concluding that dismissal was appropriate where the appellant made \u201cno effort to comply with the Rules\u201d for over four months after filing its appeal). But a slight lack of diligence on the part of the appellant may not be sufficient to warrant dismissal. <em>See In re Pyramid Mobile Homes, Inc., </em>531 F.2d at 746 (finding that the appellant\u2019s conduct \u201ccrossed the line from lack of diligence to obstinately dilatory conduct\u201d); <em>see also In re Beverly Mfg. Corp., </em>778 F.2d at 667 (remanding where the \u201cappellant took all steps necessary for prosecution of the appeal except that of filing the brief,\u201d and where the appellant offered a reasonable explanation for why he failed to inquire of the status of his case for seven months).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">Here, the district court abused its discretion by applying an incorrect standard. <em>See Heffner, </em>443 F.3d at 1337. The dismissal order reflects application of a \u201cstringent rule of dismissal for failure to timely file briefs\u201d that is inconsistent with the \u201cflexible standard\u201d we adopted in <em>In re Beverly Manufacturing Corp. </em>The simple fact that Tucker failed to file a single brief on tim\u00e9 is insufficient to support a dismissal. Rather, \u201cdismissal is proper only when bad faith, negligence or indifference has been shown.\u201d <em>In re Beverly Mfg. Corp., </em>778 F.2d at 667. The court did not expressly find that any of these grounds had been shown. Nor did the court otherwise evalu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>ate Tucker\u2019s reasons for seeking an extension of time or the prejudice to Chase. <em>See Pyramid Mobile Homes, Inc., </em>531 F.2d at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Although the district court noted that Tucker had failed to heed its warning that it expected her to comply with all deadlines, we cannot conclude that the court implicitly found that Tucker had shown bad faith, negligence, or indifference, as contemplated in <em>In re Beverly Manufacturing Corp. </em>And significantly, the court\u2019s order did not provide clear notice that the court would dismiss her appeal if she failed to file her brief by the original deadline. So Tucker\u2019s request for an extension does not appear to be in blatant disregard of the court\u2019s warning. In addition,. Tucker\u2019s filing of a motion for an extension of time to file her brief, as provided in Rule 9006(b)(1), Fed. R. Bankr. P., before the expiration of the deadline can itself be construed as an attempt to comply with the relevant deadlines. Plus, the court\u2019s failure to provide clear notice of its intent to dismiss if Tucker failed to timely file her brief raises a question of whether the court complied with Rule 8018(a)(4)\u2019s requirement that any dismissal on the court\u2019s own motion occur \u201cafter notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Accordingly, we vacate the judgment dismissing Tucker\u2019s appeal and we remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A3YS\">.
