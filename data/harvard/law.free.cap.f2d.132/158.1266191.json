It appears that prior to appellant\u2019s use of the mark \u201cVistand\u201d applied to a vise stand integral with a vise (denominated by it as No. \u201c833b\u201d) it applied the words \u201cvise stand\u201d to a like stand having the same number \u201c833b.\u201d It also appears that appellee and other manufacturers described in their catalogues similar articles as \u201cvise stands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-27\">It is our opinion that the use of the mark \u201cVistand\u201d by appellant is a misspelling of the words \u201cvise stand\u201d and that appellant\u2019s mark is merely descriptive \u2018 of the goods to which the mark is applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-28\">We are fully in accord with the following statement of the commissioner in his-decision: \u201cIn my opinion the mark \u2018Vistand\u2019 when applied to a vise stand would be apt to be pronounced the same as the name \u2018vise stand\u2019, and the similarity between the single word \u2018Vistand\u2019 and the two words \u2018vise stand\u2019 in sound and in appearance is so close that \u2018Vistand\u2019 and \u2018vise stand\u2019 mean the same thing, to wit, a vise stand; and the word \u2018Vistand\u2019 should be considered to be, in effect, merely the generic name of such article and merely descriptive thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-30\">Inasmuch as appellee used the words \u201cvise stand\u201d as describing goods similar to those to which appellant applied the mark \u201cVistand\u201d it was not necessary for appellee to prove actual damage to it by appellant\u2019s registration. In such circumstances damage will be presumed. United Shoe Machinery Corporation v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Compo Shoe Machinery Corporation et al., 56 F.2d 292, 19 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1009; Model Brassiere Co., Inc. v. Bromley-Shepard Co., Inc., 49 F.2d 482, 18 C.C.P. A., Patents, 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">It appears that on January 8, 1940, appellee filed an application for the registration of the mark \u201cTristand\u201d as applied to \u201cvise benches,\u201d and that appellant filed notice of opposition thereto, alleging that said mark \u201cTristand\u201d is confusingly similar to its mark \u201cVistand\u201d here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In view of our conclusion as to the descriptiveness of appellant\u2019s mark and appellee\u2019s use of the words \u201cvise stand\u201d to describe its product, it is not necessary here to discuss said opposition proceeding other than to say that the question of whether appellee\u2019s mark \u201cTristand\u201d is descriptive may not be determined by us in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">For the reasons herein stated the decision of the commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
