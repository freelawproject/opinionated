Ward\u2019s mark consists of the term \u201cAirline\u201d disposed across a diagonal zig-zag line representing lightning flashes and combined with a base line. It was registered in that form in 1927. Ordinarily, the mark is used without employing the zig-zag line.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-28\">The opposition is based solely upon the. \u201cconfusion in trade\u201d clause of section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of 1905, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-29\">The Examiner of Interferences held that there was sufficient dissimilarity between the marks to justify the conclusion that there was no reasonable likelihood of confusion resulting from the concurrent use of the marks. He dismissed the opposition and adjudged that the applicant was entitled to the registration applied for. Upon appeal, the Commissioner of Patents adopted the same view as that of the Examiner of Interferences and affirmed his decision. From the decision of the Commissioner, Ward has here appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-30\">That the goods of both parties are of the same descriptive properties, identical in character, and that Ward\u2019s use of its mark precedes Spiegel\u2019s use of its mark is not questioned. The sole issue presented is: Does there exist such similarity be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>tween the marks as to be likely to cause confusion in trade?</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Much testimony was taken by both parties, but in view of the admitted facts, only a little of it needs consideration here in deciding the particular issue with which we are confronted. The testimony goes to the question of how the marks of both parties are used, the character of goods upon which they are used, the volume of business, the territory in which the goods are sold, and the kind of business conducted by both parties. Both parties are mail-order houses. Ward also sells its goods in many retail stores throughout the United States and in foreign countries. Spiegel confines its activities to mail-order credit business and does a large volume of business throughout the United States in small towns and rural territories.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Spiegel\u2019s testimony shows several instances where Spiegel was charged with having encroached upon trade-marks owned by Ward, and upon being promptly notified to desist from such use, did so without necessitating litigation. Presumably, this character of testimony was intended to reflect the idea that Spiegel adopted its instant trade-mark in absolute good faith. Spiegel admits, however, that in adopting the mark \u201cAir Castle\u201d it knew of the extensive use and popularity of Ward\u2019s mark \u201cAirline,\u201d but it alleges that Ward voiced no objection to the use of the mark \u201cAir Castle\u201d for a period of approximately five years from 1934, when Spiegel first began using it, until 1939, when Spiegel applied for registration of the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The instant controversy illustrates the difficulties that confront tradesmen when they adopt a mark, all or a part of which consists of a word or words which others may wish to use in describing their goods. It is argued by Spiegel that \u201cair\u201d is descriptive; that in speaking of radios and broadcasting, the word \u201cair\u201d is almost constantly used; and that \u201cair line\u201d is a term found in the dictionary (citing Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, wherein \u201cair line\u201d is defined as \u201cA straight line, as through the air; a bee line\u201d). Spiegel further argues, in substance, that under such circumstances no one dealing in goods similar to those of the parties here involved has the right to monopolize the word \u201cair,\u201d which is so closely identified with the merchandise sold. Spiegel urges that in choosing the mark \u201cAir Castle\u201d it has succeeded in getting as far away from Ward\u2019s mark as is possible without abandoning the word \u201cair.\u201d This, it contends, is true because the common meaning of the term \u201cair castle\u201d has no relation to the air traversed by radio waves, \u201cair castle\u201d being defined in the dictionary as a \u201cdaydream.\u201d Spiegel states that in adopting said mark it intended that the term \u201cAir Castle,\u201d with the picture of the castle behind, should convey to the radio-buying public the excellence of its products and to conjure up a \u201csort of a dreamy idea\u201d that one \u201ccould get enthused over\u201d \u2014 such as the idea that \u201ca man\u2019s home is his castle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">To the foregoing argument of Spiegel, Ward replies that in the two marks the letters A, I, and R are the dominant portion ; that the last letter of the words \u201cline\u201d and \u201ccastle\u201d is E; and that under certain decisions of this court where the dominant portion of marks somewhat similar to those involved here were adopted by newcomers it has been held, and properly so, that the likelihood of confusion would exist. Ward points out that in Spiegel\u2019s catalogues, Spiegel\u2019s merchandise is described as \u201cAir Castle\u201d products, quite often without reference to any picture of a castle or any emphasis on the word \u201ccastle.\u201d Ward states that it has successfully brought about discontinuance of the use of several marks upon the kind of goods with which we are here concerned, such marks being \u201cAir Master,\" \u201cAirguide,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Spiegel argues that the word \u201ccastle\u201d and the picture of the castle form the dominant portion of its mark; that the word \u201cair\u201d could not be the dominant portion of both marks for the reason that it \u201cdoes not indicate to purchasers the origin of goods.\u201d It cites this court\u2019s decision in Langendorf United Bakeries, Inc. v. General Foods Corporation, 125 F.2d 159, 29 C.C.P.A., Patents, 831. See also American Brewing Co., Inc. v. Delatour Beverage Corporation, 100 F.2d 253, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents, 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">No case in all that have been cited to us is exactly on all fours with the instant one, and we have not discovered any such case ourselves. As we view the present situation, however, it seems to us that the decision must turn partly upon the difference in appearance and sound between the two marks, but more especially upon the difference in meaning which must be attributed to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">We have hereinbefore set out the definitions of \u201cair line\u201d and \u201cair castle.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>\u201cAir castle\u201d seems to us to be an arbitrary-selection which is suggestive of what might be brought about by the use of the \u201cAir Castle\u201d radio. This connotation is wholly different from any suggestion or meaning that might be attributed to the term \u201cair line.\u201d Therefore, unless Ward is to be given a monopoly upon the word \u201cair\u201d it would seem that Spiegel, although having knowledge of the \u201cAirline\u201d trade-mark at the time of adopting its mark, has avoided the reasonable possibility of confusion in trade by choosing the term \u201cair castle,\u201d which imports such a radically different meaning from that of \u201cair line.\u201d Thus, it does not seem likely that anyone, being familiar with the well-known and favorably considered \u201cAirline\u201d products and desiring to purchase \u201cAirline\u201d merchandise, would be confused by the name \u201cAir Castle\u201d and mistakenly accept \u201cAir Castle\u201d goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">By the foregoing holding that there is no confusing similarity between the \u201cAirline\u201d and \u201cAir Castle\u201d marks, we do not mean to imply that any newcomer would be privileged to register a trademark using the word \u201cair,\u201d unless the mark as a whole were of such character as to eliminate the probability of confusion in trade. In the Langendorf case, supra, where the trade-marks \u201cWheato-Nuts\u201d and \u201cGrape-Nuts\u201d were involved, this court said [125 F.2d 161]: \u201c * * * but to avoid conflict with appellee\u2019s mark the word 'nuts\u2019 must be used in such association as will clearly avoid confusion in the mind of the purchasing public as to the origin of the goods. Appellant\u2019s mark, in our opinion, does not accomplish this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Ward has cited the decision of the Commissioner of Patents in B. F. Goodrich Co. v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 2 U.S.P.Q. 316. That case involved the marks \u201cAirline,\u201d on the one hand, and \u201cAirway,\u201d on the other, for automobile tires. It was there held that the terms were deceptively similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">It will not be necessary for us to discuss all the cases cited, since in this case we are in very much the same position as we were in the Langendorf case, supra, where we said: \u201cEach of the parties in its brief has cited a large number of cases in support of its respective contention. Many of such decisions are of very little value because they depend upon the facts of the particular cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The Goodrich Company case, supra, is illustrative of the decisions relied upon by Ward. The marks \u201cAirline\u201d and \u201cAirway\u201d used in connection with automobile tires were not only similar in appearance but somewhat similar in sound and quite similar in meaning. In the instant case there is dissimilarity in appearance, sound, and meaning. The situation here is easily distinguishable from the situations prevailing in the instances referred to by Ward in connection with the marks \u201cAirway,\u201d \u201cAir Master,\u201d and \u201cAirguide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">In view of the foregoing considerations, we think the Commissioner of Patents was right when he said: \u201cI cannot agree with appellant\u2019s contention, but instead agree with the examiner in considering the marks, when weighed in their entireties, so different in appearance, sound and ordinary meaning that no confusion between the marks or deception of purchasers would be likely as a result .of their concurrent use on radio receiving sets or the other identical goods with which they are used by the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">Accordingly, the commissioner\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
