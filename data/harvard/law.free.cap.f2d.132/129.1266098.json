The examiner -further held that appellant was entitled to the registration of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">Upon appeal, the Commissioner of Patents affirmed the decision of the examiner holding that opposer\u2019s notice of opposition should be dismissed, but reversed his decision holding that appellant was entitled to the registration applied for. In his decision the Commissioner stated \u201c * * * it is adjudged ex parte, that applicant is not entitled to the registration for which it has made application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-16\">Appellant has taken an appeal to this Court from said ex parte decision. The Drink-Mor Beverage Company took no appeal from the holding that its notice of opposition should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-17\">Upon the record before us the DrinkMor Beverage Company is not a party to this appeal other than in form. ' The controversy presented to us is solely between appellant and the Commissioner of Patents representing the public, and it should be treated in all respects as an ex parte case with the Solicitor for\u2019 the United States Patent Office appearing to represent the Commissioner of Patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-18\">It follows from the foregoing that the Drink-Mor Beverage Company is not entitled to make the motion here before us, or appear in any other respect as a party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-19\">Therefore the motion for diminution of the record is denied</p>\n<p id=\"b194-20\">Denied</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
