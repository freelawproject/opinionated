Both parties moved for summary judgment. The Court <em>(Dalianis, </em>J.) denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion and granted summary judgment in favor of Fitchburg, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">In August of 1987, the plaintiffs were the joint owners of a home located in Manchester for which they maintained a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy with Fitchburg. In August, 1987, the plaintiffs engaged in negotiations concerning the sale of their home. Although the parties dispute the exact sequence of events, they agree that at some point during the latter part of August, David Fisher signed two separate purchase and sale agreements for the same residential property, one with a Mr. and Mrs. Clayton and one with Martin and Barbara Arliss. Thereafter, the plaintiffs notified the Arlisses that they did not intend to convey the property to them and refused to perform under the Arlisses\u2019 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">In September 1987, the Arlisses brought a civil action against the plaintiffs claiming breach of contract and negligent and intentional misrepresentation. The Arlisses also filed a bill in equity against the plaintiffs in which they sought specific performance of the purchase and sale agreement and a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction to prevent the plaintiffs from conveying the property to any other party.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>On September 22, 1987, the plaintiffs notified Fitchburg of the Arlisses\u2019 claims against them, and tendered the defense of the case. Fitchburg returned the pleadings and refused to assume the defense or pay any judgment which might result from the litigation, asserting by letter that \u201c[t]he activities which led to this litigation would not be an \u2018occurrence\u2019 as defined in our policy.\u201d On February 5, 1988, the plaintiffs filed a petition requesting a declaratory judgment that Fitchburg was obligated to provide a defense and afford coverage for the plaintiffs\u2019 expenses in the pending lawsuits filed by the Arlisses. The plaintiffs settled the suits on May 18, 1988, at their own expense. On July 7, 1988, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment in the declaratory judgment action against Fitchburg, which objected and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment in its favor. After reviewing the claim against the Fishers, the court found that the Fishers\u2019 conduct was not accidental and that no coverable \u201cproperty damage\u201d resulted, denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion and granted Fitchburg\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This appeal ensued. The Fishers\u2019 homeowner\u2019s policy with Fitchburg states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\">\u201cThis Company agrees to pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage, to which this insurance applies, caused by an <em>occurrence. </em>This Company shall have the right and duty, at its own expense, to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or <em>property damage, </em>even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless, false or fraudulent, but may make such investigation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient. This Company shall not be obligated to pay any claim or judgment or to defend any suit after the applicable limit of this Company\u2019s liability has been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlement. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\"><em>\u2018property </em>damage\u2019: means injury to or destruction of tangible property, including loss of use thereof</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-7\"><em>\u2018occurrence\u2019: </em>means an accident, including injurious exposure to conditions, which results, during the policy term, in bodily injury or property damage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>On appeal the plaintiffs first argue that the court erred in finding that the Arlisses\u2019 suit, which contained a claim for unintentional negligent misrepresentation, did not allege an \u201coccurrence\u201d covered by the Fitchburg policy. Second, the plaintiffs argue that even if the actions alleged by the Arlisses in the underlying suits are deemed intentional, they are not inherently injurious or patently hazardous, and they should therefore still be viewed as an occurrence under the test set forth in <em>Vermont Mutual Insurance Co. v. Malcolm, </em>128 N.H. 521, 524, 517 A.2d 800, 802 (1986). Third, the plaintiffs argue that as equitable owners of the Manchester property, the Arlisses suffered a loss of use which constituted \u201cproperty damage\u201d under the terms of the policy. Fourth, the plaintiffs contend that Fitchburg failed to meet its burden of proof regarding the non-existence of the Arlisses\u2019 property rights. Finally, the plaintiffs argue that the following reasons were not included in Fitchburg\u2019s initial letter denying coverage, and that Fitchburg should therefore be estopped from claiming: (1) that the Arlisses\u2019 lawsuits do not allege property damage; (2) that any damage alleged was expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured; or (3) that any damage alleged involved property owned by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-3\">The terms of the Fitchburg policy require accidental bodily injury or property damage to constitute a covered \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy. Because \u201c[i]t is well-settled law in New Hampshire that an insurer\u2019s obligation to defend its insured is determined by whether the cause of action against the insured alleges sufficient facts in the pleadings to bring it within the express terms of the policy,\u201d <em>U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., Inc. v. Johnson Shoes, Inc., </em>123 N.H. 148, 151-52, 461 A.2d 85, 87 (1983), and because the parties agree that there was no bodily injury in this case, the relevant inquiry in this case is limited to whether the Arlisses\u2019 pleadings alleged \u201caccidental\u201d \u201cproperty damage.\u201d The defendant argues that the events alleged by the Arlisses in the pleadings of the underlying case constitute neither an accident nor property damage, as those terms are defined in the policy or in common practice. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">This court has construed the term \u201caccident,\u201d in the context of \u201coccurrence\u201d coverage under insurance policies with almost identical coverage language, to mean \u201can undesigned contingency, ... a happening by chance, something out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated, and not naturally to be expected.\u201d <em>Malcolm, supra </em>at 523, 517 A.2d at 802, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number><em>quoted in Jespersen v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>131 N.H. 257, 260, 551 A.2d 530, 532 (1988). To determine whether an injury is fortuitous or not, we apply this definition with reference to the insured. <em>Malcolm, supra </em>at 523, 517 A.2d at 802. An insured\u2019s intentional act can never be considered accidental \u201cunless some additional unexpected, independent and unforeseen [circumstances exist or] happening occurs which produces or brings about the result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, we assume that an insured\u2019s intentional act cannot be accidental when it is so inherently injurious that it cannot be performed without causing the resulting injury. <em>Malcolm, supra </em>at 524, 517 A.2d at 802. \u201cFrom this perspective, an injury is not the result of an accident, and therefore not the result of an occurrence for which there is coverage, if the insured either intended that his act cause injury or intentionally engaged in an act so inherently injurious that it was certain to result in injury.\u201d <em>Jespersen, supra </em>at 260, 551 A.2d at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The activity described in the pleadings of the underlying action cannot be described as \u201caccidental.\u201d David Fisher admits that he signed two purchase and sale agreements for the same residential property and thereafter refused to perform one of the two agreements. A reasonable person would foresee that entering into two contracts to sell the same property would inevitably lead to the breach of at least one of the two contracts. Furthermore, the plaintiffs\u2019 breach resulting in the Arlisses\u2019 contract actions was just the sort of \u201cinherently injurious\u201d activity contemplated in <em>Malcolm. See Malcolm, supra </em>at 524, 517 A.2d at 802. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the <em>Malcolm </em>standard for determining whether there was an intentional, inherently injurious act which cannot be considered \u201caccidental\u201d required that the activity involved must be akin to that of discharging a gun out an open window confuses the determination of an \u201caccidental occurrence\u201d which could not be considered accidental with the tort standard of strict liability for ultrahazardous activity. <em>See Moulton v. Groveton Papers Co., </em>112 N.H. 50, 53-54, 289 A.2d 68, 71-72 (1972) (describing but rejecting tort standard of strict liability for ultrahazardous activity). In the context of these facts and pleadings, we are not persuaded by the plaintiffs\u2019 additional argument that the negligent misrepresentation claim somehow converts the plaintiffs\u2019 actions into an accidental occurrence. <em>See Malcolm, supra </em>at 524, 517 A.2d at 803 (we will not view an insured\u2019s act in isolation in determining whether it was accidental). <em>But see First Newton Nat. Bank v. Gen. Cas. Co., </em>426 N.W.2d 618, 624-26 (Iowa 1988) (finding duty to defend negligent misrepresentation claim under \u201coccurrence\u201d policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>We also reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument regarding property damage. The only property damage alleged by the plaintiffs was to the Arlisses\u2019 inchoate property interests. The policy language clearly defines covered \u201cproperty damage\u201d as \u201cinjury to or destruction of tangible property, including loss of use thereof.\u201d Inchoate equitable interests in property are not \u201ctangible property,\u201d hence the court properly found that there has been no coverable \u201cproperty damage\u201d under the policy terms. <em>See In re Estate of Jesseman, </em>121 N.H. 313, 315, 429 A.2d 1036, 1037 (1981); <em>Neuman v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>271 Md. 636, 653-54, 319 A.2d 522, 531 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Finally, we deny the plaintiffs\u2019 estoppel claim because we find that all three of the arguments challenged by the plaintiffs follow from the contract interpretation of the term \u201coccurrence,\u201d which is what Fitchburg stated in its letter to the plaintiffs denying coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
