Roberts, was indicted by a Coos County Grand Jury for witness tampering, pursuant to RSA 641:5, 1(b), for telling his estranged wife that their twelve-year-old daughter would not be returned to her unless his wife agreed not to testify against him on a pending sexual assault charge. The defendant was convicted following a jury trial and sentenced by the Court (Morrill, J.). The defendant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">The defendant challenges his conviction on two grounds: (1) that the trial court erred in failing to suppress certain of his statements; and (2) that the trial court erred in excluding testimony by the defendant that he kept his daughter in Vermont in order to protect her from abuse by her mother. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-17\">On June 13, 1986, Elizabeth Roberts of Gorham, the defendant\u2019s estranged wife, reported to the Gorham Police Department that her twelve-year-old daughter, Angie, was missing. Earlier that day, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Angie Roberts had called her paternal uncle and had told him that she wanted to leave home and be with her father, who was living in Vermont. Angie was angry at her mother for punishing her and slapping her and for not allowing her to attend an overnight party at a friend\u2019s house. Angie and her uncle had agreed that they would meet later, and that he would take her to her father. As arranged, Angie met her uncle, and he drove her to the Vermont border, where she met the defendant. The defendant then drove her to a relative\u2019s home in Danville, Vermont.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">That evening the defendant called his wife. Mrs. Roberts told the defendant that Angie was missing and asked him if he had taken her. The defendant denied taking Angie and \u201cacted really shocked that she was missing.\u201d According to Mrs. Roberts\u2019 testimony, the defendant then told her that she should \u201cdrop the charges so he could come over and help look for [Angie].\u201d The defendant continued to call his wife every few minutes with the same request.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">On June 15, the defendant called his wife, and she told him that, she feared that Angie had been picked up hitchhiking. Mrs. Roberts testified that the defendant told her that perhaps she should search the woods \u201cbecause if somebody had picked her up, they might have thrown her body up there.\u201d The following day, according to both the testimony of the defendant and that of his wife, the defendant again called his wife and told her that he had heard from Angie, and that Angie had said that she was all right but that she would not return home until Mrs. Roberts dropped the pending sexual assault charge against the defendant. The defendant repeated this request several times over the course of the next few days.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">On June 21, 1986, Sergeant Gerald Marcou of the Gorham Police Department and New Hampshire State Police Trooper John Scarinza met in Vermont with Vermont State Police Trooper Van Dam to search for the girl. After visiting the homes of several of the defendant\u2019s relatives, they observed the defendant\u2019s vehicle parked in the driveway of his brother\u2019s house in Danville, Vermont. As Trooper Van Dam entered the house, the defendant ran out the back and into the woods. The defendant was pursued and apprehended and was taken back to the house, where he was arrested by Trooper Van Dam on an outstanding fugitive from justice warrant on a charge of witness tampering.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">In the kitchen of the defendant\u2019s brother\u2019s home, Trooper Van Dam advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and the defendant stated that he wished to call his attorney. The defendant tried to call his attorney three times but was unable to reach him. The police then advised the defendant that their purpose in being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>there was to locate his daughter, and that they had information that he had been in contact with her and that he knew where she was. Sergeant Marcou then asked the defendant if he, in fact, knew where she was located. The defendant responded that he \u201ccould get in contact with her,\u201d and that he \u201ccould get the girl back.\u201d At that point, the police explained to the defendant that he could either appear before a Vermont magistrate and face extradition on the witness tampering charge, or return voluntarily with the police to New Hampshire, where he would be re-arrested upon crossing the border. The defendant was also told that he could get out of the cruiser at any time while in Vermont. The defendant agreed to return to New Hampshire stating that he \u201cwant[ed] to get this matter cleared up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">As Sergeant Marcou, Trooper Scarinza, and the defendant were leaving the driveway in the police cruiser, or at some point shortly thereafter, the defendant \u201cstarted talking to [the two police officers].\u201d They told him not to make any statements, advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and asked if he understood them. The defendant indicated that he did. The defendant then stated that he \u201ccould get in contact with his daughter\u201d by calling a relative from a pay phone. During the return trip, while still in Vermont, the police stopped at a pay phone, and the defendant made a phone call to one of his relatives to arrange for his daughter\u2019s return.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">When the police crossed the border into New Hampshire, they arrested the defendant and again advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. They then drove the defendant to his lawyer\u2019s office in Lancaster, but his lawyer was unavailable. At some point during the trip, the defendant further stated that he \u201cknew how to get the girl back but didn\u2019t want to get the people that had her involved in trouble.\u201d The police then brought Roberts to the Gorham police station, where he made a few phone calls, and within two hours, his daughter appeared at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Before trial, the defendant sought to suppress \u201cany and all statements\u201d that he may have made to the police while in custody, and \u201call evidence obtained by the State pursuant to, following, or as a result of any investigation by the State following its receipt of his said statements.\u201d The Trial Court (Morrill, J.) denied the defendant\u2019s motion. In its order, the trial court discussed only the statements made by the defendant while in the police cruiser, and found \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that [because] the defendant was not being questioned and volunteered the statements . . . there was no violation of [the] defendant\u2019s rights under the Fifth Amendment and Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The defendant argues on appeal that the trial court erred in failing to suppress: (a) the defendant\u2019s initial statement, made in response to police interrogation conducted after the defendant had requested counsel, because it was elicited in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and his right to counsel under part I, article 15, and (b) the defendant\u2019s subsequent spontaneous statements, made while in the police cruiser, and evidence of his ensuing actions taken relative to those statements, <em>e.g., </em>telephoning his relative to arrange for the return of his daughter, because the police had failed to cure their initial violation by securing a waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel. Although the trial court made a separate finding that the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to counsel was not violated, the defendant raises no separate sixth amendment claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In analyzing the admissibility of the defendant\u2019s statements, we first address the defendant\u2019s claim under the State Constitution. <em>See State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231, 471 A.2d 347, 350 (1983). However, we decline <em>to </em>decide whether the defendant\u2019s initial statement was admissible, because the issue is not properly before this court on appeal. The defendant failed to present this issue to the trial court and to obtain a ruling on it. The defendant\u2019s written motion sought to suppress \u201cany and all\u201d of the defendant\u2019s statements. At the pretrial suppression hearing, however, the parties focused only on the statements made by the defendant while in the police cruiser. The defendant did not confront the State\u2019s witness, Sergeant Marcou, regarding the initial statement, nor did he refer to it specifically during his argument to the court at the close of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The trial court\u2019s order indicates the court\u2019s perception that the defendant sought to suppress only the statements made while in the police cruiser. The trial court stated the issue to be decided as follows: \u201cDefendant\u2019s claim is that he did not expressly waive his right under <em>Miranda v. Arizona . </em>. . and that his subsequent statements to the officers in the cruiser\u201d were obtained in violation of his constitutional rights. The court then denied the suppression of these statements on the ground that the \u201cdefendant was not being questioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Despite the trial court\u2019s apparent failure to rule on the admissibility of the defendant\u2019s initial statement, the defendant, in his notice of objection to the court\u2019s order, failed to advise the court that it had overlooked a statement which he sought to suppress. The defendant objected solely on the ground that the admission of the \u201cstatements at issue\u201d would violate the defendant\u2019s rights under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>both the State and Federal Constitutions. We can only interpret this to mean that the statements at issue were those which the trial court had addressed in its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">It is well settled that objections not raised before the trial court are deemed waived. <em>E.g., State v. Laliberte, </em>124 N.H. 621, 621, 474 A.2d 1025, 1025 (1984); <em>Daboul v. Town of Hampton, </em>124 N.H. 307, 309, 471 A.2d 1148, 1149 (1983). Thus, where the defendant failed to present this issue to the trial court, we will not address it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">We therefore proceed to a review of the admissibility of the statements which the defendant made while in the police cruiser. We find no error by the trial court in admitting these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Once judicial proceedings have commenced against a defendant, as in this case, part I, article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution entitles the defendant to the benefit of counsel during interrogation. <em>See State v. Bruneau, </em>131 N.H. 104, 108, 552 A.2d 585, 587-88 (1988); <em>State v. Scarborough, </em>124 N.H. 363, 368-69, 470 A.2d 909, 913 (1983). Absent a valid waiver of that right, any government interrogation of the defendant would be improper. <em>State v. Bruneau supra. </em>\u201cHowever, totally spontaneous statements by the accused in the absence of his attorney, not elicited by government action, are admissible.\u201d <em>State v. Scarborough, supra </em>at 369, 470 A.2d at 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">As the trial court found, and as the defendant concedes, the statements which the defendant made while in the police cruiser were not the product of police interrogation. The defendant argues, however, that these statements were tainted by the alleged initial violation because the police failed to cure their initial error by securing a valid waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel before he made the statements in the police cruiser. The defendant\u2019s argument might bear some weight if the subsequent statements were the product of interrogation. <em>See State v. Nash, </em>119 N.H. 728, 407 A.2d 365 (1979) (failure to obtain a valid waiver would prevent the police from conducting further interrogation). However, the admitted lack of further interrogation in this case renders the defendant\u2019s waiver argument meritless. We hold, therefore, that the admission of the statements made by the defendant while in the police cruiser, and any actions taken pursuant to those statements, did not violate his rights under part I, article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>We find the defendant\u2019s claim under the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution equally unavailing. Indeed, under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), \u201c[t]he fundamental import of the privilege [against self-incrimination] while an individual is in custody is not whether he is allowed to talk to the police without the benefit of warnings and counsel, but whether he can be interrogated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478; <em>see also Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 485-86 (1981) (interrogation must cease when defendant invokes right to counsel, but subsequent volunteered statements by defendant admissible); <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>124 N.H. 428, 433, 471 A.2d 1172, 1174-75 (1984). Cases cited by the defendant involving subsequent police interrogation, therefore, are inapposite. <em>Cf. Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298 (1985) (police may cure initial <em>Miranda </em>violation by obtaining valid waiver of defendant\u2019s rights prior to commencing further interrogation); <em>State v. Dellorfano, </em>128 N.H. 628, 517 A.2d 1163 (1986). We note further that the trial court\u2019s finding, that the defendant\u2019s subsequent statements were voluntary, is supported amply by the record, and the defendant raises no separate claim on appeal regarding this issue. <em>Cf. State v. Reynolds, supra </em>at 432, 471 A.2d at 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In any event, should we have held that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence of the defendant\u2019s statements, the error could only have been harmless, because all of the evidence of the defendant\u2019s statements and actions, both in Vermont and in New Hampshire, merely establishes that the defendant knew where his daughter was located and had control over her whereabouts. These facts, however, were established at trial through the testimony of Elizabeth and Angie Roberts. The defendant\u2019s wife testified that the defendant had called her numerous times and indicated to her that he had been in contact with Angie. Angie herself testified that the defendant had met her on the day she ran away, had taken her to Vermont, and had visited with her virtually every dqy while she was there. She further testified that on one occasion he had driven her to New Hampshire, and that on another occasion he had taken her to a friend\u2019s camp in Vermont and had stayed with her there. Thus, based upon this evidence, we can say beyond a reasonable doubt that the admission of the defendant\u2019s statements, if error, did not affect the verdict and was thus harmless. <em>State v. Dellorfano, </em>128 N.H. at 637, 517 A.2d at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The second issue raised by the defendant is whether the trial court erred in preventing him from testifying as to specific instances of abuse of his daughter by Mrs. Roberts as the reason for his taking Angie to Vermont and allowing her to remain there.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Before addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we first consider whether the issue was properly preserved for appeal. The State claims that the defendant failed to make a timely objection or a contemporaneous offer of proof with respect to the evidence which he now alleges was improperly excluded by the trial court. We agree that the record is not without ambiguity, but upon a careful review of the record, we hold that the issue is properly before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The State first objected to the defendant\u2019s testimony on direct examination that his daughter had called him \u201cbecause my wife had been out drinking with two of her-.\u201d The court ruled that the testimony was irrelevant, and defense counsel stated, \u201cAll right,\u201d and instructed the defendant to \u201cstay away from that. . . .\u201d The defendant nonetheless further testified that \u201cmy daughter was concerned about the situation at home. . . . She was being hit.\u201d The State objected, and a bench conference was held off the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">When the defendant was then asked how he felt about Angie\u2019s request to leave home and stay with him, he testified that he felt that she should be permitted to do so because of \u201call the things that were going on at home. If I\u2019m not allowed to bring them up-.\u201d The State again objected and a second bench conference ensued. Defense counsel argued that Angie\u2019s reasons for leaving home were relevant to rebut the implication that the defendant had taken his daughter away in order to pressure his wife not to testify. The court ruled, however, that this testimony was irrelevant and hearsay. Defense counsel then stated that he wanted to introduce the defendant\u2019s reasons for taking his daughter to Vermont and for helping her to stay there for a week. When the trial court offered defense counsel an opportunity to make an offer of proof as to what the defendant would testify, defense counsel stated that the defendant would testify: that he took his daughter to Vermont at her request in order to make her happy; that he would have brought her home if she had wanted to return; and that Angie had never made such a request. The court ruled that the defendant could testify in accordance with this offer of proof, but that he could not testify \u201cas to actions that his wife was taking at that time.\u201d The court then addressed the defendant himself to determine whether he understood the court\u2019s ruling. The defendant stated to the court, \u201c[T]he reason I took my daughter was because she was being hit and being abused . . . and I think that\u2019s very important.\u201d The court responded that such testimony was hearsay and irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Despite the court\u2019s ruling, the defendant subsequently testified, \u201cI felt I was protecting . . . [Angie] as a father from being hit.\u201d When the court sustained the State\u2019s objection, defense counsel stated, \u201cAll I would say for the record, Your Honor, I think Angie did testify to that as a reason for her wanting to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">On cross-examination, the defendant again testified as to his wife\u2019s misconduct. At that point, the trial court admonished the defendant, \u201cI\u2019ve instructed you twice on that issue already and you\u2019ve heard my instructions.\u201d A bench conference was then held during which defense counsel stated to the court, \u201cI don\u2019t have any problem with the court\u2019s ruling. We have a witness here that is a little difficult to handle . . . .\u201d Defense counsel then argued as to the admissibility of the remainder of a conversation, where the State had introduced part of the same conversation. The court responded that the State had not opened up the subject area for further testimony and that, in any event, the defendant\u2019s testimony was irrelevant, and ruled against the defendant, noting his exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The State urges us that the record indicates that defense counsel agreed with the court\u2019s exclusion of the defendant\u2019s testimony relative to his wife\u2019s misconduct, noting specifically defense counsel\u2019s statement that he had no problem with the court\u2019s ruling. However, viewing this statement in the context of the lengthy bench conference which had been held earlier relative to this issue, it is reasonable to interpret defense counsel\u2019s statement as indicating merely that he was informing the court that he was aware of the court\u2019s prior adverse ruling, and that he would attempt to comply with it for the remainder of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Moreover, we find unavailing the State\u2019s argument that the defendant\u2019s offer of proof was insufficient because it did not include the defendant\u2019s testimony that his wife\u2019s abuse of his daughter prompted his taking Angie to Vermont. The defendant himself stated to the court that he would testify to the abuse as his reason for keeping Angie, and the court ruled specifically on the admissibility of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Thus, based upon the record as a whole, it is apparent that the trial court was sufficiently apprised of the substance of the evidence, and of the defendant\u2019s objection to its exclusion, to enable the court to rule on the issue, and to correct at that time any error in its ruling, <em>see </em>N.H. R. Ev. 103(b); <em>State v. Sands, </em>123 N.H. 570, 595, 467 A.2d 202, 217-18 (1983), and we therefore reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>The defendant argues that the trial court erred both in ruling that his testimony was hearsay and in ruling that it was irrelevant. We need not address the hearsay issue, however, because we hold that the trial court properly ruled that the testimony was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\">The determination of whether evidence is relevant is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we will not reverse its determination absent evidence of abuse of that discretion. <em>State v. Hammell, </em>128 N.H. 787, 789, 519 A.2d 307, 308 (1986). Here, the defendant wanted to introduce in evidence the manner and type of abuse to which his daughter had been subjected by Mrs. Roberts. At trial, defense counsel proffered the following explanation for the relevancy of the evidence: \u201cI want to get to the reasons in [the defendant\u2019s] mind why [he] took Angie into Vermont and helped her to stay in Vermont for a week\u201d and \u201cthe reasons why are relevant because . . . the State is attempting to make the strong implication that [the defendant took] Angie away from [Mrs. Roberts] to put pressure on [Mrs. Roberts] and . . . thereby tamper[ed] with a witness.\u201d The defendant, himself, in his colloquies with the court regarding the relevancy of the evidence, stated that it was relevant to show why he took his daughter to Vermont and allowed her to remain there. However, the issue at trial was not the defendant\u2019s purpose in keeping Angie in Vermont, but rather, the defendant\u2019s purpose in making the statements to his wife relative to dropping the pending sexual assault charge. Whether the defendant thought his daughter was being abused was irrelevant to a determination of the defendant\u2019s intent in making those statements unless he were to argue that his purpose in making the statements to his wife was somehow to prevent his daughter from having to return home and thus to be abused. This latter reasoning, however, was not a basis upon which the defendant argued relevancy at trial. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the defendant\u2019s testimony was irrelevant. Moreover, despite the court\u2019s ruling, evidence was introduced that Elizabeth Roberts had hit Angie. Angie herself testified that her mother had punished her by making her sit in a chair and slapping her. Further, the defendant\u2019s testimony that Angie \u201cwas being hit\u201d was not stricken from the record, nor was the jury instructed to disregard it. Thus, the evidence was before the jury to consider if they had chosen to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
