He asserts on appeal that his motion to dismiss the indictment should have been granted because his rights to due process, to effective assistance of counsel, and to confront witnesses were violated by the failure of Seabrook police officers to undertake a \u201cstandard\u201d investigation of the offense. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">The facts of the case may be summarized as follows. On Saturday, May 17, 1986, Seabrook police arrested the defendant for shoplifting. After his arrest, the police conducted a warrant check and discovered an outstanding warrant for his arrest from the Rockingham County Sheriff\u2019s Department. As a consequence, the defendant was first processed at the Seabrook police station and then transported to the Rockingham County jail. He was then again officially arrested by a sheriff\u2019s deputy on the outstanding warrant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>and told he was to be held until bail could be set by the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\">Two days later, the defendant was brought by van to the Hampton District Court for a hearing on the shoplifting charge with four other inmates from the jail. Upon arrival at the courtroom, the inmates were seated. Seabrook Officer Crossland, who was in charge of the inmates, then took one of them to the clerk\u2019s office to allow him to make a telephone call. When Officer Crossland returned to the courtroom he discovered that the defendant had disappeared. A search of the building and the Hampton area failed to locate the defendant, who was later arrested in Massachusetts at the place where he was living.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The defendant advances the rather novel argument that because of allegedly negligent police work, <em>i.e., </em>the failure to file a report of the incident, his right to a fair trial on the escape charge was compromised. There is no question that the Seabrook police were unable to produce any reports or notes of the incident for inspection by the defendant\u2019s counsel. Officer Crossland testified that he believed he did prepare a report of the escape, but that the report could not be located for review by defendant\u2019s counsel. Prior to the jury trial, the defendant also deposed both another Seabrook officer, who had spoken with the defendant at the Hampton District Court on the day of the escape, and the Seabrook Police Chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss raises no State constitutional questions; hence, we will decide this case solely upon federal constitutional grounds. It should be noted at the outset that the defendant at no time argues that police reports were, in fact, prepared and that relevant evidence was thus lost or destroyed to his detriment. <em>See State v. Murray, </em>129 N.H. 645, 648, 531 A.2d 323, 325 (1987). Further, the defendant does not claim that a report, if one had existed, would have contained exculpatory evidence relevant to the escape charge. <em>See California v. Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 488 (1984) (duty of State to preserve evidence \u201climited to evidence that might be expected to play a significant role in the suspect\u2019s defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Turning first to the defendant\u2019s claim that the police conduct in this matter deprived him of his due process rights, the defendant must show that the conduct of the police in investigating and reporting on this matter failed to meet a standard of fundamental fairness. <em>See State v. Martin, </em>125 N.H. 672, 677, 484 A.2d 1176, 1179 (1984) (citing <em>California v. Trombetta supra). </em>The fact that the police in the instant case either did not prepare a report, or prepared one and misplaced it, could only work to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>benefit of the defendant. The record reveals that defense counsel cross-examined the police officers as to the lack of a report, the preparation of which one officer described as being \u201cappropriate\u201d to the circumstances. Thus, to the extent that the defendant was able to show that the police were negligent in their handling of his case, this showing of negligence could only have damaged the State\u2019s case as to the credibility of the police. The defendant told the jury his version of the events on the day in question, and the police officers testified as to their recollection of the events, which varied in numerous ways from the defendant\u2019s testimony. Thus, the issue of credibility of the witnesses was clearly before the jury. The fact that the police officers may have failed to follow standard police practices in preparing a report or reports of the incident thus did not deny the defendant the fundamental fairness to which he was entitled. <em>Cf. Arizona v. Youngblood, </em>109 S. Ct. 333, 337 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Further, the nonexistence of a police report did not deprive the defendant of his right to effective assistance of counsel. A defendant is constitutionally entitled to counsel who performs \u201cwithin the range of competence required of attorneys representing defendants in criminal cases.\u201d <em>State v. Staples, </em>121 N.H. 959, 961, 437 A.2d 266, 267 (1981) (citations omitted); <em>see also State v. Glidden, </em>127 N.H. 359, 361, 499 A.2d 1349, 1350 (1985). In this case, the defendant was able to inform his own counsel of what had occurred, and he offered his version of the events to the jury. Although the police may have failed to conduct an exemplary investigation of this incident, there is no claim that the police in any way interfered with defendant\u2019s consultations with counsel or prevented counsel from acting on defendant\u2019s behalf. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>467 U.S. 1267 (1984) (right to effective assistance violated when government \u201cinterferes in certain ways with the ability of counsel to make independent decisions about how to conduct the defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Finally, the defendant was not deprived of the right to confront witnesses against him. His counsel deposed all of the witnesses present on the day of the escape and cross-examined them during the course of the trial in the defendant\u2019s presence. The fact that an officer may have been careless in failing to file a report on the incident did not serve to deprive the defendant of his right to confront the witnesses who testified against him. <em>See generally State v. Chaisson, </em>123 N.H. 17, 30, 458 A.2d 95, 102 (1983) (\u201cprimary interest guaranteed by the confrontation clause is the right to cross examination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
