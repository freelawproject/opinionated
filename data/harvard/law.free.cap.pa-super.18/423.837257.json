Defendant replied that it did not have the grade inquired for, but that it had another kind, describing it as \u201cthe lowest grade of stock we make, and includes everything that is not good enough for a No. 4 or cull. The defect is principally soft rot and a great deal of it, but the price is correspondingly low, as you will notice.\u201d Defendant asked for a quotation for delivery at another point of the lumber mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s letter. The plaintiff replied, making a quotation, and saying, \u201cThe principal defect being, as we wrote you before, excessive rot.\u201d The defendant thereupon ordered the lumber, which was -accordingly delivered. <em>Held, </em>that the correspondence disclosed no implied warranty that the lumber was fit for the purpose for which it was ordered.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b455-10\">Argued Oct. 25, 1901.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AB7\">Appeal, No. 198, Oct.

But it does not necessarily and always follow that the seller warrants the fitness of the article ordered because he knows the purpose for which the buyer intends to use it. The principle relied on by the appellant\u2019s counsel does not apply where a special thing is ordered although intended for a special purpose : Port Carbon Iron Co. v. Groves, 68 Pa. 149. Where a known discrihed and definite article is ordered of a manufacturer, although it is stated to be required by the purchaser for a particular purpose, still if the known described and defined thing be actually supplied, there is no warranty that it shall answer the particular purpose intended by the buyer: Jarecki Mfg. Co. v. Kerr, 165 Pa. 529. See also Haines, Jones &amp; Cadbury Co. v. Young, 13 Pa. Superior Ct. 303, and cases cited. The principle of implied warranty is based to a large extent upon the supposed confidence of the buyer in the judgment of the manufacturer, but where he is informed of the quality of the article which the manufacturer is to furnish he takes upon himself the risk of its effecting its purpose. Here the thing complained of is that the lumber ordered was unfit, by reason of its rottenness, for the purpose for which it was intended to be used; but it would seem plain from the correspondence that the defendant took the risk of this; for in its letter of February 28, the plaintiff informed the defendant of this defect. The language of its letter is: \u201c This is the lowest grade of stock we make, and includes everything that is not good enough for a No. 4 or cull. The defect is principally soft rot and a great deal of it, but the price is correspondingly low as you will notice.\u201d Again in its letter of March 13, the plaintiff wrote, \u201c the principal defect being, as we wrote you before, excessive rot.\u201d With this notice of the quality of the lumber we do not see how the defendant can allege an implied warranty. The defendant bought an article fully described and so far as appears, correctly described.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Judgment affirmed. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
