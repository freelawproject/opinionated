The jury returned a verdict of guilty. <em>Held, </em>by an equally divided court, that the conviction should be sustained.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AE9\">Argued Oct. 7, 1901.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A21\">Appeal, No. 137, Oct.

A. Gfenth, Jr., a witness for the commonwealth, was on the stand, he was asked this question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-5\">\u201c Q. Tell us, as an expert, what salicylic acid is. A. Salicylic acid is an organic compound which is used for the preservation of food stuff. It is also used as a medicine. The concensus of opinion is that salicylic acid is an extremely dangerous substance to use for a preservative in food stuffs. Q. Why ? A. Because it is apt to produce disease.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-6\">Objected to, as the testimony does not relate to this particular bill of indictment, which is based upon the one bottle of raspberry syrup which has already been testified to. Objection overruled. Exception to defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-7\">Mr. Heath states that he will withdraw his objection if the commonwealth will confine its examination to what was found in the particular bottle of raspberry syrup upon which the bill of indictment is based.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-8\">\u201c Q.

Mr. Clement asks leave to amend the bill of indictment so that it will read, \u201c poisonous and injurious \u201d instead of \u201cpoisonous or injurious,\u201d which is granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-10\">\u201c Q.

As an analytical expert, from the information which you have derived from a careful study and analytical experiments with food products, and other effects, state whether or not, in your judgment, based upon your learn-, ing and information upon that subject, salicylic acid is or is not poisonous or injurious to health? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-5\">Objected to.

What about the other portion of the question \u2014 the poisonous part? A. The words \u2018 poisonous \u2019 and \u2018 injurious to health \u2019 I look upon almost as synonymous in cases where the poison is not almost fatal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-8\">The last answer is objected to.

The defendant in this case is indicted for selling one bottle of syrup, and if the jury shall find from the evidence that the single bottle actually sold did not contain salicylic acid in sufficient quantity to be poisonous or injurious to health, then your verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: I </em>cannot affirm that point as stated. I will qualify it by saying that if you find that salicylic acid was the substance that was added, which I believe has not been questioned, and that salicylic acid is injurious and poisonous to the human sj'stem in any quantity, you may convict. If you find that it is not poisonous or injurious to the human system, then you must acquit.
