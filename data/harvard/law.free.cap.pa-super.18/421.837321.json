Stock against the Supreme Council of the Legion of the Red Cross. Isabella B. Stock was the mother of William F. Stock, a member of the association. Mary A. Stock, the widow of William F. Stock, brought a suit against the association to re. cover the death benefits which Isabella B. Stock claimed as the beneficiary named in the certificate of William F. Stock. The court directed an issue to be framed, and at the trial gave binding instructions for defendant, Isabella B. Stock. Other facts appear by the opinion of the Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in giving binding instructions for defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b454-7\"><em>Charles H.

Clause <em>d </em>of section 13 expressly provides that a single man without family may name his mother as beneficiary, and the first clause of the section provides that the death benefit certificate shall be issued to the benefit of such person or persons as may be named therein. The member being a single man without family, designated his mother as beneficiary and did not change his beneficiary as he might have done, if he had so desired, in the manner provided in section 14 of the by-laws. It was evidently his intention that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>the money </em>should be paid to his mother notwithstanding the fact that he married after the certificate issued. We find nothing in the by-laws to warrant the conclusion that his marriage revoked the designation previously made, and as the member did not exercise his privilege to revoke or change it, the right of the beneficiary to the money vested upon his death. None of the cases cited by the appellant\u2019s counsel is in conflict with this conclusion, and it is supported by the well considered decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Catholic Order of Foresters v. Callahan, 146 Mass. 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
