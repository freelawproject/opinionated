It is a rule that that which is apparent to the court, and appears from a necessary implication, need not be averred. It is sufficient in indictments that the charge be stated with so much certainty that the defendant may know what he is called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>on to answer, and that the court may know how to render the proper judgment thereon. Overnice exceptions are not to be encouraged, especially in cases that do not touch the life of the defendant: \u201d Sherban v. Com., 8 Watts, 212. \u201cWe must take some things to be true, from their resulting by irresistible necessity and conclusion from others :\u201d Edge v. Com., 7 Pa. 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\">These principles are illustrated in Lutz v. Com., 29 Pa. 441, a homicide case, in which the exceptions \u201c touched the life of the defendant.\u201d There, it was not directly averred, in the indictment, that the person upon whom the wound was inflicted by the defendant died of the wound. The Supreme Court, however, held that this sufficiently appeared by implication, and sustained the indictment, while conceding that \u201c it trenches hard on those rules of certainty which obtain in criminal pleading.\u201d Further authorities on this point are referred to, and the question discussed, in Com. v. Swallow, 8 Pa. Superior Ct. 539. And later cases repeat and affirm in clear and unequivocal terms this principle of criminal pleading: Com. v. Mentzer, 162 Pa. 646 ; Com. v. Kolb, 13 Pa. Superior Ct. 347; Com. v. New Bethlehem Boro., 15 Pa. Superior Ct. 158; Com. v. Sober, 15 Pa. Superior Ct. 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">As to the first count of the indictment before us, the averment that the labels and wrappers were used on medicines \u201c manufactured and sold by the company,\u201d necessarily implies that the company by which the medicines are manufactured is a manufacturer. This, with the description of the labels and wrappers as labels and wrappers usually affixed by the company to and used on the medicines which it manufactures and sells, meets all the requirements on these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The averment as to the defendant\u2019s intent presents no real difficulty. It charges an intent to use the labels and wrappers to aid in \u201c vending the said goods, wares and merchandise in imitation of and intended to resemble and be sold for the goods, wares and merchandise of the company aforesaid.\u201d Here the words \u201c the said \u201d have no apparent meaning. If they may be construed as having any application, it is to goods, wares and merchandise in imitation of those of the Peruna Company, and to nothing else. But there is no antecedent reference to such goods as these, to which they might relate; the only goods, wares and merchandise previously mentioned are those de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>scribed as actually manufactured and sold by the Peruna Company. These words, therefore, being used only in connection with imitations, can have no relation to the genuine goods. They may be dismissed as surplusage, without affecting the meaning of the averment. They may, perhaps, be designed to mean goods of the description of those manufactured and sold by the Peruna Company \u2014 \u201c to wit: patent medicines.\u201d But, with a meaning or with none, there is nothing in them to vitiate the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The second count charges the possession of an imitation of the stamp, wrapper and label, etc., in the language of the statute, with the exception of describing them as \u201c used on the goods, wares and merchandise manufactured and sold by the company aforesaid,\u201d while the words of the statute, on this point, are, \u201c used by such manufacturer or mechanic on or in the sale of any goods, wares or merchandise.\u201d This is obviously a distinction without a difference. If a label is used on goods manufactured and sold by the manufacturer, they are unquestionably used by the manufacturer on or in the sale of the goods. The possession is charged substantially in the language of the act of assembly, and so plainly that its nature cannot be misunderstood. The intent is charged literally in the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">It is unnecessary to specify the kind of merchandise on which the stamp, label or wrapper is usually affixed or used. Any stamp, label or wrapper, used on any goods, wares or merchandise, is within the statutory prohibition. The description in the indictment follows the language of the statute. If, in any case, this is not thought sufficiently explicit, it may be ground for an application for a bill of particulars, but it cannot be deemed a sufficient reason for quashing the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The statute defines two offenses: (1) Possession of genuine stamps, labels, wrappers, etc., with intent to use them to aid in the sale of goods in imitation of the manufacturer\u2019s goods; (2) Possession of counterfeit stamps, labels, wrappers, etc., with the like intent. The first count of the indictment charges the former offense, the second count the latter. Both counts are certain to a common intent in general. Each charges the offense in substantially the language of the act of assembly; so plainly that its nature maybe easily understood by the jury ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>and with, so much certainty that the defendant may know what he is called on to answer, and the court may know how to render the proper judgment thereon. More than this is not required. The case belongs to the class in which overnice exceptions are not to be encouraged. Its two counts present different phases of the statutory offense, \u2014 a practice in strict conformity with well established principles and sustained by numerous decisions of the Supreme Court and of this court: Commonwealth v. Lewis, 6 Pa. Superior Ct. 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\">The judgment of the court below is reversed, the indictment is reinstated and a procedendo ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b361-4\">W. D.
