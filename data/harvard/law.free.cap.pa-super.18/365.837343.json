The petitioner has been a widow for a number of years past, during which she has resided with the respondent as a member of his household. During said period the respondent, at the special instance and request of the petitioner, has paid out various sums of money for the benefit of the petitioner, comprising money paid for her board and nursing at hospitals, for clothing, for medical attendance, for redeeming articles of personal property belonging to the respondent and taken from his residence by the petitioner and pawned by her; and also for cash lent to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-10\">The respondent has commenced an action against the petitioner in court of common pleas, No. 3, to March term, 1901, No. 380, to recover the sum of $163.07, with interest.

Scott </em>with him <em>Anthony A. Hirst, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXf\">The appellant, while conceding the force of the general proposition that an executor cannot set off against an award an antecedent claim due him in his own right, contends most earnestly that he should receive credit on the award for payments of cash made directly to the appellee, or paid out for her account and on her request, after the entry of the award. Especially is this true of the present case, where the family relation subsisted between the parties, and the appellant can fairly claim that he was lulled into a sense of security by the acquiescence of the appellee in the course of dealing between them. The history of the case shows that after the entry of the award, which was for the suin of $193.79, the appellant paid out, either directly to the appellee or on her account and at her request, the sum of $434.69.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b399-8\"><em>Alex. Simpson </em>of <em>Simpson &amp; Brown, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASLL\">\u2014 A chose in action cannot be set off against a judgment or decree : Thorp v.

Bowman, 108 Pa. 273.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b399-10\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">The appellant\u2019s contention is that the payment made by him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>at the special instance and request of the petitioner after the date of the award should have been treated by the court below as payment and satisfaction of the award. The complete answer to his contention is that he does not allege that there was any agreement between him and her that the money paid on her behalf and the money lent to her was to be so applied. Without such agreement he cannot say that he has paid the award nor can he set off the indebtedness from her to him against the award. The mere fact that a person has a debt against his judgment creditor gives the former no right against the will of the latter to apply the debt as a payment on the judgment: Cooke v. Edwards, 15 Pa. Superior Ct. 412. The court below correctly construed the appellant\u2019s answer as simply alleging an indebtedness from the petitioner to him and correctly held that he had no right to apply the amount awarded to her by the decree to this indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
