Bateman would not have been accepted as a member of The Grand Fraternity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-4\">Deponent further says that the said Mathew R.

Bateman, by reason of his said change of residence as aforesaid, thereby forfeited on behalf of himself and the said plaintiff his beneficiary, all right to any benefit from The Grand Fraternity, and his said cerif\u00edcate of membership, under which the said plaintiff claims, was absolutely null and void at and before the death of the said Mathew R. Bateman, on June 24, 1900, and the said plaintiff is not, therefore, entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-6\">The court made absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b418-8\"><em>George Bradford </em>Carr, for appellant, cited:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2b\">Hamill v.

That the member of the defendant fraternity, as whose beneficiary the plaintiff claims in this suit, \u201c secured his membership in the defendant association by false and fraudulent representations as to and concerning his physical health, to wit: he represented and pretended that he was in perfect physical health, while in point of fact at the time he made his application for membership he well knew he was not in good health and that, if he had told the truth, he would not have been admitted to membership in the defendant association.\u201d This is very vague and indefinite. What were the representations as to health and wherein were they untrue? The variance between the representations and the facts should have been fully and particularly set forth. It is clear that in this respect the affidavit is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">2. The plaintiff in her statement bases her claim upon the first section of the tenth article of the constitution of the defendant association, which is set out in full. The tenth section of the same article provides that \u201cif-the frater came to his death while residing north of the fiftieth or south of the thirty-third parallel of north latitude .... without the previous consent in writing of the president, coupled with such conditions as he may have prescribed, etc., the annuity or other benefit certificate or certificates issued to him shall be absolutely null and void.\u201d The affidavit distinctly alleges \u201cthat the said Matthew R. Bateman, without the knowledge or consent of the president of the said defendant society, removed his residence south of the thirty-third parallel of north latitude and was residing south of the said thirty-third parallel of north latitude at the time of his death on June 24,1900.\u201d Here is a distinct statement of a fact which, if true and unexplained, must defeat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Why then is it not sufficient to prevent judgment? The plaintiff suggests several explanations, any one of which, if made good by proof, may be sufficient to justify a recovery, such as the addition of the residence clause in the constitution, after Bateman became a member, provided the association had no authority to make such an addition, the waiver of that clause by the association by the acceptance of dues after his removal south of the thirty-third parallel, with knowledge of the fact of removal, etc. But these answers will constitute the plaintiff\u2019s rebuttal. The defendant was not bound to anticipate them. Taking the record as it stands, we think the defendant has stated in express terms a defense which ought to bar the entry of judgment upon the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim. Judgment reversed and a procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
