The appeal brings up for review the denial, after a hearing, of that branch of the defendant\u2019s omnibus motion which was to suppress his statements to law enforcement authorities.</p><p id=\"b703-6\">Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p><p id=\"b703-7\">The hearing court properly denied suppression of the defendant\u2019s statements <em>(see People v Hills, </em>295 AD2d 365 [2002]; <em>cf. Matter of Carl W., </em>174 AD2d 678 [1991]). The determination of the hearing court, which saw and heard the witnesses, should be accorded great weight on appeal <em>(see People v Prochilo, </em>41 NY2d 759 [1977]). Its findings of fact and determination of credibility will not be disturbed on appeal \u201cunless clearly unsupported by the record\u201d <em>(People v Jakins, </em>277 AD2d 328 [2000]).</p><p id=\"b703-8\">The defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit. Prudenti, P.J., Ritter, Feuerstein and Adams, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
