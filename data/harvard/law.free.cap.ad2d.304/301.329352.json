The Clerk is directed to enter judgment in favor of defendant dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">We modify as indicated to clarify that the motion court properly made no decision in the order on appeal, which merely alluded to the order of another Justice dated August 20, 2001 that granted defendant\u2019s apparently identical prior motion for summary judgment, and from which plaintiff never appealed.
