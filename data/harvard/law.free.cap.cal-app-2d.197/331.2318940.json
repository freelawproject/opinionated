Pictures, Inc., hereinafter referred to as \u201cWarner,\u201d for a declaration determining the status of a contract between Warner, as the employer, and James Bumgarner, also known as James Garner, hereinafter referred to as \u201cGarner,\u201d as the employee. Garner cross-complained for damages for breach of the contract. The judgment declared the contract terminated as of March 10, 1960, and allowed Garner as damages the sum of $1,750. Both parties have appealed. Warner appeals \u201c. . . from the judgment . . . and from the whole thereof.\u201d Garner appeals \u201c. . . from that part of the judgment ... to wit, Subdivision 3 providing that plaintiff and cross-defendant pay to defendant the sum of $1,750.00, with interest thereon at the rate of 7% per annum from March 10, 1960 up to the date of judgment. Defendant and cross-complainant does not appeal from the rest of the judgment as set forth in Subdivisions 1, 2 and 4 thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>A r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of some of the facts is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\">Warner is a producer of motion pictures of different types for showing in theatres or on television. Garner is an actor who had been employed by Warner since 1955 under successive contracts, the latest of which, and the one with which we are here concerned, was made February 27, 1959, hereinafter referred to as \"Garner <em>Contract.\u2019\u2019 </em>The Garner Contract, among other things, contained a so-called <em>force majeure </em>clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Effective mid-January 1960, the Writers Guild of America, West, Inc. declared a strike against Warner and many other producers. The writers \u2019 guild is an organization or union composed of the writers of scripts or screen plays for both theatrical and television motion pictures. The strike continued from January until June 20, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The present controversy arose when Warner, on March 2, 1960, regarded the situation as of that time as a casualty within the <em>force majeure </em>clause and notified Garner that as of March 3, 1960, his compensation would be discontinued by reason thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The chronology of significant dates is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\"><em>January 16, </em>1960\u2014Television and feature writers struck against many feature and television producers, including Warner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\"><em>March 2, </em>1960\u2014Warner elected to suspend payment of compensation to Garner alleging existence of a \u201ccasualty period\u201d under the employment contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\"><em>March </em>8,1960\u2014Garner objected to suspension claiming that no casualty period existed and demanded payment of salary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-9\"><em>March </em>9,1960\u2014Warner refused to pay salary after Garner\u2019s demand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\"><em>March 10, </em>1960\u2014Garner informed Warner that Warner was in breach of contract and that he elected to treat employment contract as terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-11\"><em>June 20, </em>1960\u2014Writers\u2019 guild strike ended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">When the writers\u2019 strike commenced Warner was producing ten television programs or series. A series consisting of suc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>cessive episodes involving the same main characters and exhibited on television at weekly or other regular intervals. One of such series was known as \u201cMaverick,\u201d with Garner as one of the main characters therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\">Bach television episode was a motion picture filmed from a script. A script is in the form of a play with dialogue, and of the correct length to make the required episode. Scripts are written from stories, the latter being basic literary material. A script is the working tool. Scripts are the product of screen writers, and practically all of such script writers are members of the screen writers\u2019 guild.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Stories are furnished to such writers by the producing company and form the basis of the required script.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">On March 31, 1960, Warner filed its \u201cComplaint fob Declaratory Relief,\u201d which set forth in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">\u201cXV</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">\u201cAn actual controversy exists between plaintiff and defendant as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">\u201c (a) Plaintiff contends that it had and has the right to invoke the provisions of paragraph 15 [i.e., <em>\u2018Force Majeure\u2019 </em>clause set forth in fn. 2] ... in that plaintiff has been and is now prevented and materially hampered and interrupted in the preparation, production, and completion of motion pictures by reason of said strikes hereinabove referred to<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, particularly, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, that the production of motion pictures to which defendant Garner has been and now is assigned, to wit, the \u2018Maverick\u2019 television films, has been and now is suspended, interrupted, and postponed by reason of said strike, affecting writers; and that, therefore, plaintiff is, under the express provision of said paragraph 15, not obligated to make any weekly payments to the defendant during the period that said conditions prevail, except as expressly provided in said paragraph 15. Defendant denies each and all of plaintiff\u2019s contentions set forth in this subdivision (a) and contends that by failing to make payment of the weekly payments provided for in said contract, plaintiff has committed a \u2018total breach\u2019 of said contract, giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>defendant the right to terminate said contract and seek other employment in the field of entertainment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\">\u201c(b) Plaintiff contends that even if this court should ultimately find as a fact that plaintiff has not been prevented, materially hampered, or interrupted in the preparation, production, or completion of motion pictures by reason of said strikes, or that the production of said \u2018Maverick\u2019 television films has not in fact been suspended, interrupted, or postponed by reason of said strikes affecting writers, plaintiff\u2019s action in invoking said paragraph 15 was taken in good faith and in reliance on said express contractual rights and remedies, and that plaintiff can not be held to have committed a \u2018total breach,\u2019 or any breach at all, of said contract for its reliance, in good faith, upon its express contractual rights and remedies, unless plaintiff should, after the aforesaid question of fact has been finally determined adversely to plaintiff, fail and refuse to make payment of sums actually found to be due under said contract. In this connection, and in order to demonstrate plaintiff\u2019s good faith, and assure defendant and this Court thereof, plaintiff hereby offers to deposit with the Clerk of this Court, or any other person, firm, or corporation designated by this Court, such unpaid amounts as would have accrued under said contract up to the date of the filing of this complaint, but for the facts and circumstances herein described, together with all subsequently accruing amounts, such deposit to be disposed of in such manner as this Court may direct. Defendant denies each and all of plaintiff\u2019s contentions set forth in this subdivision (b) and contends that immediately upon the making of a contention or statement of opinion as to the facts by defendant, which is at a variance with plaintiff\u2019s belief as to the facts, plaintiff is required to either concede to defendant\u2019s opinion and demand, or proceed at its peril.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">\u201c(c) Plaintiff contends that even if this Court should hold adversely to plaintiff with respect to subdivision (b) above thereby finding, in effect, that plaintiff has breached said contract, such breach is only a partial breach with respect to a relatively insignificant amount of money, compared to the aggregate amount earned and to be earned by defendant; that plaintiff is financially able to pay any amount found to be due; that defendant has a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy by way of recovery of amounts found to be due; that such breach if such exists, is not of such a material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>nature as to justify rescission or termination of said contract by the defendant; and that it would be unfair, inequitable, and unconscionable to permit defendant to terminate said contract, thereby depriving plaintiff of the value thereof, which plaintiff has developed over the period of five (5) years preceding the filing of this action, at great expense and effort and at no cost to defendant. Defendant denies each and all of plaintiff\u2019s contentions set forth in this subdivision (e) and contends that any failure to make weekly payments to him under said contract, however insignificant in amount, and even though its obligation to make such payments is disputed, is a material breach of contract giving him the right to terminate said contract and seek other employment in the field of entertainment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-3\">\u201c(d) Plaintiff contends that the acts and conduct of defendant over the period of a year or more, prior to the filing of this action, demonstrate conclusively that defendant is dissatisfied with said contract; that he has been seeking an excuse to avoid, rescind, nullify, cancel, or terminate the same; that by taking the action herein described, defendant is acting in bad faith, and in breach of his clear obligation under said contract; that by reason thereof, defendant is in default under said contract within the purview of paragraph 16 thereof; and that, therefore, in addition to plaintiff\u2019s right and remedies under paragraph 15 of said contract, plaintiff is not obligated to make any weekly payments to defendant during the period commencing on the commencement of said default, to wit, March 10, 1960, and continuing thereafter until defendant shall personally report to plaintiff ready, able, and willing to resume his services pursuant to said contract and for such additional period, not in excess of six (6) weeks, as may be necessary to enable plaintiff to prepare for the actual utilization of such services; and that plaintiff has all other rights and remedies against defendant more particularly set forth in said paragraph 16. Defendant denies each and all of plaintiff\u2019s contentions under this subdivision (d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\">\u201c(e) Plaintiff contends that in addition to its rights and remedies hereinabove referred to, under the provisions of the Producers-Sereen Actors Guild, Inc. Basic Agreement of 1952, . . . said contract is automatically suspended as to both services and compensation while said strike called by Screen Actors Guild, Inc. is in effect, except to the extent, if any, that defendant may actually render services in connection with television films during the continuance of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>strike, or other services not within the jurisdiction of said Screen Actors Guild, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-4\">\u201cDefendant denies each and all of plaintiff\u2019s contentions set forth in this subdivision (e) and contends that because he has been assigned to render services in television films said provisions have no application to him. In this connection, however, plaintiff calls attention to the provisions of paragraph 3 A of said contract requiring plaintiff to utilize the services of defendant in theatrical motion pictures and to the provisions of paragraph 4 of said contract to the effect that plaintiff is not deemed to have waived the right to require defendant to render any services mentioned in said contract by assigning defendant Garner to any particular kind or type of services over any period of time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">On April 14, 1960, defendant Garner, among other things,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> filed his \u201cAnswer\u201d and alleged therein in pertinent part;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">\u201cXV</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">\u201cAnswering paragraph XV [i.e., set forth above], defendant admits that plaintiff\u2019s contentions are as set forth in paragraphs XV(a) through XV(e) therein and that defendant denies each and all of plaintiff\u2019s said contentions. In connection with defendant\u2019s contentions in paragraph XV(a) through XV(e), defendant contends that, as of March 3, 1960, plaintiff did not have the right to invoke the provisions of Paragraph 15 of the employment agreement between the parties; that as of said date the production of the \u2018Maverick\u2019 television series was not suspended, interrupted, or postponed by reason of the Writer\u2019s [sic] strike, that as of said date plaintiff was not materially hampered or interrupted in the preparation, completion or production of motion pictures for exhibition in theatres or on television; that as of said date plaintiff could have immediately secured employment for defendant as an actor, pursuant to Paragraph 13 of the employment agreement, with numerous persons, firms, or corporations connected with the field of entertainment; that plaintiff could itself have made use of defendant\u2019s services in television productions and in other fields of entertainment; that by reason of plaintiff\u2019s letter of March 2, 1960, to defendant terminating plaintiff\u2019s weekly payments to defendant and by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>reason of the fact that on or about March 9, 1960, plaintiff refused to make such payments after demand by defendant\u2019s attorneys, plaintiff has committed a breach of contract such that defendant is no longer bound to perform any or all of the terms and conditions of the agreement ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-3\">The \u201cPre-Trial Conference Order\u201d was filed September 20, 1960, and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">\u201cThis is an action in declaratory relief wherein plaintiff [i.e., Warner] seeks to have it determine <em>[sic] </em>whether or not plaintiff was justified in suspending the payment of compensation to defendant as an actor because of the pendency of a screen writers [sm] strike and whether plaintiff is entitled to an injunction to prevent defendant from working for any employer other than plaintiff. Defendant has filed an answer and an amended cross-complaint for damages for breach of contract on the part of cross-defendant and for an injunction to prevent cross-defendant from interferring <em>[sic] </em>with his employment by others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The order also incorporated a \u201cJoint Pre-Trial Statement\u201d which indicates that the contentions of the respective parties are set forth in paragraph XV of the complaint and paragraph XV of the answer thereto (see <em>supra). </em>The issues of fact are set forth in the joint statement as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AWVG\"><em>Warners contends </em>that the issues of fact involved in this case are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">\u201c(a) Was the preparation, production or completion of motion pictures by Warners prevented, materially hampered or interrupted by reason of the writer\u2019s <em>[sic] </em>strike?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">\u201c(b) Was Warners unable to obtain material (namely scripts) by reason of said strike or,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">\u201c(c) Was the production of the \u2018Maverick\u2019 series to which Garner was assigned, suspended, interrupted or postponed by said strike?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">\u2018 \u2018 <em>Warners further contends </em>that if it be found that any one or more of the foregoing conditions did exist, then Warners is entitled to a declaration of its rights in the light of such facts; if one or more of the said conditions did not exist, then Garner is entitled to a declaration of his rights in that respect. In either event Warners contends that Garner is not entitled to rescind or revoke his contract by reason of any claim or breach thereof consisting of Warners\u2019 <em>[sic] </em>efforts to assert its rights under the provision of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-10\">\u2018 \u2018 <em>Garner contends </em>that the issue of fact is as follows: as of March 3, 1960, did the circumstances resulting from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>writer\u2019s <em>[sic] </em>strike (including, but not limited to, the effect of said strike on the \u2018Maverick\u2019 television series, on Warners television and theatrical production generally, and on Warners ability to loan out Garner\u2019s services to other persons, firms, or corporations in the field of entertainment), give Warners the right, at that time, to suspend payments to Garner under the provisions of paragraph 15 of the employment agreement.\u201d (Italics shown.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The trial was conducted before the court sitting without a jury and on December 14, 1960, the trial judge filed his \u201cMemorandum Decision.\u201d The \u201cFindings op Fact and Conclusions op Law\u201d were filed December 28, 1960, and \u201cJudgment\u201d was entered December 30, 1960 (see fn. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Warner\u2019s first contention on its appeal from the judgment is that \u201cThe Facts Must Be Related to the Contract Provisions, and When This [is] Done, Essential Findings Relating to the Impact of the Strike Are Not Supported by the Evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The findings relating to the impact of the strike are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">\u201cXII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">\u201cDuring the entire period of the writers\u2019 strike plaintiff continued the preparation, production and completion of motion pictures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">\u201cXIII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">\u201cThe preparation, production and completion of motion pictures by plaintiff was not prevented, materially hampered or interrupted by reason of the writers\u2019 strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\">\u201cXIV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-12\">\u201cPlaintiff was not unable to obtain material by reason of the writers\u2019 strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-13\">\u201cXV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-14\">\u201cThe production by plaintiff of the \u2018Maverick\u2019 series was not suspended, interrupted or postponed by reason of the writer\u2019s <em>[sic] </em>strike.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">Warner divides its insufficiency of the evidence contention into two subdivisions. Under subdivision (a) Warner contends that Finding XIII indicates that the trial court erroneously construed the <em>force majeure </em>clause to require absolute impossibility or a complete cessation of all activity in order to constitute a casualty period.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">In this respect, Warner points to the <em>force majeure </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>clause which is in the disjunctive (i.e., \u201cIf the preparation, production <em>or </em>completion of motion pictures by Producer . . . shall be prevented or materially hampered or interrupted by reason of . . . strike . . .\u201d) and compares it with Finding XIII which is in the conjunctive (i.e., \u201cThe preparation, production <em>and </em>completion of motion pictures by plaintiff was not prevented, materially hampered or interrupted by reason of the writers\u2019 strike\u201d). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\">We do not believe that Finding XIII discloses that the trial court construed the <em>force majeure </em>clause to require absolute impossibility or a complete cessation of all activity in order to constitute a casualty period. (See <em>Overseas Metal &amp; Ore Corp. </em>v. <em>Rosenfield, </em>132 Conn. 364 [44 A.2d 625].)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Findings are to be liberally construed and resolved in favor of upholding rather than defeating the judgment. <em>(Woodbine </em>v. <em>Van Horn, </em>29 Cal.2d 95, 109 [173 P.2d 17] ; <em>Del Riccio </em>v. <em>Photochart, </em>124 Cal.App.2d 301, 313 [268 P.2d 814].) In accordance with this principle, the proper interpretation of Finding XIII (if it requires interpretation at all) is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">The preparation of motion pictures by plaintiff was not prevented, materially hampered or interrupted by reason of the writers\u2019 strike; the production of motion pictures by plaintiff was not prevented, materially hampered or interrupted by reason of the writers\u2019 strike; and the completion of motion pictures by plaintiff was not prevented, materially hampered or interrupted by reason of the writers\u2019 strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">A large amount of statistical data was introduced to show the effect of the writers\u2019 strike on the preparation, production, and completion of theatrical and television motion pictures. The evidence shows and Warner concedes that \u201c. . . there was at all times during the strike, both before and after March 3rd, some activity at the Studio, and some preparation, production or completion of motion pictures were at all times going on in some way and to some extent and with respect to some pictures or series.\u201d The evidence supports the finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">Subdivision (b) of Warner\u2019s contention concerning the purported insufficiency of the evidence provides, \u201cThe Findings With Respect to the Impact of the Strike on Maverick [i.e., as distinguished from the impact of the strike on Warner \u2019s general activity] Are Likewise Unsupported by the Record and Are the Result of the Erroneous Construction of the Contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>As already pointed out, the provisions of paragraph 15 of the contract are in the disjunctive and contain several alternatives. The first alternative relating to Warner\u2019s general activity has heretofore been discussed. Another alternative contained in paragraph 15 is that <em>. </em>. if the production of any motion picture or other production to which Artist is assigned hereunder shall be suspended, interrupted or postponed by any such cause, . . . (the continuance of any such event being hereinafter designated as the \u2018 casualty period\u2019), then, during the continuance of such casualty period, Producer shall not be obligated to make any weekly payments to Artist ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The trial judge in his \u201cMemorandum Decision\u201d made it clear that he construed the above alternative provision of paragraph 15 as not being applicable to Maverick (i.e., any Warner\u2019s production). The memorandum provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">\u201cThe court will find that the provision, \u2018or if the production to which Artist is assigned hereunder shall be suspended, interrupted or postponed by any such cause\u2019 means the lending or assignment of the services of Artist pursuant to Paragraph 13 to a producer other than Warner Bros, and does not mean \u2018assignment\u2019 of the Artists to one of Warner Bros, productions.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Initially it must be noted that there was no finding made concerning whether Garner was \u201cassigned\u201d to a production by Warner. The court did find (Finding XV) that \u201cThe production by plaintiff of the \u2018Maverick\u2019 series was <em>not </em>suspended, interrupted or postponed by reason of the writer\u2019s <em>[sic] </em>strike.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\">Although Warner has presented extensive argument in its brief attempting to show that the trial court erroneously construed the alternative contained in the <em>force majeure </em>clause concerning the \u201c. . . production to which Artist is assigned hereunder . . .\u201d it is manifest that the trial court\u2019s construction is immaterial if there is substantial evidence to support Finding XV. Counsel for Warner concedes this fact.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">An examination of the record discloses that there is substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination (Finding XV) that \u201cThe production by plaintiff of the \u2018Maverick\u2019 series was not suspended, interrupted or postponed by reason of the writer\u2019s <em>[sic] </em>strike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">As of March 2, 1960, Warner had completed production on the Maverick series for 1959-1960 and had filmed one \u201cextra\u201d episode which was not scheduled to be telecast until September 25, 1960. In the past, Warner had not started production until May or June or later, with respect to the next air date season, and producer Trapnell testified that when he took over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>as Maverick producer on June 15, 1959, there was not a single completed script for the 1959-1960 season, yet Warner met its September 12 air date. Warner\u2019s executives knew that production on the Maverick series for the 1960-1961 season would ordinarily not begin until May, at the earliest, and that May production would, as the trial court found (Finding XVII), allow the maximum time necessary to meet the 1960-1961 air date commitments.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The facts must be related to the manner by which Warner conducted its business.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">On March 3, 1960, Warner had approximately 14 \u201cHermanos\u201d writers available in its television department; at least one of the 14 had done work on a Maverick script previously. Warner had at least two stories suitable for development into Maverick scripts and, judging by both past and subsequent events, it could write a Maverick script in 15 days, or possibly rewrite an old script in as little as five days. Furthermore, the head of the television department indicated on direct examination that Warner \u201c. . . may have had other [Maverick and Cheyenne] scripts in at this point but I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">We believe that the evidence, taken as a whole, shows that Warner was able to obtain scripts when Warner wanted them and that production of Maverick was not suspended, interrupted or postponed by reason of the writers\u2019 strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Warner\u2019s next contention is that \u201cThe Findings of the Court That the Action of Warner Was Not in Good Faith Cannot Be Supported.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The trial court found (Finding XX) that \u201cThe refusal of plaintiff to pay defendant compensation after demand by defendant was willful, deliberate and not in good faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">At the conclusion of the arguments by counsel the Reporter\u2019s Transcript discloses that the trial judge made the following statement: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>even of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses and particularly Mr. Warner. \u2019\u2019<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Well, I am satisfied from the evidence that Warner Bros, did not have justification for laying Mr. Garner off on March 2nd. I think that is indicated by the testimony</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>The trial judge in his \u201cMemorandum Decision\u201d stated in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\">\u201cThe breach in this case was wilful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>\u201cThe court will find that plaintiff was not justified in stopping the payment of defendant\u2019s salary, under the provisions of paragraph 15 of the contract, for the reason that the preponderance of the evidence does not establish that a 'casualty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>period\u2019 in fact existed; and for the further reason that the refusal to pay Garner\u2019s salary was in bad faith as evidenced, in part, by the manner in which the Bob Hope Show transaction was handled. Plaintiff\u2019s act in refusing to pay defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>salary justified Garner in treating the refusal as a total breach of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\">\u201cWhen the dispute arose as to the rights of Warner Bros, to suspend Garner\u2019s salary, it could have protected itself by paying the salary and recouping the amount paid\u2014if the suspension was justified\u2014under the provisions of the second paragraph of numbered paragraph 17 of the contract.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">A reasonable inference can be drawn from all of the evidence that Warner knew that it would not be in any trouble with respect to Maverick unless it could not start preparing another episode by May 1, 1960 (at the very earliest, since one 1960-1961 episode was already completed). Warner did in fact start preparation on two episodes in late April and by June 15 (at least three months prior to the first air date and still before the end of the writers\u2019 strike) had completed \u201cpreparation\u201d and \u201cproduction\u201d on four \u201cMaverick\u201d episodes, was filming a fifth, and had four scripts in preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Finally, Warner asserts as its last contention that \u201cIf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Warner Erroneously Interpreted the Contract, Its Action Did Not Constitute a Serious and Total Breach Justifying a Termination by Garner. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\">Warner\u2019s contention cannot be sustained. When Warner informed Garner that it elected not to pay Garner the stipulated weekly salary, Warner\u2019s act constituted a refusal, without cause, to pay an employee his compensation. The employee\u2019s right to <em>terminate </em>the contract where there has been a wrongful refusal to pay compensation is established by both the statutory and case law of this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Labor Code section 2925 provides that \u201cAn employment for a specified term may be terminated by the employee at any time in case of any <em>wilful </em>or permanent breach of the obligation of his employer to him as an employee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As set forth above, the trial judge in his \u201cMemorandum Decision\u201d stated that the \u201cbreach in this case was wilful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In <em>May </em>v. <em>New York M. Picture Corp., </em>45 Cal.App. 396 [187 P. 785], the court defined \u201cwilful\u201d in connection with what is now Labor Code section 2924, and stated at page 404, in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">\u201cIn civil eases, the word \u2018willful,\u2019 as ordinarily used in courts of law, does not necessarily imply anything blamable, or any malice or wrong toward the other party, or perverseness or moral delinquency, but merely that the thing done or omitted to be done was done or omitted intentionally. It amounts to nothing more than this: That the person knows what he is doing, intends to do what he is doing, and is a free agent. <em>(Benkert </em>v. <em>Benkert, </em>32 Cal. 470; <em>Towle </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>130 Cal. 577 [62 P. 1064]; 40 Cyc. 944.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">With reference to the case law on the subject, see <em>Percival </em>v. <em>National Drama Corp., </em>181 Cal. 631, 637-638 [185 P. 972]; <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Universal Pictures Co., </em>62 F.Supp. 611 [S.D. Cal. 1944], affd. 150 F.2d 986 (9 Cir. 1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Having disposed of Warner\u2019s contentions raised on its appeal from the judgment, we now turn to Garner\u2019s contentions on his limited appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">As indicated in footnote 5, Garner, on April 26, 1960, filed an \u201cAmended Cross-Complaint (Damages for breach of contract; Injunction).\u201d As set forth above Garner was awarded the sum of $1,750 plus interest, and Garner\u2019s appeal is from that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">The basis for the trial court\u2019s determination that Garner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>was entitled to judgment in the sum of $1,750 is succinctly set forth in his \u201cMemorandum Decision\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">\u201cThis brings us to the question of Garner\u2019s right to recover damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\"><em>\u201cIt must be remembered that Garner was not discharged. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">\u201cAs was said in <em>Percival </em>v. <em>National Drama Corp., </em>181 Cal. 631 [185 P. 972], p. 638: \u2018The evidence does not show that the defendant refused to permit the plaintiff to render any services. The most that can be said of it is that defendant did not require any services of plaintiff. This fact, unless accompanied by some affirmative act indicating a discharge, is not sufficient proof thereof. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">\u201cWhen Warner Bros, notified Garner his salary would be suspended <em>he </em>[italics shown] treated it as a breach of the contract. Warner Bros, was still anxious for him to render services under the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">\u201cThe law is that if an employee is discharged his remedy is an action for damages. Where he has not been discharged but merely has been prevented by the employer from working, he need not treat the contract as broken but may sue on the contract and recover the agreed compensation. But in order to recover the agreed compensation he must be ready, able and willing to perform.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">\u201cIn this case, after declaring a breach of the contract, Garner refused to recognize it and refused to render services to or for Warner Bros.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">\u201cTherefore, while Garner had the right to terminate the contract, he does not have the right to recover damages. The right he had was the option to quit his employment and sue for the salary then due, or of continuing in the employ of Warner Bros., and sue for his salary as it accrued.

I can\u2019t remember how we came to pass on it at that meeting other than it was the right thing to do and the right time came; naturally, we would do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-19\">\n<em>t (</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-20\">\u201cQ. Now, did Mr. Orr give you any report with reference to the number of writers he had working for him immediately preceding that meeting, that is to say, the end of February, 1960? A. At no time has Mr. Orr ever given me a report of whom he has working for him, in writing or any of the departments of any consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-21\">\u201cQ. Did he in that report tell you that at the end of February, 1960, despite the writers\u2019 strike his division had succeeded in securing the services of 14 writers for television episodes? A. No, I don\u2019t remember him telling me anything pertaining to amounts, no.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-22\">\n<em>I i</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-23\">\u201cQ. Do you know as a fact that the Television Division did meet its commitments and did produce television pictures for the 1959-1960 season?</p>\n<p id=\"b366-24\">\n<em>( (</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-25\">\u201cA. I imagine they did because I didn\u2019t hear anyone complaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-26\">\n<em>( (</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-27\">\u201cQ. Now, as of March 2nd, do you remember Mr. Orr telling you how many scripts they had ready to shoot on March 2, 1960, for television?</p>\n<p id=\"b366-28\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, I don\u2019t remember him telling me at any time, no, whether he did or he didn\u2019t. I can\u2019t remember it.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-29\">\n<em>I t</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-30\">\u201dQ. I am particularly interested in March 2nd and Mr. Orr\u2019s report. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Did he tell you on that occasion or did Mr. Benson or did anybody tell you that as of that date, March 2nd, they had available two ideas which could be made into scripts for \u2018Maverick\u2019? And the two scripts subsequently made in May of 1960 were entitled \u2018A State of Siege\u2019 and \u2018Arizona Black Maria. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t remember them discussing any-not only the \u2018Maverick\u2019 series or any series or any source because X just humanly do not have time to read these, so many scripts. We have 200 shows.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\u201cQ. The purpose of my question is this. I want to make it clear: When you exercised your right and power as president and instructed your subordinates to suspend Messrs. Garner, Kelly and Walker by reason of their force majeure clause in their contracts, you did not know that there were available two stories for the \u2018Maverick\u2019 series on March 2, 1960, which could have been made into scripts for \u2018 Maverick \u2019 episodes?</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u201cA. No, I did not know other than \u2014 I repeat again \u2014 that there was a general concentration of trying to get scripts for all the shows which naturally took in \u2018Maverick\u2019 and everyone of them, so if they had anything to do I can\u2019t say that I knew about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">\u201cQ. Did you ask Mr. Orr whether there was any material available that could be made into a \u2018Maverick\u2019 script before you decided to suspend Mr. Gamer? A. No, I didn\u2019t, . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">\u201cQ. At this meeting when you decided to exercise force majeure did you discuss with Mr. Orr or Mr. Trilling the possibility of using Mr. Garner as an actor in other TV series which were continuing production ? A. No, I did not discuss that.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">\u201cQ. Did you give it any thought before you decided to suspend Mr. Gamer? A. Other than the final report from Mr. Orr that we did not have any scripts to be made on March 2nd, that therefore we decided to suspend him, yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. Did you discuss with Mr. Orr putting any available writers to work writing scripts for \u2018Maverick\u2019 before you decided to lay Mr. Garner o\u00f1? A. No, I did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-14\">\u201cQ. Did you give it any consideration? A. Only what Mr. Orr and I discussed personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-15\">\u201cQ. Which you have related. A. I don\u2019t remember everything that we said.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-17\">\u201cQ. At this meeting when you decided to suspend Mr. Garner for a period beginning March 3, 1960, did you have in mind the fact that Garner was going to render services as an actor in television during March and April of 1960? A. You mean for Bob Hope?</p>\n<p id=\"b367-18\">\u201cQ. Yes. A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-19\">\u201cQ. You knew that Warner Bros, was going to <em>be </em>paid $5,000 for those services? A. No, we were going to get $10,000, of which $5,000 was going to be refunded to him \u2014 we don\u2019t want to get everything. Don\u2019t make the employer the villain.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-20\">\u201cQ. I will stipulate that you had a right to keep all of it if you wanted to. You could have kept all of it. All I am asking you is whether when you decided to suspend Mr. Gamer on March 2, 1960, you had in mind the fact that Mr. Garner was going to work during March and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>April as an actor in television and that Warner Bros, was to benefit therefrom to the extent of $5,000?</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u201cA. Undoubtedly I did but, however, I took for granted Mr. Orr and our attorneys would give Mr. Garner the legal right to so do irrespective of the suspension. I imagine that is the routine that went on.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u201cQ. Assuming that you had that in mind, did you ask your executives with whom you talked about the possibility of getting another role for Mr. Garner instead of laying him off? A. Before the layoff?</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u201cQ. Yes. A. I am not in that end of it so therefore I didn\u2019t talk about it. I am not a booking agent, I don\u2019t think.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u201cQ. You knew when you authorized the signing of the letter of suspension that Mr. Garner would not receive a weekly salary during that period?</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\n<em>( (</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, I certainly should know it.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">\n<em>Ct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">\u201cQ. By Mr. Gang: Did you give any consideration whether you on March 2, 1960, when you instructed your executives to suspend payment of compensation to Mr. Garner to the fact that he could be employed and render services as an actor in television during the period of time that you didn\u2019t want to pay him?</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know \u2014 yon leave me a little dull, and our contract gives us the right that you are talking about there. Naturally, we suspended him. About trying to get him employment, I have nothing to do with that so I can\u2019t answer you.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">\u201cQ. None of your executives proposed that subject to you?</p>\n<p id=\"b368-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Not until some time later when we got the letter that we had come from you or Mr. Garner, that we would get him work elsewhere, along the lines you related.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">\u201cQ. After we complained? A. Yes, and we also wrote if he would live up to his agreement, we believed we would make every effort to get work for him. Of course, we got the negative answer. In his mind this contract was out, which it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-16\">\n<em>11</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-17\">\u201cQ. My question is: You didn\u2019t refuse to pay Mr. Garner\u2019s salary when he demanded it after you suspended him because you didn\u2019t have the money?</p>\n<p id=\"b368-18\">\n<em>( (</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-19\">\u201cA. It is the only thing we had, was money to try to keep it going.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-20\">\u201cQ. By Mr. Gang: Mr. Warner, these last three exhibits were all based upon a press release issued by your studio, were they not?</p>\n<p id=\"b368-21\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-22\">\u201cQ. And you saw that press release before it was issued?</p>\n<p id=\"b368-23\">\u201cA. I virtually wrote it. It was an optimistic-can I continue why I wrote it, or is it unnecessary?</p>\n<p id=\"b368-25\">\u201cQ. Maybe Mr. Williams will ask you that. Particularly I call your attention to the language which appears in the Daily Variety issue, which is Exhibit J, on page 7, reading, in quotation marks, quoting you, Mr. Warner:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-26\">\u201c \u2018Warner Bros, looks forward with extreme enthusiasm and confidence to the months and years ahead. Production activities at Warner Bros. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>have continued at a high level due to filming for television. Now, major picture production also is being accelerated. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">\u201cQ. As a matter of fact, the statement was true, was it not? A. You mean the whole statement?</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">\u201cQ. Yes. A. No, not exactly.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">\u201cQ. Look at your deposition, page 40. A. Much of it is true and much of it is what we call good propaganda.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">\u201cQ. Page 44 of your deposition, and I am referring to the statement we have just been discussing, line 12:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">\u201c \u2018 Q. Will you look up the statement, and if it is any different will you put the statement in the record as an exhibit ? \u2019 \u201cAnd</p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">\u201c 'Q. Did you keep on functioning during that period of time?\u2019 \u201cAnd your answer, line 17:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-16\">\u201c \u2018A. I think I have said that many, many times. Certainly we kept on functioning. Whatever scripts they could put together, or scripts that they had, which I don\u2019t know what they are. Certainly we kept on shooting.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b369-17\">\u201cYou did so testify?</p>\n<p id=\"b369-18\">\u201cA. Yes, that\u2019s exactly as I say. I say that again.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b369-19\">Paragraph 17 of the employment contract provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-20\">\u201cIf Producer shall have made weekly payments to Artist during any period when it was not obligated to do so, under any provision of paragraphs 14, 15, or 16, such fact shall not affect Producer\u2019s right to extend the current term as aforesaid; and whether or not Producer shall exercise said right of extension, Producer shall, nevertheless, not be obligated to make weekly payments to Artist for an equivalent period, and may withhold from any other moneys payable to Artist hereunder, such amount as Producer was not obligated to pay Artist by reason of the provisions of said paragraphs 14, 15, and 16. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
