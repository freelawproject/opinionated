The following facts are uncontradicted. On July 8, 1960, around 2:30 p. m. Mary T. Homma, a cashier for the Pacific Finance Company, left her office to make the company\u2019s daily bank deposit; in her left hand she carried an envelope containing 25 checks, 25 money orders and 8, $5.00 bills. She walked down the corridor and as she turned toward the stairway to descend to the first floor, defendant who had been standing there snatched the envelope from her hand, shoved her to the floor and ran down the stairs out of the building. She \u201cscreamed\u201d and \u201chollered out\u201d to the man who operated the candy store in the lobby, \u201cHelp, help, Max, catch the fellow in the green that is running out of the building. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Appellant\u2019s sole contention is that the evidence shows neither force nor fear used at the time the envelope was taken from the victim and at most it supports a finding of grand larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Section 211, Penal Code, defines robbery as the felonious taking of personal property from the person of another and against his will, \u201caccomplished by means of force or fear.\u201d  Thus, although the taking may be accomplished by the use of either force or fear <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kuranoff, </em>100 Cal.App. 2d 673 [224 P.2d 402]), proof of one or the other must be made in order to sustain a conviction of robbery. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>118 Cal.App.2d 136 [257 P.2d 39].)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">The record before us supports no conclusion that Miss Homma was in fear, for she testified that she was only startled when the envelope was snatched from her hand and that defendant did not put her in fear. Appellant argues that neither does the evidence support a finding of the force contemplated in section 211, inasmuch as the shove occurred <em>after </em>the envelope was taken from Miss Homma and its sole purpose was to \u201cby-pass\u201d her in the narrow stairway. He relies mainly on <em>People </em>v. <em>Church, </em>116 Cal. 300 [48 P. 125], to the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>that the \u201cgrabbing or snatching of property from the hand is not robbery but grand larceny, in the absence of the use of force in the taking.\u201d (A.O.B., p. 6.) If there was no evidence in the record before us to indicate that the taking was accomplished by means of force, the rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Church, supra, </em>would undoubtedly control; but this is not here the situation. Miss Homma testified that defendant snatched the envelope out of her hand, shoved her to the floor and ran past her down the stairs, out of the building and into the street; that as a result of the shove she fell to the floor on her buttocks, the fall injured her, and her buttocks were sore and \u201cblack and blue for quite a while.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Church, </em>116 Cal. 300 [48 P. 125], the facts of which appellant likens to those at bar, involved only the simple \u201cgrabbing\u201d of the victim\u2019s watch and chain from his vest and running with them out of the door. The issue there was whether an instruction, which in effect eliminated grand larceny from the case, was erroneous. The court, stating the rule that there must be force or fear in the taking to constitute robbery, held that whether the crime constituted robbery or grand larceny \u201cwas dependent upon the absence or presence of the use of force in the taking; and the use or non-use of force by defendant was a question of fact essential for the jury to determine in fixing the crime of which the defendant should be convicted.\u201d (P. 302-303.) Thus it is clear that where there is evidence of force or fear in the taking of an object \u201csnatched\u201d from the person of the victim a conviction of robbery will be sustained <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>31 Cal.App.2d 562 [88 P.2d 238]); and the record before us reveals that in shoving Miss Homma, defendant exerted sufficient force to cause her to fall to the floor and result in injury to her, and such as to incapacitate her to the extent that she could not readily recover the envelope from defendant or immediately pursue him, thus permitting his escape from the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Relative to appellant\u2019s contention that the shove occurred <em>after </em>the envelope was taken, thus the \u201ctaking\u201d could not be \u201caccomplished by means of force, \u2019 \u2019 we refer to the recital in the evidence of several acts of defendant which occurred so \u201cfast\u201d in point of time as to constitute a single incident. According to the victim they happened \u201cvery, very quickly,\u201d \u201cvery fast\u201d; defendant snatched the envelope from her hand and at almost the same instant shoved her to the floor and ran out of the building. Although the shove may have made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>it possible to \u201cby-pass\u201d her on the narrow stairway as appellant claims, it was obviously employed to create a condition to prevent Miss Homma from frustrating his act or thwarting him in his escape. Thus, to say that the force used was not part of the crime of robbery is to make an unwarranted distinction for the benefit of thieves, for their escape with the loot by means of force is as important in the commission of the crime as gaining possession of the property in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Robbery, being a combination of assault and larceny, also includes asportation; and the appropriation of another\u2019s property is a transaction which continues after the thief\u2019s departure from the place where the property was seized. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>36 Cal.App.2d 1 [97 P.2d 256].) Robbery is not completed at the moment the stolen property is in the robber\u2019s possession since the crime includes the element of asportation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Melendrez, </em>25 Cal.App.2d 490 [77 P.2d 870] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Raucho, </em>8 Cal.App.2d 655 [47 P.2d 1108].) In <em>MacGruer </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co., </em>89 Cal.App. 227 [264 P. 501], the construction of a payroll insurance policy was involved; the policy protected the insured against felonious taking by violence inflicted upon the person of the victim, the language of which conformed generally to the definition of robbery found in section 211. The following incident is reported : As money from a payroll was being passed from the hand of the victim to another employee, a voice said, \u201cI\u2019ll take this\u201d; whereupon, the hand of a stranger came between them and grabbed the money. Up to this point no force was used; however, when the victim, who had been startled by the incident, realized what had occurred he started pursuit; in his escape, to prevent capture and hinder his pursuer, the thief pulled a gun and fired several shots; because of the danger the victim ended the pursuit and the thief escaped. Said the court at page 237: \u201cThe entire transaction from the appearance of the hand to the last shot immediately preceding the escape constituted but one connected occurrence.\u201d It was reasoned that \u201cthe loss of the payroll was not in any sense due to the mere gaining of possession, but was the result of the violence used and fear engendered thereby\u201d (p. 238); and the court held that a robbery had been committed,  Although no fear existed in the ease at bar, it is clear that the loss of the envelope was due to more than the mere snatching of the same from the victim, but also to the force used to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>prevent her from interfering with defendant\u2019s possession of the stolen envelope and his escape with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Wood, P. J., and Fourt, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 27, 1961, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 24, 1962.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
