Offutt was convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon, and was later sentenced to imprisonment for a term of from three to ten years. April 10, 1956, he filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate the sentence on the ground that his counsel did not effectively assist him at the trial, in that he failed to call certain persons as witnesses, and failed to ask the victim of the assault to exhibit to the jury the scar on his leg which resulted from the shooting. This appeal is from the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">The record does not bear out Offutt\u2019s claim that the trial tactics of his counsel were such as to render his aid ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
