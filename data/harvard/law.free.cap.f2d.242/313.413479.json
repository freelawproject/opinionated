Pending appeal to a court of appeals, bail may be allowed by the trial judge, by the court of appeals, or by any judge thereof, or by the circuit justice, to run until final termination of the proceedings in all courts * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">It is not necessary under the amended rule as it was under the prior rule that the appeal involve \u201ca substantial question\u201d in order to entitle the appellant to bail. Ward v. United States, 1956, 76 S.Ct. 1063, 1065, 1 L.Ed.2d 25. We are satisfied from the affidavit of appellant\u2019s counsel that the appeal is not frivolous and was not taken for delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">It appears, however, that the district judge denied bail on quite another-ground. The district judge had before him a confidential probation report which revealed, according to the judge\u2019s remarks at the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion for bail, that appellant is a highly unstable individual who has no family in the Seattle area, no visible means of support and no home or property. It also appeared that appellant had been most uncooperative with the probation officials in giving information about himself, and that he \u201chad been well known to the narcotics officers for some period of time.\u201d The judge further noted that appellant apparently had \u00e1mple funds to provide him with means for absconding. In view of these considerations the trial judge decided that a bail bond would not adequately protect against the possibility of appellant\u2019s flight pending appeal, and denied bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">Mr. Justice Frankfurter, in denying bail under the amended rule where the trial judge had denied it on this ground said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-12\">\u201cThe granting of bail certainly presupposes confidence that a defendant will respond to the demands of justice. In fixing the amount of bail, Rule 46(c) explicitly adverts to the trustworthiness of a defendant. The bail must be of an amount to \u2018insure the presence of the defendant.\u2019 Impliedly, the likelihood that bail within tolerable limits will not insure this justifies denial of bail. One of the reasons that led the District Court to deny bail to Bowers and Ward was \u2018that there is considerable motivation for these defendants to flee the Court\u2019s jurisdiction and that they have ample means to accomplish this purpose.\u2019 I read this to mean that the District Judge felt that the likelihood of flight was a danger not to be disregarded. I cannot reject this conclusion of the District Court because it was based on confidential probation reports. * * * Such a judgment is, to be sure, a prophecy but I cannot sit as the district judge and make my own. Presumably, this reason of the District Court in denying bail was one of the considerations included in the \u2018reasons\u2019 for the action taken by the District Court which the Court of Appeals respected in not overruling \u2018the exercise of sound judgment\u2019 by the District Court. On this ground, I must deny the petition.\u201d Ward v. United States, 1956, 76 S.Ct. 1063, 1 L.Ed.2d 25, 27-28.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiL\">The motion for admission to bail pending appeal is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\">.
