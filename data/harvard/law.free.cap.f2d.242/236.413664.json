The paste was imported; and the Food and Drug Administration, after sampling it, issued \u201crelease notices\u201d that notified Customs officers that the tomato paste could enter the country. Anglo-American then accepted delivery. When it in turn delivered the paste to the government, federal officials once again inspected the paste, found that it did not satisfy the standards of the Food and Drug Administration, and ordered it destroyed. Anglo-American sues now on the ground that the negligence of officials of the Food and Drug Administration in sampling the tomato paste and in issuing \u201crelease notices\u201d induced it to accept the paste and thus suffer damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">This claim, it is clear, \u201carose out of\u201d the assertedly negligent representation of the quality of the tomato paste by federal employees. Such a claim is barred by Jones v. United States, 2 Cir., 207 F.2d 563, certiorari denied 347 U.S. 921, 74 S.Ct. 518, 98 L.Ed. 1075, which held that Section 2680(h) of the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C., excepted from liability negligent as well as intentional misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
