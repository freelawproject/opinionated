In the alternative, he urges that if it does purport to do so, it is a nullity because, (1) it went wholly beyond the issues made in the pleadings; (2) it is void for uncertainty and ambiguity; and (3) under the undisputed evidence, while appellant was a witness for the defendant in the suit, he was not and never became a party to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">The appellee, joining issue with appellant\u2019s contentions, insists that, upon the undisputed facts, the decree does purport to, and does in law, award against defendant a binding personal judgment. Pointing out that appellant\u2019s defense of an action to enforce the judgment constitutes a collateral attack upon it, and it is therefore governed by the general rules<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>such attacks, Freeman on Judgments, Sec. 310; Black v. Woodruff, 193 Ala. 327, 69 So. 97, Ann.Cas.1918C, 969, appellee insists that, under the undisputed facts, including the testimony of appellant, the court had jurisdiction, of the subject matter of the suit, the debt to the plaintiff, of the partnership, Delta-Smith Co., and of the person of the defendant, an active member of that partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">We agree with the appellee that defendant became a party to the action, not only formally by reason of the answer and cross-bill filed by his counsel, but in substance and actuality by reason of defendant\u2019s personal, active, and open participation in the cause as defendant and cross-plaintiff, and his failure to promptly disavow the activities conducted by his associates and his counsel in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Pointing to the undisputed facts as shown by appellant\u2019s own testimony, that, as defendant and cross-plaintiff in the Tennessee action, he was active in it, expecting \u201cto have to pay a part of the judgment if it was recovered and to get part of the proceeds from the cross-bill if it was recovered\u201d, the district judge correctly declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">\u201cHe was then under every obligation, legal and otherwise, if this was not his position in this lawsuit, and it came to his knowledge that was what was happening, to state frankly to the Court he had not authorized counsel to file such a proceeding and was not responsible for it. He didn\u2019t do that. He went ahead and tried the lawsuit with his pleadings there, with his knowledge that the pleadings were there, and thus undertook to defeat recovery on the part of the original plaintiff, and undertook to assist in the recovery from which he would have benefited in the sum of eleven thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-15\">\u201cIt seems to me that the entire proposition puts him voluntarily in the law-suit for all purposes for which the lawsuit was filed. It is true he was not directly named as a party in the beginning, but it was clearly stated in the pleadings that the Smiths were not the only parties who were there, and it seems to me his acts were simply to come in and say, \u2018I\u2019m one of the parties not named, I claim the benefit of the cross-bill, and I desire to join in and seek to defeat the judgment.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-16\">\u201cIn my judgment, that made him a party for all purposes to the lawsuit, and I think he is bound by the judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-17\">In so stating and declaring, he merely gave effect to established principles, indeed hornbook law. Black on Judgments, Sec. 541; Freeman on Judgments, Sec. 431; 30 C.J.S. Equity, \u00a7 140, p. 571. One who comes into court seeking, relief against the plaintiff by cross-bill or counter claim and actively presses his claim thereby invokes the court\u2019s jurisdiction in the case so that he cannot thereafter question the authority of the court to pass upon all questions raised between himself and his adversary. 3 Am. Jur., \u201cAppearances\u201d See. 11; Merchants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Heat &amp; Light Co. v. James B. Clow &amp; Sons, 204 U.S. 286, 27 S.Ct. 285, 51 L.Ed. 488; Freeman on Judgments, Sec. 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">While under defendant\u2019s testimony and the finding of the court, it cannot be here contended that he did not know of, and was not a party to, the actions of his counsel in defending and prosecuting the suit on his behalf, even if it could be contended that they began without his knowledge, it was his duty, as soon as he learned of them, to promptly disaffirm the actions or be estopped thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">As appellee, in its brief points out, \u201cThe equities of the present case make in themselves a strong argument for the reasonableness and justice of the rule invoked by appellee and applied by the district judges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The appellant was no victim of a judgment by default or a judgment in a partially litigated proceeding. As shown by the exhibits, the case was thoroughly prepared on behalf of all parties, carefully tried, and ably presented to the chancellor. The appellee, as defendant and cross complainant in the suit, appeared by counsel and present in person while the proof by deposition was being taken. He asserted and assumed the position of defendant and likewise asserted his own claim against appellee. He undertook to prove it by numerous witnesses and raised no question indicating an unwillingness to submit to the jurisdiction. Able counsel argued his case before the chancellor who, after due consideration, delivered judgment. Only after appellant was cast did it occur to him to question the jurisdiction of the chancellor over the issues raised between him and his adversary or over the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">That part of the record in the Chancery Court which has been put in evidence here contradicts appellant\u2019s present assertion that he did not know he was a litigant in the original proceeding. It is not contended that those who represented him in Tennessee were not able and conscientious practitioners. Indeed his counsel stated, upon the record that the firm of Crouch, Manier &amp; White, which represented appellee, is \u201cas reputable a firm as there is in the United States, and that each member of that firm is a capable A-l lawyer\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">The judgment was right. It is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-14\">. Entered May 6, 1955, in the Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, for $23,521.16, with interest from Aug. 22, 1950, it recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-16\">\u201cThis cause came on to be heard before Honorable Thomas A. Shiver, Chancellor, upon the original bill of complaint, the answer and cross-bill of the defendants named in the original bill and the answer and cross-bill of such defendants together with W. S. Kincade, Eva D. Kincade, and Robert P. Kincade answering as partners in the Delta-Smith Company, a partnership, the answer to said cross-bills, the amendment to the original bill, the order allowing defendants\u2019 answers to be treated as answers to the original bill as amended, the supplemental answer of the defendants to the original bill as amended, the exhibits to the original bill and to the original bill as amended, the depositions taken and filed by the respective parties together with the exhibits thereto, the stipulation of parties, the whole record in the cause, and arguments of counsel;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-25\">It then found that the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s bill were, and the allegations of the cross-bills were not, sustained by the proof, and that complainant sold and delivered merchandise in the amount adjudged to defendants and cross-complainants and had not been paid therefor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-26\">Based on said findings, the judgment ordered that complainant have and recover of the defendants and cross-complainants, and each of them, the sum adjudged; and recited that all the defendants and cross-complainants excepted and prayed an appeal therefrom.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b383-27\">. \u201cThere is little, if any, dispute about the facts of this case and the decision of the case will turn largely upon the record of the proceedings in the Chancery Court of Davidson County, Tennessee, wherein the appellee obtained the purported judgment against the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>and upon the oral testimony of the appellant in the court below. The principal question presented was whether the Tennessee judgment awards or purports to award the appellee a judgment against the appellant and, if so, whether such said Tennessee judgment is valid insofar as it purports to award the appellee a recovery against the appellant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b384-3\">, These, as shown by the oral testimony of appellant and others and the exhibits are:</p>\n<p id=\"ASL\">Prior to 1950, the appellant, Eva Kincade (his wife) and Robert P. Kincade (his brother), all residents of Coahoma County, Mississippi, constituted a partnership doing business as Delta Construetion Company, engaged m constructing power hues At the same time, H. E.

Smith, all residents of Davidson County, Ten- ..... , ,. . . nessee, constituted a partnership, doin<em>g </em>business as Smith Construction Company ... . engaged also m constructing power lines<em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AQN\">The members of these two partnerships combined in a joint venture known as Delta-Smith Company, organized solely for the purpose^ of constructing power hues m two projects, one in North Dakota and one m Wisconsin. There was no relationship or connection between the Delta Construction Company and the Smith Construction Company or the Delta-Smith Company, except that the partners <em>m the </em>Delta Construction Company and the partners m the Smith Construction Company were members of and participants m the joint venture known as Delta-Smith Company The books, records and activities of the Delta Construction Company were entirely separate and distinct from those of the Delta-Smith Company. Neither the Delta Construction Company nor the Delta-Smith Company ever did any business <em>or had any </em>contracts or property m the State of Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"AGr\">\n<em>In the course of its activities, the joint venture known as Delta-Smith Company had certain transactions with the appellee. It was these transactions which resulted in the filing of the action by appellee in the Chancery Court of Davidson County, Tennessee.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A1B7\">Appellant\u2019s Exhibit \u201cA\u201d was the original bill filed by the appellee in the Chancery Court of Davidson County, Tennessee, on Aug. 22, 1950. The only designation therein of the defendants in said cause appears in the caption to said bill, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"Av-\">\u201cJeffrey-DeWitt Insulator Corporation, a West Virginia Corporation, whose principal office is kept at Kenova, Wayne County, West Virginia, Complainant,</p>\n<p id=\"ACM\">VS.</p>\n<p id=\"AST\">\u201cH.

Nor was the original , fil , . m ^ . , bill filed m the Tennessee court amended so as to name tbe appeiiant as a party defendant</p>\n<p id=\"As1\">There was filed in the TennesSee court an answel. aad supplemental answer of H&gt; E. Smith, Jr W. B. Smith and Kenneth A. Smith, individually, and as partners in gmith Construction Company, in which they denied individual ^j^y. Also there wag filed ia gaid caase aa answer and cross.bm in tlle name of Smith Construction Company and Delta Construction Company acting as co-adventurers under the name of Delta-Smith Company. In the body of this answer and cross-bill it was stated that H. E. Smith, Jr.f W. B. Smith and Kenneth A. Smith, partners doing business under the partnerghip name of gmith Construction Company, together with Eva D. Kincade&gt; Robert p_ Kincade&gt; and appeiiant, doing business under tbe partnership name of Delta 0onatrnction Company, bad erl(.ered \u00a1nto a joint venture under the name of Delta-Smith Company, out of which venture the alleged indebtedness sued for arose.</p>\n<p id=\"ARN\">While this answer and cross-bill was sigped 0Ddy by H. E. gmith) Jr-j it was filed by the counsel for the Delta-Smith Co., to whom appellant in his deposition referred as \u201cour counsel\u201d, and while he stated that he had never authorized anyone to do anything for him in the way of entering the appearance which was entered in his behalf, or including him in the answer and cross-bill which was filed, he also stated that he had not only testified in his own behalf but had produced other witnesses who testified for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>him and had furnished Ms counsel with information to draw the answer and cross-bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Questioned, \u201cI will ask you if, when you discussed this ease with your counsel, if both you and Mr. Smith made a full and complete disclosure of all the facts known to you on the facts you are now testifying to?\u201d, he answered, \u201cYes, Sir\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">In answer to the question, \u201cWhat was your interest in that litigation?\u201d, he testified, \u201cI wanted to see the Smiths win the lawsuit.\u201d, because if they lost it ho expected them to look to him for contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Asked, \u201cWhat part did you take in the lawsuit?\u201d, he stated, \u201cI testified in it and I furnished all the records they had. In fact, we were keeping the books for Delta-Smith Co. at that time, and at the time of the lawsuit I furnished all the records I could.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">He also made it clear that he knew all about the issues involved in the lawsuit on the answer and cross-bill and discussed the ease with <em>his </em>counsel and made a full and complete disclosure of all the facts known to him, that he knew, that Ms counsel was arguing the ease for Delta-Smith Company and that he would have had to share part of the loss of the claim against Delta-Smith and would have claimed part of the cross-bill of some $11,000 if it had been recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">He further testified that long before the judgment was entered he knew that his name appeared in the answer and cross-hill and that he made no effort to withdraw it therefrom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b385-11\">. \u201cA.
