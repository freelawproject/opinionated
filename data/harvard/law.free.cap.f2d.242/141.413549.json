The attorney in particular was highly successful in obtaining a reversal from us of the dismissal below of his action to recover a preference, Margolis v. Gem Factors Corp., 2 Cir., 201 F.2d 803, and then, after a trial and judgment, in recovering ultimately $5,000 on this claim, as well as some $1,600 in other matters. These sums, together with funds turned over by a receiver, yielded a balance of $15,219.26; but the priority tax claim of the United States was $22,205.29, leaving nothing for the general claims of about $76,000. Even though these professional services were well performed and helpful, we think the only realistic course in bankruptcy collections is that allowances must be limited \u2014 as they are by customary practice \u2014 to a reasonable percentage of the recovery. In view of the substantial proportion of the recovery here granted, we cannot say that Judge Murphy\u2019s reasoned conclusion requiring some reduction constitutes error as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
