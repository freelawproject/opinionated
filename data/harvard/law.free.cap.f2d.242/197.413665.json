Appellant, the junior party, hereinafter called \u201cWest,\u201d filed an application to register \u201cSavole\u201d for liquid soap on February 18,1952. Registration was refused because of appellee\u2019s prior registration of \u201cSavol\u201d for hand cleaning cream, No. 512,632 of July 19, 1949, issued on an application filed August 14, 1948, to Samuel A. Onorato doing business as Yaltex Products Company. Appellee will hereinafter be referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>by various combinations of the several Onorato brothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">West, claiming use since January 1, 1915, requested an interference, which was instituted. Both parties took testimony. The Examiner of Interferences found that West\u2019s evidence established \u201ccontinuous use by the junior party of its mark since many years prior to any use to which the senior party is here entitled\u201d and adjudged West to be entitled to registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">On appeal to the Commissioner of Patents the decision of the Examiner of Interferences was reversed on the ground that West had failed to meet the burden of proof upon it to show that it had rights in \u201cSavoie\u201d superior to the rights of Valtex in \u201cSavol\u201d and appeal was taken to this court. No questions have been raised as to the similarity of the marks or of the goods and the only issue is which party is entitled to registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The burden of proof is, of course, upon the junior party, West, to show that it is entitled to the registration it seeks and, as against a registered mark, doubts are to be resolved against it. Baker Co. v. Lebow Brothers, 150 F.2d 580, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1206, and Brewster-Ideal Chocolate Co. v. Dairy Maid Confectionery Co., 62 F.2d 844, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">At the outset there is a question of what West, as junior party, must prove to meet the burden upon it. The opinion of the Commissioner says (105 US PQ 126, 127):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">\"The burden is on the applicant to establish prior and continuous use of its mark on its goods.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">The brief for Valtex states it somewhat differently, urging that West must establish not only priority of use but also either that it was using the mark continuously from the priority date it has established, or at least from a date prior to the date established by Valtex, until West\u2019s own filing date. West\u2019s brief appears to be confused on the question of what must be proved and says at one point, \u201cAll that the junior party had to prove, was to prove a date prior to 1948 [the earliest date established by Valtex] and instead of that * * * it went back to 1915 * * *\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b252-15\">Neither the Commissioner\u2019s opinion nor the briefs of the parties cite any authority on the question of what must be proved by the junior party to sustain its burden. Since we deem the nature of the burden of the junior party to be of decisive importance we shall state our view as to what it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-16\"> West is an applicant seeking registration. Valtex, a registrant, is in the position of having, <em>prima, facie, </em>superior rights by virtue of an earlier filing date than West, which rights must be overcome. Our view is that in this interference West must show that at the time when Valtex filed (assuming no earlier trademark rights to be established by Valtex) West was already in a position to register its mark, had it chosen to do so. Under Sec. 1 of the Trade-Mark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1051, West, to have been entitled to registration at that time, would have had to be able to state in its application \u201cthat the mark <em>is in use </em>in commerce.\u201d (Emphasis ours.) In other words, a mark which is not in use cannot be registered. A mere showing by West of trademark use at some earlier time is not sufficient. Motlow v. Oldetyme Distillers, Inc., 88 F.2d 732, 24 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1094, at page 1097. (That case involved the TradeMark Act of 1905 but it contained the same requirement of present use at the time of applying for registration as the 1946 Act involved here.) On the other hand, it would be going too far to say that West must prove continuity of use from its <em>first </em>use. It is sufficient to meet the burden of proof if the junior party establishes that it was actually making trademark use of the mark at, or shortly prior to, the time when the senior party commenced to use it, as shown by the senior party\u2019s established date. The crux of the matter is proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>of use by the junior party at the time the senior party entered the field, in which case the senior party\u2019s <em>prima, facie </em>right is defeated. We turn now to a consideration of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"A--\">The date established by Valtex as its first use of \u201cSavol\u201d on hand cleaning cream we may take as sometime in 1948, which is definite enough for the purposes of our decision. This is tantamount to reliance on the filing date of the Onorato (Valtex) application, August 14, 1948. The first use \u201cin commerce\u201d alleged in that application was July 15, 1948. No earlier date is asserted in the brief for Valtex. The brief for West treats \u201c1948\u201d as the date established by Valtex.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The evidence produced by West has been accurately summarized and ably analyzed in the Commissioner\u2019s opinion (105 USPQ 126). We see no need to restate it here.</p>\n<p id=\"ATlE\">We are satisfied that West sold liquid soap under the trademark \u201cSavole\u201d during a period of years commencing possibly as early as 1915, the date alleged in its application, although the first sale established by evidence was in 1921. The latest activity with respect to the mark to be found in the entire record was the purchase in 1939 of 2,000 \u201cSavole\u201d labels, excluding activity after 1948 in which year appellee filed its application.</p>\n<p id=\"AkMl\">The witness who, according to the record, appears to have been most familiar with West\u2019s business, its Vice-President and Secretary, testified that at his attorney\u2019s request he had made a search of West\u2019s records to see what, if any, records he could find \u201cpertaining to the use and sale of \u2018Savole\u2019 liquid soap.\u201d The only such records produced were in the period 1921-1934, and showed sales of not over 233 gallons in their entire 13 year period. Although sales records of \u201cSavole\u201d during the period from 1934 to 1948 appear to have been either available or known to the witness, he neither produced one nor stated what it would show. He was testifying in the board room of his own company and presumably records were readily available to him. Though the witness testified that in most cases records over six years old were destroyed, the 1948 sales records would not have been destroyed by 1953, when he was testifying, yet none was produced for this critical period nor even an estimate of sales for that year given.</p>\n<p id=\"ADg\">As stated in the Commissioner\u2019s opinion, both the board chairman and the vice-president of West testified that the \u201cSavole\u201d mark had been used \u201ccontinuously\u201d since it was adopted, or since the witness had been with the company, but the record does not show what either witness or West\u2019s counsel meant by \u201ccontinuously used.\u201d The reason we cannot accept this kind of evidence as proof of trademark use in the years preceding 1948 is that \u201ccontinuous use\u201d is a conclusion of law requiring the existence of circumstances with which these witnesses were not shown to be conversant. As laymen, their testimony could be quite consistent, in their minds, with use from 1915 or 1921 to 1939 and non-use until a resumption of sales in 1951 which were continuing at the time they testified. Most of the testimony that was elicited on this point was merely affirmative answers to lead-questions.</p>\n<p id=\"AWG\">The only other evidence relied on by West to show continuous use is the testimony of the label printer who produced the single record showing the printing of 2,000 \u201cSavole\u201d labels in 1939 after being asked to \u201cmake an examination \u00b01 the records of your company to find out whether you could find any record of \u2018Savole\u2019 labels being printed,\u201d which he said he did. The testimony West relies on is the following cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWU\">\u201cXQ67. Mr. Miller, you do not have any record of any labels for the word \u2018Savoie\u2019 printed for West between the card, Exhibit 3, of June 1939, and the label Exhibit 1, do you? A. Yes, I have from 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, right up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>to the present time. I can bring every one of the cards out, if you want me to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\">\u201cXQ68. Are those cards for \u2018Savoie\u2019? A. Yes, they are for \u2018Savoie.\u2019 They asked me for my earliest record and that is my earliest record, but I have records up until the present time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">He was not requested to nor did he produce any records after 1939. The evidentiary value of this testimony is weakened by the fact that he printed, he said, approximately 300 different labels for West. When asked if he printed for West liquid soap labels other than \u201cSavoie\u201d labels he named one other and said, \u201cThere are so many others, I just can\u2019t start giving you them. I can\u2019t remember which is which.\u201d The printer\u2019s testimony taken as a whole does not convince us that \u201cSavoie\u201d labels were in fact printed between 1939 and 1948. At least we have a doubt, which must be resolved against the junior party. If the other records testified to by the printer really existed, it was incumbent on West to produce them.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">One other witness produced by West was the foreman of its chemical department, in their employ since 1924. He testified that he had been making \"Savole\u201d and had seen the company make and sell it \u201csince\u201d he had been with the company and produced and identified various formula books and records of \u201cSavole\u201d samples sent out for test. All of these records are in the period 1918-1935. All that the formula books show is how to make up \u201cSavole\u201d, a simple matter of diluting \u201cconcentrated soap\u201d with water. Neither the witness nor the documents produced in connection with his testimony proved the production of \u201cSavole\u201d liquid soap in any particular quantity at any particular time nor, even by inference, any production at all after 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">On the entire record, we are of the opinion that West has failed to sustain its burden of proof in that it has not shown any use of \u201cSavole\u201d during a period of several years prior to the 1948 filing date of Valtex.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">JACKSON, J., retired, recalled to participate in place of COLE, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b254-12\">WORLEY, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AaQ\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">I am of the opinion that the evidence presented by appellant, consisting largely of conclusions and general statements not supported by satisfactory documentary evidence, is insufficient to sustain the burden resting upon it as junior party. Solely for that reason do I concur in the affirmance of the decision appealed from.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
