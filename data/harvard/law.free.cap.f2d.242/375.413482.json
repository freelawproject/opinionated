It further asserted that the claim was entitled to <em>priority </em>as a claim for \u201cwages\u201d pursuant to Section 64, sub. a(2) of the Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A petition to expunge the Fund\u2019s claim was filed with the Referee by the trustee of the bankrupt. Prior to a hearing on the petition, a stipulation of facts was entered into and the amount of the claim was reduced to $993.75. The claimant\u2019s right to priority for the reduced amount, as a claim for \u201cwages,\u201d was contested before the Referee. He sustained the trustee\u2019s contention that the claim was not a wage claim and was not entitled to priority. He allowed the claim only as a general claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-25\">On a petition to review the Referee\u2019s determination, the District Court sustained the Referee\u2019s ruling and entered an order accordingly. The issue is now before this Court on an appeal by the Fund from the District Court\u2019s order. The City of New York, a tax claimant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>joins with the trustee in opposing the Fund\u2019s claim to priority. So does the Government, also a tax claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">A form of collective bargaining agreement between Local 140 and Sleep Products, Inc. (Ex. C annexed to the Stipulation of Fact) contained the usual provisions in relation to the hiring of employees, hours of employment, rates of compensation, days to be defined as legal holidays, vacation pay, and the deduction from the wages' of the employee of an appropriate amount for \u201cdues\u201d payable to the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Paragraph Thirty-second of the agreement contained provisions for payments to be made by the employer to Local 104 Security Fund and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">\u201cThirty-second: The Employer hereby agrees, as long as this agreement remains in effect, to pay monthly on or before the tenth day of each month, a sum equal to 6% of the monthly gross payroll of the employees in the bargaining unit, to Local 140 Security Fund, for the purpose of financing a Security Plan for the benefit of the employees of the Employer' within the bargaining unit. At the same time the Employer shall forward a report setting forth the figures upon which payment is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">\u201cCommencing February. 15th, 1953, the Employer agrees to pay an additional one-half (%%) per cent to the Local 140 Security Fund, the sum to be applicable to the Welfare provisions of the Security Fund, making it a total of six and one-half (6%%) per cent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asf\">\u201cThe employer further agrees to make the aforesaid monthly remittances to the .Local 140 Security Fund at its offices and that each monthly payment shall be. based upon the gross payroll of the employees in the bargaining unit for the preceding month.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-12\">\u201cIt is understood that the social benefits to be provided will meet the requirements of all applicable laws and will satisfy the Employer\u2019s obligations under the New York State Disability Law, without further obligation on the part of the Employer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-13\">\u201cIt is agreed that Local 140 Security Fund will be administered in compliance with the provisions of all applicable laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">The Referee, in expunging the claim as a priority claim, based his decision on Judge Brennan\u2019s ruling in a similar case, Matter of Brassel, D.C.N.D.N.Y., 135 F.Supp. 827,</p>\n<p id=\"b430-15\">In the Brassel case Judge Brennan held that a creditor, a union welfare trust fund, making a claim against Brassel\u2019s estate based on his failure as an employer to pay to the union\u2019s welfare fund 5% of the gross payroll of all employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, was not entitled to priority on itsi claim as a wage claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-16\">In affirming Referee Lowenthal\u2019s order in the case at bar Judge Herlands wrote a well-considered opinion, D.C., 141 F. Supp. 463, and concluded that any .enlargement of the term \u201cwages\u201d in Section 64, sub. a(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, so as to include payments made by an employer to a Welfare Fund under a collective bargaining agreement, should be left to Congressional action through an amendment to the Act. To support that view he cites what the New York State Legislature did in 1952, in amending Section 22 of the Debtor and Creditor Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 12 to include in the definition of \u201cwages or salaries\u201d the contributions of employers to insurance or welfare benefits, and to pension and annuity funds. Claims of Welfare Funds for unpaid sums due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>from the employer are granted a preference in the administration of the estate of an employer who make a General Assignment for the benefit of his creditors under the New York statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Prior to the July 1952 amendment of Section 22 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law, judges of the State Supreme Court had rendered conflicting opinions on the right of a Welfare Fund to a preference similar to the preference given wage claims in a proceeding under a Genera] Assignment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the Federal Court we now have conflicting opinions in the District Courts on the right of Welfare Funds to a wage claim priority against a bankrupt employer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Judge Brennan\u2019s opinion in the Brassel case has been the subject of commentary notes in two Law Reviews. The Georgia Bar Journal of August 1956 (Vol. XIX, Number 1) pp. 107-108, disagreed with Judge Brennan\u2019s opinion. The article stated that the opinion seemed to minimize the idea of partial benefit to the employee (who would cease to derive any benefit upon a lapse in union membership) and to disregard the connection between the payments to the fund and the work done.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The article in the Chicago-Kent Law Review, Vol. XXXIV (1955-1956) pp. 235-239 agreed with Judge Brennan\u2019s disposition of the Brassel case and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">\u201cThe conclusion reached in the instant case, therefore, seems to be an inescapable one even under the most liberal construction of all of the terms of the relevant portions of the statute for the claimant was not a workman, or an assignee of a workman; the sum claimed did not represent wages in the ordinary sense of the term; and the amount payable while measured by the amount of wages earned, formed no more than a contractual obligation owed to a third person. * * * If the fringe benefits now common under modern mass employment contracts are to be protected against the impact of bankruptcy, substantial revision would have to be made both in the statutory language and in the fundamental concepts concerning priorities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">Judge Herlands\u2019 opinion in the case at bar has been discussed in a rather extensive note in 66 Yale Law Journal, No. 3, pp. 449 to 461. The author states that \u201cfrom the standpoint of legislative intent, however, the Sleep opinion may appear to be on solid ground.\u201d * * * \u201cThe courts, however, should ascribe a broader purpose to the wage priority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">To follow that suggestion would lead to as many different judicial opinions as there are different forms of collective bargaining agreements containing provisions for payments to Welfare Funds. Some contain an assignment of a portion of the workmen\u2019s wages as a payment to the Welfare Fund. In re Ross, D.C., 117 F.Supp. 346. There is a sound basis for a claim of priority by the assignee, the Welfare Fund, in such a case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> although the determination of the amount of its claim, if the employees also have filed claims for unpaid wages, may present some difficulty. Other collective bargaining agreements, such as in the case at bar, provide only for a payment by the employer to the Welfare Fund, with no assignment or deduction from the workmen\u2019s wages. An intermediate class, contains a combination of payments by the workman and by the employer to the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-15\">The claim in its origin must be one for wages due to a workman, to be entitled to priority under Sec. 64, sub. a(2). If it is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>the right of priority carries over to the workman\u2019s assignee. If the claim was never a part of his wages and was never a sum due to him, it would not be entitled to priority; and no theory of an indirect conditional benefit to him can give it priority. \u201cThe priority is attached to the debt, and not to the. person of the creditor; to the claim, and not to the claimant.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">In Nathanson v. National Labor Relations Board, 344 U.S. 26, 73 S.Ct. 80, 97 L.Ed. 23, Mr. Justice Douglas, writing the majority opinion, denied claims of the Board for back pay awards made under Section 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(c), to fifth class priority as a claim of the United States under Section 64, sub. a(5) of the Bankruptcy Act. The claims were genuine claims for wages but they could not meet the priority requirement of having accrued within three months of the employer\u2019s bankruptcy under Section 64, sub. a(2). The opinion stated, 344 U.S. at pages 28-29, 73 S.Ct. at page 82:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS1\">\u201cThe Board argues that the interest of the United States in eradicating unfair labor practices is so great that the back pay order should be given the additional sanction of priority in payment. Whether that should be done is a legislative decision. The contest now is no longer between employees and management but between various classes of creditors. The policy of the National Labor Relations Act is fully served by recognizing the claim for back pay as one to be paid from the estate. The question whether it should be paid in preference to other creditors is a question to be answered from the Bankruptcy Act. When Congress came to claims for unpaid wages it did not grant all of them priority. It limited the priority to $600 for each claimant and even then only allowed it as respects wages earned within three months before the date of the commencement of the proceedings. \u00a7 64, sub. a(2). We would depart from that policy if we granted the priority to one class of wage claimants irrespective of the amount of the claim or the time of its accrual. The theme of the Bankruptcy Act is \u2018equality of distribution\u2019, Sampsell v. Imperial Paper &amp; Color Corp., 313 U.S. 215, 219, 61 S.Ct. 904, 907, 85 L.Ed. 1293; and if one claimant is to be preferred over others, the purpose should be clear from the statute. We can find in the Bankruptcy Act no warrant for giving these back pay awards any different treatment than other wage claims enjoy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">What were specified in the collective bargaining agreement, Exhibit C, as payments by the employer to Local 140 Security Fund under paragraphs Thirty-second and Thirty-third, created only a debtor and creditor obligation between the employer and third parties, for something other than wages. The language of the statute granting priority to wages cannot be stretched so as to embrace this type of claim. If every type of payment made by an employer to a union welfare fund is to be given priority as a claim for \u201cwages\u201d under Section 64, sub. a(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, that should be done through the legislative action of the Congress, and not by any judicial mislabeling of such payments as \u201cwages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-16\">. \u201c\u00a7 64.
