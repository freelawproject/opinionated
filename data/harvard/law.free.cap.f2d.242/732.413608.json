We held the domestic rate applicable and affirmed a decision by the District Court in favor of the carrier. United States v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R. Co., 4 Cir., 224 F.2d 443. The Supreme Court granted certiorari, 350 U.S. 953, 76 S.Ct. 343, 100 L.Ed. 830, reversed our judgment and remanded the case to us for further proceedings in the light of its opinions in this case and the case of United States v. Western Pacific R. Co. See 352 U.S. 77, 77 S.Ct. 172, 1 L.Ed.2d 140 and 352 U.S. 59, 77 S.Ct. 161, 1 L.Ed.2d 126. There is nothing in the record before us that was not in the record before the Supreme Court, even when we look to the record in United States v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co., 4 Cir., 215 F.2d 213; and, since the Supreme Court has said that the case should be determined upon a full record, we shall remand it for further proceedings to the District Court. In view, however, of the holding of the Supreme Court that the reasonableness of the application of a tariff as well as the reasonableness of rates prescribed therein may \u201cinvolve such acquaintance with rate making and transportation factors as to make the issue initially one for the Interstate Commerce Commission,\u201d we think that the District Court should stay proceedings in the case to enable the parties to begin a proceeding before the Commission for the determination of the question as to the application of tariffs involved herein. The judgment below will accordingly be vacated and the case will be remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">Judgment vacated and cause remanded with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
