Plaintiff challenged the deficiency assessment underlying a Federal tax lien, 68A Stat. 779, I.R.C.1954, \u00a7 6322, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6322.

Co., Inc., * * * filed with the Tax Court of the United States a petition for review of the assessment complained of in this action.\u201d With what has been said thus far, we clear our opinion of several technical statutory steps which might otherwise be overlooked. \u25a0 \u2022 ! , l \u2019 s I ;</p>\n<p id=\"Apph\">This appeal lends itself to three main divisions: t</p>\n<p id=\"ANO\">(I) The nature and purpose of jeopardy assessments and, (II) The unequivocal prohibitory language<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> found in \u00a7 7421 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 68A Stat. 876, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7421, and (III) Allowance of plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Normally jurisdictional questions demand primary attention. But under the circumstances of this case we think it advisable to first examine the jeopardy assessment phase. . ; <em>[ </em>, <em>T </em>3 j.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Under \u00a7 6201 of the I.R.C. of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6201 the Secretary <em>l t </em>of the Treasury or his delegate make the inquiries, determinations, and assessments of all taxes (including interest, additional amounts, additions to the tax, and assessable penalties) imposed by the Code and \u201c * * * assess all taxes determined by the taxpayer or by the Secretary or his delegate as to which returns or lists are made * * That section is implemented by another provision, \u00a7 6204, embodying this general rule: \u201cThe Secretary or his delegate may, at any time within the period prescribed for assessment, make a supplemental assessment whenever it is ascertained that any assessment is imper-feet or incomplete in any material respect.\u201d Section 6204 in the present Code contains no material change from existing law. Limitations on assessment and collection are governed by provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 6501-6503, in Chapter 66 of the Code. Two other integral parts of the Code should also be noted: \u201c\u00a7 6202. * * * If the mode or time for the assessment of any internal revenue tax (including interest, additional amounts, additions to the tax, and assessable penalties) is not otherwise provided for, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Secretary or his delegate may establish the same by regulations,\u201d and \u201c\u00a7 6203. * * * The assessment shall be made by recording the liability of the taxpayer in the office of the Secretary or his delegate in accordance with rules or regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate. Upon request of the taxpayer, the Secretary or his delegate shall furnish the taxpayer a copy of the record of the assessment.\u201d In other words, in this case, by filing its return plaintiff\u2019s corporate predecessor made, as do most taxpayers, its self-assessment. If the initial return is accepted, income tax is paid and collected on the basis of a taxpayer\u2019s own assessment, made pursuant to the relevant statutory provisions and regulations. After filing a tax return and on dispute, but before ultimate disposition there are various administrative steps and procedures within the structure of the Internal Revenue Service. But even during the period of such administrative activity the Commissioner may invoke the statutory weapon, jeopardy assessment, for the purpose of insulating the collection of the taxes, claimed of a particular taxpayer, against loss or prejudice. See, e.g., Brown Wheeler Co. v. Commissioner, 1930, 21 B.T.A. 755.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-20\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>In its Report accompanying H.R. 8300 (A Bill to Revise the Internal Revenue Laws of the United States) the Senate Finance Committee stated: \u201cThis section [\u00a7 7421], which is identical with that of the House bill, contains no material change in existing law, except that subsection (b) is extended to conform to the extended authority, in section 0901 (a) (2), to assess transferee liability.\u201d Sen.Rep.

But we are merely tracing a statutory pattern and round out our view of this aspect of the Code by pointing up \u00a7\u00a7 7403(a), 6331, 6332(a) and (b), and 6335 governing foreclosure and enforcement of liens and suits against persons served with notices of levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">By his motion and answer the District Director persistently questioned the district court\u2019s jurisdiction, though recognizing that prevailing case law has, on occasion, paliated the strictures Congress enacted in \u00a7 7421. While a jurisdictional challenge meets us at the outset it can be resolved only by determining whether plaintiff\u2019s case qualifies for relief under some head of equity jurisdiction. Precedent reflects a case to case approach in situations where courts have previously resolved issues arising under \u00a7 7421 and its antecedent enactments. The section has a long pedigree; its purpose has been frequently explained.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When compelling factual reasons were established, in various earlier cases, federal courts have by-passed \u00a7 7421, taken jurisdiction and exercised their equity powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-20\">Both parties in this appeal point up the decision pivoting on inapplicability of \u00a7 7421 (formerly R.S. \u00a7 3224) to the particular facts before the court when Miller v. Standard Nut Margarine Co., 1932, 284 U.S. 498, 52 S.Ct. 260, 264, 76 L.Ed. 422, was decided. That case is a singular example when \u201cby reason of * * * special and extraordinary facts and circumstances, section 3224 [now \u00a7 7421] [did] not apply.\u201d The suit leading up to the Miller opinion was commenced December 26, 1929. About seven years earlier another manufacturer prevailed over the Collector of Internal Revenue in a case reported as Hig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>gins Mfg. Co. v. Page, D.C.R.I.1924, 297 F. 644; The Rhode Island District Court found that Higgins\u2019 product was not oleomargarine or taxable as such. As a result the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, promulgated the Higgins\u2019 case as Treasury Decision 3590 \u201cthus informing all concerned that the product was not subject to the tax.\u201d 234 U.S. 498, 505, 52 S.Ct. 260, 261. Several other federal courts subsequently granted relief to manufacturers who sought relief against the Collector who asserted taxability of products identical to the one involved in Higgins. After all this litigation the Commissioner, by letter, answered an inquiry made by the Standard Nut Margarine Co., advising it that its \u201cproduct would not be taxable as oleomargarine.\u201d The Miller background can now be described by repeating this passage from the opinion, 284 U.S. 498, 505, 52 S.Ct. 260, 261: \u201cRelying on the decision in Higgins Mfg. Co. v. Page, D.C., 297 F. 644, Treasury Decision 3590, the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s letter to the institute [of Margarine Manufacturers] and the injunctions * * * [Standard Nut Margarine Company] believed the product which it proposed to manufacture and sell would not be taxable as oleomargarine, and, upon receipt of [Commissioner\u2019s] letter, commenced manufacture and sale of the product.\u201d Afterward the product of Standard Nut Margarine was declared taxable by the Commissioner who demanded and threatened to collect a tax on it. \u201cThe enforcement of the Oleomargarine Act * * * would impose a tax that [Standard Nut Margarine Co.] would be unable to pay, would subject it to heavy penalties and the forfeiture of its plant, together with the materials and manufactured product on hand, and would destroy its business.\u201d 284 U.S. 498, 506-507, 52 S.Ct. 260, 262. We might also point out the stronger detailed factual background, of the Miller case, reported as Miller v. Standard Nut Margarine Co. of Florida, 5 Cir., 1931, 49 F.2d 79 where the Court of Appeals affirmed the decree perpetually enjoining the collector. Affirming the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision, the majority of Justices in the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">\u201cIndependently of, and in cases arising prior to, the enactment of the provision * * * which became Rev.St. \u00a7 3224 [now \u00a7 7421], this court, in harmony with the rule generally followed in courts of equity, held that <em>a suit will not lie to restrain the collection of a tax upon the sole ground of its </em>illegality. The principal reason is that, as courts are without authority to apportion or equalize taxes or to make assessments, such suits would enable those liable for taxes in some amount to delay payment or possibly to escape their lawful burden, and so to interfere with and thwart the collection of revenues for the support of the government. And this court likewise recognizes the rule that, in cases where complainant shows that <em>in addition </em>to the <em>illegality </em>of an exaction in the guise of a tax <em>there exist special and extraordinary circumstances </em>sufficient to bring the case within some acknowledged head of equity jurisprudence, a suit may be maintained to enjoin the <em>collector. </em>[Citing.] Section 3224 is declaratory of the principle first mentioned and is to be construed as near as may be in harmony with it and the reasons upon which it rests. [Citing.] The section does not refer specifically to the rule applicable to cases involving exceptional circumstances. The general words employed are not sufficient, and it would require specific language undoubtedly disclosing that purpose, to warrant the inference that Congress intended to abrogate that salutory and well-established rule. This court has given effect to section 3224 in a number of cases. [Citing.] It has never held the rule to be absolute, but has repeatedly indicated that extraordinary and exceptional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>circumstances render its provisions inapplicable.\u201d 284 U.S. 498, 509-510, 52 S.Ct. 260, 263. (Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">For the Miller case principles to become operative \u201cspecial and extraordinary circumstances\u201d must combine with illegality. After all the putative taxpayer seeking relief in the Miller case came into the district court armed with several judicial adjudications,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> an official letter, and Treasury Decision unanimously proclaiming non-taxability of the type of product produced by it. Relying upon that array of rulings for the prediction that its product was non-taxable under the Oleomargarine Act of August 2, 1886, 24 Stat. 209, as amended by the Act of May 9, 1902, 32 Stat. 194, the manufacturer invested capital and embarked on an enterprise \u2014 doomed to strangulation by administrative caprice, hence equitable relief was granted. The proposed tax was illegal. The Miller circumstances were exceptional even to the most jaundiced eye. From the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion it appears that \u201cAt the trial [Standard Nut Margarine Co.] introduced oral and documentary evidence, together with specimens of the product sought to be taxed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">But we are reviewing a case disposed of on summary judgment. Even if the district court has power to grant equitable relief the question of the correctness in doing so by summary judgment is a threshold one. Summary judgment procedure enables district judges to nip in the bud litigation which would wilt, if the case went forward to a trial on the merits, because there was no genuine issue as to any material fact.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">To be sure the language of Rule 56(c), Fed.Rules Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C., authorizes a judgment to be \u201crendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d But that is a deceptively simple statement for application in the setting of this case because depriving the defendant of trial hinges on whether \u201c \u2018there is the slightest doubt as to the facts.\u2019 \u201d Arnstein v. Porter, 2 Cir., 1946, 154 F.2d 464, 468; Campana Corporation v. Harrison, <em>7 </em>Cir., 1943, 135 F.2d 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">Arguing the propriety of the summary judgment in its favor, Homan relies on a passage from our earlier decision in Albert Dickinson Co. v. Mellos Peanut Co., 7 Cir., 1950, 179 F.2d 265. However, there the summary judgment was reversed and the cause remanded to the district court, and Chief Judge Duffy, delivering the opinion, suggested cautious invocation of Rule 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">To support its complaint for injunctive relief, Homan sought and obtained a deposition beginning on February 28, 1956, of the discovery witness, Charles J. Mammel. Mr. Mammel, bom in 1890, currently employed as a revenue agent in the Internal Revenue Service, had commenced working for the Service on February 2, 1920. He was a government witness in the prosecution partially reviewed and reported as United States v. Shotwell, 7 Cir., 1955, 225 F.2d 394. One of the affidavits presented on Homan\u2019s behalf referred to, and quoted from, another affidavit made by a Special Assistant to the Attorney General, filed April 6, 1953, by the government in connection with its motion for a continuance in that criminal trial. Portions of this latter affidavit relevant here follow :<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>\u201cThat Charles J. Mammel, CP A, age 63, is employed by the Bureau of Internal Revenue as a revenue agent and as such was assigned as chief revenue agent in the investigation of this cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\">\u201cThat on Sunday, March 29, 1953, at approximately 9:00 o\u2019clock P.M., while in the presence of the affiant and while engaged in the preparation of the trial of this cause, Mr. Mammel suffered a complete physical and mental breakdown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">\u201cThat since that date until the date hereof Mr. Mammel has been confined to his home, in bed, and has been receiving care and treatment from a Practitioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">\u201cThat on the date hereof, contrary to instructions but in view of the imminence of this case, Mr. Mammel attempted to return to his office but suffered a relapse, and is again confined to his home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">\u201cIt is further averred that Mr. Mammel, in view of his investigative information obtained in the past four years, is an indispensable witness and his presence is necessary for the conduct of the trial of this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Homan claims it was entitled to judgment below as a matter of law because the assessment of September 15, 1955 is arbitrary, capricious and violative of its right to due process. Taxpayer\u2019s reasoning underlying this critical aspect of the appeal runs roughly in this fashion. Mr. Mammel\u2019s incapacity reflected in the quoted passages, from the 1953 affidavit, is presumed to continue until the contrary has been demonstrated. Moreover, a variety of instances underscored by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, arising during the taking of Mr. Mammel\u2019s deposition, in 1956, allegedly manifest a mental state of mind inconsistent with such a contrary demonstration. Mr. Mammel\u2019s figures, according to Homan, constitute the basis of the assessment against it. But, in Homan's sights, some of the significant figures are unreliable since Mr. Mammel displayed little, if any, support for them while being interrogated in the discovery proceedings. Throughout that examination of the Agent, by Homan\u2019s counsel, the government sporadically invoked privilege as a bar to further questioning on phases of the challenged assessment. That discovery proceeding still remains uncompleted. Homan\u2019s motion for a partial release of funds blanketed by the jeopardy assessment was pending currently with the discovery proceeding of Mr. Mammel. After accumulating a lengthy series of questions propounded to and answers elicited from, the Agent, Homan in substance suggested to the district judge that enough of a demonstration had been made, cutting ground from under the assessment to permit the judge to act on either or both of the motions \u2014 for partial release of funds and summary judgment. Without ruling on the former pleading, summary judgment was allowed on the incompleted deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Granting relief despite the statutory-bar mandated by \u00a7 7421 would entail exercise of the district court\u2019s general equity jurisdiction. To deviate from that clear Congressional direction could be countenanced, if at all, only by adhering to case precedent. Congress left \u00a7 7421 (a) undisturbed in its sweeping revision of the Code during 1954. Assuming, without deciding, that there is enough sound case law authorizing equitable relief in the face of \u00a7 7421, we think peremptory relief through the vehicle of summary judgment was incorrect. Because if the court has equitable powers, regardless of \u00a7 7421, they are delineated by a handful of prior opinions making it necessary to determine if the Homan facts come within their ambit. For we think the judicial rubrics already inserted in \u00a7 7421 cannot wisely be multiplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Homan, in short, wants funds released urging that it cannot await review by the tax court of the basic assessment, coupled with its financial inability to furnish the statutory bond. Of course the tax court is the proper forum in which to contest this assessment and the only way such review could be circumvented is if the district court wields equitable powers potent enough to strike down the assessment. Proper regard for the salient principles lying behind the heirarchy of courts designated by Congress to deal with tax matters requires a cautionary mood in this case. Actually Ho-man bases its case on the theory that the assessment is so arbitrary and capricious that it is illegal, and for that reason warrants equitable relief. But we think an incomplete deposition, wanting in several important respects, fails to automatically obliterate the assessment so that permanent injunctive relief can flow from summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-19\">After reading this record we think the defense actually and in good faith controverted some critical allegations made in Homan\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It must be remembered that \u00a7 6861 is authorized when the collection of a deficiency \u201cwill be jeopardized by delay.\u201d Exigency is the matrix of that section. The defendant\u2019s answer contains affirmative allegations related to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase of \u00a7 6861.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-20\">It is clear that the use of a jeopardy assessment is a discretionary prerogative of the Secretary or his delegate. Under \u00a7 6861 the government official has power to act when he <em>believes </em>collection will be jeopardized by delay. His belief is justification for placing the statutory clamp on a taxpayer\u2019s assets. We think defendant\u2019s answer to the complaint, and brief, can be reduced to the following summary. Statutory assessments under the Code enjoy a presumption of validity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Homan as a business corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>is well within the taxability provisions of the Code and for that reason this appeal is distinguishable from Miller especially because, as defendant puts it: \u201cthat it [Homan] might be liable for taxes is not beyond the realm of possibility.\u201d Moreover, defendant insists there is a genuine issue of fact lurking in the case because Homan has failed in making any showing that it, in fact, owes no taxes for the calendar years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">A summary judgment proceeding is not a substitute for a trial, but rather a judicial search for determining whether genuine issues exist as to material facts. Hurd v. Sheffield Steel Corp., 8 Cir., 1950, 181 F.2d 269, 271, Dewey v. Clark, 1950, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 137, 180 F.2d 766, 772. The lower court cannot try out factual issues on a motion for summary judgment because once such an issue is found the court\u2019s function on that aspect of the case ends. There is statutory power to make a jeopardy assessment and levy in this case. The defense responded with its statutory assessment to plaintiff\u2019s allegations. The facts playing in, on or about the assessment are in issue and their presence is enough to prevent a summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">We are sending the ease back without further comment on the issue or issues of fact necessitating our reversal. When litigants are to proceed again at the trial level with a cause after our review it is essential that the case arrive below without furnishing fuel to fire up preconceived notions on the fact issues that will need disposition at a trial on the merits. All we have decided is that summary judgment for plaintiff was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The decree and judgment of the District Court entered June 14, 1956, brought here for review, must be vacated and the cause remanded to that court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Judgment of the District Court vacated and the cause remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-16\">.

Plaintiff shows the assessment of September 15, 1955 was made after the time for assessment had expired by limitation of law with the exception that if fraud be established by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue he has power to assess additional taxes beyond the usual limitations period. Plaintiff shows that fraud is never presumed and that the assessment of September 15, 1955, occurring after the running of the usual statutory period, is without <em>prima </em>facie validity and is wholly lacking in validity unless and until, if, ever, after bearing an adequate showing of fraud is made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-22\">To which defendant answered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-23\">\u201c15.
