Judicial review is precluded by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 11a-2 unless the automatic free insurance provided the deceased by the Servicemen\u2019s Indemnity Act of 3 951, 65 Stat. 33, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, created a \u201ccontract of insurance\u201d in the meaning of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 445.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court held, follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>ing a line of precedents cited below, that such indemnity \u201cgratuitously provided\u201d for servicemen did not come within the terms of the review permitted under the latter Act.</p>\n<p id=\"Aql\">The cases are consistent in holding that the free automatic insurance provided World War I fighting men by the War Risk Insurance Act, 40 Stat. 409, constituted a \u201ccontract of insurance\u201d within 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 445, e. g., United States v. Jackson, 302 U.S. 628, 58 S.Ct. 390, 82 L.Ed. 488; Caprio v. United States, 1 Cir., 45 F.2d 520; United States v. Campbell, 4 Cir., 13.9 F.2d 424; United States v. Carlson, 9 Cir., 44 F.2d 5; Cunningham v. United States, 5 Cir., 67 F.2d 714; Morgan v. United States, 5 Cir., 115 F.2d 427; United States v. Kerr, 9 Cir., 61 F.2d 800; United States v. Preece, 10 Cir., 85 F.2d 952, certiorari denied Preece v. United States, 300 U.S. 660, 57 S.Ct. 436, 81 L.Ed. 869. We think the difference in wording between that statute and the present one is not sufficient to warrant a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"A75\">Nor do we find it significant that Congress expressly provided for judicial review in the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 817, and failed to make similar provisions in the 1951 Act. At the time the latter statute was passed disputes similar to the present one under various servicemen\u2019s insurance statutes were all committed to the courts by either 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 445 or 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 817; and servicemen\u2019s families had long litigated such claims. In all probability the failure to mention judicial review here was because the Congress assumed that claims under the new statute were reviewable as contracts of insurance within 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 445. The 1951 Act amounted to little more than a mandate for payment by the Government of the premiums on what every serviceman was already strongly urged to carry, viz., $10,000 of cheap Government term insurance; and it was not considered a measure to transform Government insurance into a gratuity or to narrow the scope of review of the Veterans\u2019 Administration in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"A2k\">We cannot interpret the limitations on judicial review set in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 11a-2 differently here from cases where the sole beneficiary sues the Government and where Congress must have intended some court review of arbitrary agency behavior. The cases which deny review rest on inferences as to congressional intent drawn from the ambiguous legislative history of the 1951 Act and from its failure expressly to state the obvious.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Supreme Court, in construing World War I insurance legislation, was unwilling to find a tacit congressional intent to convert automatic insurance into a mere gratuity, United States v. Jackson, supra, 302 U.S. 628, 58 S.Ct. 390, 82 L.Ed. 488; and we are similarly unwilling to break the expectations of the families of the men who failed to buy commercial policies in reliance on the Government\u2019s insurance. The 1951 statute created a \u201ccontract of insurance\u201d as much as such a relationship is possible between the Government and the men whom it can compel to serve,</p>\n<p id=\"A5IX\">We agree with the forceful and persuasive opinion of Judge, now Mr. Justice, Whittaker in Miller v. United States, D.C.W.D.Mo., 124 F.Supp. 203, 204-205: \u201cServicemen who lose their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>lives in the service of our country, and the families of those men, are not the discretionary eestuis of a beneficent Veterans Administration, but, rather, are the beneficiaries of a grateful America * * ffe shall follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-15\">. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 445 allows review of a \u201cdisagreement as to claim * * * under a contract of insurance between the Veterans\u2019 Administration and any person or persons claiming thereunder * * This statute, originally enacted as \u00a7 19 of the World War Veterans\u2019 Act of 1924, 43 Stat. \u00a7 612, is expressly excepted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>the provisions of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 11a-2 \u2014 enacted Oct. 17,1940, 54 Stat. 1197 \u2014 forbidding judicial review of decisions by the Administrator of Veterans\u2019 Affairs on claims for benefits or payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AGL\">.
