The facts and the applicable legal principles are adequately set out in the opinion filed by Chief Judge Forman in the district court, 145 F.Supp. 439, and need not be repeated here. It is sufficient to say that we are in full accord with Chief Judge Forman\u2019s conclusions and need add nothing to the reasons given by him in support of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-30\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
