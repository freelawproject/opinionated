Appellant, leaving the George Washington University Hospital after out-patient treatment, slipped on the icy sidewalk and sustained a fractured hip. She testified that on her way into the hospital a half hour or so earlier, she had noticed that the sidewalk was icy \u201call the way across,\u201d but had \u201cpicked\u201d her way. Other witnesses testified that there had been a patch of ice on the sidewalk but that there had been room to walk around it.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-23\">Two errors are alleged on appeal: (1) that the trial judge charged the jury too generally on the issue of contributory negligence; and (2) that he over-emphasized in his charge the evidence tending to show contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-24\">As for the first alleged error, the record shows that appellant did not object to the instruction given nor suggest any different or further instruction. The point is, therefore, unavailable to her on appeal, Rule 51, Fed.Rules Civ.Proc., 28 U.S.C., and no circumstance appears which justifies exercising our discretion to consider the point though not raised below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-25\">The second alleged error has no substance when the charge is read as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-16\">.
