Under the savings clause of the latter, namely, section 405(a), which is set forth in pertinent part in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the taking effect of the 1952 Act shall not be construed to affect any proceeding existing at the time the Act took effect. This clearly seems broad enough to save for action under the 1917 Act an application for suspension of deportation filed prior to the effective date of the 1952 Act. The broad provisions of the savings clause are not to be narrowed \u201cunless otherwise specifically provided.\u201d It is appellee\u2019s position that the concluding sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>tence of section 405(a) does otherwise specifically provide, by reason of the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">\u201cAn application for suspension of deportation * * * which is pending on the date of enactment of this Act (June 27, 1952), shall be regarded as a proceeding within the meaning of this subsection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6qA\">This statutory declaration that an application for suspension of deportation pending on the date of enactment of the 1952 Act shall be regarded as a proceeding within the meaning of section 405(a) is not a specific provision that such an application filed after that date but prior to the effective date of the Act shall not also be regarded as such a proceeding under the sweeping terms of the preceding provisions of the same section. In reaching this conclusion we gather support both from this language of section 405(a) and from the decision of the Supreme Court in United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 75 S.Ct. 513, 99 L.Ed. 615. There the Court held that under section 405(a) a petition for naturalization filed subsequent to the effective date of the 1952 Act was to be governed by the 1940 Act, in a case in which the alien had filed his declaration of intention under the latter. This conclusion was reached notwithstanding the provision of section 405(b) that \u201cany petition for naturalization heretofore filed which may be pending at the time this Act shall take effect shall be heard and determined in accordance with the requirements of law in effect when such petition was filed.\u201d It will be seen that the problem of statutory interpretation there was essentially like that in the case at bar. The reasoning of the Supreme Court is equally applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">\u201c * <em>* </em>* The slight negative implication derived from the fact that \u00a7 405(b) applies to <em>pending </em>petitions for naturalization, and not to those filed after the effective date of the new Act, is overcome by the broad sweep of \u00a7 405 (a) and its direction that prior law applies unless the Act \u2018otherwise <em>specifically </em>provides.\u2019 \u201d Id., 348 U.S. at pages 536-537, 75 S.Ct. at page 518.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">The negative implication of the pertinent language in the present case may be somewhat stronger than in Menasche, but not so much so as to lead to a different conclusion in this case.
