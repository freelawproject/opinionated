Commissioner, 331 U.S. 694, 67 S.Ct. 1477, 91 L.Ed. 1750 were inapplicable to the facts of this case, and that \u201c * * * there were no sales, directly or indirectly, by any member of the Lincoln family to David Lincoln.\u201d 24 T.C. 669, 699. We agree with the Tax Court\u2019s findings and conclusions for the reasons stated in Judge Harron\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-22\">The decisions of the Tax Court are therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
