The latter action did not constitute a designation of a project area within the meaning of the statute, but was limited to preliminary steps for the purpose of obtaining funds frbm the Administrator of the Housing and Home Finance Agency to conduct surveys and studies in the general area involved. Such action was not required to be preceded by a public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-14\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the \u201cdesignation\u201d of January 20, 1956, was invalid unless preceded by a public hearing, a question we need not decide, it was rescinded and superseded March 6, 1956, by action which required no such hearing. The question of necessity for a public hearing antecedent to the action of January 20, 1956, accordingly became moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-15\">The District Court on motion of the appellees granted summary judgment in their favor. We are precluded from reviewing the question involved because it has become moot. The appropriate procedure in these circumstances is to di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>rect that the judgment in favor of appellees be vacated and the case remanded to the District Court to dismiss the complaint. Cf. Amalgamated Ass\u2019n of Street, Electric Railway &amp; Motor Coach Employees, etc. v.
