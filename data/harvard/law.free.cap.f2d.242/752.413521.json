De Luna v. United States, 5 Cir., 228 F.2d 114. The record shows that the defendant did not claim that he was entrapped into the commission of the offenses charged, but denied that he had committed them. It shows, too, positive and detailed evidence which, if believed, amply supported the finding and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-19\">Without undertaking to set out the detailed and circumstantial evidence of the government\u2019s witnesses or the testimony of the defendant, admitting part and denying part of that testimony, it is sufficient to say that the evidence amply supported the conviction, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-13\">. \u201cPoint No. 1: (Alternatively submitted)</p>\n<p id=\"ACO\">Appellant was entrapped into the commission of the offense.
