The answer to this question turns upon the question whether the written document sued on by plaintiff was a valid written contract for the sale of land under the Florida Statute of Frauds, F.S.A. \u00a7 725.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-20\">The facts are not in dispute, since the case is here on appeal from an order dismissing for failure to allege a claim on which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-21\">The amended complaint alleged that the plaintiff had entered into two contracts for the purchase by him of two tracts of land in Florida owned respectively by two groups of the defendants. It alleged also that one Asmar and his firm, also named as defendants, were authorized by the owners of the land to negotiate, agree on terms of sale, and execute the contracts and that they did so. The contracts, denominated \u201cDeposit Receipts,\u201d were attached as exhibits to the amended complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>On considering the original complaint, which was a suit on these alleged contracts for the sale of land, the trial court dismissed the complaint with leave to amend. An amendment was filed alleging in the alternative that the defendant brokers had represented that they had authority to make the contract of sale and execute it on behalf of the owners and that if the court found that they had no such authority then there was a breach of warranty of authority for which plaintiffs were entitled to their damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">Upon renewed motion the court again dismissed the complaint with 10 days leave to appellant to tender a further amendment for consideration of the court. Appellant tendered a further amendment which differed from the first only in that it alleged a confirmation and ratification of the contract by certain telegrams and letters written on behalf of defendants to the plaintiff. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The action, however, was still on the two \u201cDeposit Receipt\u201d contracts. The district judge declined to permit the second amendment and dismissed the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Appellee correctly states the law to the effect that an action should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted only \u201cwhere it appears to a certainty that the plaintiff would be entitled to no relief under any state of facts which could be proved in support of the claim pleaded.\u201d Tauzin v. St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co., 5 Cir., 195 F.2d 223, 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Probably the clearest example of such a case is where a statute requires a contract to be in writing, as in the* case of a sale of land, and it appears on the face of the agreement that it does not satisfy the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. Such is the case here. This document contains many of the elements of two contracts. One is the receipt by Asmar, the broker, for the cash payment which gives rise to certain rights as between purchaser and Asmar. It will be noted that the instrument states on its first line: \u201cReceipt is hereby acknowledged of the sum of $2,000 * * *.\u201d and on the last line of the receipt it says \u201cBy Raymond As-mar.\u201d Between these two lines there is spelled out the terms of a trade (the other contract) which includes an obligation by the purchaser to pay \u201con acceptance, $13,980, of which the ($2,000) shall be a part thereof,\u201d and which ends with the words \u201cthis contract shall be binding on both parties, their heirs, personal representatives and/or assigns when this contract shall have been signed by both parties or their agents.\u201d There is then a space for signature of purchaser and one for signature of seller following the language \u201cI or we agree to purchase (sell) the above described property on the terms and conditions stated in the foregoing contract and do hereby approve, ratify and confirm said contract in all respects.\u201d The blank space provided for purchaser was filled in with the name of the plaintiff, but that provided for the name of seller was blank in both instruments. It had never been signed either by the owners or by any one purporting to be their agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Appellant contends that the signature of Asmar to the deposit receipt amounted to a \u201csigning\u201d by the owner under the allegations of the complaint that Asmar was authorized to execute the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Under the Florida rule that permits authorization of an agency to execute a contract for sale of land by parol<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we may say that had Asmar signed the contract so that his signature stood for an acceptance of its terms quite a different question would have been presented to the trial court for decision. Here, though, it plainly appears that however much authority it is alleged Asmar had to act for the owners of the land he did not purport to exercise this authority by signing as their agent to sell; his signature merely acknowledges his own receipt of the money and his own consequent obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">We hold, therefore, that these documents, in addition to being deposit receipts signed by Asmar, were also offers on the part of appellant to buy the tracts of land from the owners Fine and Gore on the terms therein expressed \u2014 offers which were not accepted by them. It was thus not a valid contract for the sale of land as required by the Florida Statute of Frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">There is nothing in Forbes v. Babel, Fla., 70 So.2d 371, cited by appellee as dealing with this same type of \u201cDeposit Receipt,\u201d that shows that the court there was dealing with an unsigned agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">What we have said as to the lack of liability of the owners of the</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>property to the \u201cpurchaser\u201d on this agreement must, of course, also make clear the absence of any claim of the plaintiff against the agents for a breach of warranty of their authority. Inasmuch as they did not purport to execute a valid contract for the sale of land, since they did not \u201csign\u201d that contract at all, their alleged representation that they were authorized to do so would not be actionable even if false. This is so because plaintiff could not be hurt from the want of authority to do an act which the agent did not pretend to do anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The trial court was clearly right in dismissing the suit unless he abused his discretion in rejecting the tendered second amendment. We think he did not err in refusing that amendment because it added nothing to the claim. It asserted that the defendants had ratified and confirmed the contracts by a telegram and two letters, both of which were signed by members of a firm of lawyers. Reference to the proposed amended complaint and to the telegrams and letters makes it perfectly clear that they refer to two entirely different contracts which are nowhere pleaded by the complaint. The entire suit being on the pleaded contracts, as still insisted on by appellant here, the trial court properly declined to permit the amendment which alleged that letters relating to other contracts ratified and confirmed the one sued on. They showed on their face that they did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\">.

BROWN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AH0\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Reminiscent to me of the nice, intriguing dialectic inquiries of common law pleading, a point of view which Florida Judges, steeped in the lore and traditions of their local practice,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seem reluctant to discard with consequent delay and expense as that approach comes into collision<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., the nub of the Court\u2019s decision is that the pleaded contract violated the statute of frauds because the Seller did not sign on the right line. The Court puts it thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-12\">\u201c * * * The blank space provided for purchaser was filled in with the name of the plaintiff, but that provided for the name of the seller was blank in both instruments. It had never been signed either by the owners or by anyone purporting to be their agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-13\">\u201cAppellant contends that the signature of Asmar to the deposit receipt amounted to a \u2018signing\u2019 by by the owner under the allegations of the complaint that Asmar was authorized to execute the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-14\">\u201cUnder the Florida rule that permits authorization of an agency to execute a contract for sale of land by parol we may say that had As-mar signed the contract so that his signature stood for an acceptance of its terms quite a different question would have been presented to the trial court for decision. Here, though it plainly appears that however much authority it is alleged Asmar had to act for the owners of the land he did not purport to exercise this authority by signing as their agent to sell; his signature merely acknowledges his own receipt of the money and his own consequent obligation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>But the statute of frauds is not one of trivial formalism. It<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires a writing signed by the party to be charged, but it does not require that it be signed at any particular place, or in any particular way, or with black, green, red, or blue ink. If it is the fact that it was signed, rather than the meticulous details of the <em>act </em>of signing that is important, what was the state of this record?</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Since what we now have is a question of pleadings only, it is plain that the Complaint<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> did allege categorically that the defendants (sellers) did execute the contracts and that the agents (Asmar) who signed for them had express authority to act. Of course, to \u201cexecute\u201d means to sign, so that the words, read as they must under the Federal Rules, actually alleged that the sellers signed the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">On what grounds is the plaintiff denied the right to try to prove those allegations ?</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">It is not that it was the agent rather than the principal who signed. For we are all in agreement (see Note 2 Court\u2019s opinion) that parol evidence can be used to establish authority of the agent to sign and thus satisfy the statute of frauds. Nor is it because the Court feels that the words of the pleading did not assert that Asmar had authority to act for and bind the seller. This is impliedly, if not expressly, assumed. The reason boils down to the absence of pleaded circumstances, the nature of which is completely undisclosed, to show that Asmar\u2019s \u201csignature stood for an acceptance,\u201d and, apparently, the existence somewhere in the pleadings of irrefutable \u201cfacts\u201d, cf. Stanton v. Larsh, 5 Cir., 239 F.2d 104, that Asmar \u201cdid not purport to exercise this authority by signing as their agent to sell * * And this, as I read it, is then transmuted into more specific, tangible terms, to be that Asmar did not sign for the sellers since his signature appears only on the line where the broker customarily signs and did not again appear at the <em>place </em>where the blanks called for the seller\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">But neither the statute of frauds nor the elements of a contract requires such ritualism. If the agent has authority (a matter dependent upon proof, not pleading), the contract is binding on the principal even though the paper is signed by the agent in the agent\u2019s name.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, if Asmar had au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>thority (a thing which his pleading declared him willing and able to prove and which Florida policy permits him to prove), the letters spelling \u201cAsmar\u201d spelled out as well \u201cHelen Gore\u201d and \u201cHarry Fine and Ruth R. Fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-19\">And if, as our hypothesis now assumes, Asmar had authority, then the <em>place </em>or <em>manner </em>of his signature is utterly immaterial<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> so long as intention to authenticate the contract is shown and for which extrinsic parol evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>is permissible. The fact that it is the agent, signing in his own or in the principal\u2019s name, does not alter this rule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Without a doubt, the seller personally could have initialed, scrawled, scribbled, or printed his own name, part of it, or hieroglyphic substitutions for it, any place on the paper \u2014 top, bottom, left or right margin, across the face, or on the reverse side; and if its presence, or legibility, or nature was equivocal, parol evidence would have been admissible to establish it and the intention to authenticate the contract. 2 Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 520-528.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">What the principal could have done himself, the authorized agent can do for him. So Asmar, using the letter symbols actually spelling out his own name but vicariously spelling the seller\u2019s name as well, or spelling out the name of the seller (with or without a byline \u201cBy Asmar\u201d) could have indicated acceptance by the seller in any one of these, or a variety of the other ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">If he could do it by writing his own name, or writing the principal\u2019s name any <em>place, </em>he could do it by writing<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> his own name <em>once. </em>To require that an agent with this authority write his name twice (once, as broker, and again to bind the principal) would, for Florida whose statute requires only a \u201csigning\u201d (note 3, supra), not a signature \u201csubscribed,\u201d precipitate an etymological how-many-angels-can-dance-on-the point-of-a-needle formula more rigid and artificial than the most extreme decisions reading \u201csubscribed by the party\u201d to mean a signature <em>under </em>the memorandum and about which Corbin (2 op. Cit., supra, \u00a7 521, p. 764) writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-16\">\u201cProbably they have never gone so far as to hold that if a dotted line is prepared by the typist the signature must be exactly on the dotted line.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-17\">We are unanimous that \u201ca motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim should not be granted unless it appears to a certainty that the plaintiff would be entitled to no relief under any state of facts which could be proved in support of his claim * * * \u201d, Des Isles v. Evans, supra [200 F.2d 615]. Consistent with the principles I have set out at length, how can we say that proof <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was, to a moral certainty, not available ?<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Whether the purchaser can meet the heavy demands which proof of this authority and intention will require is a matter of evidence, not pleadings. What I mean to say is that the purchasers should be given that chance, and on that evidence, by motions for summary judgment,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> motion for judgment on trial before the court, or motions for instructed verdict, or judgment n. o. v. if tried by jury, Millet v. Godchaux Sugars, Inc., supra, its sufficiency under Florida law and policy can be determined. The necessity and sanctity of written contracts will be preserved with all of the protection which Florida demands, but in keeping with the spirit of the Federal Rules, the case will have been decided on the real facts, not on awkward, stilted, or archaic language of the lawyer-pleader.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">To this day no one knows whether the sellers gave this authority to Asmar, or if they did, whether he meant his name to be for them too. If they did, cutting this claim off in this fashion is an irretrievable loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Rehearing denied:</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-8\">.

Oral evidence is undoubtedly admissible to explain the name or symbol appearing on the document and to show the purpose for which it was put there. No document can ever prove its own execution and delivery. Whatever the form of the alleged signature, extrinsic testimony is always necessary to prove when, by whom or by whose authority, and for what purpose it was attached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-22\">2 Id., \u00a7 521, p. 764: \u201c* * * a name appearing on any part of the document is a sufficient signature if it is shown to have been inscribed there or adopted by the party to be charged as an authentication of the whole memorandum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-23\">2 Id., \u00a7 522, p. 767-768, as to the form or manner of signature, \u201c * * * the courts have been uniformly liberal in holding the memorandum to be sufficiently signed without regard to the form of signature or the manner of inscribing it, * * * The more unusual it [the signature] is in these respects the more testimony in addition to the face of the writing itself may be required to establish the fact that the writing is \u2018signed\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-26\">37 O.J.S., Frauds, Statute of, \u00a7 202, p. 695: \u201cThe signature authenticating the memorandum does not need to be in any particular form as long as the act is intended to be equivalent to actual signature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-28\">37 Id., \u00a7 205, p. 697: \u201c* * * the position of the signature is immaterial</p>\n<p id=\"b188-30\">49 Am.Jur., Statute of Frauds, \u00a7 379, p. 681: \u201cThe writing of his name at the top, in the body, or at the bottom of the instrument constitutes a sufficient signing or signature if it is written for the purpose of giving authenticity to the instrument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-31\">Restatement, Contracts, \u00a7 210 (1932).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\">. 49 Am.Jur., Statute of Frauds, \u00a7 414, p. 717: \u201cThe principle that the signature need not be at the end or foot of the writing but may appear at the top or in the body of the memorandum, provided the circumstances indicate that it was inserted or adopted with the intent to authenticate the writing, is applicable to a writing prepared by the agent of the party to be charged.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b189-11\">.

The signing of the Amended Complaint itself carries substantial weight under counsel\u2019s warranty, F.R.Civ.P. 11: \u201c * * The signature of an attorney constitutes a certificate by Mm that he has read the pleading; that to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b189-19\">. In testing the Complaint under F.R.Civ.P. 12, the Court, in the absence of some compelling, contrary circumstance, would have to anticipate that the plaintiff would offer testimony that the seller at a certain time and place expressly told the broker that he could sign for him, etc.; or testimony or facts, such as, conversations between broker and seller, from which the implied authority to sign for him could be inferred; or testimony that the seller by an exchange of telegrams, letters or other writings expressly or impliedly authorized the agent t&lt;s sign for him; and testimony that in the act of writing his own name on the \u201cBy\u201d line, the agent intended to act for the seller too.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Under the Court\u2019s ruling, if the following were established to be the absolute, uncontradieted truth, the plaintiff would nevertheless be denied the opportunity of proving it: at a date prior to the physical signing of the paper by the agent, the seller, in the presence of three disinterested witnesses of unimpeachable integrity, and coincidentally recorded on a tape recorder in experimental testing of a machine, categorically said to the agent (as to the Gore trade, Exhibit A), \u201cIf Moritt will pay me $139,800, with $13,980 down on the date of acceptance making a total of $41,940 down on the date of closing, with the balance under a purchase money mortgage of five equal, annual installments at <em>5% </em>interest, you are authorized to sign the contract on my behalf\u201d; and following this, having obtained the terms required for the trade, the agent signed the paper opposite the word \u201cBy\u201d intending that it bind the seller as well as the agent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b190-22\">.
