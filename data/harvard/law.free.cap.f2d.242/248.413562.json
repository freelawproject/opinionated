This court affirmed the conviction, Crosby v. United States, 231 F.2d 679, in an opinion in which the pertinent facts of the seizure are set out more fully, with special reference to the issue of probable cause for the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">In this libel action the Government offered the testimony of the same witnesses as evidence of the circumstances of the search of the truck as was offered at claimant\u2019s criminal trial, and we hold that the evidence on which the agents here acted was sufficient as a matter of law to give them probable cause for the seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-16\">Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment for the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-17\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
