DORSEY WATKINS, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Plaintiff-appellant Tungsten Mining Corporation (Tungsten) sued Defendant-appellee District 50, United Mine Workers of America (District 50) for damages under Section 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 187(a) (3) and 187(b). Tungsten claimed that in January 1953 District 50, through an unlawful strike, caused damage to Tungsten\u2019s business; and that the strike was unlawful because one of its objects was to force Tungsten to recognize District 50 as bargaining representative of Tungsten\u2019s employees, although at that time United Stone &amp; Allied Products Workers of America, C.I.O. (Stone Workers) was then the labor organization certified by the National Labor Relations Board (Board) as exclusive collective bargaining representative for such employees. At the conclusion of the trial before the district judge, without a jury, judgment was entered in favor of District 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In April 1946 the Board conducted an election among Tungsten\u2019s employees and issued a certification in favor of Stone Workers. Shortly thereafter, Tungsten and Stone Workers executed a collective bargaining agreement which was followed by an uninterrupted succession of such agreements, the fourth of which was effective until January 15, 1953, and from year to year thereafter unless modified or terminated by 60 day notice. In October 1952 Holloman, an employee <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Tungsten\u2019s mines, with the help of District 50, organized the Tungsten Mining Local of District 50 at the Tungsten plant and Holloman was elected president of the new local.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">While Tungsten Mining Local was being organized and thereafter, meetings were held with Tungsten\u2019s employees. At these meetings representatives of District 50 made a series of speeches in which they pointed out that District 50 did not use<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the facilities of the Board to settle representation questions and that District 50 would probably resort to a strike or series of strikes with picketing if it could not obtain recognition in any other way. After one of these meetings, statements were made by some of the employees that efforts to pass through a picket line might result in houses being dynamited \u201cand things like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">In October 1952 Robert Fohl, Regional Director of District 50, and Walter A. Shuey and Lucien L. Wood, Field Representatives of District 50, came to Tungsten and conferred with the vice president and general manager of Tungsten. These District 50 representatives asserted that their Union held authorizations from a majority of Tungsten employees. They stated that District 50 did not use the Board\u2019s facilities, but offered to have District 50\u2019s status verified through other media. They explained that where they were unsuccessful in obtaining representation by other means, they would resort to strike. Purported lists of requests that Stone Workers \u201cno longer be the certified Bargaining Agent at the Tungsten Mining Corporation,\u201d of the withdrawal of check-off authorizations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>on behalf of Stone Workers, and of applications for membership in District 50, were mailed to Tungsten on January 21, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Shortly after the conference with the District 50 representatives, Tungsten examined its files and finding unrevoked dues deductions authorizations in favor of Stone Workers executed by more than a majority of employees in the unit, advised District 50 that Stone Workers had been certified by the Board as bargaining agent; that this certification had never been rescinded; and that Tungsten would continue to recognize Stone Workers until some other bargaining agent had been properly certified after an election duly held under the National Labor Relations Act. On October 30, 1952, District 50 wrote the Board, with a copy to Tungsten, reviewing in part the claims of District 50 and Tungsten, and concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">\u201cWe are merely advising your Board of this situation as a matter of record because this Organization intends to fully support and protect the interests and desires of the workers of this Mining Company, by every moral and legal means at our disposal, including that of strike action, if necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In November 1952 Stone Workers notified Tungsten that it wished to terminate the existing contract and proposed that a new contract be negotiated. Because of \u201craids\u201d on the membership of Stone Workers, an administrator appointed pursuant to the Constitution of Stone Workers International Union, was sent to the plant to endeavor to bring the employees back into Stone Workers\u2019 organization. Largely <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> through the administrator\u2019s efforts, a new contract between Tungsten and Stone Workers was executed on December 18, 1952, to become effective on January 15, 1953, the terminal date of the current contract. On January 9, 1953 Tungsten discharged two employees, including Holloman, for alleged violation of working rules. They spoke to other employees of the company and a strike began at 6 p. m. At 7 p. m. representatives of District 50 arrived at the Tungsten plant. On January 10, Holloman and Fohl prepared a press release describing the strike as due to a spontaneous walk out because of the discharges which they attributed to union activity on behalf of District 50 by the discharged employees. The release also stated;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">\u201cIn addition to a strike for the two discharged workers, it will also be a strike for recognition of the United Mine Workers of America and a new contract with proper wages, hours and working conditions from January 15, 1953, on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">\u201cOn strike\u201d signs were made available by District 50 to the striking employees and after January 15, signs indicating that the strike was for recognition of District 50 were also supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">The strike was accompanied by violence, including the discharge of fire arms and dynamiting of a power pole. On January 14, 1953 the Superior Court of Vance County, North Carolina, issued a temporary restraining order directed against District 50, Holloman and others, enjoining interference with free ingress and egress; assaults, threats, abuse or damage; and also set up provisions with respect to picketing. This order was on the evening of January 14 read by Wood to the strikers, and Wood, in conjunction with State Police, laid out the picket stations in accordance with the order of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">On January 15, 1953 Tungsten\u2019s old contract with Stone Workers expired and District 50 formally adopted the strike for purposes of recognition. Strike headquarters were established at a rented building some distance from the mine. Bail was furnished through District 50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>for persons arrested for acts of violence during the course of the strike. An injunction issued by the district court on February 3, 1953, to which further reference is made in this opinion, brought an end to the strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Tungsten\u2019s suit was brought under U.S.C.A. Title 29, \u00a7 187, the pertinent parts of which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">\u201c(a) It shall be unlawful, for the purposes of this section only * * <em>* </em>for any labor organization to engage in, or to induce or encourage the employees of any employer to engage in, a strike * * * where an object thereof is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJK\">****\u00bb\u2022\u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">\u201c(3) forcing or requiring any employer to recognize or bargain with a particular labor organization as the representative of his employees if another labor organization has been certified as the representative of such employees * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">* . * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">\u201c(b) Whoever shall be injured in his business or property by reason or [of] any violation of subsection (a) of this section may sue therefor in any district court of the United States * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">Whether or not District 50 induced the employees of Tungsten initially to strike, it certainly encouraged them in the strike, and was itself engaged in the strike at least after January 14, 1953.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> One of the purposes of the strike was to force or require Tungsten to bargain with District 50 as the representative of Tungsten\u2019s employees. During all the time in question, another labor organization, Stone Workers, had been certified by the Board as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of Tungsten\u2019s employees. That certification had not and has not been revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">The case would seem to come literally and exactly within the coverage of section 187(a) (3) supra. Nevertheless the district court [142 F.Supp. 806] entered judgment for District 50 saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agx\">\u201cI am adjudging that District 50 is not liable to Tungsten because Stone Workers, despite its certification, _was no longer a going concern, nor did it represent the overwhelming majority of Tungsten\u2019s employees \u2014 a situation of which Tungsten had every reason to be well aware * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">The proposition that despite the provision of section 187(a) (3) making unlawful a strike having as \u201can object\" the forcing or requiring of any employer to recognize or bargain with a particular union if another labor organization has been certified as the representative of employees, such strike is not unlawful if the certified union (after one year from its certification) has ceased to represent a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit, was based completely and exclusively upon the decision in Kennedy, Regional Director, National Labor Relations Board v. Warehouse &amp; Distribution Workers Union, Local 688, 37 L.R.R.M. 2496, (D.C.Mo., Jan. 27, 1956). That was an action brought to enjoin an unfair labor practice proscribed by U.S.C.A. Title 29, \u00a7 158(b) (4) (c), the language of which is identical with section 187(a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">In the Kennedy case Coca-Cola Bottling Company Salesmen Association (Association) was duly certified as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees of Coca-Cola Bottling Company of St. Louis, Missouri (Coca-Cola). A collective bargaining agreement was entered into between the Association and Coca-Cola on July 17, 1953 with an expiration date of November 1, 1955. Negotiations for a new contract were begun in June 1955 but no agreement was reached. On September 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>1955, Warehouse &amp; Distributors Workers Union, Local 688, (Local 688) filed with the National Labor Relations Board a petition for the election of a collective bargaining representative of the employees of Coca-Cola. Hearings on the petition were held but on October 25, 1955 before a decision had been handed down by the Board, Local 688 made demands on Coca-Cola for immediate recognition as the collective bargaining representative of the employees in Association, the certified unit, and further demanded that Coca-Cola negotiate a new agreement with Local 688 on the threat of a strike and picketing to enforce these demands. A strike was called by Local 688 on November 9, 1955 and pickets were maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Association continued to function after October 24, 1955; Coca-Cola continued deduction of Association\u2019s membership dues from Coca-Cola employees wages and Association accepted such payments. Coca-Cola was at all times in possession of written authorizations for the check off of Association dues from a very substantial majority of Coca-Cola\u2019s employees, which authorizations had not formally been revoked in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The court in the Kennedy case also found that by October 24, 1955, the Association had lost the support of a majority of the employees in the unit; that a majority had designated Local 688 as their bargaining agent; and that before the strike Coca-Cola, \u201cwhile it may not have been convinced that\u201d Local 688 \u201crepresented a majority of employees in the unit, had good cause to doubt, and did doubt, that the Association retained the support of a majority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The crux of the decision is found in conclusions of law nos. 4, 5, and 6, quoted in full (except for citations) by the district court in this case, and conclusion no. 7, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">\u201c4. Since the relief sought by petitioner is being denied on other grounds, it is not necessary to consider whether the Association\u2019s status, or its representation of the employees in the unit, had deteriorated to such an extent that the Association\u2019s certification should for this reason be regarded as totally ineffective. Cf. Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co., 59 N.L.R.B. 325, 15 LRRM 152; WTOP, Inc., 114 N.L.R.B. No. 194, 37 LRRM 1143; National Gas Co., 106 N.L.R.B. 819, 32 LRRM 1561; but cf. Cosentino v. District Council, D.C.P.R., 107 F.Supp. 235, 30 LRRM 2683.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-13\">\u201c5. Because the Association had, by November 9, 1955, when the Association\u2019s certification was more than one year old, lost the support of a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit, and the Company had at least a bona fide doubt that the Association retained the support of a majority, the Company was then no longer required by law to bargain collectively with the Association, but was free to \u2018refuse to bargain further with it.\u2019 Brooks v. National Labor Relations Board, 348 U.S. 96, 104, 75 S.Ct. 176, 99 L.Ed. 125, 35 LRRM 2158; Celanese Corp., 96 N.L.R.B. 644. An object of Respondent\u2019s conduct, therefore, was to require the Company to violate its duty of neutrality between the Association and Respondent, e. g. National Labor Relations Board v. Indianapolis Newspapers, Inc., 7 Cir., 1954, 210 F.2d 501, 503, 33 LRRM 2536, not to require the Company to violate its duty to bargain with the certified union.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-15\">\u201c6. Section 8(b) (4) (c) of the Act proscribes strikes \u2018having as their purpose forcing any employer to disregard his obligation to recognize and bargain with a certified union and in lieu thereof to bargain with or recognize another union.\u2019<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> H.Conf.Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>1st Sess.; see also S.Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.; 93 Daily Cong.Rec. 7686; id. at 1910-1912, 3954. That section does not, as the Board contends, proscribe strikes directed toward compelling the employer to violate his duty of neutrality between two competing unions, nor does it proscribe strikes to gain an object (recognition) which could alternatively be gained, eventually, by means of the peaceful processes of the Board\u2019s election procedures, for it is not written in those terms, and there is no rational relation between these circumstances and the criterion established by the Act: whether \u2018another labor organization has been certified as the representative of (the) employees under the provisions of Section 9.\u2019 A strike is not rendered unlawful by the presence of such circumstances. See, e. g., Perry Norvell Co., 80 N.L.R.B. 225, 23 LRRM 1061; Tungsten Mining Corp., 106 N.L.R.B. 903, 909, 32 LRRM 1576; Address of former General Counsel Bott. May 13, 1954, 34 LRRM 78, 79; cf. S.Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 22; H.Conf.Rep. No. 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 43, 44, 98 Daily Cong.Rec. 4557, 4562-63. Accordingly Section 8(b) (4) (c) does not proscribe the conduct of Respondent in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8m3\">\u201c7. The fact that Respondent\u2019s representation petition was already pending at the time of the strike does not render Respondent\u2019s conduct unlawful, because this circumstance has no bearing upon the terms of Section 8(B) (sic) (4) (C), and a contrary rule would discourage, rather than encourage, resort by the union to the peaceful election procedures of the Board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASs\">After referring to these conclusions, the district judge in this case then pointed out that in District 50, United Mine Workers of America v. National Labor Rel.Bd., 4 Cir., 1956, 234 F.2d 565, this court had stated, with reference to a situation in which there was no certified union, that the maintenance of neutrality does not <em>\u201crequire </em><footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the employer refuse to recognize a bargaining agent chosen by a majority of his employees if such majority is so clearly established that there can be no true question with regard thereto.\u201d (234 F.2d at page 570). At almost the same time the Supreme Court, in another case not involving a certified union, the company\u2019s employees never having been represented by a union, held that upon proof of a majority \u201cThe company can, if it so wishes, lawfully recognize the union as the employees\u2019 representative.\u201d United Mine Workers of America v. Arkansas Oak Flooring Co., 1956, 351 U.S. 62, 75, 76 S.Ct. 559, 567,100 L.Ed. 941.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AK6\">^-x- x .vj\u2122 +jien referred to the \u201e district judge tfien retened to tfie <em>right </em>of the employer as a general , , ,, ... <em>,, </em>rule, where the certification is more than \u00b0n?/ear oId\u2019 to ,fcogmze anoIlf umon holding a majority; expressed the opmion that \u201cTungsten was at <em>liberty\u201d </em>to recognize District 50 upon clear proof of majority representation by it; and that Tungsten was <em>\u201cfree to recognize </em>District 50 in spite of the Board\u2019s cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>tification of Stone Workers, but Tungsten preferred a contrary course, taking the position that it would recognize only a union certified by the N.L.R.B.\u201d [142 F.Supp.805]</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The district court then paraphrased the Kennedy decision and held that the object of District 50 was not \u201cto force Tungsten to disregard its obligation to Stone Workers\u201d but \u201cto get Tungsten to realize and accept the fact that it was at that time <em>under no obligation </em>to Stone Workers * * This, the court held, relieved District 50 of liability under section 187(b) \u2014 although the strike was, at least in part, for recognition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">In Parks v. Atlanta Printing Pressman &amp; Assistants Union No. 8, D.C.Ga., 150 F.Supp. 246, the court dismissed an action for damages for alleged violation of section 187(a) (3). The court found that the certified union had been quite inactive; there had been no labor agreement for the years 1953, 1954, or 1955; no grievances had been processed; and while a wage increase had been negotiated in 1953, the certified union had not since that date attempted to bargain with the employer; and that it did not represent a majority. The court referred to the \u201cdifficult question * * * whether the defendant union in this case was justified in calling the strike for recognition, more than a year after the other election, without obtaining a certification by the National Labor Relations Board of its status.\u201d The court referred to the Fifth Circuit decision in National Labor Relations Board v. International Furniture Co., 5 Cir., 212 F.2d 431, that \u201cthe employer has a right to refuse recognition after the year [of certification] has passed where the refusal arises from a belief in good faith that the union does not represent a majority of the employees.\u201d (212 F.2d at page 433). The court also cited the Kennedy case, supra, and Brooks v. National Labor Relations Board, 1954, 348 U.S. 96, 104, 75 S.Ct. 176, 181, 99 L.Ed. 125, and the statement by the Supreme Court that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-13\">\u201cThe Board has ruled that one year after certification the employer can ask for an election, or if he has fair doubts about the union\u2019s continuing majority, he may refuse to bargain further with it. This, too, is a matter appropriately determined by the Board\u2019s administrative authority.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">The court in the Parks case recognized that \u201cThere is much language in\u201d National Labor Relations Board v. Sanson Hosiery Mills, Inc., 5 Cir., 1952, 195 F.2d 350 \u201cleading one to believe that the certification must be respected even after a year has passed.\u201d The court attempted, however, to distinguish the case on the ground that it related to a situation arising at a time when certification was held inviolable for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-15\">In the Kennedy case; in the court below; and to some extent in the Parks case, the courts proceed upon the theory that if, after the period of one year, substantial evidence exists that the certified union no longer represents a majority, the employer <em>may, </em>without awaiting formal decertification, refuse further to deal with the certified union; that if there is substantial evidence that a rival union does represent a majority, the employer <em>must </em>on demand of such rival cease recognizing the certified union and deal with the rival; and if he does not, the rival can cause or participate in a strike to bring that condition about; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>but that this is not \u201cforcing or requiring any employer to recognize or bargain with\u201d the rival union, whether or not another union has been and is the certified collective bargaining agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">We are not impressed with the inevitability of this reasoning or conclusion. It is founded upon the quotation and use by the court in the Kennedy case (conclusion of law no. 6, supra) of language from a House Conference Report instead of the language of the Act as passed. The court says that \u201cSection 8(b) (4) (C) of the Act proscribes strikes \u2018having as their purpose forcing any employer to disregard his obligation to recognize and bargain with a certified union and in lieu thereof to bargain with or recognize another union\u2019 * * * \u201d The language of 8(b) (4) (C), (29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(b) (4) (C)), in haec verba proscribes strikes \u201cforcing or requiring any employer to recognize or bargain with a particular organization as the representative of his employees if another labor organization has been certified as the representative of such employees * *</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The risk in glossing clear and simple language by reference to legislative history is strikingly illustrated by the substitution of words from House Conference Report No. 510 for the statutory language. Later, in speaking of the Senate amendment (in which the House concurred) this same House Conference Report No. 510 refers to the investigation by the Board of \u201cany charge of unfair labor practice within the meaning of paragraph (4) (A), (B), or (C) of section 8(B) of the conference agreement, which deals with certain boycotts and with certain strikes <em>to force recognition of uncertified labor organizations </em>* * *.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, in a footnote to the decision in Mine Workers of America v. Arkansas Oak Flooring Co., supra, 351 U.S. at page 75, 76 S.Ct. at page 567, the Supreme Court stated: \u201cPresent law in no way limits the primary strike for recognition <em>except in the face of another union\u2019s certification,\u201d </em>citing, among other references, this same House Conference Report No. 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">The Fifth Circuit flatly held in National Labor Relations Bd. v. Sanson Hosiery Mills, 1952, 195 F.2d 350, 352, certiorari denied 1952, 344 U.S. 863, 73 S.Ct. 103, 97 L.Ed. 669, that \u201ca certification, when lawfully made, must be respected by the employer until changed conditions are reflected by a later ruling by the Board altering or setting aside the certification. This is true, even though the bargaining agent so designated has lost its majority representation of the employees * * \u201cNor can the employer decide for itself whether the Union has lost its bargaining status, and deciding that it has, refuse to deal with it further. Whether or not the Union has lost that status is for the Board to determine upon orderly statutory procedure. N. L. R. B. v. Prudential [Ins. Co.], 6 Cir., 154 F.2d 385, headnote 10. Meanwhile it is the duty of the employer to deal with the duly certified union.\u201d (195 F.2d at pages 352-353).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>In Teamsters Union and Lewis Food Company, 115 N.L.R.B. 890, 37 LRRM 1421 (March 22, 1956), the Board issued a cease and desist order from engaging in unlawful picketing for recognition. On July 22, 1952, Association of Pet Food Manufacturers Employees was certified as bargaining representative of employer's production and maintenance employees. On September 11, 1952, a collective bargaining contract was executed, to expire in 1957. In August 1954, Teamsters Union began organizing employees in the certified bargaining unit, and by August 18 claimed a majority, demanded recognition and a contract, and stated that employer should join with the union in filing a petition with the Board to decertify the Association. Upon failure of the employer to comply, a strike was called. The Board found this to be a violation of section 158(b) (4) (C) since it was designed to force the employer \u201cto recognize\u201d Teamster\u2019s Union \u201cand bargain with it at a time when the unit of employees for which\u201d Teamsters Union \u201csought recognition was covered by an outstanding certification existing in the Association.\u201d The Board also affirmed the rejection of Teamsters Union\u2019s affirmative defense that the strike was not violative of section 158(b) (4) (C) \u201cbecause the Association allegedly was illegally dominated at the time of its certification * * * \u201d Presumably this, as loss of majority representation, while the basis for a decertification, could not in the Board\u2019s opinion permit a rival union to strike while the certification was outstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">But even if we should assume, concede, or agree, that after the first certification year an employer, if there be substantial evidence that the certified union has lost majority representation, <em>may </em>recognize a rival union, \u201cmay\u201d is certainly not the equivalent of \u201cmust\u201d. To hold that an employer must cease recognition of a certified union, and recognize a rival, would seem totally inconsistent with the representation provisions of 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 159(c) (1) (B) under which a petition may be filed \u201cby an employer, alleging that one or more individuals or labor organizations have presented to him a claim to be recognized as the\u201d exclusive representative.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It also would be inconsistent with the admonitory language of the Supreme Court in Brooks v. National Labor Relations Board, 1954, 348 U.S. 96, at pages 103-104, 75 S.Ct. 176, at page 181, 99 L.Ed. 125, where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-10\">\u201cPetitioner contends that whenever an employer is presented with evidence that his employees have deserted their certified union, he may forthwith refuse to bargain. In effect, he seeks to vindicate the rights of his employees to select their bargaining representative. If the employees are dissatisfied with their chosen union, they may submit their own grievance to the Board. If an employer has doubts about his duty to continue bargaining, it is his responsibility to petition the Board for relief, while continuing to bargain in good faith at least until the Board has given some indication that his claim has merit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Although the Board may, if the facts warrant, revoke a certification </em>or agree not to pursue a charge of an unfair labor practice, <em>these are matters for the Board; they do not justify employer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>self-help or judicial intervention. </em>The underlying purpose of this statute is industrial .peace. <em>To allow employers to rely on employees\u2019 rights in refusing to bargain with the formally designated union is not conducive to that end, it is inimical to it. Congress has devised a formal mode for selection and rejection of bargaining agents </em>and has fixed the spacing of elections, with a view of furthering industrial stability and with due regard to administrative prudence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">\u201cWe find wanting the arguments against these controlling considerations. In placing a nonconsenting minority under the bargaining responsibility of an agency selected by a majority of the workers, Congress has discarded common-law doctrines of agency. It is contended that since a bargaining agency may be ascertained by methods less formal than a supervised election, informal repudiation should also be sanctioned where decertification by another election is precluded. This is to make situations that are different appear the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The facts in the present case point up the risks inherent in the application of the theory that the employer would be entitled, or required, itself to determine correctly the wishes of its employees to reject a certified bargaining agent. It may be clear that a substantial majority of Tungsten\u2019s employees on paper favored District 50. Against this must be placed the facts that until January 22, 1954, no written evidence in support, of \"this claim was in Tungsten\u2019s hands\u2014 indeed, it held unrevoked dues deduction .authorizations in favor of Stone Workers, executed by more than a majority of its employees; it had paid in January 1954 the amount of such deductions to the administrator of Stone Workers for December 1953 deductions; the administrator of Stone Workers testified that upon coming to the plant he tried to rebuild that union from the raids upon it, and thought he had some success from the start; in fact, Stone Workers continued in existence down to the time of trial, February, 1956, at which time it had a contract with Tungsten, negotiated at the end of 1955, expiring January 15, 1958, and represented between seventy-five and eighty percent of Tungsten\u2019s employees; and, in proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board in 1954, Stone Workers was found to be the certified and functioning representative of Tungsten\u2019s employees. Add to this the fact that the authorizations relied upon by District '50<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> had been obtained in association with threats of strike and violence (which materialized), and it cannot be said that Tungsten acted improperly or unlawfully in insisting upon a properly supervised secret ballot to determine the real, uncoerced wishes of its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">We hold that under these circumstances Tungsten was not legally obligated to recognize District 50 as the bargaining agent of its employees, in view of the outstanding certification of Stone Workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">The appropriate Regional Director for the Board brought suit pursuant to 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160 (l) in the United States District Court for the District of North Carolina, for an injunction against Tungsten Local Union, United Mine Workers of America, Holloman, Fohl and District 50, United Mine Workers of America, \u201cpending final adjudication of the Board of the matters involved.\u201d The court issued a decree, dated February 3, 1953, \u201cupon consideration of the petition; respondents\u2019 oral answer thereto-in open court, testimony, exhibits, evidence, oral arguments and briefs\u201d from which it appeared to the satisfaction of the court \u201cthat there is reasonable evidence to believe that respondents have engaged in and are engaging in conduct in violation of Section 8(b), sub-section (4) (C)\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>of the National Labor Relations Act.

United Mine Workers of America; Tungsten Mining Local of the United Mine Workers of America; Robert R. Fohl, Director, Region 19, District 50, United MineWorkers of America; William Cordell Holloman, President Tungsten Mining Local, United Mine Workers of America and Tungsten Mining Corporation, Whether or not respondents (other than Tungsten) had engaged in unfair labor practices directly required a decision as to whether Stone Workers was at the-time of the strike a certified union under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Section 8(b) (4) (C) of the Act, and that this question of certification status at the time of the strike was directly involved and decided, is made abundantly clear from the following quotation<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> from the decision (106 N.L.R.B. 905-906):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">\u201cAs stated above, Stone Workers was certified by the Board as the bargaining representative of the Company\u2019s employees in May 1946, and the strike for the recognition of the UMW occurred in January 1953. At issue before the Board, therefore, is whether Stone Workers was, at the time of the strike, still a \u2018certified\u2019 labor organization within the meaning of the quoted language of Section 8(b) (4) (C).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">\u201cThat language places no time limitation on the duration of a certification otherwise entitled to the protection of that section. Nor does the legislative history of the Act reveal that the Congress intended, or even considered, such a limitation.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">\u201cThe Respondents, however, contend in effect that the language of the statute should not be applied in this case. They argue that Stone Workers\u2019 certification was not valid in 1953 because \u2018the strike and majority participation [in the UMW] rebuts any presumption of such continued existing certification.\u2019 This contention is apparently founded upon the Board\u2019s doctrine with respect to an employer\u2019s obligation to bargain under Section 8(a) (5) of this Act. In that context, the Board has held that the majority status of a certified union, absent unusual circumstances, is conclusively presumed to continue for 1 year after certification; thereafter, the presumption is rebuttable and the employer may in good faith question the union\u2019s majority status.<footnotemark>b</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">\u201cWe need not, however, here decide whether or not this doctrine is applicable to Section 8(b) (4) (C) of the Act. For even were we to concede that point, the Respondents\u2019 contention still would have no merit. There is no evidence in the record to show, as the Respondents assert, that a majority of the Company\u2019s employees participated in the recognition strike. The evidence shows only that there was a strike, that the Company continued to operate its mine, and that a number of employees did not participate in the strike. There is nothing else to show that UMW was the representative of a majority of the Company\u2019s employees either before or during the strike. In this connection, the record shows only that a bare claim was pressed upon the Company that the UMW represented the majority of its employees, but no supporting evidence thereof was adduced. Indeed, the only evidence there is on the question consists in the voluntary authorization of dues checkoffs in favor of Stone Workers, which supports, rather than rebuts, the presumption that the Stone Workers continued to be the majority representative of the Company\u2019s employees at the time of the strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-10\">\u201cWe need not and do not here determine whether there are any circumstances under which a union may lawfully strike for recognition if another union has once been granted a certificate which has not been superseded or revoked. We hold that, un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>der the circumstances of this case, the certification was still outstanding and the strike for recognition was a clear violation of Section 8(b) (4) (C).<footnotemark>c</footnotemark>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The Board then found that all respondents (other than Tungsten) were responsible \u201con and after January 10, for conducting a strike for recognition of UMW, thereby violating Section 8(b) (4) (C) of the Act,\u201d and that they were responsible for coercive acts, thus violating Section 8(b) (1, 4) of the Act. These respondents were ordered to cease and desist from (106 N.L.R.B. at p. 909):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">\u201c(a) Engaging in, or inducing or encouraging the employees of the Tungsten Mining Corporation to engage in, a strike or a concerted refusal in the course of their employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, or to perform any services, where an object thereof is to force or require the Tungsten Mining Corporation to recognize or bargain with District 50, United Mine Workers of America, or with Tungsten Mining Local of United Mine Workers of America, or with United Mine Workers, as the representative of the employees of said Company, so long as United Stone and Allied Products Workers of America, CIO, or any labor organization other than District 50, United Mine Workers of America or Tungsten Mining Local of United Mine Workers of America, has been certified as the representative of such employees under the provisions of Section 9 of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The Order was enforced by a decree of this court entered without opinion on March 19, 1954.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Order and Decision of the Board of August 26, 1953, and the decree of this court enforcing the Board\u2019s order, were not mentioned by the district judge in his opinion. In fact, the court struck from plaintiff\u2019s complaint herein all references to the proceedings before the Board on the ground that such allegations<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> were \u201cirrelevant, immaterial and improper, and evidence in support of them would be inadmissible on the trial * * * \u201d That court\u2019s own injunction of February 3, 1953, is referred to only as part of the statement of facts.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">In the absence of any explanation of record, we are forced to assume that the district judge considered that a decision by the Board on the question of the status of Stone Workers, as a certified union, at and during the strike, was not binding in a subsequent civil action for damages. It may be granted that there was no estoppel, as that term is technically defined,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> in the Decision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Board. Nevertheless, the Board was required to, and did, make a specific finding of fact on a matter within its jurisdiction. The Order, based upon such finding, was enforced by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The point for decision here was not involved in International Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union v. Juneau Spruce Corp., 1952, 342 U.S. 237, 72 S.Ct. 235, 96 L.Ed. 275. In that case the court held that a finding by the Board of an unfair labor practice through illegal picketing under Section 8(b) (4) (D) was not a condition precedent to an action for damages under Section 303(a) (4). It was in this connection that the court said, (342 U.S. at pages 243-244, 72 S.Ct. at page 239): \u201cSection 8(b) (4) (D) and \u00a7 303(a) (4) are substantially identical in the conduct condemned. Section 8(b) (4) (D) gives rise to an administrative finding; \u00a7 303(a) (4) to a judgment for damages. The fact that the two sections have an identity of language and yet specify two different remedies is strong confirmation of our conclusion that the remedies provided were to be independent of each other. Certainly there is nothing in the language of Sec. 303(a) (4) which makes its remedy dependent on any prior administrative determination that an unfair labor practice has been committed. Rather, the opposite seems to be true * * *.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">But the issuance, and revocation, of certifications is entrusted expressly and solely<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> to the National Labor Relations Board, subject to judicial review in suits to enforce unfair labor practice orders. In this case, the Board determined that at the times in question, Stone Workers\u2019 \u201ccertification was still outstanding\u201d within the meaning of Section 8(b) (4) (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">In United Brick &amp; Clay Workers of America v. Deena Artware, 6 Cir., 1952, 198 F.2d 637, certiorari denied 1952, 344 U.S. 897, 73 S.Ct. 277, 97 L.Ed. 694, rehearing denied 1953, 344 U.S. 919, 73 S.Ct. 346, 97 L.Ed. 708, the court held that in a suit under Section 303(b) a jury question was presented as to whether picketing by United was against Deena, and the purpose thereof. This \u201cmain issue\" was \u201cone of the issues involved collaterally\u201d (198 F.2d at page 639) in National Labor Relations Board v. Deena Artware, 6 Cir., 1952, 198 F.2d 645, in which the court enforced an order of the Board requiring Deena to cease and desist from interference and refusal to bargain. The same alleged secondary boycott, the basis of recovery in 198 F.2d 637, was urged by Deena as a defense in 198 F.2d 645. The court disagreed with the \u201cruling of the Board as a matter of law, and are of the opinion that whether the Union was guilty of a \u2018secondary <em>boycott\u2019 </em>* * * was a factual question * * *. The Examiner found for the Union. The finding is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, and is accepted on this review * * (198 F.2d at page 653).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">In noting the inconsistency of the findings (after stating that \u201cthe issues presented by the two cases are not the same,\u201d 198 F.2d at page 639), the court pointed out that the proceedings were heard by different fact finding agencies; the witnesses were not the same; and the cross-examination was <em>by </em>different attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">Apart from the fact that the Board is the only body authorized to certify or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>decertify, there is an element in this case distinguishing it from any that have been called to our attention or disclosed by our own research. In this case it was stated by District 50\u2019s attorneys that in the hearing before the Board at which time the question was whether Stone Workers was a certified union within the meaning of the Act, and when the questions of majority status, and whether Stone Workers was a defunct union were involved, District 50 deliberately refrained from offering the very evidence (alleged requests that Stone Workers \u201cno longer be the certified Bargaining Agent at the Tungsten Mining Corporation\u201d ; membership applications and check-off authorizations to District 50; and revocation of \u201cvoluntary dues assignment\u201d to Stone Workers) relied upon as a defense to the damage suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">We hold that under the facts of this particular case the deliberate withholding from the Board,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the body to which is entrusted the revocation of certifications, and procedure through which is the \u201cformal mode for selection and rejection of bargaining agents\u201d (Brooks v. National Labor Relations Board, 348 U.S. at page 103, 75 S.Ct. at page 181; National Labor Relations Bd. v. Sanson Hosiery Mills, supra, 195 F.2d at pages 352-353) of these \u201cfacts\u201d relied upon as a defense below, binds District 50, and prevents it from successfully defending this suit on the ground that at the times in question Stone Workers was not the certified bargaining agent of Tungsten\u2019s employees within the meaning of Section 303(a) (3). As a consequence, the strike, and District 50\u2019s participation therein, were unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In remanding the case for further proceedings, we of course intimate no opinion on what, if any, damages are recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\">.

United Mine Workers has consistently declined to comply with the filing provisions of 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 159(f), (g) and (h).

It did not, however, preclude District 50 from representing employees or acting as bargaining representative for them. United Mineworkers of America v. Arkansas Oak Flooring Co., 1956, 351 U.S. 62, 76 S.Ct. 559, 100 L.Ed. 941; District 50, United Mine Workers of America v. National Labor Rel. Bd., 4 Cir., 1956, 234 F.2d 565, 571.
