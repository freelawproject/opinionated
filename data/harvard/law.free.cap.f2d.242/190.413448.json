The order of the court below dismissing the complaint as to McCloskey Homes, Inc., did not constitute a final and ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>pealable judgment under Rule 54(b), Fed.Rules Civ.Proc., 28 U.S.C., because the express determination that there was no just reason for delay and the express direction for the entry of judgment were not made by the court below as the rule requires. In so stating we desire to make plain that no application was made to the court below for judgment in the terms required by Rule 54(b). We are without power to entertain the appeal. See District 65 etc. v. McKague, 3 Cir., 1954, 216 F.2d 153 and Shipley Corp. v. Leonard Marcus Co., 3 Cir., 1954, 214 F.2d 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Should the court below see fit to make the determination and the order required by Rule 54(b) and an appeal were then taken to this court, we could dispose of the appeal on its merits on the present record, enlarged by the determination and order referred to in the preceding paragraph, by submission to the present panel. Further oral argument would be obviated and time saved.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The appeal will be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
