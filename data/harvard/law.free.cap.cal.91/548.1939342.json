Wrenschall, 34 Md. 492, and in that ease it was held to be an obligation so far <em>ex contractu </em>as fairly to come within the spirit and intent of a statute intended to facilitate the recovery of judgments in suits \u201c when the cause of action is a contract, whether in writing or not, or whether express or implied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">We are satisfied with the conclusion there reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">It follows that the application for the writ applied for herein must be denied, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
