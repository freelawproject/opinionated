Brown, </em>and <em>James F. Farraher, </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-7\">The granting of alimony pending appeal was an abuse of discretion. (Browne on Divorce, 310; <em>Whitmore </em>v. Whitmore, 49 Mich. 417; <em>McFarland </em>v. <em>McFarland, 51 </em>Iowa, 565.) As the offense for which the divorce was granted was that of the wife, and there was no community property, the portion of the order allowing her a sum for personal maintenance is void. <em>(Everett </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>52 Cal. 383.) The portion of the order directing the husband to pay the wife\u2019s attorneys three hundred dollars is void as being a judgment in favor of the attorneys. <em>(Sharon </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em>75 Cal. 37-39.) The whole of the order for alimony is void, as the order directs the money to be paid into court. The only order the court can make is to direct it to be paid to the wife. (Civ. Code, sec. 137; <em>Sharon </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em>75 Cal. 37-39.) The order to pay defendant\u2019s costs is also void, for the reasons last specified. The court, in this order, also directs the money to be paid to the clerk of the court. <em>(Sharon </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em>75 Cal. 37-39.) The order for the payment of defendant\u2019s costs is also void, because made subsequent to the entry of judgment. After judgment, in an action for a divorce, neither party has any claim upon the other, except such as has been given in the judgment itself. (Browne on Divorce, 306.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-8\"><em>Gillis &amp; Tapscott, </em>and <em>H. B. Warren, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-9\">An action is deemed to be pending from the time of its commencement until its final determination upon appeal, or until the time for appeal has passed, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the judgment is sooner satisfied. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1049.) When an action for divorce is pending, the court may, in its discretion, require the husband to pay as alimony any money necessary to enable the wife to support herself or her children, or to prosecute or defend the action. (Civ. Code, sec. 137.) The lower court, in exercising a sound discretion, has decided that the appeal has merit; and this being true, respondent\u2019s position, that facts must be stated showing merit in the appeal, is invulnerable. <em>(Ex parte Winter, </em>70 Cal. 291; <em>Larkin </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>71 Cal. 330; <em>Painter </em>v. <em>Estate of Painter, </em>78 Cal. 628.) That portion of the order granting respondent maintenance is valid, and authorized by statute. <em>(Lowell </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>55 Cal. 319, 320; <em>Finn </em>v. <em>Spagnoli, </em>67 Cal. 331, 332; <em>Tregambo </em>v. <em>Comanche M. &amp; M. Co., </em>57 Cal. 501; <em>Ex parte Spencer, </em>83 Cal. 464.) That portion of the order relating to attorneys\u2019 fees is not void, but comes squarely under the decision of <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>79 Cal. 511.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b458-5\">Garoutte, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8uJ\">This is an appeal from two certain orders made after judgment for plaintiff in an action of divorce based upon the adultery of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Upon a showing by the affidavit of defendant that she desired in good faith to appeal to the supreme court from the judgment rendered against her in the aforesaid action; that she was advised by the attorneys who appeared for her at the trial in the lower court that she has good grounds for appeal; that she has no attorneys to prosecute such appeal, and no means to retain such attorneys; that she has no funds from which to pay the costs and expenses of such appeal, and has no means for her personal support during the pendency of such appeal, etc., \u2014 the court made an order that the plaintiff pay into court the following sums, to wit: <em>\u201c </em>The sum of $87.80, to be paid out forthwith, as expenses for transcribing the testimony on the part of the defendant, already incurred; the sum of $75 as incidental expenses in perfecting said appeal, including clerk\u2019s fees and expense of printing transcript herein, and filing the same with the clerk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the supreme court; and the sum of $300, attorneys\u2019 fees for preparing said cause for appeal, and arguing the same in the supreme court, to be paid said attorneys when the transcript in the said cause is ready for filing with the clerk of the supreme court; and that plaintiff pay alimony to the said defendant, the sum of $20 per month, from the date of the judgment herein during the pendency of the appeal.\u201d The court also made an order that \u201cthe plaintiff pay to the clerk of said court the amount of $269.90, to be by said clerk retained, and to await further action herein.\u201d The foregoing was the amount of defendant\u2019s costs, incurred in the trial of the cause as settled by the court. Plaintiff appeals from the foregoing orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Section 137 of the Civil Code provides that \u201c when an action for divorce is pending, the court may, in its discretion, require the husband to pay, as alimony, any money necessary to enable the wife to support herself or her children, or to prosecute or defend the action.\u201d Section 1049 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: \u201c An action is deemed to be pending from the time of its commencement until its final determination upon appeal, or until the time for appeal has passed, unless the judgment is sooner satisfied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">As to the granting of alimony <em>pendente lite, </em>that is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the court, and this record discloses nothing to justify us in disturbing that discretion as exercised by the trial court in this cause. Under section 137 of the Civil Code, the power to make an allowance to the wife for her support as alimony, or an allowance to her for the purpose of defending or prosecuting the action, is not exhausted upon the rendition of the judgment in the trial court. <em>(Reilly </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>60 Cal. 624; <em>Ex parte Winter, </em>70 Cal. 291; <em>Larkin </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>71 Cal. 330.) The case of <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Everett, 52 </em>Cal. 384, is not in conflict with the foregoing authorities. In that casa the order was made under another section of the Civil Code, and was made after final judgment, and was in no sense an order for alimony made <em>pendente </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number><em>lite. </em>The order to pay the amount of the attorneys\u2019 fees into court is not void, under the authority of <em>Sharon </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em>75 Cal. 37; for it is not \u201ca-direct judgment for money in favor of persons not parties to the suit.\u201d (See <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>79 Cal. 511.)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\">The fact that the court ordered the clerk to retain in his possession until further order the amount ordered to be paid by plaintiff for witness fees affords no grounds of complaint by plaintiff, for he is not injured by that portion of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Let the orders be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Harrison, J., and Paterson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
