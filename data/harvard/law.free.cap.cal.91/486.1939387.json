Barry for five hundred dollars and costs, and that execution issue against said James H. Barry for five hundred dollars and costs, to the sheriff of the city and county of San Francisco.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">\u201cWherefore, by virtue of the law, and by reason of the premises aforesaid, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed that judgment be and the same is hereby entered herein against said James H.
