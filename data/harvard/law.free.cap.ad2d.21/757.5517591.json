On this record it does not appear that sufficient consideration was accorded comparable sales established by appellants and, further, the basis of the testimony of rental values offered by both expert witnesses was not adequately substantiated. Accordingly, a new trial is directed in the interests of justice. Settle order on notice. Concur \u2014 Breitel, J. P., Yalente, McNally, Stevens and Steuer, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
