(Merrill Lynch), owns two properties in the Township of Plainsboro. An office building occupied by Merrill Lynch and its various affiliates and subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cAdministrative Office Building\u201d) is located on one property. A conference and training center (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cConference Training Center\u201d), which Merrill Lynch uses for training sessions and meetings for its own personnel and which outside corporations and organizations may use for the same purpose by paying a fee to plaintiff, is located on the other property. Both buildings were constructed in the early 1980s, and plaintiff has paid real estate taxes on the properties to the defendant Township of Plainsboro (Plainsboro) for more than a decade.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">On June 4, 1992, the Plainsboro tax assessor sent letters to plaintiff regarding each of the properties, which stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-12\">To comply with an order from the Middlesex County Board of Taxation to bring its assessment to 100% of Market Value, the Township of Plainsboro has retained the services of Appraisal Surveys, Inc., a professional Appraisal Company to conduct a revaluation program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-13\">As Township Assessor, I am required by both law and Contract with the Appraisal Company to obtain information from income-producing properties. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>accordance with N.J.S.A. 54:34 [sic] it is requested that you complete the enclosed rental schedule, operating expense statement and copies of all leases in force for each calendar year 1990 and 1991.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\">It is also requested that all lease addendums and other agreements be attached to the appropriate leases, along with any 1992 projections on information that you feel may be pertinent to this office in valuing your property for the 1993 tax year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">Such information will be considered by this office and Appraisal Surveys, Inc. in determining the assessment for your property for the 1993 tax year. If your property is not subject to leases in whole, or in part, please state so on the forms and the areas that are not subject to leasing agreements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">The value of income producing property rests heavily on its ability to produce income, therefore this information is <em>essential </em>in the final value estimation process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Accompanying each of the letters was one form entitled, \u201cAnnual Statement of Income and Expenses for Income Producing Properties,\u201d and another form containing a rental schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">On June 9, 1992, the day after plaintiff received the tax asses- . sor\u2019s letters, Harry J. Ferguson, Merrill Lynch\u2019s First Vice President for Corporate Real Estate, replied by a letter which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">With reference to your letters dated June 4 on the above properties, please be advised that these are not income producing properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">Merrill Lynch is the sole tenant and has no lease arrangement with outside parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">The tax assessor subsequently made 1993 assessments of $102,-700,000 upon the property containing the Administrative Office Building and $54,537,800 upon the property containing the Conference Training Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">Plaintiff challenged these assessments by filing this action in the Tax Court. After discovery was conducted, Plainsboro moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that Ferguson\u2019s June 9,1992 letter constituted a failure or refusal to respond to the tax assessor\u2019s request for information within the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4r-34, which precludes an unresponsive taxpayer from appealing an assessment. In the alternative, Plainsboro sought an order barring plaintiff from relying upon the income approach in valuing the properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">In his certification submitted in opposition to this motion, Ferguson asserted that when he received the tax assessor\u2019s June 4, 1992 letters and accompanying forms, he concluded \u201c[biased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>upon the references therein to leases and rental income, ... that the request relative to income producing properties was for information regarding leases and rental income relating to the Properties.\u201d Ferguson further indicated that \u201c[b]ecause there was then and still are no leases on the Properties, and since there was then no rental income derived from the Properties, I responded to the June 4, 1992 Letter by letter dated June 9, 1992, stating that the Properties were not income producing and that Merrill Lynch was the sole tenant without any lease arrangements with outside parties.\u201d Ferguson also stated that he had replied to the tax assessor\u2019s letters without first conferring with an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The Tax Court concluded in a written opinion that plaintiff had failed to satisfy its obligations under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34 to provide a \u201cfull and true account\u201d of the income from its properties. The court\u2019s opinion states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">Plaintiffs argument that it was misled by the assessor\u2019s June 4, 1992 c. 91 request and the accompanying forms is not convincing. There are two reasons why the Legislature required the assessor to enclose a copy of the full text of c. 91 with the assessor\u2019s request for income data. The first was to make certain that the taxpayer would be fully informed with respect to the information that is required to be supplied to the assessor. The second reason was to ensure that the owner of income-producing property would be fully aware of the sanction to be imposed should the owner fail to comply with the request. In this ease, plaintiff could have complied with the assessor\u2019s June 4, 1992 request to the extent required by the statute. Moreover, the assessor\u2019s request and accompanying forms would not cause a reasonably prudent business person to conclude that the statute was not applicable to the subject properties. The mere mention of leases and rental income in the assessor\u2019s request does not reasonably lead to the conclusion that only leased rental property is income producing within the meaning of c. 91. Additionally, although the forms which were included with the assessor\u2019s request may not have been a good fit, a close examination reveals they could easily have been completed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Thus, the court concluded that plaintiff was only entitled to a \u201creasonableness hearing\u201d in accordance with <em>Ocean Pines, Ltd. v. Borough of Point Pleasant, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>1,10-12, 547 A.2d 691 (1988). However, plaintiff subsequently waived the opportunity for such a hearing. Accordingly, the court entered final judgment dismissing the complaint with prejudice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34, commonly known as \u201cChapter 91,\u201d see <em>Great Adventure, Inc. v. Township of Jackson, </em>10 <em>N.J.Tax </em>230, 231 n. 1 (App.Div.1988), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\">Every owner of real property of the taxing district shall, on written request of the assessor, made by certified mail, render a full and true account of his name and real property and the income therefrom, in the case of income-producing property, ... and if he shall fail or refuse to respond to the written request of the assessor within 45 days of such request, ... or shall render a false or fraudulent account, the assessor shall value his property at such amount as he may, from any information in his possession or available to him, reasonably determine to be the full and fair value thereof. No appeal shall be heard from the assessor\u2019s valuation and assessment with respect to income-producing property where the owner has failed or refused to respond to such written request for information within 45 days of such request, ... or shall have rendered a false or fraudulent account . . . . In making such written request for information pursuant to this section the assessor shall enclose therewith a copy of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The purpose of this statute is \u201cto afford the assessor access to fiscal information that can aid in valuing the property.\u201d <em>SKG Realty Carp. v. Wall Township, </em>8 <em>N.J.Tax </em>209, 211 (App.Div.1985). However, the statute is solely permissive. The tax assessor may seek information from a taxpayer regarding an income producing property in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34 or may refrain from exercising the authority provided thereunder. An assessor also may confine an information request only to certain information subject to disclosure under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34 rather than exercising his full statutory authority. Thus, an assessor could decide that the only kind of information relating to income producing properties which is sufficiently useful to aid in the valuation process is information relating to rents produced by properties leased to third parties. Therefore, in determining whether a taxpayer is barred from appealing an assessment because it failed to respond adequately to a tax assessor\u2019s request for information pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34, the county board of taxation or the Tax Court must decide not simply whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>taxpayer\u2019s property is \u201cincome producing\u201d but also whether the assessor\u2019s request would be understood by the average owner of an income producing property to require disclosure of the information which the taxpayer has allegedly withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">We assume for the purpose of this appeal, without deciding, that both the Conference Training Center and the Administrative Office Building are income producing properties within the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34. However, we conclude that the tax assessor\u2019s June 4, 1992 letters and the accompanying forms did not notify plaintiff that it was required to submit income information other than the rents derived from leased properties in sufficiently clear and unequivocal terms to justify the harsh sanction of an order barring appeals from the assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34 confers authority upon the tax assessor to determine the scope of information to request from a taxpayer and a corresponding duty to give the taxpayer clear and unequivocal notice of the specific information which must be submitted. Tax assessors are experts in the field of real estate valuation, see <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:1-35.25, while the owners of income producing properties include not only substantial business enterprises such as Merrill Lynch but also small business persons who may have difficulty reading complex and confusing forms and may lack ready access to legal advice. Consequently, \u201cthe assessor\u2019s request notice to the taxpayer must be clear cut.\u201d <em>Summerton Shopping Plaza v. Manalapan Township, </em>15 <em>N.J.Tax </em>173, 177 (App.Div.1995). Moreover, if there is room for reasonable doubt as to whether an average owner of an income producing property would understand an assessor\u2019s request to include a particular kind of information, the benefit of that doubt should be given to the taxpayer. <em>Cf. Great Adventure, Inc. v. Township of Jackson, supra, </em>10 <em>N. J.Tax </em>at 233 (noting that \u201cthe severity of the penalty for noncompliance provided for by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34, namely, the taxpayer\u2019s loss of his right to appeal the assessment, requires a strict construction of the statute\u201d); <em>see also SAIJ Realty, Inc. v. Town of Kearny, </em>8 <em>N.J.Tax 191, </em>196-97 (Tax Ct.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The tax assessor\u2019s cover letters to plaintiff appear to seek information solely about properties which are leased, or available to be leased, to third parties. The letter requests the taxpayer to \u201ccomplete the enclosed rental schedule, operating expense statement and copies of all leases in force for each calendar year 1990 and 1991.\u201d The letter also requests that \u201call lease addendums and other agreements be attached to the appropriate leases.\u201d Finally, the letter states that \u201c[i]f your property is not subject to leases in whole, or in part, please state so on the forms and the areas that are not subject to leasing agreements.\u201d However, the letter does not indicate that a taxpayer is required to report not only rental income from leased properties but also other income derived in whole or in part from business operations conducted on the property. Nor does the letter indicate that a taxpayer must report charges for expenses between affiliated companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The cover letter\u2019s focus upon rental income from leased properties is reinforced by the fact that one of the two enclosed forms is a rental schedule, divided into twelve columns, which requires the taxpayer to report the \u201cType of Rental Space,\u201d \u201cLocation of Rental Space,\u201d \u201cStatus of Occupancy,\u201d \u201cNet Square Feet of Rental Space,\u201d \u201cBase Annual Rental Per Square Foot,\u201d \u201cAnnual Real Estate Tax Contribution,\u201d \u201cAnnual Utilities Contribution,\u201d \u201cAnnual Common Area &amp; Maintenance Contribution,\u201d \u201cAnnual Insurance Contribution,\u201d \u201cLease Dates,\u201d \u201cLease Options,\u201d and \u2018Tear of Last Rental Revision.\u201d The second enclosed form, which is entitled, \u201cAnnual Statement of Income and Expenses for Income Producing Properties,\u201d also supports plaintiffs argument, because it includes blanks for the taxpayer to report the \u201cTotal number of rental units,\u201d \u201cAnnual vacancy percentage\u201d and \u201cIs rental of space subject to lease?\u201d Another part of the form seeks information concerning \u201cGross Base Possible Rentals,\u201d which the form indicates is \u201cthe total annual income from the rental of space assuming that all space is 100% occupied,\u201d and \u201cOther Income,\u201d which the form indicates is \u201cincome generated by operation of the real property, but not derived directly from space rental,\u201d such as \u201cservices sold to tenants, income from vending machines, signs on buildings, phones, parking fees, etc.\u201d Thus, both the tax asses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>sor\u2019s cover letters and the accompanying forms appear designed to elicit information regarding properties which are actually leased or available to be leased to third parties rather than properties which are exclusively used by the taxpayer and its affiliated companies for their own business operations or which generate business income other than rental income.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Moreover, the term \u201cincome producing properties,\u201d used in both the tax assessor\u2019s cover letters and one of the accompanying forms, is commonly understood to refer solely to property which generates rental income. As we noted in <em>Great Adventure, Inc. v. Township of Jackson, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">[Tjhe statutory phrase \u201cincome-producing property\u201d is congruent with the concept of rental income. See <em>SKG Realty Corp. v. Wall Tp., </em>8 <em>N.J.Tax </em>209 (App.Div.1985), in which we held that the statute applied where the owner corporation had leased the property to a sister corporation for a stated rent, even though the taxpayer argued that because of the corporate relationship, the rent was noneconomic. Moreover, the Tax Court has expressly held that only rental income meets the definition of income-producing. <em>See Monsanto Co. v. Kearny, </em>8 <em>N.J.Tax </em>109 (Tax Ct.1986).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">We agree with the Tax Court, both as expressed by Judge Crabtree in <em>Monsanto </em>and Judge Kimm in his oral opinion in this case, that the phrase \u201cincome-producing property\u201d must be construed as a term of art in accordance with the understanding commonly ascribed to it by the business, investment, and real estate community. As Judge Rimm pointed out, in the real estate appraisal field, the term income-producing property is generally limited to property producing rental income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">[10 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 232.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Thus, the impression conveyed by the tax assessor\u2019s cover letters that her information request was limited to properties which are leased or available to be leased to third parties is reinforced by the restrictive meaning generally accorded the term \u201cincome producing property\u201d in the real estate appraisal field.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Finally, we reject the Tax Court\u2019s view that because the assessor, in conformity with the final sentence of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34, appended the statute itself to her letter, plaintiff should have understood that the assessor\u2019s information request related to any property which is \u201cincome producing,\u201d regardless of whether the property is leased to a third party. We are satisfied that since the assessor\u2019s letter did not incorporate the pertinent language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34 by reference, a taxpayer could reasonably as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>sume that the text of the statute was quoted simply to set forth the authority for the information request.</p>\n<p id=\"AJn\">Therefore, we conclude that the average owner of an income producing property could have reasonably read the assessor\u2019s cover letters and accompanying forms as only seeking information regarding properties which were leased or available to be leased to third parties. Read in this manner, Ferguson\u2019s response that \u201cMerrill Lynch is the sole tenant and has no lease arrangement with outside parties\u201d and that the properties \u201care not income producing\u201d did not constitute a failfure] or refus[al] to respond to the assessor or a \u201cfalse or fraudulent\u201d response. Although plaintiff received payments from third parties for the use of the Conference Training Center, those payments did not constitute rental income from leased properties. Consequently, the Tax Court erred in ruling that plaintiff could not appeal the 1993 assessments on its properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Tax Court is reversed and the case is remanded for trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\"> Plaintiff also filed complaints challenging both the 1994 and 1995 tax assessments on its properties. The Tax Court consolidated the three actions but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>subsequently severed this action after entry of the order declaring that plaintiff violated Chapter 91 with respect to the 1993 assessments. We were advised at oral argument that the Tax Court has stayed proceedings in the appeals from the 1994 and 1995 assessments pending the outcome of this appeal and a related Law Division action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
