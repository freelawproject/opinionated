Hereafter we shall refer to this property as the property in question or \u201cPQ.\u201d The relevant assessing dates are October 1, 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993. The PQ was assessed for each of those years in the amount of $13,250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Originally built in the 1980\u2019s by Hartz Mountain Development Co., the PQ contains approximately 125,000 square feet of rentable space in a six-story building. The PQ was part of a mixed use project known as Harmon Meadow. The project contains office buildings, hotels, theaters and retail uses. In mid-1992, the appellant, Mutual, acquired the property from Hartz Mountain by a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Thereafter, Mutual substituted for Hartz in the pending 1991 and 1992 tax appeals, and filed direct appeals from the 1993 and 1994 assessments. The cases were consolidated and tried on September 21 and 26, 1994, and the court rendered a written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">On appeal, Mutual contends that the Tax Court erred because it failed to consider a prior contradictory report rendered by the town\u2019s expert witness which \u201cconceded that a reduction in assessment was appropriate.\u201d Mutual also contends that the Tax Court erred in finding an economic rent \u201cwidely divergent from actual, recent leases in the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Mutual\u2019s expert determined the true value of the PQ to be $7,950,000 on October 1, 1990, $8,120,000 on October 1, 1991, $8,335,000 on October 1, 1992, and $8,635,000 on October 1, 1993. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>In arriving at these estimates he used the income capitalization approach to value. <em>See Parkway Village Apartments Co., v.

He thus calculated gross income for 1991,1992,1993,1994 respective<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>ly as $2,516,400, $2,390,580, $2,327,670, $2,264,760. From the economic income thus derived he deducted a 10% vacancy allowance and operating expenses for 1991,1992,1993, 1994 respectively of $471,643, $434,927, $362,094, and $441,008. Like plaintiffs expert, he utilized the band of investment mortgage-equity method to develop his capitalization rates of 11.46% for 1991, 11.56% for 1992,11.51% for 1993, and 11.42% for 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The trial court found the Town\u2019s expert\u2019s analysis to be more credible and, therefore, did not disturb the assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">We recognize the unique role of the Tax Court in determining issues such as those before us. As noted in <em>Glenpointe Associates v. Township of Teaneck, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>37, 574 A.2d 459 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>391, 585 A.2d 392 (1990): \u201cThe judges presiding in the Tax Court have special expertise; for that reason their findings will not be disturbed unless they are plainly arbitrary or there is a lack of substantial evidence to support them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46, 574 A.2d 459. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2B:13-6b; <em>see also Pine St. Management Corp. v. City of East Orange, </em>15 <em>N.J.Tax, </em>681, 688 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>172, 675 A.2d 1121 (1996). Our scope of review in a ease such as this \u201cis limited to determining whether the findings of fact are supported by substantial credible evidence with due regard to the Tax Court\u2019s expertise and ability to judge credibility.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Township of Hamilton, </em>15 <em>N.J.Tax, </em>222, 226 (App.Div.1995) (quoting <em>South-bridge Park, Inc. v. Borough of Fort Lee, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>91, 94, 492 A.2d 1026 (App.Div.1985)). <em>See also Romulus Dev. Corp. v. Township of Weehawken, </em>15 <em>N.J.Tax, </em>209, 211 (App.Div.1995); <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Township of Edison, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>290, 311, 604 A.2d 580 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Applying these principles, we conclude that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Plaintiffs expert, Robert McNearney, relied on leases for space in the PQ for terms commencing in 1993 as well as a 1992 lease, a 1990 lease and a 1989 lease. McNearney gave little, if any, probative value to leases commencing in the late 1980\u2019s because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>thereafter the market had changed due to a downturn in the business cycle. McNearney also ignored leases in other Harmon Meadow buildings because, in his opinion, they were better buildings than the PQ and, therefore, were not comparable. Instead, McNearney relied on a building in nearby Lyndhurst, New Jersey, for supporting comparables.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The Town\u2019s expert, Louis Izenberg, relied principally on leases in other Harmon Meadow buildings and minimized the significance of the PQ leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">As previously indicated, the trial court found Izenberg\u2019s analysis to be more credible. The core issue is the probative value of the PQ\u2019s leases. We are persuaded that there is a rational basis in the record to discount substantially the probative value of the PQ leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Citicorp was one of the PQ\u2019s original tenants, leasing 50,000 square feet of space. In January 1990, Citicorp and Hartz negotiated an early termination agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, Citicorp vacated its PQ space and took 200,000 square feet in a new Hartz building on the Hudson River in Weehawken, N.J. Thus, 40% of PQ space became vacant, virtually overnight. According to Izenberg, Hartz\u2019s management decision created a tenant-favorable market for PQ space.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">According to Izenberg, Hartz\u2019s management frequently moved tenants from one of its buildings to another of its buildings. Izenberg testified that this management idiosyncrasy made it less likely that the PQ\u2019s actual rent was equivalent to economic rent. Izenberg also testified that an adjoining building, 450 Plaza Drive, was a \u201cconstruction twin\u201d of the PQ. Without certain management decisions made by Hartz, <em>e.g., </em>the Citicorp early termination in favor of a Weehawken building, the PQ\u2019s rent would have been equivalent to No. 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">This testimony supported the inapplicability of the <em>\u201cParkview </em>presumption,\u201d established in <em>Parkview Village </em>Assoc. <em>v. Borough of Collingswood, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>21, 34, 297 A.2d 842 (1972), and reiterated in <em>Parkway Village Apartments Co. v. Township of Cranford, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number><em>supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 272, 528 A.2d 922 (1987). This doctrine, originally stated as applicable to apartment houses, is also applicable to the valuation of a hotel. <em>See Glenpointe Assoc. v. Township of Teaneck, </em>10 <em>N.J.Tax </em>380, 391 (1989), <em>aff'd, </em>12 <em>N.J.Tax </em>118 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>391, 585 A.2d 392 (1990). The Supreme Court explained the <em>Parkview </em>presumption as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">In the absence of convincing evidence to the contrary!,] the current ongoing income scale of a large, well-managed apartment project like this, functioning as customary with leases of relatively short length, should be deemed <em>prima facie </em>to represent its fair rental value for purposes of the capitalized income method of property valuation. A court or taxing agency should be most hesitant to find that the tenants of a residential property being operated commercially are being charged inadequate rent . . . . Readily to be distinguished is the case of a taxpayer owning commercial property tied to a long term lease made long before the current assessing date, where the present rent may well be out of line with current fan-rental value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\"><em>[Parkview, supra, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>at 34-35, 297 A.2d 842.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">In <em>Parkway Village, </em>the Court summarized the <em>Parkview </em>presumption as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-11\">In <em>Parkview </em>we presumed that the actual rent of a well-managed apartment complex is equivalent to economic rent only absent \u201cconvincing evidence to the contrary.\u201d We explained that the municipality can overcome the <em>Parkview </em>presumption if it proves by \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d that (1) the leases are not economic because the property is not well managed, (2) the leases are not economic because they are old, long term leases, or (3) the leases are not economic as shown by a comparison with at least four comparable apartment properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-12\">[108 <em>N.J. </em>at 272, 528 A.2d 922 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">Assuming applicability of the <em>Parkview </em>presumption in an office building context, we conclude that the evidence undermined the presumption in the present case because there was evidence of Hartz\u2019s willingness to sacrifice occupied space in the PQ in pursuit of other management objectives. The evidence, therefore, supported a determination that management had created a surplus of space in the PQ.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">We are persuaded, therefore, that the findings and conclusions of the Tax Court were not arbitrary or unsupported in the evidence, particularly in light of the \u201cTax Court\u2019s expertise and ability to judge credibility.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Township of Hamilton, supra, </em>15 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Izenberg had prepared a report two months before trial in which his value estimates differed from the estimates in his testimony and in the report he used at trial. Those initial estimates exceeded the assessed value for the years 1991 and 1992. Izenberg\u2019s initial estimate for 1998 was <em>Vh% </em>less than the assessed value. His initial estimate for 1994 was approximately 6% less than the assessed value. Counsel for Mutual briefly questioned Izenberg regarding the differences between the July and September reports. The judge also questioned Izenberg about the July report and thus became aware of the difference between Izenberg\u2019s two sets of numbers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The existence of two sets of Izenberg numbers, which Izenberg did not attempt to conceal, does not compel a favorable result for Mutual or require a new trial. The Town was not bound by its expert\u2019s first report. <em>Skibinski v. Smith, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>349, 353, 502 A.2d 1154 (App.Div.1985). An expert\u2019s inconsistent statements are appropriate for impeachment purposes and bear on the expert\u2019s credibility. <em>Ibid. </em>The judge was aware of the inconsistency and exercised his power to disregard it as a factor of significance in this case. We perceive no basis in those circumstances to disturb the judgment below. <em>See Warren Tp. v. Suffness, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>399, 414, 542 A.2d 931 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>640, 552 A.2d 166 (1988) (observing that Tax Court must apply its own judgment to valuation data submitted by experts).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-6\"> It appears that the July report was marked for identification but was not introduced into evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
