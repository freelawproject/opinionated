We therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s order denying appellant Integrity Insurance Company\u2019s petition to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">In two similar 1979 and 1982 contracts, respondent Market Insurance Corporation agreed to act as appellant Integrity Insurance Company\u2019s general agent in various insurance transactions. A large part of each written contract contained complex formulas for calculating respondent\u2019s commissions on the basis of premiums collected and losses reported. Both contracts also provided that \u201cdifferences of opinion of interpretation\u201d of the contract \u201cshall be submitted for arbitration to two officers or executives ... of insurance companies,\u201d one to be chosen by each party. The one-page arbitration provision also stated that the arbitrators must meet in Paramus, New Jersey, which is where appellant\u2019s corporate headquarters are located.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Contract negotiations were conducted primarily by Mr. Stem, then vice president of appellant Integrity, and Mr. Uritz, president of respondent Market. The two men exchanged drafts of the contracts in which they had changed and corrected terms. Mr. Uritz even made changes in the arbitration clause contained in the 1979 contract. The signatories to the contracts also initialed each page.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">Disagreements eventually developed over the payment of commissions. Respondent filed this action for declaratory relief, an accounting, breach of contract, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The central theme in each count was that if all premiums and losses were accounted for, and if the payment formulas were accurately interpreted and applied, then appellant would be found to owe respondent money.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">Shortly after respondent filed its California complaint, appellant filed a similar suit against respondent in New Jersey. No further steps were taken, however, in pursuing that action. Instead, appellant answered respondent\u2019s California complaint and petitioned for an order compelling arbitration of all disputes between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>Following a hearing on the petition, the trial court issued the following order: \u201cMotion to compel arbitration denied. Whether or not the filing, by Integrity, of the New Jersey litigation amounted to a waiver of the arbitration clause it does not appear, applying the principles of <em>Victoria </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 734 [222 Cal.Rptr. 1, 710 P.2d 833] that any \u2018differences of opinion of interpretation of the contract\u2019 exist here.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Appellant\u2019s position is based on Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2. That section provides, in pertinent part, that the court \u201cshall order\u201d arbitration if \u201can agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists\u201d and has not been \u201cwaived\u201d by the petitioner. According to appellant, the arbitration clauses must be enforced because they were intended to encompass all contract-related disputes and have not been waived. Appellant also claims that the commercial setting in which the contracts were negotiated distinguishes this case from <em>Victoria, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at page 734, which the trial court relied upon to deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">We begin by ascertaining the standard of review. In the absence of conflicting extrinsic evidence, the interpretation of a contract is a question of law for the appellate court. <em>(Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Development Co. </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 861, 865 [44 Cal.Rptr. 767, 402 P.2d 839].) Here, the factual record consists of declarations executed by the individuals who negotiated the contracts. Their versions of the facts differ only as to the intent each harbored towards the scope of the arbitration clause.  However, the objective intent as evidenced by the words of the contract, not the parties\u2019 subjective intent, governs our interpretation. <em>(Titan Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sonoma Valley County Sanitation Dist. </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 1122, 1127 [211 Cal.Rptr. 62].)  We therefore exercise our independent judgment as to whether the instant disputes are arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">The general rule in this area is well-settled. California courts traditionally have maintained a strong preference for arbitration as a speedy and inexpensive method of dispute resolution. <em>(Keating </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 584, 595 [183 Cal.Rptr. 360, 645 P.2d 1192].)  To this end, \u201carbitration agreements should be liberally construed\u201d <em>(Baker </em>v. <em>Sadick </em>(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624 [208 Cal.Rptr. 676]), with \u201cdoubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues [being] resolved in favor of arbitration [citations].\u201d <em>(Ericksen, Arbuthnot, McCarthy, Kearney &amp; Walsh, Inc. </em>v. <em>100 </em>Oak Street (1983) 35 Cal.3d 312, 323 [197 Cal.Rptr. 581, 673 P.2d 251].)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The recent case of <em>Victoria, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at page 734 carves out a limited exception to this rule. There, the court held that an arbitration clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>in a group medical agreement, covering claims \u201carising from rendition or failure to render services,\u201d did not apply to a claim against a hospital for negligent employment of an orderly accused of sexually assaulting a patient. The reasons were two-fold. First, the \u201cscope of the arbitration clause [was] ambiguous.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 742.) Its reference to \u201cservices\u201d could either be interpreted as excluding the orderly\u2019s outrageous action or including the hospital\u2019s act of hiring him. Second, the contract had \u201cadhesive characteristics.\u201d Specifically, the \u201csmall, indistinguishable\u201d arbitration clause was embedded in a \u201clengthy standard form contract\u201d which the patient-petitioner had no opportunity to negotiate. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 743.) The court therefore concluded that general contract principles\u2014such as construing the contract against its maker\u2014 outweighed the policy favoring arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The court made it clear, however, that this result is atypical. The opinion reaffirms the general rule that arbitration agreements which are voluntarily and intentionally made are to be accorded broad scope. In fact, the court emphasized that this rule most readily applies \u201cin the context of a commercial contract devoid of allegations or evidence of adhesion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 744.)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">In light of these principles, the trial court erred as a matter of law in concluding that the dispute herein is not arbitrable. The two contracts were freely negotiated in a commercial setting by top-level representatives of each company. Even though the wording of each arbitration provision is broad, it is not ambiguous. The parties are sophisticated in contract matters and easily could have limited the description of arbitrable issues had they chosen to do so. It is thus reasonable to conclude that the all-important commission provisions were intended to fall within the scope of the arbitration clauses. This determination is buttressed by the fact that the arbitrators were insurance specialists who would be located near appellant\u2019s corporate headquarters and its financial records. Consequently, we follow the basic tenet that questions concerning the scope of arbitrable issues are to be resolved in favor of arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Moreover, we reject respondent\u2019s claim that appellant waived its arbitration rights by filing suit on the contracts in New Jersey. It is well established that \u201cthe mere filing of a lawsuit,\u201d with no \u201cjudicial litigation of the merits of [the] arbitrable issues,\u201d does not waive a party\u2019s contractual arbitration rights. <em>(Doers </em>v. <em>Golden Gate Bridge etc. Dist. </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 180, 183, 188 [151 Cal.Rptr. 837, 588 P.2d 1261], italics omitted.) Here, no litigation on the merits occurred. After appellant filed its New Jersey suit, respondent moved for an order of dismissal. The New Jersey court ordered that the action be stayed pending the outcome of appellant\u2019s California petition to arbitrate the controversy. No waiver occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The order denying arbitration is reversed. Appellant to recover costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Feinerman, P. J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 15, 1987. Eagleson, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
