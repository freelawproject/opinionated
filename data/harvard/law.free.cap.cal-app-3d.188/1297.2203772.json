J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ais\">Plaintiffs appeal from a pretrial order disqualifying their counsel for conflict of interest. Some 27 to 30 years before the motion for disqualification was made, one of plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys represented an individual who now appears as a defendant in the present action. In both the old and new matters the litigation concerned water rights along the Kern River in the central valley. An issue before the trial court on the motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>disqualify was whether the matters were \u201csubstantially related,\u201d a legal point of significance in attorney disqualification. The trial court found the matters to have the substantial relationship necessary for the disqualification of the attorneys.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">This litigation is a complex one with many parties; numerous attorneys have been involved to this point. At the time of the filing of the notice of motion to disqualify, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys had already engaged in over 3,000 hours of litigation effort, costing their clients $387,000. Of particular significance to this appeal, the motion to disqualify was not made until 47 months after the moving party\u2019s answer was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Although the trial court heard argument on whether the moving party unreasonably delayed seeking the disqualification and the effect of such delay, the court made no finding with respect to delay. Apparently the court decided once it found a substantial relationship existed, counsel should be disqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">On appeal, plaintiffs have abandoned any effort to challenge the substantial relationship finding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, their argument is that prejudicial delay in making the disqualification motion is a proper consideration in ruling on such a motion. On these facts, plaintiffs contend the court abused its discretion when it disregarded the extraordinary delay and effectively ended not only their attorneys\u2019 further participation in the case, but also made worthless the enormous amount of effort so far expended.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">We will examine the confusing state of the law on the role of delay in disqualification matters. Specifically, we must consider whether the public\u2019s interest in preserving attorney-client confidentiality and trust in the bar is so great that if there exist grounds for disqualification based on a conflict of interest, questions regarding unreasonable delay and resulting prejudice become irrelevant. Or, to rephrase the query, once grounds exist for disqualification due to the successive representation of clients with adverse interests, is the appearance of impropriety a substantial enough concern to overcome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>practical or realistic questions of unreasonable delay and resulting prejuduce?</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">\n<em>The Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">On August 5, 1980, plaintiffs filed the present action seeking injunctive and other relief against 12 named defendants for interference with plaintiffs\u2019 water rights. On October 5, 1984, defendant George W. Nickel, Jr., moved to disqualify plaintiffs\u2019 counsel Greer and the law firm of Kuhs and Parker on grounds: \u201c(1) Greer [was] acting adversely to Nickel, his former client, with respect to the same matters at issue in his previous representation of Nickel; (2) Greer [was] acting adversely to Nickel despite his previous receipt of confidential communications from Nickel; (3) Greer\u2019s conduct [had] created the appearance of impropriety; and (4) Kuhs &amp; Parker [had] shared Greer\u2019s information. Both Greer and Kuhs &amp; Parker must be disqualified on the basis of Rule 4-101, Rules of Professional Conduct, and California case law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Plaintiffs opposed the disqualification motion with the following arguments: (1) To the extent Greer represented Nickel approximately 30 years earlier, his employment did not involve matters which were \u201csubstantially related\u201d to the issues in the present action; (2) Greer\u2019s representation of corporate entities, of which Nickel was a shareholder, employee, officer or director, did not amount to representation of Nickel as an individual; (3) Nickel, by his conduct, consented to Greer\u2019s representation of plaintiffs; and (4) Greer did not give any confidential information to cocounsel Kuhs and Parker.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">Both sides offered extensive declarations and exhibits in support of their respective positions. Following a December 20,1984, hearing on the motion, the lower court ruled: \u201c1. Issues exist in the litigation now pending before this court in which T. Keister Greer (with the law firm of Kuhs and Parker) represents the plaintiffs against the defendant, George W. Nickel, Jr. and others, which are substantially related to issues involved in T. Keister Greer\u2019s prior representation of Defendant, George W. Nickel, Jr., as a client and a beneficiary of the Henry Miller Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>\u201c2. Confidential information acquired by T. Keister Greer during his prior representation of George W. Nickel, Jr., has been shared with attorney James R. Parker Jr., in the litigation now pending before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">\u201c3. Grounds exist for disqualifying T. Keister Greer and Kuhs and Parker from representing the plaintiffs in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">\u201c4. The motion of defendant, George W. Nickel Jr., to disqualify T. Keister Greer and Kuhs and Parker is granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Nickel contends the lower court\u2019s disqualification order should not be reversed if it is supported by substantial evidence, citing <em>Grove </em>v. <em>Grove Valve &amp; Regulator Co. </em>(1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 646, 653-654 [29 Cal.Rptr. 150], and <em>Meehan </em>v. <em>Hopps </em>(1956) 144 Cal.App.2d 284, 287 [301 P.2d 10]. Both <em>Grove </em>and <em>Meehan </em>dealt with a conflict in the evidence supporting the court\u2019s determination. As the appellate court in <em>Meehan </em>pointed out, \u201cit is for the trial court to evaluate the evidence.\u201d <em>(Meehan </em>v. <em>Hopps, supra, </em>at p. 287.)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">Nevertheless, because of the importance of motions to disqualify counsel, appellate courts must carefully review the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion. (See <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>McFarland Unified School Dist. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 562, 567 [211 Cal.Rptr. 802]; <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 893, 903, fn. 7 [175 Cal.Rptr. 575].)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\"><em>\u201cSubstantially </em>Related\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">In this case, the trial court found \u201c[i]ssues exist in the litigation ... which are substantially related to issues involved in T. Keister Greer\u2019s prior representation of Defendant, George W. Nickel, Jr., as a client and a beneficiary of the Henry Miller Trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">The trial court\u2019s use of the words \u201csubstantially related\u201d was a purposeful one. These words of art are a simple reference to the screening process used in identifying an impermissible conflict of interest in an attorney\u2019s representation of successive clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-12\">Under the \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d test: \u201c[T]he former client need show no more than that the matters embraced within the pending suit wherein his former attorney appears on behalf of his adversary are substantially related to the matters or cause of action wherein the attorney previously represented him, the former client. The Court will assume that during the course of the former representation confidences were disclosed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>attorney bearing on the subject matter of the representation. It will not inquire into their nature and extent. Only in this manner can the lawyer\u2019s duty of absolute fidelity be enforced and the spirit of the rule relating to privileged communications be maintained.\u201d <em>(T.C. &amp; Theatre Corp. </em>v. <em>Warner Bros. Pictures </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1953) 113 F.Supp. 265, 268-269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">In <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Deukmejian </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 150 [172 Cal.Rptr. 478, 624 P.2d 1206], our state Supreme Court appeared to endorse the federal \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d rule when it quoted a federal decision, <em>State of Ark. </em>v. <em>Dean Foods Products Co., Inc. </em>(8th Cir. 1979) 605 F.2d 380, 384, and noted: \u201c[I]t was held that the \u2018 \u201cattorney-client relationship raises an irrefutable presumption that confidences were disclosed.\u201d \u2019 Disqualification of the Attorney General was upheld because of his prior representation of a litigant; whether he \u2018did in fact receive confidential information is irrelevant, the policy considerations of the Code precluding that inquiry.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>p. 386.) The same doctrine was enunciated in <em>General Motors Corporation </em>v. <em>City of New York </em>(2d Cir. 1974) 501 F.2d 639, 648, and <em>Emle Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Patentex, Inc. </em>(2d Cir. 1973) 478 F.2d 562, 571. Also see Kramer, <em>Appearance of Impropriety </em>(1981) 65 Minn. L.Rev. 243, 255.)\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Deukmejian </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at pp. 156-157.)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">In addition, however, the state Supreme Court noted its own longstanding, strict position on successive representation of adverse interests by quoting <em>Wutchumna Water Co. </em>v. <em>Bailey (1932) </em>216 Cal. 564, 573-574 [15 P.2d 505]: \u201c \u2018[A]n attorney is forbidden to do <em>either </em>of two things after severing his relationship with a former cient. He may not do anything which will injuriously affect his former client in any [matter] in which he formerly represented him nor may he at any time use against his former client knowledge or information acquired by virtue of the previous relationship.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Deukmejian </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p. 155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">A California appellate court first expressly applied the federal \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d test in <em>Global Van Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 483 [192 Cal.Rptr. 609]. In <em>Global, </em>the trial court denied a disqualification motion for lack of evidence that the attorney obtained confidential information during his previous employment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 487.) The appellate court reversed. In considering whether the attorney had accepted employment adverse to his former client, the <em>Global </em>court reasoned: \u201cWhen a substantial relationship has been shown to exist between the former representation and the current representation, and when it appears by virtue of the nature of the former representation or the relationship of the attorney to his former client confidential information material to the current dispute would normally have been imparted to the attorney or to subordinates for whose legal work he was responsible, the attorney\u2019s knowledge of confiden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>tial information is presumed. (See <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Deukmejian </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, 29 </em>[Cal.] 3d at pp. 155-156.)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">\u201cThis is the rule by necessity, for it is not within the power of the former client to prove what is in the mind of the attorney. Nor should the attorney have to \u2018engage in a subtle evaluation of the extent to which he acquired relevant information in the first representation and of the actual use of that knowledge and information in the subsequent representation.\u2019 <em>(Developments in the Law: Conflicts of Interest in the Legal Profession, supra, </em>95 Harv.L.Rev. 1244, 1318; accord: <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Eaton </em>(1930) 211 Cal. 113, 116-117 [293 P.788].)\u201d <em>(Global Van Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.3d at p. 489.)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Therefore, in the usual case when the substantial relationship of the matters is established, the inquiry ends and the disqualification should be ordered. If it were otherwise, a weighing process would be inevitable. The rights of the former client would be lined up against those of the new client, perhaps to the detriment of both. The purpose of the substantial relationship test is to avoid such an inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">\n<em>Relevance of Delay and Prejudice Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">As a preface to our discussion of the relevance of delay in making disqualification motions, we must observe that the case law which discusses delay in seeking recusal involves disqualification of two kinds: (1) when it appears the attorney may be called as a witness in a case in which he or she is an advocate (attorney-witness); and (2) when a former client wants to stop the former attorney from presently representing an adverse interest (past representation). In the first instance, courts are concerned only with the possible appearance of impropriety when an attorney appears as an advocate and a witness in the same proceeding. In the second, and significantly more important matter, the attorney\u2019s confidential relationship with the former client is the troublesome issue. We further note the cases we will discuss do not always keep this distinction in mind when quoting precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">In <em>Earl Scheib, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 703, 706 [61 Cal.Rptr. 386], a past-representation case, the trial court denied a motion to disqualify on grounds the motion was filed \u201ctoo late.\u201d The appellate court reversed the order because the matter had not been heard \u201con its merits.\u201d It recognized the former client could expressly or impliedly consent to the adverse representation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 707.) However, the trial court\u2019s bald conclusion, \u201cfiled too late,\u201d was not a proper disposition of the complaint, even though the delay in filing the motion had prejudiced the new client. Mere delay was said to be irrelevant. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 707, 709.)</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>The <em>Earl Scheib, Inc. </em>case purports to state a rule that laches is irrelevant. Yet, the court acknowledged federal cases which remind us the motion for disqualification is equitable in nature and reasonable diligence is required. <em>(Earl Scheib, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>253 Cal.App.2d at p. 709.) Because the delay in <em>Scheib </em>was only four months, the court distinguished the case before it from the four-year delay in <em>Milone </em>v. <em>English </em>(D.C. Cir. 1962) 306 F.2d 814, and the twenty-year delay in <em>Marco </em>v. <em>Dulles </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1959) 169 F.Supp. 622. Therefore, we can assume the court\u2019s reference to these cases indicated delay and prejudice might be relevant under other circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">In <em>Kraus </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 484, 491-492 [85 Cal.Rptr. 846], an appellate court interpreted <em>Earl Scheib, Inc. </em>in the following manner: \u201cA client or former client may consent to an attorney\u2019s acceptance of employment which may be adverse to the client\u2019s interest. (Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 5 [52 Cal.2d at p. 897]; and see <em>Earl Scheib, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>253 Cal.App.2d 703, 707; <em>Grove </em>v. <em>Grove Valve &amp; Regular Co., supra, </em>213 Cal.2d 646, 652-653; and <em>Lessing </em>v. <em>Gibbons (1935) </em>6 Cal.App.2d 598, 605-606 [45 P.2d 258].) Nevertheless, a waiver will not generally be presumed from mere delay in raising the objection <em>(Earl Scheib, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 253 </em>Cal.App.2d at pp. 707-709; but cf. <em>Gottwals </em>v. <em>Rencher </em>(1940) 60 Nev. 35, 57-60 [92 P.2d 1000; 98 P.2d 481, 486-487]); nor is the question of possible prejudice to the new client a relevant consideration if there is prejudice to the former client <em>(id., </em>at p. 709).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">By 1979, the appellate court in <em>White </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 51, 55-56 [159 Cal.Rptr. 278], ruled that a party seeking to challenge an attorney\u2019s qualification to represent an adversary party <em>must </em>proceed at the first reasonable opportunity and by proper motion to achieve that end. In <em>White, </em>the allegedly disqualified attorney had previously represented both parties during the preparation of their partnership agreement; now, he appeared for one of the partners in an action against the other. Counsel could become a witness; the moving party also argued some confidences would be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">In reaching its conclusion, the <em>White </em>court relied upon <em>Comden </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 906 [145 Cal.Rptr. 9, 576 P.2d 971]. <em>(White </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 55.) In <em>Comden, </em>the court reviewed an order granting a disqualification motion premised on the possibility the subject attorney might be called as a <em>witness. </em>The ethical rule requiring disqualification in such a situation (rule 2-111(A)(4)) set forth four exceptions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> One of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>those exceptions was substantial hardship due to the distinctive nature of the lawyer or law firm. (Rule 2-111(A)(4)(d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Addressing petitioner\u2019s claim of substantial hardship, the high court remarked: \u201cIt would be naive not to recognize that the motion to disqualify opposing counsel is frequently a tactical device to delay litigation. (See <em>U.S. </em>ex rel. <em>Sheldon El. Co. </em>v. <em>Blackhawk Htng. &amp; Plmb., supra, </em>423 F.Supp. 486.) \u2018[JJudicial scrutiny [is required] to prevent literalism from possibly overcoming substantial justice to the parties.\u2019 <em>(J. P. Foley &amp; Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt, supra, </em>523 F.2d 1357, 1360, conc. opn. Gurfein, C. J.) However, ultimately the issue involves a conflict between a client\u2019s right to counsel of his choice and the need to maintain ethical standards of professional responsibility. \u2018The preservation of public trust both in the scrupulous administration of justice and in the integrity of the bar is paramount.... [The client\u2019s recognizably important right to counsel of his choice] must yield, however, to considerations of ethics which run to the very integrity of our judicial process.\u2019 <em>(Hull </em>v. <em>Celanese Corporation </em>(2d Cir. 1975) 513 F.2d 568, 572.)\u201d <em>(Comden </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at p. 915.)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">The <em>White </em>court recognized the importance which <em>Comden </em>placed on the public\u2019s interest in an untainted judicial system; nevertheless, the court stated: \u201c[I]t was not the intention of [the Comden] court to permit an adversary litigant to corrode, prostitute and defeat the objective of the rule by what amounts to no more than trial tactics. Pragmatically, discouragement of any merely tactical procedure affirms and strengthens the rule announced.\u201d <em>(White </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.3d at p. 55.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">The appellate court in <em>White </em>passed over the complaint concerning past representation as one without substance. It focused instead on the attorney-witness claim, the sole issue before the <em>Comden </em>court. There is no indication that either the Supreme Court in <em>Comden </em>or the appellate court in <em>White </em>intended the \u201ctrial tactics\u201d comment to become a rule of law applicable to past-representation disqualification eases. Notably, the <em>Comden </em>court\u2019s federal references were to cases which did not discuss the effect of delay in the past-representation context.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">Some courts have cited <em>Comden\u2019s </em>language respecting counsel of choice and ethical standards for the proposition trial courts may <em>weigh or balance </em>competing interests in deciding attorney-witness disqualification motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>based on rule 2-111(A)(4). <em>(Reynolds </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 1021, 1027-1028 [223 Cal.Rptr. 258]; <em>Lyle </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 470, 480 [175 Cal.Rptr. 918]; <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 180, 201-202 [150 Cal.Rptr. 156].) However, other courts have cited <em>Comden </em>for balancing competing interests in disqualification motions based on situations <em>other than </em>the attorney-witness scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">In <em>William H. Raley Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1042 [197 Cal.Rptr. 232], the court addressed a claim that a law firm was vicariously disqualified due to a partner\u2019s conflict of interest under rule 5-102(B).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In doing so, the panel wrote: \u201cTrial courts in civil cases have the power to order disqualification of counsel when necessary for the furtherance of justice. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 128, subd. 5; <em>Klemm </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 893, 901, fn. 4 [142 Cal.Rptr. 509].) Exercise of that power requires a cautious balancing of competing interests. The court must weigh the combined effect of a party\u2019s right to counsel of choice, an attorney\u2019s interest in representing a client, the financial burden on a client of replacing disqualified counsel and any tactical abuse underlying a disqualification proceeding against the fundamental principle that the fair resolution of disputes within our adversary system requires vigorous representation of parties by independent counsel unencumbered by conflicts of interest. (See <em>Comden </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at p. 915; <em>Lyle </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.3d at p. 481; rule 5-102(B).)\u201d <em>(William H. Raley Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.3d at p. 1048.)</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">In addition, this court in <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>McFarland Unified School Dist., supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d at pages 567 and 572, adopted the <em>Raley </em>language regarding a delicate balancing process in a disqualification case based on alleged violations of rules 5-102(B) and 4-101.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">Further, in <em>Maruman Integrated Circuits, Inc. </em>v. <em>Consortium Co. </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 443, 450-451 [212 Cal.Rptr. 497], it was stated: \u201c[I]n exercising this discretion [in a disqualification proceeding], the judge may properly consider the possibility that the party brought the disqualification motion as a tactical device to delay litigation. <em>(Comden </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at p. 915; <em>William H. Raley </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 1048[;] <em>White </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 51, 55 [159 Cal.Rptr. 278].)\u201d (Fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number><em>Raley </em>and the cases which follow are troubling. They rely heavily upon <em>Comderv, </em>however, <em>Comden </em>does not offer authority for interest balancing in deciding whether an attorney should be disqualified for conflict of interest. First, <em>Comden </em>was neither an adverse representation nor a past-representation case. Second, the ethical rule in <em>Comden, </em>rule 2-111(A)(4), included express- exceptions, one of which, the \u201csubstantial hardship\u201d test, enabled the court to balance interests. By comparison, rules 5-102(B) and 4-101 contain only one express exception, an informed and written consent of the client or former client. Third, the rule relied upon in <em>Comden </em>for balancing was amended in 1979 well before <em>Raley, Elliott </em>and <em>Maruman. </em>Fourth, without any apparent qualification, <em>Comden </em>says that a client\u2019s right to counsel of his choice must yield to ethical considerations which run to the very integrity of the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Therefore, we believe <em>Raley </em>lacks Supreme Court authority for its claim of a balancing test in nonattomey-witness disqualification cases. The same is tme of <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>McFarland Unified School Dist., supra, </em>which relied solely on <em>Raley </em>for a balancing test. Finally, in <em>Maruman Integrated Circuits, Inc. </em>v. <em>Consortium Co., supra, </em>166 Cal.App.3d at page 449, the court\u2019s reference to a balancing test appears to be dictum in light of the fact the court found, under <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 582 [147 Cal.Rptr. 915], there was no prior representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Rules dealing with the attorney-witness conflict are based on far less dramatic principles than those which apply to the attorney who appears to take an adversary position to a former client in the same or a substantially related matter. While the dual role of counsel and witness may threaten an attorney\u2019s effectiveness as an advocate, it should not materially affect the other parties to the litigation. Further, the other parties may attack the attorney\u2019s credibility as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">In contrast, the risk of an attorney \u201cturning\u201d on a former client in the same or a substantially related matter poses greater concern: There exists the potential for counsel to reveal or use the former client\u2019s confidences. As a result, the \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d test is a strict, prophylactic mle. In applying this mle, courts avoid becoming enmeshed in considerations of the number and importance of the confidences, the potential impact of their use in litigation, or the effect of disqualification upon the parties. Therefore, if a timely motion to disqualify is made, we reject the idea that the trial court should enlarge its inquiry by balancing the parties\u2019 competing interests under its equity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">If a substantial relationship is established, the discussion should ordinarily end. The rights and interests of the former client will prevail. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>Conflict will be presumed; disqualification will be ordered. However, it is not in the interests of justice to make the \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d rule <em>so unyielding </em>as to permit the former client to inexcusably postpone objections without penalty. Therefore, a narrow exception should apply if the present client, by way of opposition, offers prima facie evidence of an unreasonable delay by the former client in making the motion and resulting prejudice to the current client. <em>(Estate of Harootenian </em>(1951) 38 Cal.2d 242, 247 [238 P.2d 992]; <em>Newport </em>v. <em>Hatton </em>(1924) 195 Cal. 132, 148 [231 P. 987].) The trial court must have discretion to find laches forecloses the former client\u2019s claim of conflict. The burden then shifts back to the party seeking disqualification to justify the delay. That party should address: (1) how long it has known of the potential conflict; (2) whether it has been represented by counsel since it has known of the potential conflict; (3) whether anyone prevented the moving party from making the motion earlier, and if so, under what circumstances; and (4) whether an earlier motion to disqualify would have been inappropriate or futile and why.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Similar results may be found in criminal cases. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 884, 892 [164 Cal.Rptr. 746], the court noted a former client can \u201cexpressly or impliedly\u201d consent to adverse representation. There, the defendant raised the question for the first time on appeal. Noting <em>Earl Scheib, Inc., supra, </em>and its reluctance to presume consent, the <em>Johnson </em>court nevertheless found consent, stating: \u201c[I]n this case, the defendant was in the best position to appreciate any impropriety in the proceeding.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Although the federal rule is primarily concerned with avoiding the appearance of impropriety, some federal courts have also invoked the doctrine of laches. In the Ninth Circuit, the equitable principle is stated in terms of waiver: \u201cIt is well settled that a former client who is entitled to object to an attorney representing an opposing party on the ground of conflict of interest but who knowingly refrains from asserting it promptly is deemed to have waived that right.\u201d <em>(Trust Corp. of Montana </em>v. <em>Piper Aircraft Corp. </em>(9th Cir. 1983) 701 F.2d 85, 87.) In other circuits the courts have emphasized a party with knowledge will not be allowed to delay the disqualification motion for tactical reasons. <em>(Central Milk Producers Co-Op. </em>v. <em>Sentry Food Stores </em>(8th Cir. 1978) 573 F.2d 988, 992; <em>Redd </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>(10th Cir. 1975) 518 F.2d 311, 315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">When the trial court examines unreasonable delay and resulting prejudice, it acts in its equity jurisidiction. To some it may appear once equitable principles apply, the trial court will \u201cweigh,\u201d as once was the case in attorney-witness disqualifications and as some courts have tried to do in past-representation disqualifications; however, this perception is not quite accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>When rale 2-111 permitted a weighing process to consider substantial hardship in the attorney-witness cases, the law was not primarily concerned with the objector\u2019s status. The law was more concerned with the appearance created by the attorney\u2019s dual role. Today, though, as previously noted, the need for \u201cweighing\u201d no longer exists in the attorney-witness case.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">By comparison, in the case of past-representation disqualification based on substantial relationship, the law is primarily concerned with the presumed prejudice to the former client if the attorney in question is allowed to continue his or her present representation. That concern for the former client will be displaced only by the action or inaction of the complaining party, the former client. With convincing evidence that the delay was inexcusable and the present client will suffer prejudice, the court may find the former client has waived any right to disqualify counsel despite the existence of a substantial relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">\n<em>Application</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Here it appears the trial court was persuaded by <em>Earl Scheib, Inc., </em>that delay was irrelevant. No findings were made as to delay, even though the facts concerning the delay and its prejudicial effect were fully presented by documentary evidence. Section 909 of the Code of Civil Procedure permits the reviewing court to make additional factual determinations in appropriate circumstances. We do so in this case because it is manifest the delay was unwarranted and prejudicial to the interests of the present clients and the court. The same conclusion would be reached if there had been a contrary finding by the trial court. Nevertheless, we find in the record indications the trial court thought the delay was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">We are benefited by a record of considerable size, expertly developed and preserved by skilled counsel and a scholarly trial court. When the hearing commenced, the trial judge acknowledged reading the numerous motion papers and noted the case would turn on whether there was sufficient proof of a substantial relationship. On this question, prior to argument, he said, \u201cI consider it a very close call.\u201d At the same time, he added he had a question concerning the delay and admitted he was not convinced the objecting party had satisfactorily explained it.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">In reply, defense counsel urged the <em>\u201cEarl </em>Scheib\u201d rale that \u201ctime spent on the matter in the meantime or otherwise is not relevant.\u201d Regardless, counsel argued no delay existed due to the unavailability of judges to hear motions in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">At the end of the hearing the court confirmed its initial impression: \u201cI really think it\u2019s a close call.\u201d Our examination of the record convinces us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>the trial judge was at this point referring to the substantial relationship issue, not the question of delay. Absent any finding concerning delay, we will highlight certain noncontro verted facts concerning knowledge and the objector\u2019s excuse that no judge was previously available to hear this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Because of the law\u2019s concern for unhampered counsel on both sides of the litigation, \u201cmere delay\u201d in making a disqualification motion is not dispositive. The delay must be extreme in terms of time and consequence. Thus the court must initially determine when the former client became aware of the attorney\u2019s potential conflict. Whether there was diligence in making the motion for disqualification depends upon establishing that knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Prior to the initiation of this litigation, Attorney Greer\u2019s services were in demand. Indeed, defendant Nickel unsuccessfully tried to retain him. Presumably concerned about his relationship with his former client, Greer consulted the law offices of Young, Wooldridge, Paulden, Self, Farr &amp; Hugie; he obtained a \u201cTo Whom It May Concern\u201d opinion that he was not disqualified, due to his representation of Nickel, from advocating plaintiffs\u2019 interests. He then filed the current litigation on August 5, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">In January 1981, Nickel filed with the California State Bar a complaint for disciplinary action against Greer. Nickel argued in considerable detail Greer\u2019s purported conflict of interest in representing plaintiffs. A State Bar official in turn sent Greer a letter which, in four pages of single-spaced print, detailed Nickel\u2019s contentions and sought a response. Greer replied on January 20, 1981, with 16 similar pages of complaint and answer defense. On July 1, 1981, the State Bar notified Nickel and Greer of its decision that the facts did not warrant disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">We consider the foregoing to be important only in respect to knowledge and timing. The information Nickel supplied the State Bar is similar to that he later used to obtain relief in the trial court. Nickel therefore had knowledge of the conflict well over three years <em>before </em>he made the motion to disqualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">Significantly, throughout that period of over three years, Nickel was represented by counsel. Further, there is no evidence in the record that <em>any </em>individual prevented defendant Nickel from pursuing Greer and Kuhs and Parker\u2019s disqualification. Thus, the second and third criteria for evaluating delay in this case are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">Despite these facts, Nickel argues that to have moved for disqualification any sooner would have been futile. Nickel complains there was no court available to hear the disqualification matter during the 47-month period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>between the filing of Nickel\u2019s answer and the filing of his motion to disqualify. Change of venue, judicial disqualifications and the parties\u2019 difficulty in locating an \u201cacceptable\u201d judge to hear the case allegedly prevented Nickel from bringing the motion sooner.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">We will not consider the time when the venue motion was pending. We assume for purposes of this appeal that the filing of the venue motion operated as a stay. <em>(Pickwick Stages System </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1934) 138 Cal.App. 448, 449 [32 P.2d 433].) As a result, the trial court may not have been able to hear a disqualification motion while the venue motion was pending. Yet there was nothing at that time to prevent Nickel from filing the motion and giving plaintiffs notice of his challenge. Whenever it first appears a disqualification motion should be noticed and filed, it should be done within a reasonable time irrespective of the date it might be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">There remained, nevertheless, approximately 39 months (47 months less 8 months for the venue matter) within which Nickel could have sought recusal of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. While as a result of judicial disqualification there was a gap of approximately 10 months between disqualifications and assignment of substitute judges, almost 30 months passed while a trial judge was presumably available to hear the motion barring further judicial disqualification. More importantly, judicial disqualification and reassignment did not prohibit the filing of a disqualification motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Nickel contends the parties\u2019 difficulty in finding an \u201cacceptable\u201d judge excused his failure to notice a motion earlier in the proceedings. We disagree. To begin, it was not within the power of the parties and counsel to peremptorily \u201cpick and choose\u201d trial courts to their liking. The only authority remotely relating to this matter and permitting parties to \u201cagree upon\u201d a judge is Code of Civil Procedure section 170.3, subdivision (c)(5). The section authorizes appointment of an \u201cagreed upon\u201d judge when another judge refuses to recuse himself or herself. In those circumstances, the parties may agree upon a judge to hear and determine the issue of judicial disqualification. However, this was not a case of disputed judicial recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">In addition, the parties all knew they could file appropriately noticed motions even though a judge might not be readily available to hear them. For example, an assigned judge was peremptorily disqualified on August 24, 1984. Before another judge was assigned, plaintiffs filed their notice of motion seeking a partial summary judgment. Nickel responded by filing his disqualification papers, yet having no more assurance a judge would be available at that time than in the prior months and year.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Difficulties in finding a \u201csuitable\u201d judge to hear an attorney disqualification motion do not excuse prompt noticing of the motion. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>absence of a judge may extend the time to bring the entire case to trial <em>(Hartman </em>v. <em>Santamarina </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 762, 768 [180 Cal.Rptr. 337, 639 P.2d 979]), the importance of placing adverse counsel and the parties on notice of a serious question concerning further participation in the litigation demands early notice and filing of the appropriate objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">The seriousness of the delay in this case is manifest. Although there was a personal attempt by Nickel to obtain disciplinary sanctions from the State Bar, it failed. True, different standards of proof were applicable, but the failure in that forum did not excuse his seeking prompt relief in the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">In the meanwhile, years passed and much work on the case was done. Nickel\u2019s principal attorney speculated the matter was dormant for some time. He reported <em>only </em>230 hours of effort and a personal billing to Nickel of \u201cless than $25,000.00\u201d for that interval. During that same time, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel engaged in substantial discovery directed at Nickel and other defendants. One of the complained-of attorneys, Parker, examined over 200 files in the offices of Nickel\u2019s Sacramento counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Having allowed plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to engage in over 3,000 hours of litigation effort at a cost of $387,000 constitutes prejudice in more than time and dollars expended. The fruits of discovery presumably were shared by plaintiffs and their counsel. We can assume there is a substantial \u201cwork product\u201d in the hands of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. The right to its possession and interpretation would become a serious and complex issue if counsel were disqualified prior to its use. This unnecessary complication and prejudice is a direct by-product of the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Under these conditions, we find the delay in making the disqualification motion so unreasonable and the resulting prejudice so great, that the law must assume an implied waiver of the right to disqualify Attorney Greer; defendant Nickel is therefore estopped from asserting otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">Because we have found an implied consent to Attorney Greer proceeding on behalf of plaintiffs, we need not address the issue of cocounsel Parker\u2019s right to continue in the case. His disqualification hinged upon Greer\u2019s being disqualified. The implied waiver of objection to Greer extends to Parker.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">We therefore reverse the disqualification order. Costs on appeal are awarded to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">Martin, J., and Best, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 23,1987, and respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 15, 1987.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b968-8\">The motion and order for disqualification were directed not only to the attorney, T. Keister Greer, who previously represented one of the defendants, but also cocounsel, the law firm of Kuhs and Parker, on a theory of vicarious disqualification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b968-9\">For appellate purposes, plaintiffs purport <em>not </em>to challenge the lower court\u2019s \u201csubstantially related\u201d finding; however, their arguments frequently infer their counsel\u2019s prior work was not of significance to the current litigation and if there were confidences, time and disclosures have made them unimportant. Two days prior to oral argument in this appeal, T. Keister Greer received permission from this court to file an amicus brief. In that brief, Greer raised the substantial relationship issue which plaintiffs in turn attempted to urge at oral argument. However, because plaintiffs belatedly sought to challenge the trial court\u2019s substantial relationship finding, we will not review the merits of that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b969-9\">California Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 4-101 provides: \u201cA member of the State Bar shall not accept employment adverse to a client or former client, without the informed and written consent of the client or former client, relating to a matter in reference to which he has obtained confidential information by reason of or in the course of his employment by such client or former client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">All references hereafter to rules are to the California Rules of Professional Conduct unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b973-8\">The rule was rewritten in 1979 to provide greater leniency.
