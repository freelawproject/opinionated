In deciding this appeal, we do not intend our opinion to apply to a related but different question regarding the circumstances in which an attorney has a right to withdraw from a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Four sisters, Mahria Decker, Silvia McAbee, Lyn Reimholz and Lee Falcon (respondents)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entered into a contingency fee agreement with appellants G. Dana Hobart (Hobart) and the law firm of Oshman, Brownfield &amp; Smith (Oshman) (collectively appellants) in September 1979 for the purpose of contesting the will of their deceased brother, John Falco (decedent). Appellants filed a petition for revocation of probate of purported will in December 1979, on behalf of the respondents. The decedent\u2019s fifth sister, Virginia Vosburg, appeared in propria persona.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Inter alia, the decedent\u2019s will bequeathed $2,000 to each of his five sisters, leaving the bulk of decedent\u2019s estate to his friend and secretary Phyllis Werden. The value of the estate at the time of death in August 1979 was $918,924. The will was witnessed by the mother of Phyllis Werden, and executed by the decedent in October 1971, while he was hospitalized for liver complications stemming from alcoholism.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The contingency agreement provided that appellants would be obligated to \u201chandle the Will contest up to and through the trial thereof and a Motion for a new trial, if any.\u201d Noting that neither the clients nor appellants knew the value of the estate, the contract specified that appellants \u201cmay withdraw as attorneys for the Contestants, if they discover that there are not sufiicient assets subject to the contingency fee arrangement portion of the Estate to warrant them to prosecute said action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">In April 1983, all parties appeared in court prepared to begin trial, but stipulated to postpone trial until September due to an overcrowded court calendar. Thereafter, on May 11, Hobart then conducted an investigation and met with Dr. Telfer Reynolds, one of many physicians who examined the decedent in the hospital in October 1971, during the time decedent executed his will. Dr. Reynolds expressed his opinion that the decedent was competent at that time and able to execute a will, and was not in a mental or physical condition rendering him susceptible to influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Dr. Reynolds\u2019s evaluation prompted Hobart to advise respondents by letter dated May 13, 1983: \u201c... In short, [Dr. Reynolds\u2019s] testimony is directly contrary to our best interests in <em>every </em>respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">\u201c... [T]here is at least one mutual friend that John Falco and Ginny Vosburg had, the name of whom escapes me at the moment without digging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>into the file, who has unequivocally stated that during the last five or more years of your brother\u2019s life was [sz'c] angered with his sisters and intended to disinherit them.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">\u201cThe foregoing are facts of life. Whether or not you like the facts of life is of no importance. My role and responsibility is to attempt to evaluate the win/lose potential of any litigation. Only a fool would not see the handwriting on the wall and reject settlement negotiations when confronted with this kind of evidence and testimony. For these reasons I am asking that each of you communicate to me your immediate willingness to accept any settlement that I can put together. If you do not do so, I will be forced to withdraw from a [szc] case on the basis that it is unethical for me and Mr. Oshman to proceed with litigation that we consider to be without merit----</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">\u201cFinally, please understand that my position is unequivocal and cannot be changed by discussing irrelevant issues with you and listening to each of you tell me how much John Falco cared for and loved each of you.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">\u201cYour failure to respond within 10 days, in writing, will leave me with no choice but to file a motion in court setting forth the reasons why Mr. Oshman and I are seeking permission to be relieved as counsel. Please understand that under these circumstances the court will have no alternative but to grant our motion and you will be faced with representing yourself or securing new trial counsel at this late date.\u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Hobart deposed Dr. Reynolds in two sessions, on May 18 and June 1, 1983, and concluded that Dr. Reynolds\u2019s testimony and reputation were unshakeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">Appellants contend that prior to June 9, 1983, Hobart discussed settlement with his clients, who predicated their authority to settle upon appellants reducing their attorneys\u2019 fees, and upon the fifth sister, Vosburg, sharing in the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees. Respondents deny authorizing settlement and contend that they requested a reduction of attorneys\u2019 fees because the amount specified in the contract was unconscionable. The contract provided for appellants to receive 33 Vs percent of the decedent\u2019s gross estate if the case was settled before trial. Respondents allege that they requested appellants to amend the contract to provide for the attorneys\u2019 fees to be based on a percentage of respondents\u2019 recovery rather than a percentage of the value of the gross estate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>The facts in the record shed no light on the incidents which led Hobart to write to his clients on June 9, 1983, that \u201c[b]ased on the authority previously given us, Mr. Oshman has made a settlement offer to the attorney for Phyllis Werden that we settle the claim on a 50/50 basis.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hobart\u2019s letter further stated that he and Oshman agreed to \u201cthe modifications which [respondents] requested,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that appellants would not need to file a motion to withdraw if the settlement negotiations were successful. Hobart informed respondents that he would be leaving the United States for a period of one year on July 28, 1983. He then warned respondents that \u201cif something should occur which would nullify our settlement discussions or otherwise terminate them, you are placed on notice that I will not be available for trial under any circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">By certified mail on June 14, 1983, Mahria Decker immediately denied that she ever gave appellants the authority to settle, and intended to take the case to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">By letter dated June 20, 1983, Hobart wrote to Mahria Decker informing her that her denial of settlement authority left him with no alternative but to withdraw as attorney of record, and reiterating that he would be leaving the United States in August for a year and would not be available for trial under any circumstances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-11\">\u201cI am afraid you have finally placed me at the end of a rope.

They argued that this belief became \u201ccemented\u201d by Dr. Reynolds\u2019s deposition testimony. Hobart contended that \u201c[d]espite [respondents\u2019] constant refusal to cooperate, Mr. Oshman and I have diligently prosecuted this cause. Not until we became convinced that we had no reasonable chance to prevail did we seek to be relieved as [respondents\u2019] counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Appellants contended that it was their legal duty to withdraw from prosecuting an action which they believed lacked merit, alleging \u201c[n]ot only would it [have been] detrimental to [respondents] to be represented by counsel without faith in their cause, it would [have been] unethical for said attorneys to [have taken the] matter to trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Respondents, without benefit of legal counsel, did not file an opposition to appellants\u2019 motion to withdraw, but sent letters in opposition to the motion to the trial judge without serving copies on appellants. Respondents\u2019 sister, Virginia Vosburg, who never retained appellants as counsel, filed a formal opposition and appeared at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Appellants\u2019 motion to withdraw was granted on the basis that the attorney-client relationship had completely broken down.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Trial was continued until January 1984. All parties to the will contest action were served with copies of appellants\u2019 motion to withdraw, and as a result were aware of appellants\u2019 evaluation of the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The mandatory settlement conference was held in December 1983, with respondents appearing in propria persona. Under the supervision of the trial court, the parties entered in a settlement agreement which specified, inter alia, that the decedent\u2019s five sisters would each receive one-fifth of a 36 percent share of the net balance of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">In September 1984, appellants filed a petition seeking reimbursement of their costs and $48,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees. Appellants argued that their withdrawal was justified, entitling them to recover fees in quantum meruit because (1) their withdrawal was mandated by rules of professional conduct as a result of appellants\u2019 evaluation that the case was meritless; and (2) their clients did not cooperate and failed to authorize them to enter into settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>ment negotiations. In summarizing the important role appellants\u2019 work played in the eventual settlement of the case, appellants contended that there was a 2 percent chance their clients would prevail at trial as a result of their vigorous discovery work.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court allowed appellants to recover their costs pursuant to the provisions of the contingent fee agreement, but denied recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Contentions on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Appellants contend that they are entitled to recover fees in quantum meruit because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">1. Appellants withdrew in adherence to ethical mandates stemming from their belief that respondents\u2019 case was meritless;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">2. Respondents repudiated settlement authority and refused to settle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">3. Subsequent to appellants\u2019 withdrawal, respondents settled under terms similar to those negotiated by appellants; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-9\">4. Respondents refused to cooperate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">\n<em>California Decisions Concerning an Attorney\u2019s Right to Fees Following Discharge or Withdrawal From a Contingent Fee Arrangement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">In <em>Fracasse </em>v. <em>Brent </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 784 [100 Cal.Rptr. 385, 494 P.2d 9], our Supreme Court articulated the respective rights of an attorney and client engaged in a contingent fee agreement when the attorney is discharged. A client\u2019s right and power to discharge his or her attorney at any time, with or without cause, is absolute. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 790, citing Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 284.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>Such a discharge does not constitute a breach of contract for the reason that it is a basic term of the contract, implied by law. However, an attorney discharged with or without cause is entitled to recover, in quantum meruit, the reasonable value of services rendered up to the time of the discharge. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 791.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Appellants, who voluntarily withdrew from representing respondents, now wish to extend the policy laid down in <em>Fracasse.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Subsequent to the <em>Fracasse </em>decision, only two California cases, <em>Hensel </em>v. <em>Cohen </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 563 [202 Cal.Rptr. 85], and <em>Pearlmutter </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d Supp. 16 [158 Cal.Rptr. 762], have analyzed whether an attorney who voluntarily withdraws from a contingency fee contract is entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees from his client\u2019s subsequent recovery.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellants wish to distinguish <em>Hensel </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>and rely heavily upon <em>Pearlmutter </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>decided by the Appellate Department of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County.  We are not bound by <em>Pearlmutter </em>(9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 <em>777, </em>p. 747) and, to the extent that it is inconsistent with the views expressed herein, we decline to follow its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">In <em>Pearlmutter, </em>the court held that a client\u2019s failure to accept a settlement was justification for the attorneys\u2019 withdrawal, entitling them to recover attorneys\u2019 fees on the basis of the written lien executed by their clients. In dicta, the court concluded that the standard applied when a client discharges an attorney similarly applies to a case in which an attorney voluntarily withdraws;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we reject this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>The court in <em>Hensel, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d at page 568, specifically rejected the rubric of <em>Pearlmutter, </em>and embraced the general rule followed in other jurisdictions: recovery for services in quantum meruit is allowed only when the attorney has <em>justifiable </em>cause for withdrawing. An attorney who voluntarily abandons a case without good cause will be denied compensation. (I<em>d., </em>at p. 567, citing 7 Am.Jur.2d, Attorneys at Law, \u00a7\u00a7 262-266, pp. 298-303, Annot. (1978) 88 A.L.R.3d 246, \u00a7 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">In <em>Hensel, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d 563, the Cohen law firm filed a personal injury suit on behalf of Hensel. When efforts to obtain witnesses failed and the defendant\u2019s insurance company showed no interest in offering settlement, Cohen advised Hensel that the firm wished to withdraw from the case. Hensel engaged alternative counsel and subsequently settled the case. Finding that the firm was not justified in its withdrawal, the Court of Appeal denied recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees through enforcement of the written lien signed by Hensel.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Appellants argue that <em>Hensel </em>is distinguishable on the basis that the attorneys in <em>Hensel </em>expended merely 25 hours on the case before their withdrawal, compared to appellants\u2019 extensive investigation and discovery during a 4-year period. Appellants\u2019 emphasis is misplaced. In our view, the crucial element is the existence of a justifiable reason for withdrawing, not the quantity of time expended.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Appellants contend that once a trial court grants an attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw, cause for withdrawal has been established for the purpose of awarding attorneys\u2019 fees. We disagree. As the court noted in <em>Hensel, </em>\u201cemploying the proper procedure in withdrawing from a case is not synonymous with withdrawal for justifiable cause.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 568.) To protect the best interests of the client, a trial court should have broad discretion in allowing attorneys to withdraw. In the case at bar, the court granted appellants\u2019 motion to withdraw on the basis that the relationship between the parties had completely broken down. It was not relevant who caused the breakdown for the purposes of determining whether appellants should be allowed to withdraw, but rather, the trial court\u2019s concern focused on the effects the rift would have on respondents\u2019 legal representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">While a personality clash between the parties may provide good reason for allowing the attorney to withdraw, it is not necessarily a justifiable reason for purposes of awarding fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">\n<em>Attorneys May Be Entitled to Quantum Meruit Recovery if They Withdraw in Adherence to Ethical Mandates</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">To date, no court has addressed the question of whether an attorney\u2019s voluntary withdrawal, motivated by an adherence to professional ethical codes, constitutes a justifiable cause so as to permit a recovery of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Two crucial factors must be present for appellant to prevail.  First, we must conclude that withdrawal for ethical reasons justifies an award of attorneys\u2019 fees; an attorney who withdraws voluntarily without cause forfeits recovery for services performed. <em>(Hensel </em>v. <em>Cohen, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d at p. 567.) Second, the facts in the instant case must be sufficient to establish that appellants did in fact withdraw for a justifiable reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Business and Professions Code section 6068, subdivision (c), specifies that an attorney has a duty to maintain only such actions, proceedings or defenses as appear to him or her to be legal or just.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Our Supreme Court has commented that \u201c \u2018[w]hen an attorney loses faith in his cause he should either retire from the case or dismiss the action.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kirsch </em>v. <em>Duryea </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 303, 309-310 [146 Cal.Rptr. 218, 578 P.2d 935, 6 A.L.R. 4th 334], citing <em>Larimer </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1933) 130 Cal.App. 98, 101 [19 P.2d 825].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Appellants argue that an attorney hired under a contingent fee agreement who determines that a case is meritless, and thus withdraws from the case for ethical reasons is entitled to recovery in quantum meruit. In considering the merits of appellants\u2019 position, our concerns focus on two undesirable consequences of such a position.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">First, attorneys faced with failing claims may attempt to abandon a losing cause under the guise of an ethical duty, hoping later to collect their fees if the client eventually recovers at trial or through settlement. As the court aptly stated in <em>Hensel, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d at page 564, an attorney employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>on a contingency fee basis may not \u201cdetermine that it is not worth his time to pursue the matter, instruct his client to look elsewhere for legal assistance, but hedge his bet by claiming a part of the recovery if a settlement is made or a judgment obtained____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Secondly, appellants\u2019 position would require trial courts to weigh the veracity of the attorney\u2019s contention of an ethical motivation against the possibility that counsel\u2019s withdrawal was motivated by a desire to reduce counsel\u2019s own losses. Both motivations may well co-exist in the minds of counsel faced with a \u201cmeritless\u201d case. The trial judge is faced with the dilemma of determining the proportions of these two desires; ethical versus financial motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">As Professors Hazard and Hodes have noted, \u201c[i]t is impossible to look into a lawyer\u2019s head, and it is unacceptable simply to take his word for his state of mind when the probity of his own conduct is at issue.\u201d (Hazard &amp; Hodes, The Law of Lawyering: A Handbook on the Model Rules of Professional Conduct (1986 supp.) p. 342.) However, we must balance these considerations with the inequities which would result if attorneys compelled to withdraw from cases by the provisions of ethical codes, through no fault of their own, were denied the ability to recover compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Noting the difficulty facing a trial court in making a factual determination of an attorney\u2019s motivation, we nonetheless find that an attorney\u2019s withdrawal in adherence to ethical mandates is justified, entitling counsel to recover attorney\u2019s fees in quantum meruit. But, the attorney has the burden of proof to show: (1) counsel\u2019s withdrawal was mandatory, not merely permissive, under statute or State Bar rules;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (2) the overwhelming and primary motivation for counsel\u2019s withdrawal was the obligation to adhere to these ethical imperatives under statute or State Bar rules; (3) counsel commenced the action in good faith; (4) subsequent to counsel\u2019s withdrawal, the client obtained recovery; and (5) counsel has demonstrated that his work contributed in some measurable degree towards the client\u2019s ultimate recovery.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>A. The <em>Trial Court\u2019s Determination That Appellants Did Not Have Ethical Cause for Withdrawal Is Supported by Substantial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In denying appellants\u2019 petition, the trial court determined that the case was not, in fact, meritless, and further rejected appellants\u2019 contentions that their withdrawal was motivated by appellants\u2019 ethical duties.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the case was not meritless is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Despite the opposing parties\u2019 knowledge of Dr. Reynolds\u2019s deposition testimony and appellants\u2019 belief that the case lacked merit, all parties to the will contest action subsequently entered into a settlement agreement in which the five contesting sisters received 36 percent of the net balance of the estate.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Appellants did not consistently argue that the will contest was completely meritless. Appellants stated in their petition for attorneys\u2019 fees, that after fully explaining to the four sisters the liability aspects of the case, they refused to settle \u201cin spite of [appellants\u2019] advice that, in view of the very questionable liability, the proposed settlement amount was, in [appellants\u2019] opinion, <em>far greater than any possible recovery that could be obtained in the trial of the Contest </em>action.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">Appellants simultaneously argued that Dr. Reynolds\u2019s testimony \u201cpulled out the final vestiges of <em>any </em>hope\u201d that respondents could prevail at trial. (Italics added.) However, the credibility of Dr. Reynolds, one of a number of doctors who examined the decedent, and the totality of the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>under which the decedent executed his will, were ultimately questions of fact to be determined by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Appellants\u2019 inconsistent contentions regarding the validity of respondents\u2019 case was a factor to be considered by the trial court in making a factual determination as to appellants\u2019 motivation for withdrawal.  The presumption on appellate review favors the correctness of the judgment, and where there is a conflict in the evidence and the inferences to be drawn therefrom, an appellate court is bound to accept as true the evidence and inferences in accordance with the findings of the lower court. <em>(Price </em>v. <em>Hibbs </em>(1964) 225 Cal.App.2d 209, 216 [37 Cal.Rptr. 270].)  We find the trial court\u2019s factual determination to be supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">\n<em>A Client\u2019s Refusal to Settle Cannot in Itself Constitute Cause for Withdrawal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Appellants cite <em>Pearlmutter </em>v. <em>Alexander, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.3d Supp. 16, in contending that respondents\u2019 refusal to settle justified their withdrawal. As noted, we disagree with <em>Pearlmutter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">A client\u2019s right to reject settlement is absolute.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To hold otherwise would deprive the client of his due process right to proceed to trial on the merits.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The exercise of the right to reject settlement is implicit in the contract between a client and an attorney, and cannot constitute a breach of contract. This right is irreconcilable with the rule espoused in <em>Pearlmutter. </em>A client\u2019s exercise of this right cannot constitute cause for the purpose of awarding attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">\n<em>An Attorney May Be Entitled to Recover Under a Theory of Unjust Enrichment if a Client Who Repudiates Settlement Later Accepts the Terms Negotiated</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">While a client\u2019s exercise of the right to reject settlement is not cause for withdrawal, a client should be required to make restitution to the attorney, under a theory of unjust enrichment, if the client subsequently accepts settlement terms substantially similar to those negotiated by the attorney prior to his or her withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">In the case at bar, respondents were not unjustly enriched by the settlement they entered into six months after appellants\u2019 withdrawal.  The trial court\u2019s finding that the settlement entered into was not the direct result of appellants\u2019 labor is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">Appellants never solidified any settlement with the opposing parties. They merely offered settlement on behalf of four of the five sisters at a rate of 50 percent, three days prior to receiving word from respondents denying that appellants had authority to negotiate settlement. The trial court concluded that the subsequent settlement agreement entered into by all five sisters was not a direct result of the settlement efforts made by appellants, but rather was the result of six weeks of negotiations, supervised by the trial judge, in which respondents appeared in propria persona. The trial judge had firsthand knowledge of the proceedings in their entirety, and was in a superior position to evaluate the circumstances which led the parties to enter into the settlement agreement. On review, we find no error in this factual determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">\n<em>Substantial Evidence Supports the Trial Court\u2019s Finding That Respondents\u2019 Conduct Did Not Justify Appellants\u2019 Withdrawal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">Appellants argue that their withdrawal was justified by respondents\u2019 failure to cooperate. Other jurisdictions have recognized, under some instances, that an attorney who cannot obtain the cooperation of a client may be justified in withdrawing from the case and entitled to recover compensation. (See Annot. (1978) 88 A.L.R.3d 246, \u00a7 7, p. 260.)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>In their motion to withdraw, appellants contended that respondents refused to cooperate, claiming that one of their clients stated that she would not testify unless her transportation was paid for by appellants; that respondents denied appellants permission to incur jury fee and medical expert witness expenses; and that Mrs. Decker told appellants \u201c \u2018your contract with us requires you to pay the costs of litigation.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Appellants further contend that respondents\u2019 failure to take their advice regarding settlement constitutes failure to cooperate. Given that it was respondents\u2019 absolute right to refuse settlement, it would be anomalous to hold that their refusal to settle constitutes lack of cooperation sufficient to award attorneys\u2019 fees in quantum meruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Appellants\u2019 motion to withdraw was granted on the basis that the attorney-client relationship had completely broken down. It is clear from the record that there was mutual animosity between appellants and respondents. The harsh tone of Hobart\u2019s letters to respondents understandably did not improve their compatibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Adding to the troubled relationship was the dispute which arose over the attorneys\u2019 fees specified in the contract. In all likelihood the fees specified in the contract would have been substantially greater than any recovery gained by respondents. It does not appear from the record that this dispute was ever resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">It is reasonable to conclude that these factors adversely affected respondents\u2019 ability, and desire, to cooperate with appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">The decision as to whether an attorney\u2019s lien should be imposed lies within the trial court\u2019s discretion.  On review, we must resolve all conflicts in favor of the respondents, and indulge all legitimate and reasonable inferences to uphold the verdict. <em>(Crawford </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 427, 429 [45 P.2d 183].)  We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s implicit finding rejecting the contention that respondents\u2019 lack of cooperation justified appellants\u2019 withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">Klein, P.

Had respondents settled for 50 percent ($459,462), respondents would have received $153,157 after paying appellants $306,305. In comparison, if appellants\u2019 fees were calculated on the basis of the clients\u2019 recovery, in a settlement before trial of 50 percent, the clients would receive $306,310 and the appellants\u2019 fee of one-third would total $153,152.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\">The record on appeal contains no documentation of a settlement authorization given by any of the four sisters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Appellants contend that respondents agreed to proceed with settlement on the condition that Virginia Vosburg agree to share in fees and costs. Since Ms. Vosburg refused, appellants decided to reduce their fees by 20 percent to give their clients the equivalent of their request. The record does not indicate whether respondents agreed to the 20 percent reduction as an equivalent of Vosburg\u2019s contribution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b716-10\">\u201cDear Mrs. Decker:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b717-10\">At the hearing of the motion, the trial court stated, \u201c[I]t appears to the court... the attorney-client relationship is completely broken down.

In analyzing whether an attorney discharged by the client was entitled to recover fees, the <em>Moore </em>court focused on whether the discharge was for cause, and whether the contract was divisible. However, the analysis in the <em>Moore </em>decision is dubious in view of the court\u2019s subsequent analysis in the <em>Fracasse </em>case, which did not consider divisibility of the contract as a factor, and specifically rejected cause as a factor when an attorney is discharged. \u201cIn summary, we hold that an attorney discharged with or without cause is entitled to recover the reasonable value of his services rendered to the time of discharge. Cases to the contrary, commencing with <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Bennett </em>[1854] 4 Cal. 392, are overruled.\u201d <em>(Fracasse </em>v. <em>Brent, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 792.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b719-10\">In allowing the attorney to recover on his lien, the <em>Pearlmutter </em>court reasoned, \u201cWhile the trial court found that plaintiff was under no legal compulsion to withdraw from the case, there is no finding that his withdrawal was improper....

In cases involving permissive withdrawal it is within the discretion of the trial court, with heightened scrutiny consistent with the standards articulated here, to determine whether counsel\u2019s withdrawal was justified for the purpose of awarding fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b722-9\">This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of considerations which a trial court must utilize.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b723-10\">Tuming first to the provisions in the contract allowing for withdrawal, the trial court noted that the only right to withdraw established by contract was in the event there were insufficient assets in the estate: \u201cThere is nothing said in here about anything else exeept that.
