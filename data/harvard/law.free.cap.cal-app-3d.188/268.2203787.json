We further hold that the prosecution met its burden to rebut the inference of group bias. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\n<em>Propriety of Peremptory Challenges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">A. <em>Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">There were only two Blacks in the jury venire\u2014Mr. Warren Reed and Mrs. Jamsetta McGee\u2014and the prosecutor exercised two of its first six peremptory challenges to exclude them from the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">After the prosecutor had peremptorily excluded both Blacks, the defense made a <em>Wheeler (People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748]) motion for a mistrial, pointing out that the prosecutor had excused the only Black man and the only Black woman out of the 35 members of the jury panel, leaving the defendant as the only Black in the courtroom. Defense counsel asked that the prosecutor be required to make a showing of his reasons. The court noted \u201cfor the record\u201d that the prosecutor had excused \u201call of the black jurors in this case.\u201d  Following discussion of the governing cases, the court initially ruled that the defense had established a prima facie case and called upon the prosecutor to state his reasons for challenging both Blacks.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After hearing the prosecutor\u2019s explanations, the court denied the <em>Wheeler </em>motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>B. <em>Governing Principles and Procedural Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 258, our California Supreme Court recognized the danger that peremptory challenges could be used to undermine constitutional rights.  The <em>Wheeler </em>court concluded that \u201cthe use of peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors on the sole ground of group bias violates the right to trial by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community under article I, section 16, of the California Constitution.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 276-277.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In a series of subsequent decisions, our Supreme Court has repeatedly \u201cmade it clear that the courts of this state cannot tolerate [such] abuse of peremptory challenges . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 715-716, and cases cited therein.) Moreover, this \u201csame pernicious practice\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 716) has also recently been condemned by the United States Supreme Court as a violation of the right to equal Protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution. <em>(Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 79 [90 L.Ed.2d 69, 106 S.Ct. 1712].)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">There is a rebuttable presumption that a party exercising a peremptory challenge is doing so on a constitutionally permissible ground\u2014that is, on grounds of specific bias. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at p. 278.) \u201c[Peremptory challenges are a historic right, provided \u2018to insure that criminal trials are conducted before jurors who not only proclaim their impartiality, but whose ability to be evenhanded is not seriously questioned by <em>the parties. </em>. . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 302, 314 [208 Cal. Rptr. 196, 690 P.2d 669].) \u201c [T]he law recognizes that a peremptory challenge may be predicated on a broad spectrum of evidence suggestive of juror partiality\u201d which \u201cmay range from the obviously serious to the apparently trivial, from the virtually certain to the highly speculative.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at p. 275.) Peremptory challenges allow for the removal of a biased juror where \u201cthe party either cannot establish his reason by normal methods of proof or cannot do so without causing embarrassment . . . and resentment among the remaining jurors. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, \u201c[a] prosecutor may act freely on the basis of \u2018hunches,\u2019 unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>and until these acts create a prima facie case of group bias, and even then he may rebut the inference.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 161, 170 [197 Cal.Rptr. 71, 672 P.2d 854].)</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">In <em>Wheeler, </em>the California Supreme Court established the following procedure as a remedy for the misuse of peremptory challenges: \u201cIf a party believes his opponent is using his peremptory challenges to strike jurors on the ground of group bias alone, he must raise the point in timely fashion and make a prima facie case of such discrimination to the satisfaction of the court. First... he should make as complete a record of the circumstances as is feasible. Second, he must establish that the persons excluded are members of a cognizable group within the meaning of the representative cross section rule. Third, from all the circumstances of the case he must show a strong likelihood that such persons are being challenged because of their group association rather than because of any specific bias. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d (22 Cal.3d at p. 280; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 717-718.)</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Once the defense makes out a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the prosecution to rebut the inference of impermissible group bias. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 281; accord <em>People </em>v. <em>Motion </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 596, 600 [217 Cal.Rptr. 416, 704 P.2d 176]; <em>People v. Trevino, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 688.) We rely \u201con the good judgment of the trial courts to distinguish bona fide reasons for such peremptories from sham excuses belatedly contrived to avoid admitting acts of group discrimination.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at p. 282; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 168.) But \u201cwe must do so in the \u2018specific bias\u2019 context envisaged by <em>Wheeled\u2019 </em>because \u201c[o]nly then can we assure that a defendant is afforded the full complement of cross-sectional rights.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Trevino, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 688, fn. 21.) Thus, \u201c[i]n determining whether the prosecution has satisfied this burden, the court must not consider the proffered justifications in terms of the district attorney\u2019s \u2018 \u201cjudgment\u201d or \u201csincerity,\u201d \u2019 but must determine whether the \u2018ground of challenge was a specific bias on the part of the individual juror.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 688.)</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 96 [90 L.Ed.2d at p. 87] the United States Supreme Court recently adopted \u201cessentially the same procedure.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 717.) The court held that in order to establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, \u201cdefendant first must show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group [citation] and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant\u2019s race. Second, the defendant is entitled to rely on the fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>as to which there can be no dispute, that peremptory challenges constitute a jury selection practice that permits \u2018those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.\u2019 [Citation.] Finally, the defendant must show that these facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used that practice to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury on account of their race.\u201d <em>(Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, supra, </em>476 U. S. at p. 96 [90 L.Ed.2d at pp. 87-88].)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u201cOnce the defendant makes a prima facie showing, the burden shifts to the State to come forward with a neutral explanation for challenging black jurors. . . . The prosecutor . . . must articulate a neutral explanation related to the particular case to be tried. The trial court then will have the duty to determine if the defendant has established purposeful discrimination.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 97-98 [90 L.Ed.2d at pp. 88-89], fns. 20 &amp; 21 omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">C. <em>Defendant Established a Prima Facie Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The People contend that defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of discriminatory exclusion of Blacks from the jury. We disagree. Defendant herein clearly made the requisite showing of the first two elements. The record accurately demonstrates that the prosecutor used two of his peremptory challenges to strike the only prospective Black jurors so that none remained on the jury panel. Secondly, it is well settled that Blacks constitute a cognizable group. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 719; <em>People v. Trevino, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 686; <em>People </em>v. <em>Motton, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 605; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at p. 280, fn. 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The crucial question herein involves the third element: taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration, did defendant show a strong likelihood that Mr. Reed and Mrs. McGee were being challenged because they were Black rather than because of any specific bias? \u201cWhether race was, in fact, the exclusive basis need not be proved; <em>the objecting party need only make a prima facie showing </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(Holley </em>v. <em>J &amp; S Sweeping Co. </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 588, 593 [192 Cal.Rptr. 74].)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">The <em>Wheeler </em>court, for the purpose of illustration, listed several methods by which a party might satisfy this final prong of a prima facie showing. For example: \u201c[T]he party may show that his opponent has struck most or all of the members of the identified group from the venire, or has used a disproportionate number of his peremptories against the group. He may also demonstrate that the jurors in question share only this one characteristic\u2014 their membership in the group\u2014and that in all other respects they are as heterogeneous as the community as a whole. Next, the showing may be supplemented when appropriate by such circumstances as the failure of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>opponent to engage these same jurors in more than desultory voir dire, or indeed to ask them any questions at all. Lastly, . . . the defendant need not be a member of the excluded group in order to complain of a violation of the representative cross-section rule; yet if he is, and especially if in addition his alleged victim is a member of the group to which the majority of the remaining jurors belong, these facts may also be called to the court\u2019s attention. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d <em>(People v. Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 280-281; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 167; <em>People </em>v. <em>Trevino, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 688, fn. 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">In the case herein, the prosecutor peremptorily struck the only two Black jurors in the entire venire. Moreover, in a case of alleged exclusion on the ground of race it may be significant if the persons challenged, although all Black, include both men and women and are of a variety of ages, occupations and social or economic condition. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 280, fn. 27; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fuller </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 403, 419 [186 Cal.Rptr. 283]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 719.) Here, the two challenged jurors shared few if any characteristics other than their race.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although the prosecutor questioned Mrs. McGee extensively on voir dire, particularly with respect to her familiarity with the location, he asked no questions at all of Mr. Reed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Finally, not only was defendant a member of the excluded group of prospective jurors, but the alleged victim was a member of the group to which a majority of the jurors belonged. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 719; <em>People </em>v. <em>Motton, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 607, fn. 3.) \u201c[I]f a defendant is black, and the victim is white such facts would be especially <em>significant in the totality of circumstances </em>in establishing group bias. [Italics in original.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra, </em>136 Cal.App.3d at p. 419.) \u201cThe prosecutor clearly possessed a motive to exclude black jurors in that the defendant was black while the victim[] [was] white.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harvey </em>(1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 90, 110 [208 Cal.Rptr. 910].) These race factors are particularly significant in a mixed race rape case such as here when it is apparent that the defense would be misidentification and alibi. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra, </em>136 Cal.App.3d at pp. 419-420.) Here, as in <em>Turner, </em>\u201c[t]he combination of these factors establishes a prima facie case of group discrimination.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 719.)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Nonetheless, the People, in effect, claim that a prima facie case cannot be established where, as here, there were only two Black jurors in the venire and the prosecutor challenged both. Not so. Prima facie cases have been found when seven peremptory challenges were used to remove all Blacks <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 280); when all six Hispanics and one of two Hispanic alternates were peremptorily challenged <em>(People </em>v. <em>Trevino, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d 667); when five of eight peremptories were used to remove all Black jurors <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 169; <em>People </em>v. <em>Motton, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 607); when seven of thirteen challenges eliminated all but one Black juror <em>(ibid.); </em>when four of ten challenges removed all Blacks <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clay </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 433, 456 [200 Cal.Rptr. 269]); when three of six challenges removed three out of four Black jurors <em>(Holley </em>v. <em>J &amp; S Sweeping Co., supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d at p. 590); when three challenges were used to remove the only three available Black jurors <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra, </em>136 Cal.App.3d at p. 415); and when three of four Hispanics and one of the alternates were peremptorily challenged <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ortega </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 63 [202 Cal.Rptr. 657]).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Furthermore, the recent case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 711, makes it clear that two peremptory challenges can make a prima facie case. In <em>Turner, </em>where the prosecution eventually peremptorily challenged three Black panelists, the California Supreme Court concluded that a prima facie case was established where \u201c[a]s of the time of the <em>[Wheeler] </em>motion, the prosecutor had used <em>two </em>of his first five peremptory challenges to strike the only Black prospective jurors in the box.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 719, italics added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">There is no arbitrary numerical cutoff so that if only one or two Black jurors are on the venire or survive challenges for cause, \u201cthe prosecutor need have no compunction about striking them from the jury because of their race.\u201d <em>(Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 105 [90 L.Ed.2d at p. 93], Marshall, J. concurring.) We emphatically reject any automatic rule which would leave prosecutors \u201cfree to discriminate against blacks in jury selection provided that they hold that discrimination to an \u2018acceptable level [of one or two].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 105 [90 L.Ed.2d at pp. 93-94].)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Accordingly, in view of the total circumstances herein <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 719), and relying on the indisputable fact that \u201cperemptory challenges constitute a jury selection practice that permits \u2018those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate\u2019 \u201d <em>(Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 96 [90 L.Ed.2d at p. 87]), we conclude that defendant sustained his burden to make a prima facie showing of impermissible exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">D. <em>The Prosecution Justifications Were Sufficient</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The trial court herein had required the prosecution to justify its exclusion of the two Black jurors and thereafter denied the <em>Wheeler </em>motion. We therefore now turn to an analysis of the proffered reasons to determine whether the prosecution satisfied its burden to rebut the inference of impermissible group bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The People argue that the prosecutor gave specific reasons for excluding both Reed and McGee but the prosecutor must show the exclusion was on grounds of a \u201cspecific bias,\u201d not just a \u201cspecific reason.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Trevino, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at pp. 689-690.) Moreover, disparate treatment of the members of the excluded group and the unchallenged jurors is indicative of group bias <em>(id., </em>at p. 690) and can in itself warrant the conclusion that the prosecutor exercised peremptories for impermissible reasons <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 168). A prosecutor may sustain his burden by showing that he peremptorily challenged similarly situated members of the majority group on identical or comparable grounds. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 282.) However, \u201c[s]uch a comparison must be presented to the trial court at the time the prosecution attempts to justify the challenges made to members of the cognizable class. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Trevino, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 692.) \u201cIt is the prosecution\u2019s responsibility to bring these circumstances to the trial court\u2019s attention. It is neither the function nor the duty of the trial courts, or the appellate courts on review, to speculate as to prosecutorial motivation for other peremptory challenges.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 692, fn. 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The prosecutor offered the following reasons for excusing Mr. Reed: \u201cI noted his demeanor and the way he looked at me during jury selection. He had a rather unpleasant look and his face toward me made me feel very uncomfortable with him. [11] He was wearing dark glasses yesterday, wore a gold chain, velour shirt, Levi\u2019s with running shoes. [1i] His manner in responding to the questions I found were\u2014I felt very uncomfortable with. He was reading a newspaper in the jury box. [If] More importantly, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>standing alone at the end of the hall when I would look at him, away from all prospective jurors and kind of being the loner of the bunch. [H] All of these factors I felt\u2014his appearance, the mannerisms that he had at the time there with his arms folded in front of each other, he appeared to be a very closed person, one that would either result in a hung jury or be unreceptive to the evidence. [II] I would have challenged him would he have been Caucasian, oriental or any other ethnic group because of his overt actions. [II] Those are my specific reasons, specific bias, and those are the reasonings for the specific bias.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s explanations for challenging Mr. Reed were predominantly based on his appearance, demeanor and overt actions in court. In <em>Wheeler, </em>our Supreme Court said that a prospective juror may permissibly be excluded, for example, if the prosecutor fears bias because \u201chis clothes or hair length suggest an unconventional lifestyle\u201d or \u201cmistrust[s] ... a juror\u2019s objectivity on no more than the \u2018sudden impressions and unaccountable prejudices we are apt to conceive upon the bare looks and gestures of another.\u2019 \u201d (22 Cal.3d at p. 275; accord <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at pp. 314-315.) We recognize that, more recently, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Trevino, </em>the court rejected a prosecutor\u2019s \u201creason\u201d for exclusion based solely on the prospective juror\u2019s \u201cbody language and mode of answering certain questions\u201d as \u201cparticularly untenable in light of <em>Wheeler\u2019s </em>requirement of a showing of specific bias. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d (39 Cal.3d at p. 692.) The court noted that \u201c[t]o suggest . . . that either body language . . . or a conclusory notion that a juror might not form his own opinion . . . rises to the level of specific bias in the <em>Wheeler </em>context, is to reduce the constitutional guarantee to meaningless superficialities.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Trevino, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 692, fn. 25.) Nonetheless, the prosecution showing need not rise to the level of the challenge for cause. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 167.)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Here, the trial court could validly determine that the prosecutor had sustained his burden to justify his peremptory challenge of Mr. Reed. The prosecutor\u2019s subjective impressions based on body language, demeanor and apparel were buttressed by reference to objectively observable overt actions by the prospective juror. Although neither the prosecutor\u2019s conclusory assumption from seeing Mr. Reed folding his arms (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Trevino, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 690, fn. 22), nor the juror\u2019s \u201crather unpleasant look\u201d (cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at pp. 171-172, Bird, C. J., concurring) nor his clothing would suffice in and of itself to indicate \u201cspecific bias,\u201d the prosecutor also articulated his reliance on the facts that Mr. Reed was standing apart from the other jurors in the hall and was reading the newspaper in the jury box. The prosecutor, and the court, could reasonably infer from the latter action in the jury box, especially when combined with Reed\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>facial expressions, a disdain for the proceedings, if not out right antagonism to the prosecutor and the court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We next turn to the prosecutor\u2019s proffered reasons for challenging Mrs. McGee. The prosecutor gave the following explanation: \u201cI have been trying cases for 15 years and been trying jury trials for that long, too. I have been selecting\u2014been through\u2014tried hundreds of jury trials. [11] I found county employees with service such as 18 years in a position such as Mrs. McGee said she had are set\u2014do not\u2014there\u2019s a high substantial risk of them not being satisfactory jurors. [1\u00cd] Now, this is whether they are Black or they are White. This has nothing to do with color whatsoever. In the capacity in which she worked, my primary\u2014one of the primary things I make decisions on is occupations, so her occupation, I felt, was not inducive to the type of case that we\u2019re trying here, the type of juror I\u2019m looking for specifically. [1\u00cd] She lives in an area that\u2019s close to where the defendant lives right now. He lives with Paulette Hooker on Bellaire, which is close to approximately where Mrs. McGee lived. [11] Mrs. McGee has sons which are the approximate age of the defendant in this case. I believe that she would identify with those sons in deciding\u2014there\u2019s a change [xzc], a risk that she would do so. [11] I feel that she grew up in the area. She knows the area too familiarly. I think in this situation I would rather have jurors that were totally, totally unfamiliar with that specific area. [If] She says she drives up Los Robles past that location on numerous times, and there\u2019s such a thing as being too close. [If] But primarily, with respect to her, it was on the basis\u2014my specific reason for challenging her was her occupation, her age. She is an elderly lady. As the court noted, I have been excusing elderly jurors, a number of them, throughout the course of this trial. [If] And my excusal of her, again, was not based upon race at all. It was based upon occupation and the other factors that I have outlined to the court. [If] And there were also matters in which she answered the court\u2019s questions, the court\u2019s questionnaire, which I was looking at, her various\u2014the way she did that. [11] Again, not based upon race, but based upon the manner in which she did that made me feel uncomfortable with her. [If] Now, the fact that those are the only two [Blacks] in the panel, I wish there were more Black jurors in the panel but there weren\u2019t. That\u2019s not my fault. I have to do\u2014to competently select the jury in the manner I feel is best. I would welcome more Black jurors on the panel, but that would be the subject matter of another motion, not a Wheeler motion in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The articulated reasons for excusing Mrs. McGee generally appear on their face to be legitimately based upon specific bias. Moreover, at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>some of them withstand analysis for disparate treatment between unchallenged jurors and her. The prosecutor stressed that his primary rationale for excluding her was \u201cher occupation\u201d and \u201cher age.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s expressed dissatisfaction with county clerical employees with about 18 years service was not inconsistent with his acceptance of Ms. Velasquez, a young single woman who had worked five years for the Department of Water and Power. Although there was no evidence of Mrs. McGee\u2019s exact age, she was described as \u201celderly.\u201d The record supports the prosecutor\u2019s claim that he had been excusing \u201ca number\u201d of \u201celderly jurors\u201d since at least two, if not three, of the previously challenged White jurors would be classified as \u201celderly.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is true that the prosecutor\u2019s alternate reason that Mrs. McGee had sons about the defendant\u2019s age does not survive analysis; three unchallenged jurors (two women and one man) also had sons the same age.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Finally, however, the record supports the prosecutor\u2019s references to her knowing \u201cthe area too familiarly.\u201d She was the only juror who had not only grown up there and was \u201cup and down that street all the time\u201d but also she had family (a granddaughter) living right there.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, the prosecution also sufficiently rebutted the inference that Mrs. McGee\u2019s exclusion was based <em>solely </em>on group bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\"><em>Sentencing </em>Error<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\n<em>Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Lillie, P. J., and Johnson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 16, 1987. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should, be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-11\">In the unpublished part of this opinion, we reject defendant's further contention that the trial court failed to exercise its discretion in imposing a five-year enhancement for a prior rape conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b144-10\">The prosecutor actually exercised seven peremptory challenges in all. Reed was the fourth challenged and McGee was the sixth. In order of challenge, the others were: Mrs. Hurley (#1), Mr. Fuginami (#2), Mr. Barbe (#3), and Mr. Gilmore (#5). After the only two Black prospective jurors were excused and the court had denied the <em>Wheeler </em>motion, the prosecutor peremptorily challenged one more person, Mr. Potlerana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b144-11\">The court stated: \u201cTo cut it short, I think that [the defense] has made out a prima facie case. You have excluded the only two black people in the whole courtroom. [H]. . . . Let me just say that I have concluded that to cut it short. [H] So why don\u2019t you state your reasons for why you have excluded those two people.\u201d This was an express ruling that gave the prosecutor notice that he was required to justify his peremptory challenges. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 711, 719, fn. 3 and conc. opn. at p. 729 [230 Cal.Rptr. 656, 726 P.2d 102].) Indeed, even without the explicit statement herein of a prima facie case, a trial court\u2019s inquiry into the prosecutor\u2019s reasons implies a finding of group discrimination and shifts the burden of justification to the prosecutor. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 719.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b144-12\">Subsequently, after denying the <em>Wheeler </em>motion, the court apparently changed its mind about the existence of a prima facie case since it later stated its \u201cfindings for the record\u201d that defendant had not sustained his burden to establish a prima facie case. Regardless of the court\u2019s belated statement, we have no doubt that defendant made the required prima facie case of group discrimination as the court originally found.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b145-7\">\u201cGroup bias\u201d is the presumption \u201cthat certain jurors are biased merely because they are members of an identifiable group distinguished on racial, religious, ethnic, or similar grounds . . . .\u201d <em>(Wheeler, id., </em>at p. 276.) It is to be contrasted with \u201cspecific bias\u201d which has been defined as \u201ca bias relating to the particular case on trial or the parties or witnesses thereto.\u201d <em>(Ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Of course, \u201c[t]he representative cross-section rule does not guarantee a jury which includes members of a defendant\u2019s group or that \u2018mirror[s] the demographic composition\u2019 of the community.

Medical Center as a data entry clerk for about 18 years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The prosecutor also peremptorily challenged three other males (Barbe, Gilmore, and Pollerana) without asking them any questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The People\u2019s reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Rousseau </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 526, 536-537 [179 Cal.Rptr. 892], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Harvey, supra, </em>163 Cal.App.3d 90, for the proposition that two peremptory challenges cannot make a prima facie case is misplaced. As the <em>Turner </em>court pointed out (42 Cal.3d at p. 719), <em>Rousseau </em>is distinguishable because there the defendant\u2019s attempt to make a prima facie case was limited to a statement that the only two Blacks on the panel were challenged. There were no other circumstances shown. Indeed, in <em>Rousseau, </em>where the defendant was charged with theft and a failure to remit unemployment taxes, the race of the defendant was not even shown. Moreover, in <em>Harvey, </em>although the court did not find a prima facie discrimination there, it recognized that \u201c[i]n theory at least, even the exclusion of a single prospective juror may be the product of an improper group bias.\u201d (163 Cal.App.3d at p. 111.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b152-6\">There is no issue of disparate treatment between Mr. Reed and other unchallenged jurors.
