Gerald Armstrong. That action was tried before Judge Breckenridge, and a judgment signed by Judge Breckenridge was entered in favor of the defendant on August 10, 1984. The judgment contained comprehensive orders with respect to the disposition of all documents or objects received in evidence or marked for identification during the trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>The complaint in the case giving rise to this appeal, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, was filed on December 20, 1984 and was assigned to a department of the superior court other than that presided over by Judge Breckenridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The complaint states no cause of action. In reality, it seeks to have one department of the superior court review and restrain the judicial act of another department of the superior court. That cannot be done. The complaint sought an order restraining the superior court and the clerk of the superior court from carrying out and executing the judgment which had been entered by the superior court in case number C 420153 on August 10, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The preliminary injunction was denied by Judge Shimer on January 16, 1985 without prejudice to the plaintiffs\u2019 right to make further application to Judge Breckenridge; later, the demurrer of defendants superior court and Frank S. Zolin, clerk of the superior court, to the amended verified complaint, was sustained without leave to amend, the judge noting in his minute order that the court had no jurisdiction over the matter. The order of dismissal was made and entered by Judge Dowds on March 28, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cA superior court is but one tribunal, even if it be composed of numerous departments____An order made in one department during the progress of a cause can neither be ignored nor overlooked in another department....\u201d \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Grace, 11 </em>Cal.App. 752 . . . cited in <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Offenberg, </em>275 Cal.App.2d 575, 583 . . . .) This is because the state Constitution, article VI, section 4 vests jurisdiction in the court, \u2018... and not in any particular judge or department ... ; and ... whether sitting separately or together, the judges hold but one and the same court. [Citation.] It follows, ... where a proceeding has been ... assigned for hearing and determination to one department of the superior court by the presiding judge ... and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>proceeding ... has not been finally disposed of... it is beyond the jurisdictional authority of another department of the same court to interfere with the exercise of the power of the department to which the proceeding has been so assigned____If such were not the law, conflicting adjudications of the same subject-matter by different departments of the one court would bring about an anomalous situation and doubtless lead to much confusion. [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>14 Cal.2d 656, 662 . <em>. . .)\u201d (In re Kowalski </em>(1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 67, 70 [98 Cal.Rptr. 444]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Batchelor </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 278, 284 [128 Cal.Rptr. 349].)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">One department of the superior court cannot enjoin, restrain, or otherwise interfere with the judicial act of another department of the superior court. Even between superior courts of different counties, having coequal jurisdiction over a matter, the first court of equal dignity to assume and exercise jurisdiction over a matter acquires exclusive jurisdiction. <em>(Morrisette </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1965) 236 Cal.App.2d 597, 599-600 [46 Cal.Rptr. 153]; <em>Browne </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 593, 597 [107 P.2d 1, 131 A.L.R. 276].)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">A judgment rendered in one department of the superior court is binding on that matter upon all other departments until such time as the judgment is overturned. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 727, 734 [57 Cal.Rptr. 818].)  Appellate jurisdiction to review, revise, or reverse decisions of the superior courts is vested by our Constitution only in the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeal. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a711.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">In the present case, neither Judge Shimer nor Judge Dowds had jurisdiction to make any order which would interfere with the judgment made and entered on August 10, 1984, by the superior court, Judge Breckenridge presiding, nor with respect to the documentary exhibits which were subjects of the orders previously made by Judge Breckenridge. Plaintiffs\u2019 remedy was by way of intervention in the main case, and, in the event of an adverse decision there, an appeal to this court. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a711.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">In the light of our affirming the order of dismissal of the entire action below, for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, it follows that there was no viable action below and the question of the propriety of the denial of the preliminary injunction is moot.  Furthermore, although the plaintiffs \u201cRoes 1 through 200\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed a timely notice of appeal from the minute order denying a preliminary injunction, they have not presented a legal argument nor cited any authorities, and have not specified any points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>in support of that appeal and we treat it as waived. <em>(Estate of Randall </em>(1924) 194 Cal. 725, 728-729 [230 P. 445]; <em>Ward v. Litowsky </em>(1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 437, 439 [85 Cal.Rptr. 278]; and see text and authorities cited at 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 479, pp. 469-470.)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The orders denying preliminary injunction and dismissing the entire action are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Klein, P.
