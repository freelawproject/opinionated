Dipinto and Dipinto Manufacturing Company, Inc. (Dipinto Company) appeal from the \u201cOrder Accepting Stipu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>lation of Parties and Determining Title to Property in Favor of the Estate and Withdrawing Objections Thereto\u201d filed November 20,1985, and the \u201cEx Parte Order Re Execution Of Documents By The County Clerk\u201d filed November 25, 1985. The order \u201c[a]djudicating the merits of [the] claim under [Probate Code] Section 851.5\u201d constitutes a judgment and is appeal-able. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1240, subd. (i).) Appellants contend that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Respondent was appointed administrator with will annexed to the estate of America Dipinto, following her death. Respondent filed a \u201cPetition For Order Directing Conveyance And For Damages\u201d on behalf of the estate. The petition alleged that assets of the estate had been concealed and misappropriated by Joanna Delgado, Josephine Cockman, and John Dipinto, and that the assets had been diverted into the personal bank accounts and real estate holdings of those parties and into Dipinto Company, a corporation of which John Dipinto and Ms. Cockman were directors, and of which they were president and bookkeeper respectively. Appellants opposed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">At the mandatory settlement conference held September 4, 1985, respondent and beneficiaries Renaldo Dipinto, Josephine Cockman, Joanna Delgado and John Dipinto entered into a settlement agreement and their counsel concurred in that agreement. Although beneficiary Philip Dipinto was not present, he agreed through counsel to accept the settlement agreement. In open court the trial judge inquired of John Dipinto, who was represented by counsel, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">\u201cThe Court: Did you understand everything that your lawyer Mr. Antablin was saying with respect to the settlement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">\u201cMr. John Dipinto: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">\u201cThe Court: Did you also understand everything Mr. Oldman [attorney for John Mills] was saying with respect to the settlement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-10\">\u201cMr. John Dipinto: Yes, with one question, Your Honor. I have a check coming, which I discussed with Mr. Oldman, due any day for $3,000.1 want that check, and anything previous on from today he gets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-11\">\u201cThe Court: All right. That\u2019s understood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-12\">\u201cMr. Oldman: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Mr. John Dipinto, do you believe you\u2019ve had sufficient time to discuss the terms and conditions of the settlement with your attorney Mr. Antablin?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\">\u201cMr. John Dipinto: (Nods head up and down.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">\u201cThe Court: Do you believe you\u2019ve had sufficient time to talk about this with your attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">\u201cMr. John Dipinto : Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The trial court took the trial date off calendar. A written agreement was prepared which John Dipinto refused to sign. On November 20, 1985, the trial court held a hearing on respondent\u2019s motion that the agreement be entered as a judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. That section provides: \u201cIf parties to pending litigation stipulate, in writing or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The court heard John Dipinto\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-9\">\u201cThe Court: Will you tell the court why it is that you do not wish to sign the papers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-10\">\u201cThe Witness: It was my understanding that when we talked in your chambers, I was supposedly to get 50,000 tax return and 21,000 from the estate that\u2019s holding a check for me plus a twelve percent interest which was at that time put in trust for me. Plus $8500 for selling up Hisperia, which they now say there\u2019s only $2400 left. $10,000 for a car that was taken from Dipinto Manufacturing, plus $30,000 that they were going to give to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-11\">\u201cThe agreement came to practically 125,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-12\">\u201cNow I understand that in the wording, the one third that I would never give up, a word was put in there that I didn\u2019t understand, residue as of September.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-13\">\u201cI did not agree to\u2014for September date. I agreed for one third whatever is left. If there\u2019s nothing, I want nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-14\">\u201cBut I am not giving up my one third that\u2019s left in the will, and I am not giving up saying my mother owns 45 percent of the property so I can get a tax refund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>\u201cI expected that to come from the money that they are getting from me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">\u201cNow as I understand just two weeks ago, that it says you get one third which is $800.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">\u201cI donate that $800, but I will not sign any agreement that I get one third of just the Hisperia. Hisperia was asked quite a while ago. What happened to the money when I wasn\u2019t notified and I found out that they had auctioned it off?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">\u201cThey said there\u2019s nothing left. Now all of a sudden there\u2019s $2400 plus there\u2019s $4000 that was sent from a brother that doesn\u2019t know anything about the whole case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">\u201cNow this other money that\u2019s being taken, because I\u2019m not one that has money, and everybody else now is a partner of me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The court had before it a transcript of the September 4, 1985, proceeding as well as his own recollection of that proceeding, a declaration of respondent\u2019s attorney in support of the motion, a written agreement prepared by respondent\u2019s attorney and approved by counsel for all parties, and a letter dated November 6, 1985, in which John Dipinto\u2019s attorney stated with regard to the written agreement: \u201cUpon reviewing the enclosures, it appears to me as though all is in order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">The court heard argument and granted respondent\u2019s motion. It accepted the stipulation of the parties and determined entitlement to property pursuant to section 851.5 of the Probate Code in accordance with the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 authorizes the court to enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement orally stipulated to \u201cbefore the court\u201d if it determines that the parties have entered into a valid and binding settlement agreement. <em>(Casa de Valley View Owner\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>Stevenson </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 1182, 1189 [213 Cal.Rptr. 790].) In making that determination the court acts as a trier of fact. <em>(Fiore </em>v. <em>Alvord </em>(1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 565 [221 Cal.Rptr. 400]; see also <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Richardson </em>(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 91 [225 Cal.Rptr. 370].)  The proper standard of review of the court\u2019s exercise of discretion in granting the motion is whether the court\u2019s ruling is supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Casa de Valley View Owner\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>Stevenson, supra, </em>167 Cal.App.3d at p. 1190.)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">In this case the trial court had presided at the mandatory settlement conference at which the oral settlement agreement was made and inquired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>on the record to make sure that John Dipinto understood that agreement. On November 20, 1985, the trial judge heard John Dipinto testify that he would not have entered into the agreement if he had understood all of the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">At the time it made its determination the trial court had heard the oral stipulation of settlement made before it on September 4,1985, and had heard John Dipinto\u2019s September 4, 1985, representation that he understood that agreement. It also had before it the transcript of those September 4, 1985, proceedings. These constituted substantial evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s determination that a valid and binding agreement had been entered into by the parties before the court on September 4, 1985. The trial court obviously disbelieved John Dipinto\u2019s November 20, 1985, testimony and resolved the dispute in favor of respondent. That determination, supported as it was by substantial evidence, does not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Section 664.6 of the Code of Civil Procedure took effect on January I, 1982. It does not appear to us that the appeal, taken in a developing area of the law (see <em>Datatronic Systems Corp. </em>v. <em>Speron, Inc. </em>(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1168, 1172 [222 Cal.Rptr. 658]), is \u201cfrivolous or taken solely for delay.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 907.) Respondent\u2019s request for sanctions is accordingly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Woods, P. J. and Kingsley, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February II, 1987.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
