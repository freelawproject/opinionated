Code, \u00a7 11352) and one count of possession of heroin for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351). Before trial one count of heroin sale was dismissed. Following trial by jury, appellant was convicted of the two remaining counts. The trial court sentenced appellant to state prison for the middle term of four years for the heroin sale plus a consecutive one-year term for possession of heroin for sale. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">In early September 1984, Sergio Santos, a Tulare County narcotics detective, entered into an agreement with Robert Hernandez, a heroin user, by which Hernandez would work as an undercover purchaser of heroin in return for Santos\u2019s \u201chelp\u201d in some pending misdemeanor cases. Santos had received numerous calls regarding suspected heroin sales at appellant\u2019s home in Earlimart. Santos knew appellant had been convicted in 1978 for heroin sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">On September 12, 1984, Santos directed Hernandez to meet him on the outskirts of Earlimart. There, Santos strip searched Hernandez, determined that he had no heroin in his possession and drove him to appellant\u2019s residence. Santos instructed Hernandez to go to appellant\u2019s door, ask for \u201cBoogie,\u201d an older, heavy-set man, and tell him that he wanted to buy some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>heroin. Santos and another agent named Conley then watched as Hernandez went to appellant\u2019s door.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">At appellant\u2019s door, appellant answered and responded that he was \u201cBoogie.\u201d Hernandez then asked appellant if he could buy a $20 bag of heroin. Appellant said \u201chold on,\u201d reached into his pocket, and took out a small orange container from which he removed a tinfoil \u201cbindle\u201d later found to contain heroin. Hernandez saw six or more bindles inside the container. Hernandez gave appellant the $20, took the bindle, and asked appellant if he could return for more bindles. Appellant replied that he could. Hemanez immediately walked with the bindle to Santos\u2019s car parked nearby and gave it to Santos. Hernandez, who had never seen appellant before, later picked out appellant\u2019s photograph from a lineup presented by Santos. Santos then obtained a warrant for appellant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">On November 20, 1984, Santos met with Tulare County Narcotics Detective Joe Landin in order to arrange a possible second controlled heroin purchase from appellant before appellant\u2019s arrest. Santos furnished Landin with $40 in recorded county funds and took him to appellant\u2019s residence to request a heroin purchase. Landin went to appellant\u2019s door, asked for \u201cBoogie,\u201d and appellant acknowledged that he was \u201cBoogie.\u201d Landin then asked to buy some heroin; appellant said that he did not have any, as he had just sold to a woman sitting in a pickup in front of appellant\u2019s house. Landin then signaled Santos to arrest appellant, which Santos did. Santos patted appellant down and found a plastic baggie filled with 18 tinfoil bindles plus a plastic container with one bindle. Appellant also had about $500 in cash, of which 14 bills were $20\u2019s. Santos did not count the money at that time. A criminalist from the California Department of Justice later determined that the substances seized from appellant constituted sufficient heroin for personal use. There was no evidence that appellant was a user of heroin or any other narcotic substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Appellant testified in his own behalf. He denied even having seen Robert Hernandez before the preliminary examination. He admitted Landin\u2019s visit to his house on November 20, but maintained that he possessed no heroin at the time of his arrest by Santos. He claimed that he possessed more than $800 in cash on his person when arrested, but contended that it represented savings from his Social Security income. He admitted his prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">During cross-examination, the deputy district attorney asked appellant if he had previously been convicted in 1980 for sale of heroin, one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>offenses with which he was presently charged. Appellant admitted the prior conviction. Appellant\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s questions in this regard and did not then, or at any earlier time, make a motion to suppress evidence of appellant\u2019s identical prior,  Appellant contends in this appeal that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to impeachment of appellant with his prior conviction deprived appellant of the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412 [125 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859, 2 A.L.R.4th 1], our Supreme Court stated: \u201cTo render reasonably competent assistance, an attorney in a criminal case must perform certain basic duties. [Citations.] Generally, the Sixth Amendment and article I, section 15 require counsel\u2019s \u2018diligence and active participation in the full and effective preparation of his client\u2019s case.\u2019 [Citation.] ... If counsel\u2019s failure to perform these obligations results in the withdrawal of a crucial or potentially meritorious defense, \u2018 \u201cthe defendant has not had the assistance to which he is entitled.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 424-425, fns. omitted.) In the instant case, failure of trial counsel to object to the introduction of appellant\u2019s prior conviction for impeachment purposes did not result in the withdrawal of a potentially meritorious defense.  However, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fosselman </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 572, 584 [189 Cal.Rptr. 855, 659 P.2d 1144], the court further stated on this subject: \u201cWe conclude that in cases in which a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is based on acts or omissions not amounting to withdrawal of a defense, a defendant may prove such ineffectiveness if he establishes that his counsel failed to perform with reasonable competence and that it is reasonably probable a determination more favorable to the defendant would have resulted in the absence of counsel\u2019s failings. <em>(Pope, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 425; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836. . . .)\u201d  Thus, we must determine here whether appellant\u2019s trial counsel failed to perform with reasonable competence and, if so, whether it is reasonably probable a determination more favorable to appellant would have resulted in the absence of counsel\u2019s failings.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111], the Supreme Court addressed the question of admissibility of prior felony convictions for impeachment purposes in light of article I, section 28 of the California Constitution, adopted by the enactment of Proposition 8 by the electorate in June 1982. There, the court stated: \u201cThe legislative and judicial history of [Evidence Code] sections 352 and 788, the circumstances under which article I, section 28, was enacted, the language of the enactment \u2014concededly ambiguous\u2014as well as certain policy considerations convince us that section 28 was not intended to abrogate the traditional and inherent power of the trial court to control the admission of evidence by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>exercise of discretion to exclude marginally relevant but prejudicial matter \u2014 as, indeed, is provided by Evidence Code section 352.4</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u201cA further issue\u2014tendered by the nature of defendant\u2019s convictions and subdivision (d)\u2019s recognition that only relevant evidence is admissible\u2014is the nature of the prior convictions which may be used for impeachment of witnesses in criminal cases. We shall hold that\u2014always subject to the trial court\u2019s discretion under section 352\u2014subdivision (f) authorizes the use of any felony conviction which necessarily involves moral turpitude, even if the immoral trait is one other than dishonesty. On the other hand, subdivision (d), as well as due process, forbids the use of convictions of felonies which do not necessarily involve moral turpitude.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 306.) Footnote 4 states: \u201cSection 352 reads: \u2018The court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) Castro </em>was filed in March 1985, nearly four months prior to the trial in the instant case. <em>Castro </em>held possession of heroin for sale, analogous to appellant\u2019s prior conviction here, involves moral turpitude\u2014though the trait involved is not dishonesty but, rather, the intent to corrupt others. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 317.)  Even so, appellant\u2019s prior, sale of heroin, was identical to one of the present charges against him, and trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the use of such prior for purposes of impeachment constitutes a failure to perform with reasonable competence. The question of admissibility as to prior convictions was far from settled by Proposition 8 in light of the many challenges it faced in the courts prior to the filing of the <em>Castro </em>decision. Moreover, under these circumstances, we cannot perceive of a rational tactical purpose in failing to object to the impeachment questions,  The question remains whether a result more favorable to the appellant would have resulted in the absence of counsel\u2019s failings.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In the recent decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 378 [228 Cal.Rptr. 899, 722 P.2d 173], the Supreme Court has set forth the procedure to be followed in appellate review of <em>Castro </em>error. The court stated: \u201c2. If the defendant did testify, the appellate court should make a preliminary determination of the probable effect of the prior convictions, taken together, on the outcome of the trial. The purpose is to screen out those cases in which the admission of the prior convictions probably did not harm the defendant in any event. The appellate court is able to make this determination because it need not speculate on what the defendant\u2019s testimony would have been: the record discloses the content of both the direct testmony of the defendant and any cross-examination of or rebuttal to that testimony. The court can therefore assess the probable effect of the impeachment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>that testimony. In turn, the court can appraise the probable effect of that testimony on the verdict, taking into account such factors as the strengths and weaknesses of the prosecution\u2019s case, the nature of the defense, and the potential persuasive force of the defendant\u2019s testimony in light of the other evidence put before the jury. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u201cIf the appellate court concludes it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the defendant would <em>not </em>have been reached in the absence of the <em>Castro </em>error\u2014i.e., that the admission of the prior convictions did not change the outcome\u2014it should hold the error harmless.12\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 390-391.) Footnote 12 states: \u201cAlthough stated negatively, this is the familiar test of <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836. . . . A higher standard of review may be required if the defendant waives his right to trial by jury because of <em>Castro </em>error. A defective waiver of the right to jury trial is reversible per se. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Holmes </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 442. . . .) The appellate court should therefore consider whether the same rule applies when a defendant is induced to waive such right by an erroneous decision to allow his impeachment by prior conviction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 391.)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In our view, it is <em>not </em>reasonably probable that a result more favorable to appellant would have resulted in the absence of the <em>Castro </em>error, or as more correctly stated in the instant case, in the absence of trial counsel\u2019s failure to raise by appropriate objection the <em>Castro </em>issue. As set forth in our statement of facts <em>(ante), </em>the evidence against appellant was substantial. On September 12, 1984, Hernandez made a controlled \u201cbuy\u201d from appellant while being observed by two narcotics officers. The product of the \u201cbuy\u201d was received in evidence and verified by expert testimony as heroin in a usable amount. On November 20, 1984, Detectives Santos and Landin attempted another heroin purchase from appellant at the same address. When appellant stated he had no heroin, he was arrested and a search of his person produced 19 separately wrapped bindles, later tested positive as heroin, and introduced into evidence. Against this evidence, appellant testified on his own behalf. He denied the September 12 incident in its entirety, i.e., it never happened. He admitted Landin attempted to purchase heroin from him on November 20, but denied the 19 bindles of heroin were on his person when searched. In other words, for the jury to have believed appellant\u2019s testimony, it would have to have disbelieved and rejected the testimony of Hernandez, Santos and Landin in its entirety. Moreover, it would have to believe these three prosecution witnesses and Agent Conley, who did not testify, conspired to fabricate this entire scheme, both incidents, and falsified a declaration to support their request for a search warrant, and each offered perjured testimony under oath at trial, in order to get appellant for some undisclosed reason. In view of the weight of the evidence against appellant and his incredible testimony in response, we conclude, as we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>stated, it is not reasonably probable that a result more favorable to appellant would have resulted in the absence of trial counsel\u2019s failure to raise the <em>Castro </em>issue. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fosselman, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 584.)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b237-13\">Before Woolpert, Acting P.
