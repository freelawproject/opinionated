Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">On June 13, 1984, Shelton pled guilty to a felony violation of Welfare and Institutions Code section 11483, welfare fraud. In an effort to recoup the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>monies fraudulently taken by Shelton, the county, prior to her conviction, filed a lien for $ 11,731.61 against a claim that respondent had pending with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB). Shelton was sentenced on August 15, 1984, and a condition of her probation was that she pay restitution to the county in the amount of $ 11,731.61. Subsequently, the WCAB awarded the county $5,000 \u201cin full satisfaction of [the] lien . . . .\u201d When the county thereafter sought payment of the balance of the restitution from Shelton at a probation hearing in the superior court, Shelton claimed that the Workers\u2019 Compensation award had fully satisfied her obligation to make restitution. The superior court agreed and found that the WCAB award constituted full satisfaction of the restitution order. The county has appealed this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Labor Code section 4903, subdivision (c), authorizes the WCAB to determine and allow a lien against a workers\u2019 compensation award for \u201c[t]he reasonable value of the living expenses of an injured employee or of his or her dependents, subsequent to the injury.\u201d  While the WCAB has the authority to determine the amount of living expenses, and may, as it did here, award an amount less than that demanded, it does not, in the absence of an agreement, have the power to modify or compromise an order for restitution in a criminal proceeding. To allow the WCAB such authority would only frustrate the efforts of public agencies to collect monies fraudulently taken from them. The purpose of section 4903 is \u201cto protect persons who advance credit or loan money to dependents for necessary living expenses.\u201d <em>(Rowland v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 448, 451 [136 Cal.Rptr. 1].) It is certainly not intended for the benefit of individuals who wrongfully obtain funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The record is utterly devoid of any mention of an agreement between the parties to the effect that upon acceptance of the WCAB award by the county, Shelton\u2019s restitution obligation would be satisfied. Indeed, Shelton does not claim that such an agreement was ever made.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Shelton\u2019s claim that the county is collaterally estopped from collecting the restitution balance is without merit. The issue before the WCAB\u2014the amount of Shelton\u2019s reasonable living expenses after her injury \u2014is vastly different from the issue before the sentencing court\u2014the amount of monies fraudulently obtained by her. (See 7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 253-254, pp. 691-694.)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the superior court is reversed. This case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Brauer, Acting P. J., and Capaccioli, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-15\">Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
