In each instance the trial court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Appellant has failed to establish to our satisfaction that the rulings of the trial court were incorrect. Therefore, section 652 of the Code of Civil Procedure is inapplicable and appellant\u2019s motion for diminution of the record is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Moore, P.
