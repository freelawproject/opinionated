Selvin for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b558-8\">McCOMB, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Airh\">This appeal transferred from the Supreme Court to this court for decision pursuant to article VI, section 4c, of the Constitution of the State of California, is on the judgment roll alone from an order of the probate court holding that respondent, a charitable organization, is entitled to receive a part of the estate of decedent as a distributee.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">This is the sole question to be determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">\n<em>Was there substantial evidence to sustain the trial court\u2019s finding \u201cthat the decedent left her surviving no spouse, brother, sister, nephew, niece, descendant, or ancestor?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">This question must be answered in the affirmative. The law-is established in California that, where the appeal is on the judgment roll alone, the findings will be <em>conclusively </em>presumed to be supported by the evidence. <em>(Estate of Woods, </em>23 Cal. App. (2d) 187, 191 [72 Pac. (2d) 258].) In the ease just cited Mr. Justice Wood, speaking for this court at page 191, thus accurately states the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-12\">1 \u2018 Since the appeal is on the judgment roll alone the findings are conclusively presumed to be supported by the evidence; they are to receive, if possible, such a construction as will uphold rather than defeat the order of the court; they must be liberally construed and any ambiguity or inconsistency must be resolved in favor of sustaining the order. On such an appeal every presumption and intendment is resolved in favor of the regularity of the proceedings in the trial court. <em>The order of </em>the court will not be reversed except for some fatal error appearing on the face of the judgment roll.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Even if we assume for the purpose of argument that the document filed by appellant Carrie Levi entitled \u201cstatement of Carrie Levi as a qualifying distributee\u201d is a pleading, we must, since the appeal is on the judgment roll alone, assume that the trial court received evidence contrary to the statements in such document, which evidence would support the trial court\u2019s findings. <em>(Berri </em>v. <em>Rogero, </em>168 Cal. 736, 741 [145 Pac. 95].)</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Therefore, applying the foregoing rules to the facts of the instant case, since the appeal is on the judgment roll alone, the finding above set forth is conclusively presumed to be supported by evidence, and since no error appears on the face of the judgment roll, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Moore, P. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">A petition by appellant to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on June 17, 1940.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
