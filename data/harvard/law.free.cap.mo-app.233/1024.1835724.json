Ridgway, 307 Mo. 529, after a general discussion of failure to comply with the statute and rules, on 1. c. 534-5 of the opinion, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-14\">\u201cThe right and the duty of this court to dismiss this appeal cannot be held to operate harshly, because the grounds therefor are based wholly upon the record as made by the appellants. While the law grants the right of a review to litigants in cases determined in the trial courts, as a condition precedent to the exercise of that right they are required to conform to the statute and the rules of the court-regulating the same. Expressed differently, the right being wholly statutory, a compliance with its mandatory conditions is an essential requisite to its exercise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1111-15\">So repeatedly have the courts of this -State stressed the importance-of compliance of the statutes and rules of court touching an appeal, it would appear that a counsel should not be excused when flagrantly-violating same. We here suggest that if every lawyer practicing in-this State would have for ready reference a typewritten copy of a few of the plain utterances of our courts on the importance of the.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>rules governing matters of appeal, it would be to the best interests \u25a0of all concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-3\">As applying to assignments Nos. 1 and.2, <em>supra, </em>we submit the following :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-4\">\u201cAppellate court will not search the, record for errors, existence of which is stated in general terms, in view, of rule. 17. [Williams v. American Exchange Bank, 280 S. W. 720,]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-5\">\u201cAn assignment that the court erred in admitting illegal, incompetent, and irrelevant testimony, without pointing out what particular evidence was improperly admitted, is too general to be considered on appeal. [Sanzenbacher v. Santhuff, 119 S. W. 395, 220 Mo. 274.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-6\">\u201cIf an appellant assigns error to admission of evidence, the assignment should set out the <em>names of the witnesses, </em>and at least the <em>substance of the testimony improperly admitted, </em>and give the <em>page </em>of the <em>record </em>where found. [\u00bfSchool Dist. of Kansas City v. Phoenix Band &amp; Improvement Co., 249 S. W. 51, 297 Mo. 332.] \u201d (Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">The appellate courts of this State have never shown inclination to avoid a thorough review of all matters presented in accordance with the law and rule of procedure. However, so flagrant a violation is apparent in the specifications of error under specifications Nos. 1 and 2, above, as they fail to meet the mandatory conditions that are the \u25a0essential requisites to the exercise of privilege of review.'</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">Under appellate practice in this State, our courts review all proper assignments of error whether found under head of \u201cAssignment of Errors\u201d or \u201cPoints and Authorities.\u201d Under \u201cPoints and Authorities\u201d in defendants\u2019 brief, the following appears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-9\">\u201cThe court erred in permitting the plaintiff to state in answer to a leading question that he delivered the cattle in question to John \u25a0Clay &amp; Company and in overruling appellants\u2019 objection on the ground that the answer was a conclusion and invaded the province of the jury. The court further erred in refusing to permit cross examination of plaintiff as to the facts, if any, upon which such conclusion was based. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-10\">We conclude, under liberal constructions of our rules, that the above calls for a review of the specific matter pointed out. We will refer to the above as assignment of error No. 4 and proceed with our review as to assignments Nos. 3 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-11\">In passing upon the question of demurrer offered by defendants and refused by the court (assignment No. 3) we are confronted with many difficulties as plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is not predicated upon a written contract. However, without objection, plaintiff placed in evidence the following exhibit, ,to-wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-12\">\u201cEXHIBIT 1.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-13\">\u201cSTATE OP TEXAS, COUNTY OF SHEBMAN ss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-14\">\u201cKnow all Men by these Presents: That I, W.

Exhibit No. 3 is a statement for cattle sold to John Craig, indicated as shipped by W. \u25a0C. Martin, plaintiff herein. This statement is based upon the sale \u2022of the one hundred and ninety-six head involved in this suit except as to one marked \u201cdead.\u201d The net proceeds ($8,819.74) are shown as remitted to The Inter State National Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-15\">It is clear that the amount of damages sued for in this cause is the difference between the amount stated in exhibit No. 1 and \u2022exhibit No. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-16\">As the above showing of record, together with testimony concerning the admissibility and relevancy, which we have above pointed out, is not properly before us for review, we are compelled to find against defendants on specification of error No. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-17\">In connection with specification No. 4, we herein set forth questions and answers appearing in plaintiff\u2019s testimony and the objections taken thereto as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-18\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Rogers) : Do you know who John Craig is? A. No, sir, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-19\">\u201cQ. Never heard of him before? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-20\">\u201cQ. \u2018Ship by W. C. Martin.\u2019 That is your name? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-21\">\u201cQ. \u2018Shipping point, Stratford, Texas,\u2019 is that where you delivered them to John Clay <em>&amp; </em>Company, was'it? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-22\">\u201cMr. Farrar: We object to that as calling for a conclusion of the witness and invading the province of the jury, and saying it was delivered, that that is where they were delivered to John Clay &amp; Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>\u201cQ. (By Mr. Rogers) : Well, they were your cattle, weren\u2019t they, Mr. Martin? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-3\">\u201cQ. And you did deliver them there, didn\u2019t you? A. Certainly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-4\">\u201cMr. Farrar : Now, we renew our objection to that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-5\">\u201cThe Court: ' Objection overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-6\">\u2018 \u2018 To which ruling and action of the Court, the defendants, and each of them, at the time duly' excepted and still except. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">The word \u201cdelivered\u201d is somewhat elusive. Judge Napton in Caldwell v. Garner, 31 Mo. l. c. 134, says: \u201cWhat constitutes a delivery of personal property must necessarily depend very much on the particular character of the property and the circumstances attending the alleged delivery\u201d\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-9\">If there be a contract of purchase, then delivery of personal property passes title. However, if bailment, or consignment, or conditional sale be involved, the word \u201cdelivery\u201d has a far different import. Further, at common law, delivery is not necessary to complete a sale of personal property as between vendor and vendee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-10\">In Bouvier\u2019s Rawle\u2019s Third Revision, Yol. 1, l. c. 830, the following appears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-11\">\u201cThe word delivery is used in different senses, which should be borne in mind in considering the cases. Sometimes it denotes transfer of <em>the property </em>in the chattel and sometimes transfer of <em>the possession </em>of the chattel. When used 'in the latter sense it may refer either to the <em>formation </em>of the contract, or to the <em>performance of </em>it. When it refers to the delivery of possession in the performance of the contract, the buyer is sometimes spoken of as being in <em>possession </em>although he has only the right of possession, while the actual custody remains with the vendor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-12\">\u201cA condition requiring delivery may be annexed as a part of any contract of transfer. [Salvage Mfg. Co. v. Armstrong, 19 Me. 147.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-13\">\u201cIn the absence of contract, the amount of transportation to be performed, by the seller to constitute a delivery is determined by general usage. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1115-14\">There is showing in the record that indicates that the triers of the fact guided by the rulings of the trial court gave consideration to the conclusion of the witness that he delivered the cattle to plaintiff, in Texas as indicating delivery in the sense of passing of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-15\">The'trial court in passing upon objections as to testimony gives indication of that court\u2019s limitations of the issues under the pleading. It is shown that the court in passing upon an objection to evidence made by plaintiff\u2019s counsel says: \u201cThe answers set up practically a general denial, that you did not buy these cattle, nor did you agree to pay the price mentioned in the petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-17\">In the light of the fact that the plaintiff predicated his cause of action upon an allegation that the parties defendant constituted a partnership, \u201cand as such partnership was engaged in the business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>of buying and selling livestock,\u201d when taken together with oral testimony and plaintiff\u2019s exhibits \u00d1os. 1 and 2 and 3, we conclude, indicate the issues of this case t\u00f3 be broader than the language of the court, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-3\">With the fact of the plaintiff\u2019s statement of his conclusion that he delivered the cattle to defendants in Texas, we include herein showing of record as follows, to-wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-4\">\u201cMr. Farrar: He stated that he delivered these to the men, to John Clay &amp; Company. These men are John Clay &amp; Company, and we want to know how.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-5\">\u201cMr. Rogers: That is right, but they all live in Chicago or some other sea port.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-6\">\u201cThe Court: Let him answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-7\">\u2018 \u2018 Q.

Did you deliver any of these cattle to them ? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-9\">\u201cQ. Now, who did you talk to in making the sale of these cattle? A. Tom Fields.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-10\">\u201cQ. And what price was agreed upon per hundred weight? The cattle were weighed, weren\u2019t they? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-11\">\u201cQ. And you weighed them over the scales ? You were there when they were weighed ? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-12\">\u201cQ. And what price did you agree upon? A. $8.30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-13\">\u201cQ. $8.30 per hundred weight? \u00c1. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-14\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. Now, where did this conversation that led up to this trade and the agreement of $8.30 \u2014 where did that take place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-15\">\u201cMr. Rogers: I object to the question because it appears in evidence that the agreement is in writing; therefore, all matters \u00e1re absorbed by that writing. There is no evidence now to the contrary to this writing. ' .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-16\">\u201cMr. Phillips : Now, in view of that fact we make a motion again to strike out the bill of sale draft \u00e1ttached, as it appears' now from the statement that they are relying upon a written contract not pleaded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-17\">\u201cThe Court: Objection overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-18\">\u201cMr. Phillips: There is no ple\u00e1ding of any written contract, and for the further reason given before, that it does not satisfy the Statute of Frauds, nor the Statute requiring the acceptance of a draft, nor they have not pleaded any contract whatever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-19\">\u201cThe Court: Objection overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-20\">\u201cMr. Rogers: Now, what about iny objection, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-21\">\u201cThe Court: \"Was that prior to. the execution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-22\">\u201cMr. Rogers: That is what he asked him.

Now, how was he \u2014 when was the weights arrived at ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-3\">\u201cMr. Rogers: Well, let'me ask a preliminary question. \"Was that before or after the bill of sale was signed, was the weights arrived at before or after the bill of sale ? A. Before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-4\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Farrar) : That is, on the same day ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-5\">\u201cMr. Rogers: The plaintiff objects because it now appears that there is a written contract between the people governing this transaction and therefore the matters prior thereto are immaterial to any issue in this ease. There is no allegation in any pleading that attacks the validity of this agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-6\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. (By Mr. Farrar) : I would like to ask a preliminary question. Was it on the same day, and was it, the weights and the price that were \u2014 the weights that were ascertained on that same day from which you get the figures that are in'the bill \u00f3f sale \"or draft? ' A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-7\">\u201cMr. Farrar: We submit it is part of the <em>res gestae </em>and part of the same transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-8\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court : The weights were obtained on that particular day ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-9\">\u201cMr. Farrar: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-10\">\u201cMr. Rogers: It would not make any difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-11\">\u201cThe Court: Objection overruled.

(By Mr. Farrar) : Now, to whom did you weigh these cattle on the fifth day of November, 1937 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-17\">\u201cMr. Rogers: Why, I submit, Your Honor, that the question is impossible of answer. I do not know \u2014 I cannot object to the question because I don\u2019t know what the lawyer means by, 'to whom he weighed' the cattle.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-18\">\u201cMr. Farrar: He knows to whom he weighed to. He said he weighed them down there. We would like to know to whom he weighed them to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-19\">\u201cMr. Rogers: I would like to know what counsel means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-20\">\u201cMr. Farrar: What name, or what person did he weigh them to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-21\">\u201cMr. Rogers: I object to that, because it is wholly immaterial. The contract is in evidence between these parties and that shows the agreement there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-22\">\u201cThe Court: Object sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-23\">\u201cTo which ruling and action of the Court, the defendants, and each of them, at the time duly excepted and still except. \u201d \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-24\">From the showing of the record that we have included herein as a basis for passing upon defendants\u2019 specification of error No. 4, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>come to two conclusions: First, the trial court based its rulings upon admissibility of evidence upon the conclusion that there was a written contract between the parties for the sale of the cattle in question and that, therefore, any facts of circumstances happening before reduction to writing were inadmissible to prove that said instrument did not constitute an absolute sale; Second, we conclude that the trial court in its rulings made same as based upon its conclusions that what happened in placing the cattle in transit from Texas constituted such delivery as consummated such sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">As to whether exhibit No. 1 constitutes an absolute written contract of sale and the transaction in Texas an absolute delivery in consummation, we do not pretend to say. However, there are matters of pleading and showing in the record from which we conclude there is an issue of fact as to whether or not exhibit No. 1 be an absolute contract of sale or not and as to whether the Texas event constituted a culminating of an absolute sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">Transactions of sale and barter and consignment for sale in this marketing age are subject to certain well defined usages and customs which are conducive to uncertainty in the minds of Jurors and elusive to application of judicial knowledge. After a careful examination of exhibit No. 1, it appears to us as a compilation of written documents. The exhibit is indexed and referred to as a deed to cattle. The first section, executed by plaintiff alone and attested by witness, on its face indicates a sale of cattle and acknowledgment of receipt of full purchase price. Thereafter, plaintiff sells and sets over to The Inter State National Bank of Kansas City, Missouri, all of his right title and interest in the cattle. Accompanying same is what is termed a draft with bill of sale attached together with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">In connection with above the plaintiff introduces its exhibit No. 3. Exhibit No. 3 shows that defendants treated the transaction as a shipment upon consignment, and remitted the proceeds to the bank to which, as shown by exhibit No. 1, the plaintiff had assigned his interest in the cattle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">In studying the record before us in considering assignment No. 3, matters directly bearing upon the attitude of the trial court in its rulings complained of in defendants specification No. 4 were directly brought to our attention. From a consideration of plaintiff\u2019s exhibits Nos. 1 and 3 and aided by\" a gleaning of the whole record, pleadings included, we conclude that there is presented an issue of fact as to whether or not the transaction as presented by'plaintiff\u2019s exhibit No. 1, constitutes an absolute sale or a cpnsignment to defendants for sale. Owing to narrowing of the issues by the rulings of the trial court as to matters of evidence, we conclude that the showing in the record before us is insufficient from which to determine the issue referred to above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-9\">We conclude that defendants\u2019 specification No. 4 is well founded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>in that plaintiff\u2019s answer to the leading question complained of invaded the province of the jury and in that failure of the trial court to permit defendants\u2019 counsel to cross examine as to matters in writing designated as plaintiff\u2019s exhibit No. 1, presents error in that same might have bearing on the question as to whether a sale or consignment for sale. Further, the cross examination might have challenged the effect of the conclusion that the witness was permitted to state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"Aik0\">All concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
