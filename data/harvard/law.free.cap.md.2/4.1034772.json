It is a mathematical truth, that the land described in the certificate and grant of <em>Hobson,s Choice, </em>and on the plot, (which is part of the declaration of the plaintiff, and part of the defendant\u2019s plea or defence of title,) is not the same land, but different.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-11\">'There are two modes of declaring in ejectment. A plaintiff may declare for one hundred acres of plantable land, called <em>Black Acre, </em>and it is <em>good; or </em>he may give a further description, and add the abuttals or boundaries, and courses and distances, and although they are not necessary, yet he is obliged to prove them as alleged, otherwise the defendant would suffer a disadvantage, because the plaintiff claims by one description, yet shows title to another. If the plaintiff will undertake to set forth the boundaries and the course and distance, he must take care to set them forth and show that his title, that is, his patent or deed, corresponds, to such description, although it is not necessary to be thus particular. <em>Salk. </em>661. \u25a0 So it is of a libel, you may declare either in the <em>-words </em>or the <em>sense ; </em>if in the words, there is the least variance, as a letter which changes the word, it is fatal. So if one will recite a statute, though not obliged to do it, yet he must recite it truly. 1 <em>Stra. </em>214. A plaintiff may, and it is the common practice, to declare for a whole tract of land, and locate on the plot only a part of it for his pretensions. Plots were introduced in the room of a view, to make the place plain and certain to \u2022the jury, and they become part of the plaintiff\u2019s allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>tion against the defendant. A warrant, resurvey and plot may be considered as a new assignment, and an ascertainment of the place where the trespass and ejectment was committed, and as part of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration. <em>Law of Tresp. </em>146, 147. The same rules of evidence have been adopted, and the same variance is fatal, between the title and plot, as between the title and the declaration. It has been universally ruled, that if a tract of land is laid down for <em>pretensions, </em>or for <em>illustration, </em>and the grant varies from the location on the plot, it is not admissible in evidence, with this exception only, that you -may adopt a greater instead of a less certain description, as rejecting the course and distance to go to a tree or other boundary, artificial or natural, but in no other case pan it be done. A fault in the description of the trespass is matter of substance, and not of form only. 2 <em>Raym. </em>986. In trespass or ejectment, the place is descriptivo of the fact, and must be proved, and every part of the declaration is descriptive. Trespass for an assault and battery, or for taking goods, is transitory, and may be laid in a different county from that in which the injury was <em>done; </em>but trespass <em>quarc clausum fregit </em>is local, and must be laid in the county h\u2019here the land lies. 5 <em>Bac.
