In the case of <em>The State </em>against Ridgely, in the General Court, at <em>May </em>term, 1785, this point was determined. In the case of <em>Henry Widden, </em>who broke open <em>Brice\u2019s </em>store about thirty years ago, Mr. <em>Brice </em>sent to <em>England </em>to procure a copy of the conviction of the person who was a witness against him. It Was defective, and the evidence was rejected. The plaintiff has had time to procure a record of conviction, and having failed to do so, he cannot resort to inferior testimony. How could the testator know of the conviction <em>i </em>There are offences in <em>England </em>which subject the offender to the punishment of transportation, and which does not take away credibility, as under the act of parliament prohibiting the exportation of wool.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-12\">Martin, (Attorney-General,) for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AO8s\">In the case of <em>Driver </em>and Lee, <em>(April </em>term, 1760,) the Provincial Court decided, that parol evidence of the confession of a witness that he had been a convict was sufficient. All persons punished with the pains annexed to felony arfe disqualified from being witnesses. All indictments for transportable offences, charge with felony under the act of 1751, c. 11., and there is no question about the crime the offender has been convicted of.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-7\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\n<em>Chase,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaDm\">contra, cited certain statutes which direct the punishment of transportation for the repetition of offences not felonious.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The Court were of opinion that such parol evidence was admissible to prove that the same witness was a convict and transported as aforesaid; but inasmuch as before and-during the year 1750 there were offences not amounting to felony, or rendering a person thereof convicted, infamous, for which, by the statutes of <em>Great Britain </em>then subsisting, offenders might be transported from <em>Great Britain </em>to the then <em>British </em>colonies, in the same manner as felons are directed to be transported there to serve for a term of years. The Court were further of opinion, that it was incumbent on the plaintiff, in order to prove the incompetency of the said witness, to prove by record or other evidence, that he was transported for some offence made felony or infamous by the common law of <em>England, </em>or by some statute of <em>Great Britain, </em>and the Court being of opinion that the parol evidence \u00a1offered was admissible, the defendant excepted.</p>\n<author id=\"ABZ\">(Hanson and Goldsborough)</author>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The plaintiff being called made default.
