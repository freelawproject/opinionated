If no custom to bar by such recovery, a surrender will do if there be a custom to bar by surrender. But if no custom to bar by either, <em>Lord Ilardv/icke </em>has declared it must be by recovery. 2 <em>Vez. </em>601. The mode of barring <em>descendible </em>freeholds, if entailed, by simple alienation, was originally adopted on the principle of barring conditional fees at common law. <em>A common recovery or fine xvould have been a forfeiture. 1 Atk. 525. </em>It was afterwards extended from necessity, there being ms other method of doing it, to all cases, even before issue had. <em>But this is the case of an </em>inheritance, and if there be any other mode of barring the entail, the' necessity existing in the case of descendible freehold will not apply.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-7\">fiat neither in the case of <em>descendible </em>freeholds, copyholds, nor yet of trusts, can the entail be barred by simple alienation, if the limitations are so tied up that if the estate had been a <em>legal estate </em>and an inheritance, the tenant in tail could not have barred it by a <em>common recovery. </em>2 <em>Ch.

The warrant of attorney is not acknowledged either before any Judge or taken under a <em>dedimus </em>which is found to have been the constant usage in the province. Great frauds might be practised if it were otherwise. Cruise, 76.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-6\">The verdict, it is true, finds that Lord <em>Frederick </em>executed this power of attorney, but how is that fact to be proved after a number of years; or if proved, how will it appear from thence that it was not executed under <em>duress </em>or other improper influence ? The legislature has wisely directed an acknowledgment of all conveyances ; and recoveries being a mode of conveyance, there is every reason for the same precaution with respect to them as to common deeds. It bears date before the writ of entry issued, which is error appearing upon the face of the proceedings. <em>Cro. Eliz. </em>740. Regularly there ought <em>to he </em>a summons to warrant, and although a party may appear voluntarily without any summons ; yet he cannot appear without a writ, and there can be no warrant to defend a writ beiore it issues. Another objection to this recovery is, that the proprietary being lord of the fee and seigniory, could not suffer a common recovery at all. <em>Lord Frederick </em>thought so, for he applied to parliament upo*k <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>-,he ground that there was no other method of barring the entail. He could not be demandant in a recovery because he could not be disseised, <em>for all must hold of him. </em>He could not be vouched for the same reason, because he would then stand <em>in loco tenentis, </em>and in judgment of law would be tenant to, and hold of, demandant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-4\">But if the proprietor could suffer a recovery he could not do it in his own Court. The Judges were appointed by him, held their commissions in his name, and were removable at his pleasure ; exercised their jurisdiction as his delegates, and the Court in every instance and sense is as much his as if he presided in person. Can such a Court be proper for trying suits in which he was either plaintiff or defendant ? Is it agreeable to natural justice that a jurisdiction so \"partial could be established ? Could it be the intention of the crown, in granting the charter, to extend his jurisdiction to causes in which he was interested ? Or if such was the intention, could it be in the power of the crown, or rather was it not contrary to the <em>fundamental principles of the English Law and Constitution </em>to render him in effect a Judge in his own cause ? <em>Davis, 75.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-5\">The crown might grant cognisance of pleas to proceed according to the law of the land; but not otherwise. <em>Litt.

From the same necessity they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>always <em>appellate </em>jurisdiction from the plantations.

It was <em>a legal estate </em>remaining in <em>Lord </em>Charles, and devised by him to Mr. <em>Cahert </em>; but the estate in <em>Lord Baltimore </em>was never vested in possession. <em>The fee teas in the </em>trustees, and he was <em>cestuy que trust, </em>and that only in remainder at the time he suffered this recovery : and a recovery suffered by <em>cestuy que trust </em>will not bar the remainder or reversion of a <em>legal estate, </em>but only the remainders of the trust estate. 2 <em>Atk. </em>578. 1 <em>Atk. </em>595. 4 <em>Burr. 2165. 1961. 1 Atk. </em>473. <em>Brawn's Ca. </em>73. 75.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-8\">If <em>Lord Frederick </em>was tenant in tail, and could bar it without joining the outstanding estate for life, he would destroy the provision made for his mother\u2019s jointure.

When the second <em>Lord </em>Charles, the son of Benedict, was born, he became seised of the vested remainder in tail, and after the death of his grandfather, the first <em>Lord </em>Charles, the remainder in fee descended on him. His marriage settlement could not alter this estate-tail; for if so, and he altered it to an estate for life, and created only a contingent remainder to his first son, &amp;c. then he and the trustees under this marriage settlement, might have destroyed the contingent remainders limited by it, and by the same method any tenant in tail might defeat the issue in tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-5\"><em>Lord Charles </em>the second had, under his father\u2019s marriage settlement, in 1698, a conditional fee, or an estate-tail with reversion in fee. Whether it was the one or the other depends on the statute <em>de donis </em>extending to the proprietorship. If it did not, then it was a conditional fee, and <em>Lord Charles </em>second (after having issue) had a right to dispose of it. If the statute <em>de donis </em>affects the case, it was an estate-tail, and <em>Lord Charles </em>had the reversion in fee, of which he might dispose.

The statute was made to prevent the great baronies from being divided, that their joint power to oppose the king might not be weakened. Each baron was a petty prince in his own territory. His vassals attended him in war. The makers could never have in contemplation lands in a remote region. 1'hc statute does not extend to the <em>Isle of Man. </em>4 <em>Inst. </em>284. 2 <em>Vez. </em>354.</p>\n<p data-order=\"185\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-7\">The reasons on which the statute <em>de donis </em>rest, are there directly opposite to the principles on which the charter was granted. The statute was to prevent the conveyance of property ; the charter to encourage it. It is absurd to draw t.he same conclusions from things totally dissimilar in their principles. It is no argument to say that the statute <em>de donis </em>has been adopted with respect to the proprietary grant, because the settlement has words which would create an estate - tail, if the statute extended to the case ; for this depends on the statute <em>de donis </em>extending to the subject or not, for the same words which make an estate-tail since the statute, make a conditional fee at common law : therefore, whether it is one or the other does not depend on the words of the conveyance, but on the statute\u2019s applying or not to the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"186\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-8\">When the Judges in the reign of <em>EdwardIV. </em>determined that an estate-tail might be barred by common recovery, they could have had no idea that there could be any estate-tail under the statute <em>de </em>donis, but such as an actioti would lie to recover in the king\u2019s Courts. If no such action would lie, then it could not be an estate-taiL</p>\n<p data-order=\"187\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-9\">The principle on which a common recovery was introduced, was to avoid the increase of perpetuities under the statute <em>de donis. </em>These perpetuities were estates-tail; but to say the statute extended to estates out of the realm of England, of which recoveries could not be suffered in the king\u2019s Courts, would be saying that the Judges gave a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>struction to the statute <em>de donis </em>to es\u00edt\u2019b\u00fc\u00edsL \u00abeiiiates- tail out of the realm which could never be destroyed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"188\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0S\">The statute <em>de donis, </em>says the will of the donor, shall be \u2019thserved. On a dispute whether it was or was not observed, it must have been the ideas of those who made this act, that the point should be determined in the king\u2019s Courts. How could this be of lands in foreign countries ? The common law, therefore, remains as to them, where the statute has not been adopted; then it becomes a rule not <em>su\u00e1 vi, </em>but by such adoption. If it is said that the statute <em>de donis </em>does extend to foreign countries without adoption, then the entail may like other estates-tail be docked in the king\u2019s Courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"189\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-5\">Taking then the province not to be within the statute <em>de donis, </em>and on the supposition that all the settlements are valid, it follows that <em>Lord Charles </em>second had a conditional fee under the settlement in 1698, and on the birth of .his son <em>Frederick, </em>the estate in fee was absolute, at which time, and not before, he had a right to dispose of it. He did dispose of it by his will, and that part of it called <em>Ann Arundel Manor, </em>to Mr. <em>Calvert, </em>who had a right to enter after the determination of the respective leases. In this view of the question the point is very short, for if the statute <em>de donis </em>does not affect the subject, then there is a clear tide under the devise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"190\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-6\"><em>Second. </em>To cousider the subject on the supposition of its being affected by the statute <em>de donis; </em>and that this statute is to be construed as operating on the province immediately after the granting of the charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"191\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR6\"><em>Lord Baltimore </em>must be considered either as standing <em>in loco regis, </em>as to conveyances and acts executed by him, or he is not to be so considered. He ought not to be considered in both capacities, just as it may suit the adverse party, for this would be giving him greater privileges than the king, who cannot be considered as a private person, and a king too. If he is considered as a private person, the deed of 1698 is bad, it being neither acknowledged or recorded. If it is to be considered good in the case of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>proprietor as being <em>in loco regis, </em>and not bound by the act, we must carry the doctrine of the proprietor\u2019s standing <em>in loco regis, </em>as to conveyances, all through, and we shall hereafter see the consequence of that doctrine.

Then a trust for 1,000 years for the better securing of the jointure, and to raise younger daughters\u2019 portions and after the determination of said term, to the use of his first son, &amp;c. remainder to himself in fee. From every state of our case, therefore, the freehold was in the trustees after the death of <em>Ijord Charles </em>until the death of <em>Mary </em>his wife, in 1769. Then a remainder in tail was vested in <em>Lord Frederick, </em>at the time of his birth, which fell into possession at the death of <em>Mary, </em>and until that time the freehold was not in him. This death happened in 1769. <em>Lord Charles </em>devised the manor to Mr. <em>Calvert, </em>and at the time <em>Lord Frederick </em>attempted to dock the entail and destroy the remainder devised to Mr. <em>Calvert, </em>he could not do it without joining the trustees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"193\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-7\">There must be a freehold in the tenant to the <em>praecipe. A </em>person suffering a recovery must not only have an estate of freehold, but an estate of freehold in possession. If <em>Lord Frederick, </em>as tenant in tail after the freehold estate in the trustees, could suffer a recovery, it would destroy the jointure. <em>Pigot, </em>136. For a tenant in tail suffering a recovery takes a new estate in fee by purchase; and, if the entail was limited to heirs <em>ex parte materna, </em>yet, after the recovery, it will descend to heirs general. <em>Cruise, </em>151. The mode to be pursued is for the tenant in tail to apply to the Court of Chancery, to compel the trustees to join, which it will do on reasonable terms. In this view, as the estate-tail could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>not be barred by <em>Lord Frederick, </em>the trustees not joining, it *s neec^ess to consider the acts done by <em>Lord Frederick </em>to bar the \u00e9ntail. ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"194\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABB\"><em>Thirdly. </em>If it is said that the deed in 1698 is good, and therefore <em>Lord Charles </em>being tenant in tail, with remainder in fee, could not make a jointure to encumber the estate- tail beyond his life, that then <em>Lord Baltimore </em>must be considered <em>in loco regis </em>so as not to be bound by the act of 1692. He must be considered <em>in loco regis </em>as to all his other acts of conveyance, for it would be absurd and unjust to say the proprietor shall he considered as having <em>jura regalia </em>to support his acts against others, and also as not having <em>jura regalia </em>to support his acts against others. In this case, the <em>Lord Baltimore </em>could not suffer a common recovery in his own Courts. It could only be done before the king and council.</p>\n<p data-order=\"195\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-6\">It vvould be a needless learning to consider how far the general rights and prerogatives of the lord proprietor are commensurate with those of the crown. To say that they are in all respects the same would be too large ; to say he has none in any respect similar would be certainly wrong, and against the words of the charter. As to transactions in his Courts of Justice, they being similar, the commissions and process being in his name, they should have similar effects.

Every thing should be done under the authority of the Court, and being done under their authority, it becomes their act. Where the parties do not appear in person to have their appearance recorded, then a <em>dedhnus </em>must issue from the Court, and the. acknowledgment, being taken under it, becomes their act. If a recovery can be suffered at all by the lord proprietor, it must be before the king and council.</p>\n<p data-order=\"197\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-8\"><em>Fourthly. </em>It may be argued that the settlement of 1698 is good,- as the act of 1692 does not bind the proprietor. Yet it does not follow that he is obliged to dock the entail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>by a recovery; for where an estate-tail is created, there must be some way of barring it; and therefore it may be barred by deed, as in the case of copyholds, they may be barred by surrender, and descendible freeholds by conveyance.

Charles </em>took an estate-tail under it and the reversion in fee descended on him. And if a deed will bar an entail in the lord proprietor, then the deed of settlement in <em>1730 </em>executed by <em>Lord Charles, </em>barred this entail, and was in the nature of a recovery and a declaration of uses. By this deed he became tenant for life, remainder to trustees to preserve con tingent remainders and support the wife\u2019s jointure. Remainder to his son in tail, remainder to himself in fee. lie devised the manor part of this remaining fee to Mr. <em>Calvert. </em>The son could not dock the entail without joining the trustees, for this would destroy the wife\u2019s jointure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"200\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-9\">This then is the general scope of the argument:</p>\n<p data-order=\"201\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-10\">1st. The deeds of settlement of 1698, were invalid, or they were not invalid. If invalid, then <em>Lord Charles </em>second took an estate in fee by descent, nothing having been done to impede such descent. And if the deeds in 1730 \u25a0were also invalid, then having the whole fee, he had a right to devise the manor to Mr. <em>Calvert.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"202\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-11\">2d.

He might devise the remainder in fee, provided <em>Lord Frederick </em>had not destroyed the estate-tail; therefore it brings it to the question, whether he did or did not bar the entail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"205\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-7\">5th. Supposing the recovery suffered by <em>Lord Frederick </em>not effectual, and that his deed should be deemed so, then <em>Lord Charles </em>second had docked the entail by his deed of 1730, and by this deed had given an outstanding term either to the trustees or his wife, for a jointure, then how could <em>Lord Frederick </em>dock it without a surrender of his life estate ? If a deed will dock it, must not this deed be considered as a recovery, or will the want of a tenant to the <em>prcecipe </em>be an objection to the conveyance, inasmuch as no <em>prcecipe </em>is necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"206\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW_\">Suppose the province not entailable', then if both the deeds of 1698 and 1730 are void, <em>Lord Charles </em>second had a fee-simple.

If the statute <em>de donis </em>does not extend, then the first deeds are good, and <em>Lord Charles </em>had a conditional fee, and by making the deeds in 1730, before issue had, he barred the after born issue, and the legal estate was in trustees.

If the evidence was to be inserted in the verdict, it could answer no purpose ; for even if the Court should think it not sufficient, and the Jury did, the Court must be bound by their opinions.

Therefore a condition broken could not be assigned as debts, covenants, rights of entry for nonpayment of rents, &amp;c. See 3 <em>P.

It tends no more to-maintenance to alien a reverter than a remainder. 2 <em>Vez. </em>411. It is the more strange sucha doctrine should have ever prevailed under the statute of wills, as the judges in <em>Taltarum's </em>case,, Temp. <em>Edw, </em>IV. laid the foundation of common recoveries to prevent perpetuities, and this was strengthened by the stat. of fines in the reign of <em>Hen. </em>VII.</p>\n<p data-order=\"221\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-3\">A reversion was always devisable, and the- not allowing a reverter to be so, tends to a perpetuity. Judges have by degrees enlarged the power of devising. Executory deviserwould have been formerly rejected, and though such a remote limitation is not now good in a deed, it is in a will. They were first confined to a life in being, then extended to 21 years after.</p>\n<p data-order=\"222\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-4\">That the descent of the reverter merged the conditional fee.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"223\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkNL\">A man cannot have two fee-simples in him at one time. If he has a conditional fee, and a' reverter in fee, separate,, it must amount to the same thing in point of descent; therefore if is keeping them separate for no manner of purpose. Suppose he has no issue, then the reverter will descend to his right heirs and give the whole fee-simple. Suppose he has issue ; it will descend in the same manner. Before the abolition of all tenares but those in socage, the king would have been entuled- to- double relief for admitting the heir to these several inheritances. Suppose a person, having these two fees should have- a real action brought against him-, which of the two fees would the demandant recover. The greater estate, therefore, must merge the less. If the reverter did not merge, but was held separate, yet the deeds of 1/30 barred the issue, <em>Lord Charles </em>having a right to- alien before issue had, to <em>bar </em>them, though not the donor. He himself was the donor. That he might bar the issue, <em>Co.

If a recovery may be suffered against the king, there may be a default entered against him; and consequently judgment would go against him, and he would be said to depart in despite of the court, though by an estaolished principle of law he is supposed to be always present in court. It is therefore impossible, consistent with the known principles of law, that a recovery could be suffered against the proprietor, for the king and he are in this respect in the same situation. If the king, tenant in tail, could suffer a recovery with voucher, the <em>prcecipe </em>might also he brought against him immediately. If he comes in as vouchee, then he is made tenant to the <em>prcecipe by </em>his own warranty, and the demandant counts against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"228\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-7\">A common recovery, though a fiction, is grounded on real principles of law. 2 Cruise, 1!. Therefore no recovery in <em>England </em>can he suffered, but in the court of common pleas, that being the original court where civil suits were brought. If a common recovery in which the proprietor is tenant or voucher can be supported, then a real recovery may be had against him ,\u2022 but this would lead to consequences in the highest degree absurd and totally inconsistent with the principles of law. If a <em>prcecipe </em>would not lie against him in a real proceeding, (real is here meant in opposition to fictitious,) then a recovery by fiction could not be had against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"229\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>The first process in a recovery is that kind of <em>prmcipe </em>called a writ of entry, which commands the defendant that justly and without delay he render, &amp;c. The absurdity is striking, of the lord issuing a writ in his own name directed to himself, commanding himself to do justice to another, and supposing himself to have acted unjustly in the records of his own court, and then to give judgment against himself. He would also be subject to a judgment and execution for costs which are given by the statute of <em>Gloucester. </em>If there is another disseisin on the demandant, by the statute of <em>Merton </em>he is liable to imprisonment, and in this case the writ must be issued in his own name to imprison himself. To avoid these inconveniences and absurdities it is held that the king cannot suffer a recovery, nor can any be had against him. These absurdities were so glaring, that in all the settlements it was never attempted to suffer a recovery. The late attempt is the first. By <em>Lord Fredericks </em>marriage settlement it appears that the most eminent counsel thought it could only be docked by act of parliament.

This proves the old estate is gone, and all limitations dependent on it. Such a recovery will even destroy a debt which the tenant in tail agreed to pay as a consideration of the gift in tail. Pigot, 136. The king cannot dock the entail of his lands by deed. If the proprietor cannot dock an entail by recovery, it is because he is considered <em>in loco reg\u00eds; </em>therefore he must be considered as <em>in loco reg\u00eds </em>not to dock by deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"241\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-10\"><em>Objection. </em>If trustees appointed to preserve a small outstanding jointure, would prevent docking the estate-tail of a very large estate, then great inconvenience would ensue, and a tenant in tail could make no settlement on his marriage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"242\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-11\"><em>Answer. </em>In this case application must be made to chancery, to compel the trustees to join in a conveyance to make a tenant to the prmcipe, and the chancery may order it on equitable terms, and would take care that security was given that after the recovery, there should be a sufficient part of the estate allotted to secure the jointure.

A deed of other mode of conveyance docking an entail, has exactly the same effect, and is liable to the \u25a0 same restrictions as a recovery. If it were otherwise, they might by this mode destroy all outstanding life-estates and \u2018jointures.

If the deeds of 1698 are good, then <em>Lord Charles </em>second had an estate-tail under this settlement, and the reversion in fee descended on him. By his deeds in 1730, he conveyed the province to trustees and their heirs, which conveyance docked the estate-tail. He declared the uses as above stated, so that the trustees had a freehold 'estate to preserve the jointure during the life of <em>Lady: Mary. </em>This brings it to the same thing as if he had been seised in fee by descent. In the first case he would have had a power to create a jointure: so if he had an estate-tail, he docked it, and then interposed the jointure. No act that <em>Lord Frederick </em>could do, whether by recovery or deed, could dock the entail limited to him under the deeds of 1730, without joining the trustees, or if they did not join, it could not be docked till after the death of <em>Lady \u2022Mary.

But, <em>query. </em>Whether it would not have been more conform, ible to tire principles of the common law, if in consequence of holding descendible freeholds entailable, though not. strictly within the statute <em>de donis, </em>the Judges had deemed them totally subject to the same consequences as conditional fees, and had declared that alienation should not be a complete bar of the entail until after having issue.

How could he impart rights to them if he did not possess them himself. The right of <em>Charles </em>first was not an absolute ice-simple which descended on <em>Lord Charles </em>second, but only a reverter. It is admitted by all that <em>Charles, </em>by the deed of 1730, created a conditional fee. It is thus reduced to a single point, whether the reverter Is devisable ? It is a fixed principle that it is not, though no reason can be assigned. It might lay a foundation for suits and create lawsuits by assigning causes of action. The highest estate is a fee, and if granted under a condition, there is a possibility it may return. Where there is a feoffment on condition to go to <em>Rome, </em>there is the same chance of reverter as a death without issue; so in case of escheat; but this chance is not devisable. A right of entry will descend but cannot be devised. If a person is disseised, he cannot devise his right of entry. The chance of escheat will descend.

The settlement of 1698 is of the whole province; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>A the proprietary had no other mode of conveyance than under the act of assembly, then all his grants are void.

But call the estate what <em>you. </em>will, acts have been done to bar it. The law will invent some mode to bar all entails. A trust estate in tail may be barred by acts that would not bar a legal estate.

One seemed to contend they pass an estate-tail; another that they pass a conditional fee. Again, one gentleman contended the deed of 1698 is good; and he contended that <em>Frederick Lord Baltimore </em>was issue in tail under that deed, at the time of suffering the recovery in 17C7, although he admitted that any mode of conveyance would bar the estate-tail; and the Attorney-General had expressly agreed before, that the deeds of 1730 destroyed all the limitations of the deed of 1678.</p>\n<p data-order=\"282\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-18\">Mr. <em>Cooke </em>said, that if the proprietary could entail this province, he might tie it up from alienation, under a strict settlement, in the same manner that any other estate might be restrained. That if any other estate restrained during a life in being would be good, so it was admitted such outstanding estate would prevent alienation in this case. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>supposed the case of an executory devise. He observed that 'the gentlemen had offered no reason in support of the deed of 1698, but that one construction would destroy all the grants of the proprietary. Do they recollect that if they establish this to be a conditional fee, that every grant of <em>Frcderick Lord Baltimore </em>V void! He never had issue, and therefore the sale to Che defendants is void. When too they speak of the policy of the law, in promoting alienation, did: they recollect that the same policy would operate against i. conditional fee with much more force than against an estate; tail ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"283\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-4\">He said that there appeared to be a distinction between common sales and transfers of property, and that of taking lands up under the conditions of plantations, under which this province was settled, and migrations encouraged; the case of sales is within these laws, but that of taking up vacant lands is not so. That it was well known that patents have issued during the infancy of the patentees, and could be good on no other principle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"284\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-5\">He supposed a bargain and sale had been executed by the proprietary. He then considered the case as a conditional fee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"285\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-6\">To show that there was no merger of the term, he cited 1 <em>Atk. </em>592.</p>\n<p data-order=\"286\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-7\">That the trustee is to have an estate to serve all the trusts in the settlement, he cited 1 <em>Atk. </em>592.</p>\n<p data-order=\"287\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-8\">That a term is enlarged, (on a writ of error from Ireland,) after it had expired., he cited <em>Cowji. </em>841.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"288\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b306-14\"> This fact is not slated in tiit verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"289\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b342-9\">Hanson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYx\">delivered the following opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">In my opinion the plaintiff\u2019s claim rests entirely on the devise of the second <em>Charles Lord Baltimore </em>in 1750, supposing nothing since done to bar his right of entry upon the death of <em>Lord Frederick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">We are then to consider , first, whether or not <em>Lord Charles </em>second had any thing in <em>Anne Arundel Manor </em>which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>was capable of devising, w hen he made the will under which the plaintiff claims.</p>\n<p id=\"A99\">And here the first thing to be done is to determine the ^ . validity, or nullity of the settlement in 1698. As to the deed of 1730 both parties have rightly admitted that it had all the requisites of a deed; and they differ only as to its operation and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">To the deed of 1698 it is objected, that it was not acknowledged and recorded agreeably to the act of assembly, and of 1692. But although the words of that law are general, although the government of the province in the year 1698 was in the hands of the crown, I do not imagine, that, on just construction, the law extended to any kind of grants by the proprietary, whether they were grants ou original surveys, or conveyances of any part of the province, before surveyed, and reserved to himself. The species of grant can make no solid distinction. Either the act of assembly comprehends all, or extends to no conveyance by the lord. And inasmuch as the patents issued during its ex\u00ab Istence, have been uniformly held good, it is now too late to call them in question. I consider then the settle-of 1698 originally good, although neither acknowledged nor recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">'The interest of <em>Lord Charleo </em>second in <em>Anne Arundel '.Manor </em>under that deed, I conceive, was an estate-tail with the reversion in fee. <em>Lord Charles </em>first by that deed had conveyed the province of Maryland, and the manors, and certain lands in <em>England </em>to trustees, to the use of himself for life, remainder to his son Benedict, remainder to the issue male of <em>Benedict </em>and <em>Lady Charlotte \u2018Lee, </em>his intended wife, in tail male, remainder to himself in fee. Now as <em>Charles </em>first and his son <em>Benedict, </em>were both dead, and <em>Charles </em>second was the heir male of <em>Benedict </em>and <em>Lady Charlotte, </em>and the heir general of <em>Charles </em>first, it follows -hat at the time of the devise be had an estate tail in <em>Anne Arundel Manor, </em>with the reversion to himself in fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">When I say this, I mean that the statute <em>de donis </em>extend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>ed to the lord proprietary\u2019s manors at least, if not t the province itself. Against this idea I have heard no argument which has the least weight in my mind. It would ^deed appear extraordinary that a tract of land, or a manor in Maryland, whilst in the hands of the lord proprietary should not be subject to the statute, and that when it fell into the hands of an individual it should be subject to the statute. Whether or not the province itself might he entailed, is a question I hold not material in the cause, if it were material, I should incline to a decision in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\">I mean likewise that <em>Charles </em>second had an estate in <em>Anne Arundel Manor </em>executed by the statute of uses. It has been said with truth, that that statute under, the decision of 'the Courts of Law, executes no more than the first use, where there is a limitation of a use upon a use ; that where there is a limitation of a use upon a use, the second <em>cestui que use </em>has no remedy but in chancery, which will compel the performance of the trust, and that wherever there is a use, on which the statute does not operate, it is upon the same footing with all uses before the statute, which were never-held to be subject to the statute <em>de donis. </em>But I am clear, that the interest of <em>Lord Charles </em>second was not a use upon a use. \u2022 It is necessary here, to distinguish a little. The true idea of a use upon a use is, where there are two uses limited upon the same estate, or the same interest in lands. As where the whole fee or an estate for life, or an estate-tail is given to <em>A* </em>for the use of <em>B. </em>in trust for the use of <em>C, </em>there the statute executes the possession in B., the first <em>cestui que </em>use, and goes no further ; and the use limited to <em>C. </em>is determined to be on the same footing, as it would have been before the statute. But where lands are given to <em>A. </em>in fee to the use first of B., for life and then of <em>C. </em>in tail, there the statute executes the possession in <em>B. </em>immediately ; and upon his death, it executes the possession in <em>C. </em>In this case there is only one use limited on the estate for life, and one use limited on the estate-tail. In the other case there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>iwo uses limited on the same estate for life, or in tail, or m fee, which the Courts of Law said was absurd, and therefore void. In short, the difference is between a use <em>upon </em>a use, and a use <em>after </em>a use. The statute will not execute a use, but it will execute any number of uses, one after another, as they arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><em>Lord Charles </em>second then at the time of making the devise to the plaintiff\u2019s lessor, being seised in tail with the reversion to himself ih fee, most clearly had something which he was capable of devising; and that was the reversion, which unquestionably may well pass by a devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">On the extinction then of the issue in tail, supposing the estate not before barred, the plaintiff\u2019s lessor became entitled to enter. That extinction took place by the death of <em>Lord Frederick </em>in 1771, and the lessor was then entitled to enter, unless <em>Lord Frederick </em>had done something in his life to bar him.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">When I say <em>Lord Charles </em>second was seised in tail with the reversion in himself, it must be understood, that I conceive the settlement of 1730 did not defeat the deed of 1698, because, under the deed of 1730, he would have had only an estate for life, remainder to his first, second, &amp;c. son in tail male, reversion to himself in fee. But with respect to the operation of the devise, the plaintiff is precisely on the same footing, whether <em>Lord Charles </em>second was seised under the deed of 1698, or the deed of 1730. Under both or either he had the reversion in fee, and the devise was intended to give <em>Benjamin Cahert </em>all the devisor could give in the manor of <em>Anne Arundel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Having proceeded so far as to say that <em>Lord Charles </em>second had a reversion in fee, and that such reversion was well devised, it remains to consider whether any thing was done by <em>Lord Frederick </em>amounting to a legal and effectual bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The first thing on this head to be considered, is, by what methpd the proprietary\u2019s estate-tail in a manor may be barred. In what way an estate-tail of the province itself might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>foe barred, I consider as not material, although I accede most readily to the position, that every estate-tail whatever, and the reversion or remainder thereon, may be barred in some way or other. That the estate-tail in <em>Anne Arundel Manor </em>could not be barred by a fine or a common recovery, in the Court of Common Pleas in England, I think, has been admitted ; but whether it was admitted or not, I am confident that no action in the Courts of <em>Westminster </em>ought ever to have affected lands in <em>Maryland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Supposing an estate-tail in the province itself, and an estate-tail of a manor in the lord proprietary to be on the same footing, there could, I conceive, be only four ways which could have been adopted for the purpose of barring it. 1. A common deed of conveyance, in the same manner as if the tenant in tail were tenant in fee; 2. A common recovery in the Provincial Court; 3. A fine on grant and render in the Provincial Court, in the same manner as is used by the king of <em>England </em>in the Common Pleas; 4. An act of assembly,</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">That it could net be barred by a common deed of conveyance, as if the tenant were tenant in fee, I think must strike every disinterested person on refection j because, if it could be barred in that way, it would be on the same footing in every respect as a fee-simple; and such a construction would give the lord proprietary a power, or a prerogative not enjoyed even by the king of England, his superior. On this subject it has been said, that if the proprietary could not bar the entail by deed, all ordinary grants by patent are on the same principle void. But I conceive from the charter of Maryland, and the object in granting it, and the manner in which it is to be enjoyed, that the person who holds the province, must for the time have die power of granting ordinary patents. So that the rights of patentees, their heirs and assigns are not at all involved in the decision of this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">That the estate-tail (if such there could be) in the province itself might be barred by act of assembly, I suppose every one would admit. Whether a common recovery or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>line, would be most proper, or whether the proprietary might not choose either, for docking the entail of the province, is to be considered. I conceive that either way would be proper, because cither way was in use, and deemed right by the Court for barring entails of land held by common persons ; and because it seems that where the law has not already prescribed a mode, it will recognise the mode chosen by the party, provided it be convenient for the purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">I cannot, however, conceive that an entail of the province, and an entail of a manor in the hands of the proprietary, are on the same footing. It is the recovery of <em>Anne Arundel Manor </em>with which we are concerned. Had a private person been seised in tail of this manor, there is no question that lie might have suffered a common recovery. Common recoveries in <em>Maryland </em>were as usual as in England; and it would be vain at this time to question the propriety of that mode of barring estates-tail, reversions, and remainders.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">To the recovery by <em>Lord Frederick </em>there are two objections. 1. That the lord proprietary being on a footing with the king of England, could not suffer a recovery in his own Courts; <em>2. </em>That he did not suffer it in person, and there was not a good attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">As to the first objection, it has been settled that <em>Lord Baltimore </em>might sue in his own Courts ; and if it be not absurd for him to be plaintiff in his own Courts, it is not absurd for him to be defendant. The whole absurdity is supposed to arise from the style of the writ, and the submitting to his own Judges and officers. There might, indeed, be a very powerful objection against <em>Lord Baltimore\u2019s </em>being, subject to his own creatures, if there had been any other mode for him to sue and be sued. That he might and did sue in his own Courts is a point well fixed- and ascertained, and, in my opinion, when this point was fixed, it determined at the same time that he might be sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Having said that <em>Lord Baltimore </em>might sue and be sued in his own Courts, it does not remain to be considered., which we? the best method to he adopted for barring en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>tails, in a case not before provided for. The verdict states, with truth, that both fines and common recoveries had been commonly used in the province, at the time when the recovery in question was suffered; and <em>Lord Frederick </em>was as free to make his choice between them as any other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">As to the second objection to the validity of the recovery, namely, the want of a good warrant of attorney, it is, I conceive, hardly entitled to a remark. When it appears from the record, that an attorney <em>xvas admitted., </em>it is too late to say, that although he was really the attorney of <em>Lord Frederick, </em>he <em>ought not to have been admitted. </em>Perhaps the commission of attorney-general was alone sufficient. Common recoveries are common assurances; and I believe there is no instance of determining a common recovery to be void merely for want of form, when all the parties requisite to the recovery appear to have joined in it. In short, the case before the Court, I apprehend to be far more important on account of the value of the thing in contest, than difficult of decision. The ingenuity of the counsel on each side has been displayed in raising points, many of which I deem immaterial. As to the point suggested by the Court, whether or not <em>Benedict Calvert </em>can take by a devise to \u201c <em>Benjamin </em>Calvert, Esquire,\u201d without any other designation whatever, I conceive to be the most difficult of all which have been raised, and it would have been still more difficult for the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to support, had the verdict stated the whole truth, <em>viz. </em>that in <em>England., </em>where the will Was made, there were several persons of <em>kin </em>to the devisor, who bore the name of <em>Benjamin Calvert. </em>However, as this point is immaterial for the defendants, on the supposition that the other points are in their favour, I shall give no further opinion about it. I have, indeed, ever made it a rule to determine nothing more than is absolutely necessary, and to leave those points which are foreign from, or immaterial to, the cause in hand, to be discussed in causes wherein a decision upon them may be essential.</p>\n<p id=\"AHLD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>The Court </em>gave judgment on the special verdict for the defendant. And,</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><em>The Court of </em>Appeals, at <em>June </em>term, 1792, affirmed the judgment of the <em>General Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"><em>Francis </em>Hargrave, Esq. the author of the <em>Notes upon Coke Littleton, </em>having been applied to on behalf of the lessor of the plaintiff, during the pendency of this ejectment, gave the following opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">My thoughts on Mr. <em>Calverfs </em>case, and on the proper manner of arguing for his title to the estate of <em>Anne Arundel </em>Manor, in <em>Maryland, </em>being desired immediately, I am forced to express myself with great haste, and in more general terms than I should use, if the time necessary for considering a subject with so much importance and novelty in it had been allowed. I therefore desire to be understood, not as drawing out a regular and formal account of all the arguments and authorities incident to the case, but merely as giving a general view of my present ideas. It is pro\u00bb bable that many new lights may occur to me in future, and if it should be required, I shall be very ready to communi\u00bb cate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The case between Mr. <em>Calvert </em>and the grantees of <em>Frederick Lord Baltimore, </em>in respect to <em>Anne Arundel Manor, </em>is subject to a consideration very different from that which would arise, if the title to the whole province of <em>Maryland </em>should ever be contested by his sisters and heirs, against his devisee ; and as I think that pointing out what the difference is, will tend to give the best idea of Mr. <em>Calverfs </em>situation, I shall begin with so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">As between the devisee of <em>Frederick Lord Baltimore </em>and his heirs, <em>there </em>would be two great questions. One would be, whether the province of <em>Maryland </em>is entailable and devisable ; the other would arise only on the supposition that the property was entailable and devisable, and it would be, whether the means made use of by <em>Frederick Lord Baltimore </em>for barring the entails were effectual. If his sisters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>and heirs could succeed on either of these questions, it would be equally fatal to his devisee ; though the consequences to the former would depend on the principles on which the dedsion against the heir should be founded. If the province should not be deemed either entailable or devisable, the two sisters of <em>Frederick Lord Baltimore </em>would take as genera? heirs of <em>Cecil Lord Baltimore, </em>the first grantee of the province. If it should he held that the province is entailable and devisable, but that the several entails are now subsisting for want of a sufficient bar, still the devisee of <em>Frederick. Lord Baltimore </em>would be disappointed, because then on hie death without issue, the reversion in fee of his father the secopd <em>Charles Lord </em>Baltimore, became an estate in possession, and consequently vested, according to his will, by which it is limited, on failure of his son <em>Fredericks </em>issue, to hir&gt; own daughter, Mrs. Brovoning, in fee, subject to the payment of 20,000/. to her sister, Mrs. <em>Eden. </em>In observing that the reversion in fee of the second <em>Charles Lord Baltimore </em>came into possession upon the death of his son <em>Frederick, </em>I take it for granted that there is not either <em>CecilliaCalvert, </em>the brother of the second <em>Charles, </em>or any other issue male of <em>Benedict </em>their father, living, to claim the estate in tail male, limited to <em>Benedict's </em>first and other sons by the marriage settlement in 1698, which appears to have been the first entail of the province. I say that I take this fact foi, granted, for if the property is entailable, and the several entails still remain undisturbed, and there is any issue male of <em>Benedict </em>still living, such issue would have a good title as well to the <em>Anne Arundel </em>estate as to the rest of the province, against every other claimant. Such would be the two questions as between the sisters of <em>Frederick Lord Baltimore </em>and his devisee, and the different consequences of a decision against the latter, according to the principle upon which the case shall be determined. But one only question can, as I conceive, arise between Mr. <em>Calvert </em>and the grantees of <em>Frederick Lord </em>Baltimore, which would be, whether either of the modes adopted by him for barring the entail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>of the <em>Anne Arundel </em>estate is sufficient in law. Both Mr. <em>Calvert </em>and his adversaries must agree that the property is entailable and devisable. If it is not, neither claimant has a title, but the estate clearly belongs to the heirs general of <em>Cecil Lord </em>Baltimore, the first grantee of <em>Maryland, </em>which heirs are Mrs. <em>Browning </em>and Mrs. <em>Eden. </em>The <em>Anne Arundel </em>estate being then admitted to be entailable and devisable, Mr. <em>Calvert </em>will be entitled, if the acts done by <em>Frederick Lord Baltimore </em>for barring the entail, are inefficient, because the estates-tail limited to the issue male of <em>Benedict </em>Calvert, by the settlement of 1698, and to the issue male of the second <em>Charles Lord Baltimore, </em>by the settlement of 1730, are both determined for want of objects, and the reversion in fee expectant on those estatcs-tail is now come into possession, and is vested in Mr. <em>Calvert, </em>under the will of the second <em>Charles Lord Baltimore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">This brings me to the modes by which <em>Frederick Lord Baltimore </em>endeavoured to destroy the subsisting entails oi\u00b0 <em>Anne Arundel Manor, </em>and to gain the fee of it. Une mode was the conveyance by lease and release; and I conjecture that this was adopted in consequence of a supposed resemblance between the property in question and another species of property of which the entail is certainly barrable by simple alienation.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">If a lease is granted to one and his heirs during lives, such a descendible freehold, though not within the statute <em>de </em>donis, is in effect, entailable; and it is now well settled by a variety of adjudged cases, that the entail of a descendible freehold may be barred by mere alienation, whether by lease and release, or any other valid conveyance of a freehold. Why such an alienation is deemed to bar the entail, of a descendible freehold, will best appear from reading the series of determinations on the subject. These, as well as I am able to collect them at present, will be found by examining the following references. 2 <em>Vern. </em>184. <em>225. </em>3 <em>P. Wms. 262. 1 Atk. </em>524, 2 <em>Atk. </em>259. 376. 2 <em>Ves. </em>681, 3 <em>Atk. </em>464,</p>\n<p id=\"A8-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The shortness of the time prevents me at present from giving due attention to the cases which I refer to ; but I am in-dined to think, that the origin of holding alienation to be a ^ar t^le enta\u00fc of a descendible freehold, was the mode of barring the donor and the issue of the donee in the case of a fee conditional at common law. Before fees conditional were converted into estates-tail by the statute <em>de donis, the </em>donee\u2019s alienation, after performance of the condition by the having of issue was effectual, both as against the donor, and the issue of the donee. This most probably was what first suggested the idea of attempting to bar the entail of a descendible freehold by lease and release, which, by force of the statute of uses, is a mode of alienation as legal as feoffment, or any other common law conveyance. At length, the validity of thus barring an entail by alienation, was brought into question in the Court of Chancery, and there it being allowed, that a descendible freehold was entail-able, though not strictly within the statute <em>de donis, </em>the Court was driven to the necessity of acknowledging some mode of barring the entail; and as a common recovery could not be suffered of a descendible freehold without a forfeiture of the estate, and as a fine, in most cases, is not sufficiently extensive in its operation, simple alienation of the property seemed to be the only mode left for the choice of the Court, and was with less scruple adopted, as having been already applied to the case of fees conditional at the common law. It may, however, be observed, that it would have appeared more conformable to the principles of the common law, if, in consequence of holding descendible freeholds entailable, though not strictly within the statute <em>de donis, </em>the Judges had deemed them <em>totally </em>subject to the same consideration as fees conditional, and had declared that alienation should not <em>be </em>a complete bar of the entail, till after the having of issue. But the doctrine is now settled otherwise, and it is only necessary, on Mr. <em>Calvert's </em>part, to show an essential difference between the case of a descendible freehold, and that of <em>Anne Arundel </em>Manor, between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>lord proprietor and others. <em>Feigned </em>recoveries are liable to the same consideration as recoveries really adverse. The former can be prosecuted only where the latter may be. In <em>England </em>the only Courts for original suits to recover the freehold and inheritance of land, is the Court of Common Pleas. In that Court only <em>really adverse </em>recoveries of the freehold and inheritance can be had; and, therefore, in that Court only, can <em>common </em>or <em>feigned </em>recoveries be suffered. The rule must be the same with respect to land in America. Whatever the Court is, in which suits for the freehold and inheritance of land in Maryland,, between the lord proprietor and others <em>ought </em>to be prosecuted, that <em>must </em>be the Court for every common recovery to which he is made a party. Now, on the part of Mr. Calvert, it should be insisted, that though the Courts of Justice in <em>Maryland </em>are certainly, in general, the proper jurisdiction for trying the right to land in <em>Maryland,, </em>yet they are not so in the <em>particular </em>case of the lord proprietor. I apprehend that the Courts of Justice in Maryland,, for trying the title to land, are the Courts of the lord proprietor who happens to be in possession; that the Judges are appointed by him, and are removable at his pleasure; that they exercise their jurisdiction as his delegates ; that the process of the Courts runs in his name ; and, in short, that they are in every sense of the words, the Courts of the lord proprietor, as much as if he presided in them, and administered justice in his own person. Is it possible that Courts so constituted, should be the proper jurisdiction for trying suits in which the lord proprietor is either plaintiff or defendant ? Would not the allowance of such a jurisdiction, in effect, render the lord proprietor a judge in his own cause ? Is it agreeable to na-.Sural justice, that a judicature so partial should be established ? Could it be the <em>intention </em>of the crown, in granting the charter under which the Courts of the lord proprietor sire erected, to extend his jurisdiction to causes in which he is a party; or if such was the <em>intention </em>of the crown, could <em>\"J\\ </em>be within <em>the power </em>of the crown to invest him with such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>a jurisdiction; or rather was it not contrary to the fundamental principles of the <em>English </em>law and constitution, to make the.lord proprietor a judge in his own-case? Is there any instance,.except the single case of the king, in which the law of <em>England </em>permits any person to be the judge of his own cause ?\u25a0 The words of <em>ILovd' Hardwicke, </em>in the case between the <em>Earl of Derby </em>and the <em>Duke of Athol, </em>on the title to the <em>Isle of Man, </em>as reported by Mr. <em>Vesey </em>in his second volume, 204. are very strong against such jurisdiction. He says, \u201c the question here is to the title and right to the whole island, which cannot be determined in the Courts of <em>Man, </em>because that would be permitting the persons who claim the seigniory of the isle to judge in their own case.\u2019*</p>\n<p id=\"AqJK\">But if the Courts of the lord proprietor cannot take cognisance of suits to which he is a party, it may be asked, what is the jurisdiction which must be resorted to ? Some Court there must be, to prevent a failure of justice <em>; </em>and it seems incumbent upon those who deny the competency of the proprietary Courts, - to point out another jurisdiction which is competent; and this I think may be easily done in the case in question, which is that of a suit for the freehold* and inheritance of land in <em>Maryland. </em>There are only two Courts, exclusive of tin; Courts in <em>America, </em>which can pretend to a jurisdiction over such suits. These are the Court of Common Picas in <em>England, </em>and the Court of the King in Council. Whether the jurisdiction belongs to both concurrently, or to one only; or if to one only, whether the former or the latter has the better title, is wholly immaterial to Mr. <em>Calvert, </em>because if <em>either </em>has the jurisdiction, hie purpose is answered. But it seems clear that from the nature of the Constitution, as well as from authorities of law* that the jurisdiction is vested in the King in Council only.. <em>America </em>is out of the realm of <em>England, </em>but the process of the Common Pleas is confined to <em>England, </em>and that Court cannot issue writs for the delivery of the possession of lands in <em>America. </em>But the same objection will not apply to fbe King in Council. The <em>appellant </em>jurisdiction of f.hn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Mng in council, with respect to all civil causes from <em>Ame</em>rica, has Leen exercised ever since the establishment of our colonies, and is not now to be called in question. It arose at first from the necessity of the case, and because there was not any other Court which seemed to have the least pretence for claiming such a jurisdiction. The like necessity will equally justify at least the exercise of an <em>original </em>jurisdiction. If there are special cases of suits for land in <em>America </em>to which no court there is competent, and the ordinary Courts of Justice in <em>England </em>cannot entertain them, what jurisdiction can be resorted to, except the king in council ? The title of the king in council to an <em>original </em>jurisdiction in such case, would be reasonable and constitu\u00ed tional, even though the privy council was not already in possession of an <em>appellant </em>jurisdiction over causes from <em>America ; </em>but the <em>latter </em>being now settled, is a fair precedent for admitting <em>theformer, </em>wherever the reasons on which the latter was first allowed, strongly and fully apply. This kind of reasoning seems so forcible, that perhaps that, unasf isted by positive and direct authorities, it might be sufficient to prove the original jurisdiction of the king in council over such suits for land in <em>America, </em>as, for any special reason, cannot be prosecuted in the Courts there. Bui authorities and precedents of law arc not wanting. In the reign of <em>Queen Elizabeth, </em>there was a controversy about the title of the <em>Isle of </em>Man, between the then <em>Earl of Derby </em>and the daughter of the preceding earl, and it appears by the reports which we have of the ease, that the proceeding was before the king in council, and that by his command the matter of law was referred to the lord keeper of the great seal and divers of the privy council, and the two chief justices, and the Chief Baron Zee. 2 <em>And. 115. </em>4 <em>Inst. </em>284. The case <em>o\u00a3 America </em>is of the same kind, when there are contests between one province and another province about boundaries, or between two competitors about the title to the whole province\u00bb Accordingly, <em>Lord </em>Hardtoicke, in the case of Dean and <em>Baltimore. 1 </em>Ves, <em>447 </em>mentions the <em>ori</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number><em>ginal j </em>una di ci ion of the king in council in such eases, an\u00abx. others of a similar kind, as a <em>thing certain. </em>If it should be attempted to distinguish between a suit for the whole province of <em>Maryland, </em>and one for a <em>parcel </em>of land within it, the proper answer I think is, that whatever differences there may be in other respects, they are the same so far as regards the <em>impropriety </em>and <em>illegality </em>of allowing a jurisdiction to the court of the lord proprietor in his own case. <em>Lord Hardwicke </em>held that reason <em>alone to </em>be sufficient for denying the jurisdiction of the Court of the <em>Isle of </em>Man, over suits for the seigniory of that isle; and where the lord proprietor of a province in <em>America </em>is party to a suit, the reason is as applicable to a suit for a <em>part </em>of the province, as a suit for the whole province. There may perhaps be <em>other </em>reasons why the Court of a province in <em>America </em>should not be competent to a suit for the <em>xbhole </em>province, such as are not applicable to a suit for <em>pari </em>of the province. But if the lord proprietor\u2019s being a party,- is of itself a sufficient objection to the jurisdiction of his own Courts, it becomes unnecessary, on Mr. <em>.Calvert''s </em>part, to seek for assistance from <em>those other </em>\u25a0reasons, and he will not be affected, even though they should not extend to the <em>Anne Arundel Manor. </em>I have now finished the arguments against the common recovery suffered by <em>Frederick Lord 'Baltimore </em>in his own Court, and in order to give them all possible force, I recommend it to the gentlemen concerned for Mr. Calvert,' in <em>America, </em>very carefully to peruse and consider the case of the <em>Earl of Derby </em>and the <em>Duke of Athol, </em>in 1 Ves. 202. That of <em>Pain </em>and <em>Lord </em>Baltimore, in the same book, 444.; and the case in respect to the <em>Isle of Plan, </em>in 2 Ves. 337. From the whole of what I have written, which is much more than I expected it would have been when I began, it appears that there are two-great and general propositions proper to be insisted upon for Mr. <em>Calvert, </em>one is, that a common <em>recovery </em>was the only mode by which Mr. <em>Calvert?a </em>reversion in fee in the <em>Anne Arundel Manor </em>could be barred. The other is that the recovery suffered by <em>FrrdnkL Lord Baltimore </em>was not srT<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>fered before the proper jurisdiction, and consequently is ineffectual. If both these propositions can be supported, Mr. <em>Calvert's </em>tide seems uncontrovertible; but if either fails, I think that he cannot succeed in the ejectment he has brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">I have not observed any thing in respect to the mistake of Mr. <em>Calvert's </em>Christian name in the will under which he claims, because I apprehend that there cannot be the least doubt of his right to prove the mistake by parol evidence,</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">FRANCIS HARGRAVE\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\"><em>Lincoln's </em>Inn, <em>17th </em>January, 1774.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\"><em>Continuation. </em>If what I have written in respect to the origin of holding alienation a bar of the entail of a descendible freehold, is well founded, it is evident that it is held to be so, from the necessity of the case, and because there was not any other mode which the Judges had any pretence for allowing. But how is the doctrine applicable to the case of the <em>Anne Arundel Manor f </em>In that there is an estate of inheritance, it is entailable within the statute <em>de </em>donis, and a common recovery may he suffered; for there must be some jurisdiction competent to the trial of suits about the inheritance of the estate, and if there is, common or <em>feigned </em>recoveries may be prosecuted before that Court as well as <em>real </em>recoveries. Alienation is a bar of the entail of a descendible freehold, because a common recovery cannot be suffered: but alienation is not a bar of the entail of <em>Anne Arundel </em>Manor, because a common recovery may be suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">It is not necessary to inquire here which is the proper Court for such a recovery. In this part of the argument it is sufficient that there must necessarily be <em>some </em>Court in which a recovery may be suffered,</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">The second mode which <em>Frederick Lord Baltimore </em>made \u25a0use of for barring the entail of <em>Anne Arundel </em>Manor, was a common recovery <em>in his own </em>Court, as lord proprietor of <em>.Maryland. </em>Here it should be insisted that so far as regards the kind of jurisdiction which 5s competent to the <em>tsht </em>of suits for land.</p>\n<p id=\"AmI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>Notes concerning the rights to the province of </em>Maryland, <em>by the late Daniel </em>Dulany, Esquire.</p>\n<p id=\"ADm\"><em>Lord Charles </em>seised in fee of the province of <em>Maryland\\ </em>on the marriage of his eldest son Benedict, conveyed to trustees to the use of <em>Lord </em>Benedict, for life; remainder to the trustees to preserve contingent remainders; remainder to the first and every other son of <em>Lord </em>Benedict, in <em>tail; </em>remainder to his own right heirs. <em>Lord </em>Charles, the eldest son of <em>Lord </em>Benedict, became seised in tail male, and having the reversion in fee on his marriage conveyed to trustees to the use of himself for life; remainder to trustees above; remainder to his first and every son in tail male ; remainder to his own right heirs. Having issue of the said marriage, Frederick, now <em>Lord </em>Baltimore, and two daughters, <em>Louisa </em>and Caroline, he devised the province of <em>Maryland </em>to trustees to the use of his son, <em>Lord </em>Frederick, for life; remainder to the trustees above ; remainder to his first and every other son in tail; remainder to his eldest daughter Louisa, in fee, chargeable with <em>20,0001. </em>sterling, payable to his daughter <em>Caroline.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\"><em>Note. </em>By the settlements above, besides the province, <em>other </em>rights, such as the tonnage, are conveyed to the above uses, and by the will the province <em>only </em>is devised.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\"><em>Frederick Lord, </em>Baltimore, on his marriage settled by deeds, in 1753, by conveyance to trustees, as above <em>mutatis mutandis. </em>His lady being dead without issue, all the purposes of the deeds of 1753 are answered, so that he had such estate as before the deeds of 1753. In 1761, by deeds of lease and release, <em>Lord Frederick </em>conveyed to trustees to the use of himself, 8:c.; remainder to the use of <em>Cecilius </em>Calvert, &amp;c.; remainder to such use as he should appoint by deed to be execute!.! In the presence of two witnesses, or by will, and in default, to the use of the persons named in the will of <em>Lord Charles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">.It is said that <em>Cecilius </em>is dead without issue, though I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Well remember an intimate friend of his (Mr. <em>Anderson </em>of London, merchant) told me Mr. <em>Cecilias Cahert </em>assured him he was married, and that he had a son bom in wedlock; that son is now alive, but it is said he is not legitimate. However, to proceed on supposition of the death of <em>Cecilias Cahert </em>without issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">T he question will be, whether <em>Lord Frederick </em>can bar by any act, and whether he has, by the deed of 1761, barred the right of <em>Louisa </em>under the will of her father, her father having the reversion in fee, if the province is clothed with a capacity of entail.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">It is said, indeed, to have been the opinions of Mr. <em>Jar</em>drell, Mr. Wilbraham, and others, on a case stated by Mr. <em>Benedict </em>Cahert, to whom <em>Lord Charles </em>devised <em>Anne Arundel </em>Manor, and also the opinions of Lords.Worthington, <em>Camden </em>and <em>Sir E. </em>Wilmot, on the marriage of <em>Lord </em>Frederick, that the devises to <em>Louisa </em>and <em>Benedict </em>Calvert, were to take-effect only on the death of <em>Lord </em>Frederick, within age, and without issue.

Vide <em>Hale's Hist, of the Common </em>Law.</p>\n<p id=\"AAOe\">It is a general rule that <em>nova constitutio futuris formant debet imponere non preteritis : </em>had the charter been granted before the statute <em>de donis, </em>&amp;c. then, according to the rule, 1 <em>Inst. </em>9. 4 <em>Inst. </em>201. 284. 2 <em>And. 115. </em>the common law would govern, being the law of <em>England; </em>but the grant has been made since, and at a time when the common law was altered by the statute, and therefore according to the rule above mentioned not being the law of England, it cannot govern the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">There does not appear to me to be any ground for contending, that such a limitation as would make an entail of Sands in England, will make a conditional fee when applied to the province, <em>i. e. </em>that the grant of the province ought to be governed by a law which did not exist in <em>England </em>when, it passed the seal, merely because it once did exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">If the rules respecting estates of inheritance at common law were not, according to <em>Lord Macclesfield's </em>doctrine, introduced by statute, yet, without doubt, considered as <em>lex non scriptm </em>the law might be as effectually abolished by statute, as if it had certainly been <em>lex scripta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Put the case that the estate called fee conditional had been introduced by statute in the time of <em>Henry </em>VIII. and that it had been altered to an estate-tail by a statute of <em>Ed ward </em>VI. there could be no reason to say, that the charter granted by <em>Car. </em>I. should be governed by the statute Hen. VIII. and it seems to me that <em>mutatis </em>mutandis, the same reasoning applies to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">It is commonly said that the common law, and such statutes of a general nature suitable to their circumstances as were made before their settlement extend to the plantations. This is to be understood in reference to the rules obtaining in the plantations, and even in this respect, it would be a strange incongruity to say that when the common law ?s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>abolished <em>by </em>statute, both the common law and that statute extend hither; that is, that estates of the same nature should be governed by opposite or different rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\">It may be inferred from the several settlements that the advisers of them were of opinion the grant was affected by the statute <em>de </em>donis, &amp;c. the purposes and provisions intended to be made would not otherwise have been answered. The remainders limited after the determination of the estates limited to heirs of the body would have been void. From the charter, moreover, it may be inferred that the Statute <em>dc donis </em>was understood to extend: for parcels are thrreby grantable in tail, as well as in fee, but if the entirety be not entailable, on what principle are parcels ?</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">If the province be not entailable, neither is it devisable, \u2022J. <em>e. </em>if the statute of <em>Edw. </em>I. does not extend, neither does the statute of <em>I Jen. </em>VIII. extend to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">There possibly may be another question, should a will be made according to the statute of Hen. VIII. and not ac - cording to the statute of frauds and perjuries, the latter act having passed subsequent to the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Supposing the province entailable, the next question will be. whether the estate-tail be barrable er not ? It is clearly not barrable by fine or recovery, either in <em>England </em>or <em>Maryland; </em>is it then barrable any other way? By act ofparlia\u00bb ment it certainly is, and it should seem from the writings in. 1753, that this method was advised as the proper one ; but this cannot be called a remedy; it is not a power incident to the estate. It might be refused or granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">The question then is brought to this, is it barrable by common deed ?</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">It may reasonably be inferred from the settlements that it was not so understood: what security of family provision, the great object of settlements, if the estate barrable by common deed ?</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">If thus barrable, then the tenant in tail would have a power over his estate excluded by the statute <em>de donis: </em>he would have a power too, that did not belong to a fee condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>tioual at common law: for one having such estate couid no'. bar, but <em>postproleni euscitalam,</em></p>\n<p id=\"ARJ\">But if not barrable bv common deed, then a perpetuity , which it is said the law has so great an abhorrence of, at. not to allow it in any case.</p>\n<p id=\"AVl\">Here is the stress of the objection. The entail of a copy-hold, it is now settled, is barrable one way or another by recovery, surrender, or forfeiture and regrant, and that whether there be any custom for it or not; and the very principle thereof is, that there may not be a perpetuity, which the law abhors.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">lienee' it is argued, that as a copyhold is barrable by surrender, &amp;c. on account of the imbecility of the estate, so the province by common deed on account of the magnitude <em>o\u00ed </em>it, and that the same reason applies in both cases, the avoidance of perpetuity.-</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">It was certainly the Attention of the statute <em>de don/s </em>to create perpetuity ; but policy found out a fiction by which, that intention was defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The same policy has at length determined all copyholds to be barrable one way or another; and it is no wonder it should, if what is said in the book called <em>Lex Manerwrum </em>be true, that the greater part of the estates in the kingdom are copyhold, or customary estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">In what did the policy consist ? In giving a power, by which there might Lc a circulation of property preventive of too great influence, and encouraging social industry; but, perhaps, the reason does not apply in the present case, which is of a very peculiar nature, and it might not be proper to allow a power \u00a9f alienation when the purpose for which it it allowed in other cases does not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">By the power of alienation, in the above instances, lands were split and divided, and instead of being in the hands of one fell into the hands of many: thus too great influence was guarded against and a general encouragement to industry was given. Had there not been this effect, had lands nassecl entire from one to another, the end would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>/save been answered. The province is an entirety. It cannot be split and divided : the lands w\u2019l dn it are alienable, and devisable. If there was not <em>a </em>power in all the settle-<em>1 </em>tnents to grant out in parcels, perhaps, considering the nature, end, and view of the original charter, considering the express power given by it to grant parcels in fee, tail, ike. \u00a1such power would always attend the propriety. If there would not be such an incidental power, at present there is no objection to the settlements on this head, because it is expressly given.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">This being a peculiar case, the objection from the abhor\u00bb renee of perpetuity has the less weight, and tile rule is laid down too largely, that to every estate-tail there is necessarily a power of barring it belonging to the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">\u2022 A common recovery cannot be had of the province in <em>Maryland; </em>for the very instant the Judges should give judgment, they would of course determine their own commission. If <em>Lord Baltimore </em>had no right to the province, which the recovery would suppose, he had no right to appoint the Judges; in <em>England </em>there could be none, for the subject ought to be there in some county.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">The peculiar situation of the subject is such that a <em>prascipe </em>will not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">Is there no case where there is an entail not barrable Such is the case of the king.

A conditional fee and reverter cannot exist at the same time in the same person, but the having the former is an extin\u00bb guishment of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\"><em>Lord Frederick </em>had a power to grant out parcels, and s\u00a9 had his father. In all these grants, the rent has been reserved to the grantor and his heirs, without any reference to (the power, or to the settlements. The validity of these grants will not, I hope,' be questioned. The rents could only be reserved to the grantors, and their heirs; a reservation to any other would have been void.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">Lands have escheated, and been granted out under rent reserved as above.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">On the supposition that these grants are good, the parcels granted are severed, and the rents being reserved to the grantors and their heirs, belonged to them, and that being so, are not affected by the settlements, and, consequently, might be disposed of by deed or will; but yet this could hardly be the intention of the settlements, and especially when the restriction annexed to the power in respect to the quantum of the rent is considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">The subject being peculiar, it is no wonder that every contingency was not provided for.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-15\">Where there is a particular estate of the seigniory and' ar. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>escheat of the tenement, the seigniory is extinct; but who shall have the tenement <em>l </em>It seems reasonable that there should be such respective interests in the tenements as there were in the seigniory.

In Keilvay, 114. or 141. it is said if he does not enter, he in reversion cannot, but may have his writ of escheat, and it is said it was his fault he had connection with one who neglected to enter ; but if the tenement on the entry should entirely belong to the person having the particular estate, it would be improper to say that he in reversion suffered by the neglect of the other, since he would gain by it in having it in his power to recover by writ of escheat.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">In the case of forfeiture of copyhold, it is said the <em>dorninuspro tempore </em>shall have it.

In the case of the crown, the elder would succeed, and for a very good reason, which seems very strongly to apply to the province, though not entirely. In the case of the crown, the inconvenience of two of equal power and authority, differing in opinion, would be <em>intolerable; </em>there would be no superior to redress it. But not so of the province, for the sovereignty being in the king, the royal interposition might redress.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In the case of dignity, which is not partible, it may be conferred by the king on either of the sisters. Some hold that until the king confers, it descends to both ; others that it is until then in abeyance.

Maryland, as the king\u2019s is in <em>England. </em>Indictments charge offences to be against his peace, good rule and government, Provincial laws are enacted in his name by and with the advice, &amp;c. The king\u2019s name is never used in <em>Maryland, </em>in executing or enacting any laws. Even prosecutions upon the penal statutes of <em>England </em>are in the name of the lord proprietary. All lands in <em>Maryland </em>belonging to the inhabitants are entailable, and estates-tail, remainders and reversions are barrable by common recovery in the provincial court. The charter of the province was long after the statute <em>de donis. </em>The charter speaks of grants in tail. It has been the usage and practice to entail lands, and bar by recovery in the provincial Court. This usage has been referred to, recognised, and confirmed by acts of assembly. Verv many titles depend thereon; the statute <em>de donis </em>and mode of conveyance by common recovery are observed as established rules of property, and so of the statutes of uses and of wills. The oath of judges prescribed by act of assembly is to do equal right according to the laws, customs and directions of acts of assembly, so far forth as they provide; and where they are silent, according to the laws, statutes and reasonable customs of England, as used and practised within this province.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Land is granted to the king in tail, remainder to <em>A. B. </em>in fee, the king cannot bar the remainder by common recovery, neither can he bar by grant. <em>Plowd. Comm. Willion </em>v. <em>Lord </em>Berkley, and the case of <em>Altonwood </em>in <em>Co. </em>Rep,</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Perpetuity is odious. Many million of acres of land are contained within the boundaries of this province ; but the. property is principally in tenants paying a quit-rent, who have as full power to bar by recovery in the provincial court as any in <em>England </em>to bar in <em>C. B. </em>This property is most open to alienation.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">If the lord proprietary could not suffer a common recover) , though every inhabitant may as above, it seems to arise, from his exercising regal powers under the charter, and be* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>&gt;:ng considered <em>in loco regis. </em>Indeed I cannot conceive how a common recovery can be suffered by the lord proprietary of the province. The Judges derive their capacity, as such, from his appointment, and should a recovery be suffered before them of the propriety, and he thus cease to be lord proprietary, they, too, must cease to be Judges. The existence of their judicial power would be incompatible with a judgment against the proprietary under whose commission they are Judges. As to his suffering a recovery in <em>England, </em>it seems to be a strange notion. It is said there are precedents of recoveries in <em>C. B. </em>of lands in the plantations. but if there have been such recoveries, and they are effectual, they must have been under act of assembly; but there .is no such act in <em>Maryland. </em>If <em>Lord Baltimore </em>could not bar by common recovery, neither can the king ; and yet. if <em>Lord Baltimore </em>might bar by lease and release, though the king cannot by grant, the following doctrine is the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Every person having an estate-tail in land in <em>Maryland </em>may bar that estate and a remainder thereon, and reversion in the same and in no other manner in the Provincial Court, that a person in <em>England </em>having a similar estate there, may in <em>C. B., </em>except the lord proprietary, because being <em>in loco </em>regis, a <em>prcceipe </em>will not lie against him; but since he cannot bar by recovery, he may by lease and release, though the king cannot either by recovery or grant; such being the peculiar situation of the lord proprietary, that he is in one respect <em>in loco </em>regis, and to be considered in another, in a different light, and to have a power to bar by lease and release in order to prevent the establishment of an odious perpetuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In the case of <em>The Earl of Derby </em>v. <em>Duke of Athol, </em>Lord <em>Hardwicke </em>observed, as I have been informed, that if the private act of <em>James </em>I. intended the like effect with the statute <em>de </em>donis, there was no occasion for the restrictive and prohibitory clause in the act, in respect of the estate-tail, because there could be no fine or recovery, and therefore no method to bar it. The settlements, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>have been made on the marriages of the lords proprietaries, I supposed, were upon the advice of able counsel, who did not entertain the idea of a power to bar by lease and release, and that Mr. <em>Booth\u2019s </em>was not singular. But as so many eminent lawyers are now of opinion in favour of the bar by deeds of lease and release, I am to suppose that I should have had less doubt if I had had more knowledge of the subject; but I do not understand why it should be thought that the propriety of <em>Maryland </em>was not entailable, or that the law of England, as it stood before the statute <em>de </em>donis, extended to Maryland,, though it ceas\u00e9d to be the law of <em>England </em>long before the charter o'f Maryland, or any discovery made that such a country existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">As to the tonnage, I apprehend it is not a tenement, nor does it partake of the realty, and therefore it is not entailable, wherefore the estate limited being a fee conditional, when <em>Lord Charles </em>made his will, he had only a reverter, possibility, or condition in law.</p>\n<p id=\"AiSj\">Though some very modern resolutions have gone a great way in favour of the power of devising, yet I do not know that a condition in law, or 'in fact, has been held to be devisable. The statute <em>de donis </em>divided the estate, which was before entire in the grantee subject to a condition in law; and according to the old doctrine, this possibility, or condition, was not grantable, or devisable. I do not know that this doctrine has been overruled in the point, that it has been'directly held a condition in law or in fact is devisable, that there is a reasonable ground for a distinction between a condition in law and in fact, as to this matter, nor do I clearly perceive why, if after the creation of a conditional fee, the reverter or condition in law is grantable, or devisable, such reverter or condition may not be granted at the very time of creating the conditional fee, nor why, if a condition in fact be grantable, or devisable after the creation of an estate in fee, subject to such condition, such condition may not be limited to <em>C. </em>upon a grant of <em>A. </em>to <em>B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">The case of <em>The Earl of Stafford </em>v. Buckley, in 2 <em>Ves. Rep. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>seems to me to be very strong in favour of the first point, that the tonnage is not entailable ; and <em>Lord Hardwicke </em>in this case seems also to have allowed the old doctrine respecting conditional fees and reverters ; but if the Judges were of opinion, in the case of <em>Selwyn </em>v. Selwyn, in 2 Burr. as the reporter (and I suppose upon proper grounds) has in* timated, that a voidable contingent executory use to arise out of a subsequent recover}-, was devisable, the reason and principle of this opinion may be of extensive application, nor shall I venture to suggest my opinion upon the point whether the reverter or condition ia law was devisable or not; but if it was not devisable, then I conceive it became extinct upon the descent of the condition to <em>Lord </em>Frederick, and he therefore had upon the matter an absolute fee-simple which he might dispose of as he did. If, however, the. tonnage belongs to Mrs. <em>Browning </em>under the devise to her of the reverter or condition in law, it is to b\u00a9 considered, in respect of the charge in favour of Mrs. Eden, that the charge was laid upon the whole subject, that <em>Lord Charles </em>intended a greater profit to his elder than to his younger daughter, and that the 20,000/. was more beneficial than half the value of the tonnage. Indeed, as to the value of the whole subject intended to be devised by <em>IFrd </em>Charles, it is very great. The revenue for the support of government, fines, forfeitures, appointment to offices, presentations to forty-four livings, caution money for vacant lands, quit-rents, fines of a year\u2019s rent upon every alienation, escheats, manors, (as they are called,) reserved lands, as well as the tonnage, constitute the subject intended to be devised to Mrs. Browning, a subject which, I think, if purchased at the price of 400,000/. sterling, would be purchased at a very moderate rate <em>; </em>and it would seem to carry the fiction of a recompense beyond the supposition, there being no possibility of a recompense, as there is no instance of a similar estate or subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-2\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>\n<em>Letter to John Hall, Esq, ,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\">Sir,</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Mr. <em>Hamersley, </em>in his letter of the 29th last <em>July, </em>received by the last post via <em>Nexo-Tork, </em>desires, in the special verdict in the cause of <em>Calvert </em>v. <em>Tenants of Anne Arundel </em>Ma\u00bb <em>\u00f1or, </em>that the charter and all the subsequent settlements, and the deed of 1761, may be found \u00bfra <em>hcec verba; </em>that it may also be found that the statutes <em>de </em>donis, uses, wills, and limitations have been adopted and received as laws in <em>Maryland, </em>and that the particular circumstances of Mr. <em>Calvert's </em>acquiescence, and the sales and improvements, See. be also found.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">I infer from the above, that it is considered to be a point Of great importance to have the adoption of the above statutes expressly found, and therefore you will be pleased to consider whether it may not also be proper to find that the titles to a considerable share of real property in <em>Maryland </em>are held and secured under this adoption. As the statute <em>de donis </em>is to be thus found, it seems necessaiy to have the practice of barring entails by common recovery also found.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">With the above view it may be necessary to find the 'Judges\u2019 oath, and also the acts of assembly relative to common recoveries, of which there are two or three, particularly the act to aid defective recoveries, and the act of the last session, concerning estates-tail, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In finding the recovery suffered by the late lord of the manor, it is to be considered whether our peculiar practice should not be found; for it differs not a little from the practice in <em>England, </em>I mean with respect particularly to the manner of appearing under a letter of attorney for an absent vouchee ; for in my practice I never knew a summons <em>ad </em>warrmtizandum. I don\u2019t remember whether there was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>particular power given in the case to Mr. <em>Goldsborough, </em>to appear for <em>Lord Baltimore, </em>or whether he appeared in virtue of his office as attorney-general. Whatever power he acted under it seems should be found. It seems also very proper to find the death of <em>Lady Baltimore, </em>on whose marriage the settlements were made, without issue, and also the. death of <em>Ccecilius Calvert </em>without issue, before any steps taken to dispose of the manor; for by7 these events there was an end of the trusts respecting the above persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The name \u201c Manor,\u201d perhaps, may mislead, if not explained and shewn to be merely descriptive, as black acre or white acre.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">I do not understand what Mr. <em>Hamersley </em>means by the expressions \u201cthe particular circumstances of Mr. <em>Calvert\u2019s </em>acquiescence,\u201d unless he means what is alluded to in one of his former letters to me, in respect of a letter written by Mr. <em>Calvert </em>to the late lord, in which it is said he seemed to give up his pretensions, and applied to his lordship\u2019s bounty. If this be the meaning, there is no legal evidence of the fact here.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">It seems rather odd to find laws in a verdict, but as the cause will be finally determined in England., it may be thought proper for the information of the king and council. It seems it is the practice in other colonies, and I find many instances in which it was done here, by the note books of my father, when appeals home were expected, which were more common heretofore than of late times.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">As to finding the charter <em>in hcec verba, </em>that will hardly be practicable ; for it is in abbreviated <em>Latin, </em>and therefore the substance of it can only be found, having particular regard to that part of it which enables the proprietary to grant in fee, in tail, 8cc.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">Having understood that you have undertaken to draw up the notes for a special verdict, I have taken the liberty to send you the above extract from Mr. <em>Samersky\u2019s </em>letter, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>the addition of a few other hints for your consideration, and am, siy, &amp;c.-</p>\n<p id=\"Aqe\">DANIEL.

The charter bears date on the 20th day of <em>June, </em>in the 8th year of <em>Charles </em>I. <em>Anno Domini, </em>1633. The clauses of that charter necessary to be taken notice of at present, are the 18th and 19th sections. By the 18th section, the lord proprietary has full power and license given him from time to time, at his pleasure, to assign, alien, grant, demise or enfeoff, so many, such and proportionate parts or parcels of the premises, to any person or persons willing to purchase the same, as he shall think convenient, to hold in fee, fee-tail, term of life, or years, under such rents and services as shall seem fit and agreeable, notwithstanding the statute of <em>quia emptores. </em>The 19th section gives license to the same baron of <em>Baltimore </em>and his heirs, to erect any parcels of land within the province aforesaid into manors, and in every of those manors to hold a Court Baron, and all things which to a Court Baron do belong, with view of frank-pledge, &amp;c. Under the power or license given in this last section, particular tracts of land have been laid out in some way of other, probably by instructions given to the Judges of the land-office, and have been known and called by the name of manors. How they were erected does not appear to me, nor did I ever know or hear of Courts being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>held under the name of Courts Baron, or under any other name particularly for those manors. In virtue of the powers contained in these sections, however, leases have been given, from time to time, for lands, parcel of the manors, generally for term of life or years ; and <em>Anne Arundel Manor </em>has been, I believe, almost entirely leased out. Whether with covenants to renew or not, does not appear to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The next title paper that appears to me is a family settles ment of the province of <em>Maryland, </em>made on the 31st day of <em>December, </em>1698, between <em>Charles Lord Baltimore </em>and his eldest son and heir apparent, <em>Benedict, </em>of the one part, the Earl of <em>Lchfield </em>and his dau ghter, <em>Charlotte </em>Lee, of the second part, and the Dukeof <em>ATorthum her land </em>and other trus\" tees, of the third part, on the marriage of <em>Benedict </em>with <em>Lady Charlotte Lee, </em>at a time when the government was in the hands of the crown. By this settlement, the province of <em>Maryland, </em>amongst other things, is conveyed by the name of all the country, province, and islands in <em>America, </em>commonly called <em>Maryland, </em>to the uses following, viz. to the use of <em>Charles Calvert </em>during his life, without impeachment; of waste; remainder to <em>Benedict Calvert </em>for life, in the same manner; remainder to trustees to preserve contiru gent remainders ; remainder to the first, second, and other sons of <em>Benedict, </em>on the body of <em>Lady Charlotte </em>begotten, in. Sail male, with other remainders relative to jointure, &amp;c. with proviso that it ^should be lawful for <em>Charles </em>or <em>Benedict Calvert </em>to grant in fee unimproved lands; to lease manors for twenty-one years, or one, two or three lives; rever-, sion in fee to <em>Charles Calvert. Benedict </em>had issue, as the fact is stated, by <em>Lady Charlotte, </em>four sons, <em>Charles, BenedictK Edward </em>and <em>Ccecilius ; </em>the three last died without issue. In 1716 the government was restored to <em>Charles, </em>the grandson of <em>Charles l,ord </em>Baltimore, who appears at that time to have-been in his minority. He lived to old age, (dying in the year 17.71,) and was succeeded by the present <em>I.ord Baltimore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">To the year 1730, <em>Charles, </em>late <em>7.ord Baltimore, </em>on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>marriage with <em>Mary, </em>the youngest daughter of Sir <em>Thee* dore </em>Jansen, likewise made a settlement of the province of Maryland, amongst other things, by which the uses are limit\u00aed to himself for life, without impeachment of waste 5 remainder to trustees to preserve contingent remainders; clauses to secure jointure ; remainder to the first and every other son of the marriage in tail male; reversion to himself in fee. <em>Charles </em>had issue by his wife <em>Mary, </em>one son, <em>Frederick, </em>and two' daughters, <em>Louisa </em>and Caroline. On the 17th day of <em>November, </em>in the year 1750, <em>Charles </em>late <em>Lord </em>Baltimore, made his last will and testament, and amongst other devises therein contained, devi\u00e1ed <em>Ann Arundel Manor </em>to <em>Benjamin </em>Calvert, Esq. his heirs and assigns ; under which <em>Benedict Calvert, </em>Esq. of <em>Prince George\u2019s </em>county -Claims title.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><em>Frederick, </em>the present <em>Lord Baltimore, </em>in the year 1753, likewise entered into articles for the settlement of the province of <em>Maryland, </em>on his marriage with <em>Diana </em>Egerton, one of the daughters of <em>Scroop Egerton, </em>late Duke of <em>Bridge-water, </em>deceased, in which the said marriage is recited as a matter in prospect. The former entails are recited. The terms on which the marriage was proposed to be held are also set forth. And then it is recited, that it was apprehended no plea could be held in the Courts of <em>Westminster </em>concerning the said province, for that the remedial writs of our lord the king do not run into the plantations or other parts beyond the seas. And it is also apprehended that the several Courts established in the same province or territory, under the authority of \u00abhe <em>said-Frederick Lord Baltimore, </em>as lord or proprietor of that territory, for the determining suits between the tenants or inhabitants of the said province, cannot hold plea.concerning the property or ownership of the said province, in cast: of any controversy concerning the same, the cognisance of such questions being conceived to belong to the king\u2019s majesty, of whom, as superior lord, the said <em>Frederick Lord Baltimore </em>doth hold the said province as a feudatory tenant, by the rents and services ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>pressed in the charter or letters patent herein before mentioned. And whereas it will be necessary that the said <em>Frederick Lord </em>Baltimore, to be enabled to settle, convey, and assure the said province, lordship, or territory, in the manner proposed in the course of the said treaty, should acquire to himself, and be seised of a full and indefeasible estate in fee-simple, of and in the said province, lordship, or territory of <em>Maryland; </em>but though the estate and interest which he hath in the said province, is in nature o\u00ed aa estate of inheritance in tail male, and it is conceived to be incident and belonging to every such estate to be barrable by a common recovery, and the said <em>Fredsrick Lord </em>Haiti-<em>more </em>would be qualified to suffer such recovery, and thereby to bar such estate-tail, did the said territory or district of land lie in <em>England; </em>yet by reason that it is apprehended that there doth not exist any Court or jurisdiction before which any proceedings in nature of a common recovery for or concerning the said province or territory can be carried on or prosecuted, the said <em>Frederick Lord Baltimore </em>is wholly disabled to bar or dock the said estate-tail, and therefore cannot acquire the fee-simple of the said province to himself. And whereas there is great reason to expect that if the several matters aforesaid are in a dutiful manner represented to his majesty, he will be graciously pleased to give leave that an application be made to the parliament for the aid of the legislature iO enable the said <em>Frederick Lord Baltimore </em>to execute such deed, or do some such solemn act as may be enacted, and declared to be equivalent to, and tuve the force of, a common recovery, and may so operate as to vest an indefeasible estate of inheritance in fee-simple, freed and discharged from all entails, and ail remainders and reversions expectant, &amp;c. Therefore proper covenants are to be entered into, to oblige <em>Lord Baltimore </em>to lay a most dutiful representation upon the matter aioresaid be tore his majesty, to petition for leave to apply to parliament for an act to enable him to bar said entails so subsisting, -and to use his utmost endeavours that such act may be obtained. <em>Cmcilius </em>Calvert, heir in tail,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>engages to join in the application for an act of parliament This settlement contains a great variety of other clauses not material to the point under consideration, and the less wor thy of notice, because, although the marriage took effect, the <em>Lady Baltimore </em>is since dead without issue. Whether any application was ever made to parliament or not, does not appear to me. I find a deed of settlement amongst the council records, by lease and release, leased 30th day of <em>Janua</em>ry., 1761, between <em>Frederick Lord Baltimore </em>and his uncle <em>Ccecilius, </em>deceased, of the one part, and the honourable <em>Thomas Bennett, </em>Earl of <em>Tankeroille, </em>and <em>William Sharpe, </em>Esq. one of the clerks of the privy council, of the other part, for one year,, in common form, to ground release on: the release dated the 31st of the same month, by way of indenture <em>tripartite, </em>between <em>Frederick Lord Baltimore of </em>the one part, the honourable <em>Ccecilius Calvert, </em>uncle, &amp;c. of the se - cond part, and the earl &lt; f <em>Tankerville </em>and <em>William </em>Sharpe, Esq. of the third part, recites a marriage agreement in <em>March, </em>1753, to secure the payment of 800/. <em>per annum </em>to the baroness dowager of <em>Baltimore, </em>ten thousand pounds for the portions of <em>Louisa </em>and <em>Caroline Calvert, </em>and two thousand a year to <em>Lady Diana Egerton; </em>province of <em>Maryland </em>to be settled and assured, &amp;c. on <em>Lord Baltimore </em>for life, with divers remainders. It recites that the said marriage did take effect in pursuance of the said recited indenture, and in performance of such covenants and agreements as are now, and remain to be executed, and for docking, barring, and extinguishing all estates-tail, and all remainders and reversions, and all other estates of and in the said province, lordship, &amp;c. called <em>Maryland, </em>and for settling and assuring the same to the several uses and trusts after ex - pressed, and in consideration of ten shillings sterling, <em>Frederick Lord Baltimore </em>and <em>Ccecilius Calvert </em>convey said province to the trustees aforesaid and their heirs, to hold to the use of <em>Frederick Lord Baltimore, </em>during his natural life, without impeachment of waste, and with power to commit waste; remainder to trustees to preserve contingent re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>unainders; remainder to the first, second, and every other son of <em>Ccecilius </em>Calvert, in tail male; remainder to the use o* such person and persons, and for such estates as <em>Lord Bal</em>timare, by deed executed in presence of two witnesses, or by his last will shall limit and appoint; remainder, in case of no such appointment, to the use of such persons and for such estates as the reversion of the same premises now stands limited to, and devised by, the last will and testament of <em>Charles Lord </em>Baltimore, deceased.

The lease bears date the 7th of April, 1767, for one year, in common form. The <em>release </em>bears date the 18th day of the same month, <em>tripartite </em>between the lord proprietary of the first part, the Reverend <em>Bennett Allen, </em>of the second part, and the honourable <em>Walter </em>Dulany, Esq. of the third part; recites the former entails, 1698 and 1730; recites a former conveyance made by <em>Lord Baltimore </em>and <em>Ccecilius </em>Calvert, to the honourable <em>Thomas Bennett </em>and <em>William </em>Sharpe, Esq. of th, province of <em>Maryland, </em>dated the 30th and 31st days of January, 1761, enrolled in the chancery of <em>England, </em>and recorded in <em>Maryland, </em>but does not set out the use in said deed contained and limited; recites the instructions dated in <em>February </em>and <em>November, </em>1766, to his excellency <em>11, ratio </em>Sharpe, Esq. the honourable <em>Daniel </em>Dulany, and <em>John Morion </em>Jordon, Esq\u2019rs. for sell ng the manors, and that they had made considerable progress therein; recites that the former entail, subsisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>upon the entire province, had been already effectually barred and destroyed by the deeds in 1761, and that the said <em>Lord Baltimore </em>had acquired an indefeasible estate in fee by the said deed, according to the usage in like cases, (there being no other established method for barring entails upon the entirety of the said province, and other the premises,) yet in regard to the subsequent limitations and dispositions, created and made by the said last recited indentures, and for facilitating the sale of the manors, &amp;c., the scheme of the deed is to make <em>Walter </em>Dulany, demandant, <em>Bennett </em>Allen, tenant to the <em>prcecipe ; </em>the <em>Lord Baltimore to </em>come in either personally or by attorney, as vouchee, and to vouch over the common vouchee ; the parties to stand seised to the use of the <em>Lord Baltimore </em>in fee, with an express proviso, that nothing in that deed should frustrate or destroy, or in any manner derogate from, or invalidate, impeach, prejudice, oraffect the said recited deeds of lease and release, dated in January, 1761, but that the same should stand in full force and vigour as to the entire province and the whole territory called Maryland, <em>(Anne Arundel </em>and other manors only excepted.) There is a power of attorney also, or writing purporting to be a power of attorney, from <em>Lord </em>Baltimore, dated the 8th of April, 1767, to the Honourable--Goldsborough, Esq. attorney-general of the said province, or any other attorney-general of the sarpe province, to appear, and in the name and behalf of the said <em>Lord </em>Baltimore, to enter into warranty and vouch over common vouchee. Executed before <em>Hugh Hamersley </em>and <em>Giles </em>Hitchcock, and proved by <em>Hitchcock </em>before the mayor of <em>London. </em>In consequence of this deed to make a tenant to the prcecipe, at an adjourned Provincial Court in the month of <em>July </em>last past, a writ of entry <em>sur disseisin </em>was issued out in the name of <em>Frederick Lord Baltimore </em>to the Sheriff of <em>Anne Arundel </em>county, <em>Walter </em>Dulany, demandant, <em>Bennett </em>Aden, tenant, of all that tract or parcel of land called <em>Anne Arundel </em>Manor, &amp;c.; bearing date the 1st day of April, in the 17th year of the dominion. Declaration in common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>form. <em>Walter </em>Dulamj, demandant, recovers against <em>Bennett Alien, </em>he over against the lord proprietary, and the lord proprietary against <em>William </em>Rawhns, the common vouchee. Writ of seisin is prayed returnable to the third <em>Tuesday </em>in <em>October </em>next, and I presume has been issued, but cannot be as yet returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">I have been thus circumstantial in stating the facts on which my opinion is founded, because every gentleman interested mav have an opportunity of considering them and judging for himself. Proper allowance, I doubt not, will be made for the short time I have had to consider an affair \u2022of so great extent. The charter to the first lord proprietary gives him an estate in fee-simple with ample powers. Those that immediately relate to this matter may be seen in the 18th and <em>19th </em>sections of the charter printed in <em>Bacon\u2019s </em>laws. The settlement made by the first <em>Charles Lord Baltimore </em>in 1698, is in my opinion'of sufficient force and validity to work an alteration of that estate, and without saying any thing of the settlement made by the late <em>Lord Baltimore, </em>in 1730, I look upon it that Frederick, the present lord proprietary, at the time of his coming to the government upon the decease of his father, was seised of an estate in tail male under the deeds made by his great grandfather. And I do not think the father of the present <em>Lord Baltimore </em>had power by testament to devise <em>Anne Arundel Manor, </em>or any other part of the province, to any person whatever, to take effect otherwise than upon the death of the present <em>Lord Baltimore </em>without issue male, and without exercising that power which 1 think he has of docking the entail. But should no other steps be taken than what have been already, I doubt much whether the entail would be barred. There are some very strong recitals in the marriage articles, with regard to the manner in which the entail ought <em>to </em>be <em>docked; </em>jt appears clearly from those recitals to be the opinion of gentlemen in <em>England, </em>and even of <em>Lord Baltimore </em>himself, that the entail on the entire province could not be barred but <em>by </em>act of parliament. No process from the Courts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>Westminster </em>would reach us, and the Courts in this province are looked upon not to have competent jurisdiction so as that the loid proprietary would bar the entail on the entire province j if so, how can he be vouched for the most valuable part of it, or where must he stop ? I am not clear in this point the one way or the other. It has been the prevailing doctrine here that the lord proprietary, like the king at home, cannot be disseised, and the proceeding in common recovery is grounded upon a disseisin, and although he comes in as vouchee, yet I do not know what consequences might be deduced from this doctrine, where it appears from the deeds to lead to the uses, and from the whole complexion of the affair, that the lord proprietary is the real person concerned, and that the intention of the recovery is to gain him an estate in fee. Adversary suits are brought in the Courts of Justice within this province, where the lord proprietary is plaintiff, and every day\u2019s experience shows that such suits may be maintained; but I never knew an action where he was defendant. The common method of trying title, where the lord proprietary is concerned, is to bring ejectments against his tenants, and then the Courts hold plea. What ought to be the opinion of Judges in <em>England,, </em>in case the dispute were carried thither <em>by </em>appeal, is uncertain. Recitals demonsit ate what opinion has been already formed. And, therefore, I much admire no steps were ever taken to procure an act of parliament which would have put a short end to ail controversy about it, more especially as this seems to have been a matter in contemplation at the time of the marriage articles in 1753. Another objection appears to me considerable; how can it consist with the settlement in the year 176\u00cd, in which <em>Lord Baltimore </em>and <em>Cwcilius Calvert </em>both joined to the Earl of <em>Tankerville </em>and <em>William </em>Sharpe, Esq. that the <em>Lord Baltimore </em>should have an estate sufficient to make a tenant to the <em>prcecipe </em>without the trustees or the survivor of them joining in the deed. The settlement, though it cannot in my opinion operate so as to extinguish the estate-tail on the entire province, has certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>tested the legal estate in trustees to the uses therein mentioned. The lord proprietary is tenant for life with divers remainders over, one of which is to the use of such persons and for such estates as the reversion of the same premises now stands limited to and devised <em>by </em>the last will and testament uf <em>Charles Lord Baltimore, </em>deceased, under which, I take it, the devise to Mr. <em>Calvert </em>is included. If it could be supposed not necessary for the trustees to join, what is there to prevent <em>Lord Baltimore </em>from defeating that whole settlement without their consent; for if he can gain a fee in the manors without them, by the same parity of reason he may gain a fee in all the rest of the province without them, and to what purpose would be those deeds ?</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Another objection appears to me to have great weight, and is quite apparent to any one that knows the method of proceeding in recoveries. Where they are suffered in this province, and if we can trust to our law books, in the island of <em>Great Britain, </em>by power of attorney, the same must be taken by one of the Judges of the Court; or by <em>dedimus </em>.\u2022 our practice is so, and evils might follow not easy to guard against were it otherwise. Where a Judge of the Court does not take the power of attorney, the course is to issue a writ of entry and send <em>dedimus </em>to take acknowledgment of deeds and powers of attorney, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Upon the whole I am of opinion that it is unsafe to purchase under the title as it stands at present. It is not certain what would be the opinion of Judges in England, with regard to the Courts in this province having competent jurisdiction, were the matter carried thither by appeal. It would have been much better that the trustees had joined in the deeds to make a tenant to the <em>prcccipe, </em>for if this be not necessary, the consequence will follow that the whole settlement in 1761 may be defeated without their consent. If there were no doubts upon either of these points, as I do think there are, yet the power of attorney is utterly new and irregular, and ought to have been taken by dedimus. There is one thing that satisfies me how little regard is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>be paid to some parts of the deed to make a tenant: after reciting the settlement of 1761, the deed asserts that <em>Lord Baltimore </em>had thereby acquired an indefeasible estate in fee according to the usage in like cases. There is no usage, I believe, that can be pointed out to bar entails by a simple deed recorded in the Chancery, and what follows just after in a parenthesis is very remarkable (there being no other established method for barring entails upon the entirety of the said province and other the premises.) These are my sentiments upon the occasion. It is with reluctance I have given any opinion. I cannot conclude without observing that many of these settlements, particularly those in 1698 and 1730, are entirely in the custody or power of the <em>Baltimore </em>family, and certainly attested copies of them ought to be sent over and recorded here for the safety of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The lord proprietary no doubt would be bound by his warranty, but after his death the heirs would not be bound without assets in fee descended, and the whole family estate seems to be entailed. And this further inconvenience would attend the purchasers in cases of eviction : they must follow the lord proprietary or his heirs into the Courts of Justice in <em>England, </em>where they reside.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">J.
