By the bill it appears that <em>fames </em>Weems, being possessed of a very considerable personal estate, consisting of slaves, stock, ready money, Continental and State of <em>Maryland </em>loan-office certificates, bills of exchange, plate, and other articles, duly made and published his last will and testament in writing, bearing date the 14th of November, 177S, by which will the testator made divers dispositions of certain parts of his personal estate, and provided for the payment of his funeral expenses, his debts that might be justly due, and the legacies therein, given out of a certain fund, by the will appropriated for that purpose, and appointed and constituted his son <em>folm </em>his executor. That the testator died in or about the month of September, 1781, without altering or revo-; king the said will. That the said executor proved the will, -and possessed himself of the whole personal property of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the testator. That at the time of the death of the testator, there were debts due and owing to him by bonds, &amp;c. to a large amount, which the executor had received. <em>That the said testator by his said will did not make any disposition or bequest of his plate, ready money, and loan-office certificates, of which he teas possessed in his lifetime and at his death, nor of the debts due to him, or of any part thereof nor did he by his said will subject them to the payment of his funeral </em>expenses, <em>debts or legacies ; but as to the same, the said testator died intestate. </em>That the said testator left three sons, viz. <em>fohn, William, L. </em>and <em>fames, </em>(the appellees,) and one daughter, <em>Margaret, </em>who intermarried with <em>foseph Sprigg, </em>.(one of the appellants,') that she is since dead, and letters of administration on her estate had been' granted to the said <em>Sprigg. </em>That <em>Sarah, </em>the wife of <em>William Allien, Anne, </em>the wife of <em>Daniel Kent, </em>Elizabeth, the wife of <em>Levin Ballard, </em>and <em>Mary Bond, </em>(also appellees,) ate the children of <em>Roger Wheeler </em>and <em>Susanna </em>his wife, which, said <em>Susanna </em>was also a daughter of the said testator, and died during his life-time. That <em>Samuel Chew </em>(another of the appellees) is the only child of <em>Samuel Chew </em>and <em>Sarah </em>his wife, and which said <em>Sarah </em>was another of the daughters of the said testator, and died in his life-time. That the said testator left no other children or grandchildren, but those above mentioned. That they claimed a distribution, each of one sixth part of the moneys, plate and certificates, of which the testator was possessed as aforesaid, and of all the debts due to him,, and moneys received by the executor. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-7\">The answers of the appellees admitted the facts stated in the bill, except that they denied, that the testator, by his will, did duly dispose of his plate, money, loan-office certificates and debts, and contended, that he did not die intestate with respect to any part of his real or personal estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-8\">The will of the testator, which is exhibited, recite?. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>that being in perfect health, and of sound mind and memory, makes his last will and testament, \u201c directing in what manner the real and personal estate which Almighty God has bestowed upon me, shall be distributed after my decease.\u201d ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-4\">He then devises all his real estate, and recites, that he had advanced for his daughter <em>Susanna, </em>on her intermarriage with <em>Roger </em>Wheeler, <em>a full share of his personal estate, adds </em>400/. <em>to be divided among his four daughters, to be kept and given to their children, when married, or of </em>age.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-5\">He then recites,, that lie had advanced handsomely for his daughter Sarah, on her intermarriage with <em>Samuel Chew ; </em>yet to induce him to make an adequate provision for her son, he gives the son 1,000/. <em>certificates in the continental treasury, the interest to be added to the principal, </em>and paid when he arrives of age.

The Court cannot make a will, or give an arbitrary construction to it. 2 <em>Burr. </em>771. Great inconveniences have arisen by departing from strict words, from the incertainty it produces. 2 <em>Atk. 577. </em>An heir at law is not to be disinherited, unless by express words, or necessary implication. 3 <em>Atk. </em>10. The Court would not infringe the rule in favour of younger children, who claimed it as a provision. An heir ought not to be disinherited by doubtful words. 2 <em>P.Wms. </em>393. It must be a necessary, and not a possible, implication; for the heir\u2019s title being plain and obvious, shall not be impeached by construction. 2 <em>Bac. </em>66. 81. <em>Gilb.

By the statute of distribution, the succession to the personal estate is as much settled and fixed in the next of kin, (when it is not disposed of by \u00a1the will,) as by the common law the title to the real estate is fixed in the heir at law, if not given away by .the will. 1 <em>P. Wms. </em>554. According to the rule in favour of the\u2019heir at law, by a parity of reason; indeed with' more reason may the position be made, the representatives of the deceased shall not be excluded or deprived of their distributive shares, unless by <em>express </em>words, or <em>necessary </em>implication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The law which prefers the heir at law, or the eldest son, in exclusion of the other children, is founded in policy only, and hot supported by justice, nor does it coincide with the feelings of humanity. The statute of distribution has established a reasonable and equitable rule, and does what a good and just parent would do. It makes an equal provision for all his children. 2 <em>P. </em>Wms. 439,440. From whence I conclude there is more reason to apply the said rule in favour of the r epresentatives of the deceased, and to determine they shall not be excluded, but by express words or necessary implication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-7\">A chattel shall not be taken from an executor, unless by express words or necessary implication. 2 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>66. The ground of the rule is, that the heir at law has a presumptive title cast on him by the law. This right cannot be destroyed, but by express words or necessary implication. There is the same ground for the rule in the case of the next of kin; they have a presumptive right to the personal estate, thrown on them by the statute of distribution. This right cannot be defeated but by express words or necessary implication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-9\">It will be contended, it was the intention of the testator to dispose of all his estate, and that he did not intend his daughters should have any part of his estate, but what he had expressly given them ; and this intention is to be inferred from coupling the preamble with the last clause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-10\">The preamble has no weight where the dispute is, whether the subject is disposed of or not. It is nothing more than words of form, thrown in by drawers of wills. 3 <em>Atk. </em>226. 231. <em>Cowp. 657. </em>660. 2 <em>Atk. </em>3 <em>Atk. </em>61. 2 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>890, 891.

But the Court would not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>trol the rule of law,' without words expressive of such intention. <em>Cowp. </em>659, 660.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-7\">Suppose the testator intended to make a disposition of his whole estate, it does not follow he meant the devisees should have it. The Judge being satisfied in his private opinion, will not do, for he must view it with judicial eyes. Intention, without operative words, will not do. <em>Vide </em>2 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>889. 891.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-8\">As to the clause \u201c all the remaining part of my personal estate, viz.\u201d &amp;c. the plain intention was, to pass only such things as were the proper objects of appraisement and sale. This is evident from the specification of particular things, all of which were the objects of sale. It is plain from the nature of the disposition. Those things were to be sold and the money to be invested in certificates. They made a fund for the payment of debts, legacies, and funeral expenses, and the sum which should remain, was given for the benefit of his sons\u2019 children. This plainly means, <em>that part </em>of the money arising from the things to be sold which should remain after paying-debts, &amp;c. the plate expressly excepted. Although his whole personal estate was the proper fund for paying-debts, the testator could subject a part in exemption of the rest. He could have exempted the whole and subjected his land. The things directed to be sold were perishable, and the keeping of them would burthen the estate with a useless expense. He could not intend his <em>certificates, debts </em>and <em>ready money </em>should be sold, because they were not proper objects of sale, and because the money arising therefrom was to be laid out in the purchase of <em>certificates, </em>therefore such intention would be most absurd.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-9\">In common parlance, and according to the general idea, personal estate extends to, and comprehends, such things only as are the proper objects of appraisement and sale. Debts, bonds and ready money, are not in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>eluded in the idea of personal estate. And such was 1 the testator\u2019s idea of personal estate. We cannot have a better exposition of his meaning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqt\">The enumeration of somethings is an exclusion of all \u00b0 , others. Nothing can be comprehended under theu \u00a3s?c.\u201d but things of the <em>like </em>nature with those specified, and such as are the proper objects of an appraisement and sale. The \u201c <em>viz.\u201d </em>was inserted for the purpose of explaining, in a more precise and certain manner, what was intended; and the \u201c <em>&amp;c.\u201d </em>must be confined to things of a similar nature with those enumerated. <em>A. </em>devised to his niece all his goods, chattels, household stuff, furniture and <em>other things. </em>By the words \u201c other things,\u201d nothing shall be intended but things of the like nature with those mentioned; and <em>ready money </em>will not pass. 2 <em>Bac.

Although the general words, \u201c <em>-whatever </em>I have, or <em>shall </em>have, at my death,\u201d would have passed notes and bank bills, yet the particular words which follow, as plate, jewels, &amp;c. restrain them to things of the same nature. 2 <em>Atk. </em>104. 2 <em>Bac.

To effectuate this intent, every word in the will is to have a construction, if you can give it one. 1 <em>P. Wms. </em>232. 652. 599. <em>Burr. </em>1540. 3 <em>Atk. </em>409, 1 <em>Fez. </em>106. 255. But if the intent appears, and you cannot otherwise give it effect, and carry it into execution, the Court may transpose sentences $ may insert them, or strike out those that are inserted. 1 <em>Vez. </em>15. 2 <em>Fez. </em>279; <em>Co.

The single question, therefore, on this occasion is, <em>what was the intent of the testator P </em>and that, I contend, clearly appears on the face of this will, without transposing, striking out, or adding one word to it. 3 <em>Wils, </em>141. 2 <em>Wils. 323. </em>1 <em>Wils. </em>166. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>2 <em>Burr. </em>770. 3 <em>Burr. </em>1541, 1542. 1622. 2 <em>Atk. </em>113. Where there are two intents, the greatest shall prevail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ami\">Mr. Weems, a man of sense, makes his will professedIy to direct how his -whole real and personal property should be inherited after his decease ; yet after particularly considering the situation of all his children, and even grandchildren; after going into calculations of what he had given them respectively before, and the expense of raising and maintaining the children of one who had died; yet the complainants would put such construction on this will, as to show the testator had forgot the most considerable part of his personal estate, and made no provision respecting it. No man of plain understanding, who is not a lawyer, can read this will and retain such ideas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-5\">Mr. <em>Cooke </em>then examined and compared the particular clauses, and said, that although every case on the construction of wills must stand on its own bottom, yet the Courts have laid down some general rules for construction, where the intention of the testator is not so clearly expressed, as to make it unnecessary to resort to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-6\">Every word is to have a construction, and none to be rejected if it can have effect j for, as the intent is to be collected <em>from the </em>words, it would be making a will, instead of construing it, to reject the words of the testator, if they can have operation. 2 <em>P. Wms. </em>282. 3 <em>Atk. </em>233. The introductory and residuary clauses would have no effect, if there was an intestacy as to any part of this estate. 2 <em>Vez. 179. 3 Burr. </em>1623. 1 <em>Wils. </em>334. 3 <em>Wils. </em>141. <em>1 Atk. 433.

So where there was a' devise of <em>5001. </em>and afterwards all his goods and chattels at <em>Normanton. </em>A sum of 400/. that was in the house at his death did not pass, because the Court said, if he intended it, he might have as well added it in the first instance. 2 <em>Ch.

This is a question of construction. Shall the will be so construed as to make the testator die intestate of the greater part of his personal estate ? As to the rule that the heir shall not be disinherited without express words, there is no case to support it as to personal property. The reason of the rule is, that the heir at law under the feodal system, is burthened with many services to the lord. There are only-two cases where the intent of the testator shall not prevail as to personal <em>property; </em>1st. Where the testator says his personal property shall descend in the same manner as his real estate ; 2d. Where there is a limitation over upon a remote contingency. The preamble indicates an intention to dispose of the whole of his real and personal estate. That such was his intention is plain beyond construction. The rules of construction, as to real and personal devises, are different. As to construction from intent, -and that intent taken among other parts from the preamble. 1 <em>Atk. </em>416. 3 <em>Wils. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>197. 3 <em>Burr. </em>1621. 1625. 1 <em>Atk. </em>433. 3 <em>Atk. </em>785. 1 <em>P.

The testator, by devising in such particular expressions to the children of <em>Roger </em>Wheeler, to the son of Mr. <em>Chew </em>and Mrs, <em>Elzey, </em>plainly denotes he intended they should have no more. He is careful to provide, that the son of Mr. <em>Chew </em>if he died under age, should not convey his legacy to his representatives, as he is careful in such case to limit it over, to be considered as part of his estate. But by the complainants\u2019 construction, this residue, of so much more consequence than the other part of the estate, would go entirely out of the family. . It was his intention, therefore, that neither the son of Mr. Chew, the children of Wheeler, or the children of his son, should have any power over any part of his estate, till they came of age, or married; and yet by the complainants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>construction, they would take the residue immediately on his death, and might dispose of it m any manner they thought proper- A devise of horses, cattle, ike. would not Pass houshold furniture, or plantation utensils, because not <em>ejusdem generis. </em>But it was intended they Should be sold in this case, because, after giving away those articles, the plantation utensils would be of no use.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-5\">Chase, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apz\">The intent of the testator is to prevail, if it is consistent with the rules of law.
