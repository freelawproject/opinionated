To remedy which it was enacted in 32 <em>Hen* </em>VIII. c. 34. that all grantees of reversion shall have and enjoy like advantages against the lessees, their executors or assigns, by entry for non-payment of rent, waste, of other forfeiture, that the grantors or lessors had; but shall have remedy by action only for non-performance of other conditions, covenants, &amp;c. expressed in the indenture of their lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-5\">In our researches we find it laid down by different reporters, as the law of the land, that the contract for the payment of rent is a real contract, follows and waits on the land, and makes the land the debtor; but for collateral covenants, such as to pay a premium, sum in gross, build houses, mills, 8cc. the grantee of the reversion may have his action against the lessee, his assignee, or either of them; but an action of covenant for the payment of rent must be maintained on the privity of estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-6\">The counsel for the plaintiff, in the case before the court, have said much in support of what they call a second independent or express covenant. We cannot take this second or express covenant, as they call it, in any point of light different from the first: it is for rent. The first clause <em>says, yielding and paying, &amp;c. yearly and every year, the yearly rent or sum of, </em>c\u00ede. The latter covenant expresses <em>that he shall pay, &amp;c. the said yearly rent or sum of, </em>&amp;V. <em>in such manner andform as the same is herein before reserved and made payable, &amp;c. </em>It is not only rent, it is a re\u00bb servation of the same rent as expressed in the first clause, and grounded on the same considerations. It is a real contract, and will follow the estate; and we are of opinion that by the law of the land, an action of covenant for the payment of rent must be maintained on the privity of estate:\u201d wherefore the pleas are good, and sufficient to bar the plaintiff\u2019s recovery.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Arct\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Cooke, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1p\">in the General Court. This was an action of covenant, brought by the plaintiff against the defendant in the County Court of Baltimore, for the recovery of 20/. 11s. sterling, for one year\u2019s rent due the first of April, 1786, on the express covenant in a lease made by <em>Richard </em>Moaie, deceased, who by his will devised his real estate to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-5\">From the judgment of the County Court the plaintiff ap\u00bb pealed to this Court, and assigned the general errors, to which the defendant has replied there is no error, so that it now remains to inquire if the said judgment is erroneous or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-6\">I shall, therefore, on the part of the plaintiff, endeavour to shew that the said judgment is altogether erroneous and contrary to law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-7\">Covenant is the agreement of two or more persons to do, or not to do, some act or thing contracted between them by deed, under hand and seal, and is either in fact or in law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-8\">Covenant in fact is what is expressly agreed between the parties, and <em>inserted in the deed.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-9\">Covenant in law is that covenant which the law intends and implies, <em>though it is not expressed in the deed </em>in words; as if a lessor demise a house to his lessee for a certain time, the law will imply a covenant on the lessor\u2019s part, that the lessee shall quietly enjoy during the term. <em>1 Inst. </em>384.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-10\">' This action is brought on a covenant <em>in </em>fact, expressly entered into by the lease, and is such a contract as the lessee can never, by any act of his, free himself from.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-11\">I shall therefore shew, in the first place, how far the party is bound by express covenants between the lessor and lessee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-12\">I shall secondly shew how far the party is bound by the express covenant to the grantee of the reversion; and, lastly, that the devisee of the reversion is entitled to all the benefit of the conditions and covenants expressly entered into by the lessee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number><em>First. </em>Lawful covenants in fact bind the party expressly though they become afterwards unlawful, 3 <em>Mod. 39. </em>or impossible by the act of God, 2 <em>Danv.

Afterwards, the house, by the default of <em>B., </em>became ruinous. <em>A. </em>grants the reversion, to <em>C., </em>who. upon view of the house, gave warning to A. of the default. If it is not repaired, <em>C. </em>may have an action as assignee o\u00ed <em>A. </em>against <em>B., </em>(hough the house became ruinous before <em>C. </em>was entitled to the reversion: for the action is not founded on th. ruinous estate of the house, and the time where it first happened, but for not repairing within the time appointed by the covenant after the warning. So is the case of <em>Glover </em>v. <em>Cope, Carthew, </em>205. in covenant to repair where the second surrenderee of copyhold lands brought covenant against lessee, and determined to be within the equity of the statute 32 <em>lien. </em>VIII. which is a remedial law and of universal use, and absolutely necessary, as well for copy-holders as others. <em>4 Mod. </em>60. 3 <em>Lev. </em>326. 1 <em>Salk. </em>185. <em>Skin. </em>296. 305.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-4\">If lessee for years covenants to leave the house hi good repair at the end of the term, and lessor grants the rev ersiou to another, though this covenant is not to be performed during the term, yet for a breach thereof the grantee of the reversion may bring an action, and there cannot be a more apt covenant to run with the land. 1 <em>Bac. </em>537. <em>Cro. Eliz. </em>599. 617. <em>Sec 1 P. in Godbolt, </em>270, 271.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-5\">And these determinations are founded on the reason and justice of the ease. The lessor enters into covenant, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>the lessee, as well relying on the person he contracts withy and from a confidence in the man, that he will faithfully perform fiis part, as on any other remedy that the law gives him. The tenant was formerly considered as the bailiff, or person intrusted by the person seised, to manage the land leased to him for the benefit of the owner, and to have a .\u2022share of the profits thereof, and might be cutout of his term, before the statute, by a fine or recovery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-4\">Where there, was lessee for years rendering rent of lands in Lincolnshire, the grantee of the reversion brought covenant in <em>London </em>for non-payment of rent. It was objected that although the statute gives covenant, yet it was local. It was determined by the Court that the action was well brought, and they declared that the statute expressly puts the gVantee in the same light as the lessor, and the diversity between debt and covenant was observed, and it was agreed that if the lessor grants his reversion and the assignee the term, yet covenant lies. 1 <em>Sid. </em>401, This is a case in point. In the case of <em>Walker </em>v. Reeves, an action was brought by the grantee of the reversion against the. assignee in covenant for rent, and it was not there contend ed but the action would lie if a privity of contract had remained in assignee. <em>Doug. </em>444.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-5\">In <em>Cro. Jac. </em>322. which . same case is undetermined in Popharn, 137. Sir <em>J. Brett, </em>assignee of the <em>Queen, </em>granted the reversion, and action was by the grantee. See the same case more largely in <em>Godbolt. </em>The second question was, whether the assignee of the reversion should resort to the executor of the lessee. It was resolved he should be chargeable ; for if it is a covenant which runs with the land, the lessee is always chargeable, and by the statute the grantee has the same right. The privity of action is transferred. 2 <em>Saund. </em>237. <em>Vent. </em>10. where it is not disputed, but an action lies. It lies by grantee of conusee, to whom no attornment was made against assignee who attorned to grantee. 5 <em>Co. </em>113. a,</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-6\">I come now to shew that the devisee of the reversion is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\u25a0entitled to all the benefit of the conditions and covenants expressly entered into by the lessee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-4\">When the statute of uses, 27 <em>Hen. </em>VIII. was made, which transferred the uses into possession, it soon became necessary to introduce the <em>statute of </em>wills, so called, the 32 <em>Hen. </em>VIII. c. ., whereby all persons were enabled to dispose of their lands by their wills, to any persons who could legally take the same. A will of lands under the statute has been always sinee considered by the courts of law, not so much in the nature of a testament as of a conveyance, declaring the uses to which the land shall be subject ; and upon this notion, that a devise is merely a species of conveyance, is founded this distinction between such devises and testaments of personal c .dels, that the latter will operate upon whatever the testator dies possessed of, the former only upon such real estates as were Ms at the time of executing his will. 2 <em>Black. Comm. </em>378.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-5\">In 2 <em>Black. Comm. </em>501. devises of lands are said to be conveyances by statute. 1 <em>Wms. </em>78. It is a declaration o\u00ed the use, and the devisee is put in the place of the heir at law by the statute. The devisee comes in by the act and limitation of the testator by virtue of the statute of 32 <em>Hen. </em>VIII. c. <em>34. Co. Litt. </em>215. Moore, 98. <em>4 Leon. </em>27. 29. 1 <em>Bar. </em>538. <em>in notes.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-6\">At the time when the statute of wills was made, and ever since, almost all the lands in <em>England </em>were let out ou leases to tenants, many of them for long terms of years, and in no single instance has it been denied but that the devise\u00bb: is the grantee of the reversion. <em>A. </em>devises to <em>B. </em>for years, rendering rent upon condition to re-enter for non-payment, and after devises the reversion in fee to another and dies; the devisee may take advantage of the condition, though there never was any reversion in the devisor. 2 <em>Leon. </em>33. Here the right of entering for a condition not performed is acknowledged to a devisee of the reversion under the statute, which shews clearly, that the courts of law' have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>always considered the devisee to be included'in the statute 32 <em>Hen. </em>VIII. c. 34. as grantee of the reversion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALU\">If the devisee of a real estate was not, under the statute, to have the benefit of the privity of a contract, all the leases in <em>England </em>would soon have been at an end, and the lessees only hold the lands until they had destroyed them, and then return them to the landlord, or transfer them to any insolvent person. This would be a doctrine which would well suit some late speculators in lands and lots, but would be subversive of the end and meaning of the statute of wills, contrary to common sense and common honesty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-5\">In <em>Lill. Ent. </em>131. there is covenant by a devisee against; the assignee of a term. The same by assignee of the reversion in covenant for rent. <em>Carth. </em>289, 290. <em>Midgley </em>&amp; <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Lovelace.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-6\">In 1- <em>Bac. </em>S39. <em>A. </em>demised a house for a term of years to <em>B., </em>who assigned to <em>f. S. </em>The lessor devised one moiety of the reversion to <em>C. </em>and the other to <em>D. </em>who granted the reversion to <em>J. JD., </em>after which <em>C. </em>and <em>D. </em>brought covenant against <em>J. S. </em>for rent due before the assignment by them : and it was held, first, that <em>C. </em>and <em>D. </em>being tenants in com mon, may, at their election, join or sever as well in debt as in covenant for rent; but if they sever, they must not each of them make his demand of such a certain sum which amounts to a <em>moiety; </em>but the demand must be of one moiety of the whole rent; and if they can count in debt they may in covenant, and if debt will lie, d <em>fortiori </em>covenant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A00\"><em>Secondly. </em>That this action is maintainable for the arrears of the rent, notwithstanding the reversion was out of the plaintiff; for though the defendant was but assignee of .the term, yet the very privity of contract was transferred by the statute 32 <em>Hen. </em>VIII. c. 34. which gives the action for and against assignees; and the contract still remains though the privity of estate is gone. The assignee shall have it, as a fruit fallen from the reversion. At common lawr after assignment, the assignor might bring debt for rent before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>an arrear: but his power over the land being gone, he could ,. , . not distrain or bring waste.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-5\">This case shews clearly that the devisee is considered as the grantee of the reversion, under the statute of 32 <em>Hen. </em>VIII. c\u00ab 34. That the privity of contract is transferred thereby, and that it still remains though the privity of estate is gone; and therefore the devisee, as grantee of the reversion, may well bring covenant against any persons, either lessee or assignee, for the breach of any covenant or agreement contained in the leases, as the lessors or grantors might have done at any time. See the case in <em>Godbolt, </em>161., where the devisee of the reversion of a term brought, covenant against assignee of an under lessee, and adjudged that the action lay by the statute of Hen. Vill. See the case at large.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-7\">When the above cases are attended to, it must evidently appear that the judgment in the county court is erroneous. \u2018It says that an action of covenaut for the payment of rent must be maintained on the privity of estate, whereas the above-mentioned authorities are, that it lies on the privity of contract, though the privity of estate is gone.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-9\">Upon the whole, as it appears from the above cases that the action of covenant well lies by the lessor against the lessee on the privity of contract, after the assignment and acceptance of rent from the assignee ; as it also appears that the grantee of the reversion under the statute has the same right in him that the grantor had, and the privity of contract is transferred thereby to him, and still remains ; and as it also appears that the devisee by will is in the same situation as the grantee of the reversion under the statute, and the devise is considered as a conveyance by statute, and that the privity of contract is transferred to him and still remains, though the privity of estate is gone, I hope there will remain no doubt but that the said judgment is erroneous, and that it will he reversed, and a judgment given for the plaintiifin error for the sum of 33/. 1 <em>is. 8d. </em>current money, being 20/. 11\u00bb. sterling money, due by the covenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>in the said lease, as appears by the <em>narr. </em>and interest thereon, from the time due, with the costs of suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-3\">By 2 <em>Saund. 107. 5 Com.
