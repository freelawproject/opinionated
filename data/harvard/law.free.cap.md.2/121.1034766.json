The writing by <em>Davie </em>on the deed, is nothing but a covenant for quiet enjoyment. Blackman, if he had been disturbed in his enjoyment, had his remedy on the covenant. <em>Davie </em>was not a party to the deed, nor is <em>Holbridge Town </em>mentioned. <em>Blackman </em>was never molested, but enjoyed the full benefit of the covenant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-4\">The bond from <em>Davie </em>to <em>Greenfield </em>and Jowles, cannot be a release of his equitable interest to Blackman, who was no party to it. The consideration moved from <em>Greenfield </em>and Jowles, and the .bond was for their benefit. <em>Blackman </em>could not avail himself of it for a noncompliance. <em>Davie </em>was to repair to Annapolis, and relinquish all his right to <em>Holbridge </em>Town, obtain a warrant for other land, and assign it to <em>Greenfield </em>and <em>Jowles. </em>This assignment could be made to no one but <em>Greenfield </em>and <em>Jowles. </em>The bond is executed to them, and though it does not mention that a release should be made to them, yet it follows of necessity, because they are parties, and it is not said it should be made to any one else.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-5\">No patent could issue on the certificate of <em>Holbridge Town </em>to any one but Davie, before the assignment made by him, so that the equitable interest still remained in <em>Davie. </em>The assignment by him to <em>Greenfield </em>and Jowles, was on the 27th of October, 1712, which was subsequent to the death of <em>Blackman. Blackman's </em>interest in <em>Callicome </em>and <em>Joxvles's Calf Pasture </em>had there-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>lore ceased and his estate was extinct. When <em>Greenfield </em>and <em>Jowles </em>obtained the assignment they had the equitable interest in, and right to, the land. And when the patent was obtained no <em>\u00a1mesne </em>grant stood between their patent and the certificate of <em>Ilolbridge Town.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-6\">The relation of a patent to the certificate is a rule or principle of law, and not a fiction, because the certificate is the commencement of the title, and is like a deed of bargain and sale, -which after enrolment relates to the date of the deed. But before the enrolment the bargainee has only an equitable interest. The enrolment is the completion by which the legal estate passes, and overreaches a deed of a later date, though enrolled prior.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-7\">But admitting the relation ofa patent to the certificate is a fici-ion, no injustice will be done, for <em>Blackman\u2019s </em>estate was extinct, and no person had any claim or interest in the land but the lord proprietary and <em>Greenfield </em>and Jowles, so that no estate was devested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-8\">The cases cited are good law, but they do not apply to the present case.

Abr. 206. </em>They cannot pass a freehold <em>in </em>futuro.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH1\">The proprietary rights are contained in the 4th, 5th 16th, 18th and 19th sections of the charter. The three latter sections show what privileges he w;as to have. Under the 5th section, which is general, he might do anything. But the, king could not grant to a subject the privilege of <em>nullum tempus, Popham, 26. </em>It was not necessary that a dignified subject should have that privilege, though the state of Maryland, independent and sovereign, has all the privileges of sovereignty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-5\">When a patentee has a right to sue in the king\u2019s name, it is considered as the king\u2019s suit. 4 <em>Bac. Abr. 202. </em>The king may sue in any Court he pleases. <em>Ib. 214. </em>And the party, to avail himself of the prerogative, must sue in the king\u2019s name. The king\u2019s grant shall never be construed to do wrong. <em>2 Bac. Abr. </em>105. 4 <em>Bac. Abr. 214.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-7\">If part of the description of a thing be false, nothing will pass by the king\u2019s grant, and this was the principle on which <em>Legate\u2019s </em>case, 10 <em>Co. </em>109. was determined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-8\">There is a great difference between bonds and grants. The former are only <em>chases in action </em>in a Court of Law, and cannot extend far, and no great injury could result from setting it aside. It is otherwise as to grants of lands, which are transferred from man to man. 5 Bac. <em>Abr. </em>333. Can a feoffment, with livery, obtained by fraud, be declared void ? A person cannot be an intruder if he enters under the king\u2019s grant. 4 <em>Co. </em>58. a.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AIm\">Stone,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEZ\">in reply. A covenant will amount to a release. <em>Hob. </em>35. Whatever is covenanted to be done, is considered in equity as done. In the bond from <em>Davie </em>to <em>Greenfield wad fotvles </em>the words are \u201c release, relinquish and quit-claim,\u201d which show that the assignment was to be made to <em>Blackman, </em>who had purchased the land from \u25a0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number><em>Greenfieldcxidjorvles. Blackman </em>could have obtained possession by a bill in equity against <em>Greenfield </em>and <em>Jarcies.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axp\">It has not always been the opinion of lawyers that the patent on an escheat should relate to the first certificate, so as to overreach a <em>mesne </em>grant. If, in truth and fact, <em>Davie </em>had the legal estate when the certificate was dated, the land was conveyed by the /deed to <em>Greenfield </em>and <em>Jowles. </em>Relation is always a fiction of law. There is a wide difference between a deed of bargain and sale and a patent, as to relation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-6\">In the case in <em>Coke </em>Littleton, it was immaterial whether the warranty wras general or special. The security by warranty is favoured in law. A man does not warrant against his title but against himself and his heirs, and if he acquires a title paramount, the title conveyed with a special warranty will bind him and his heirs. As to estoppel, <em>(Co. Litt. </em>363.) a deed indented is a deed of both parties, and therefore both are estopped by it. 1 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>163. 2 <em>Bl. 245. </em>As to <em>jura </em>regalia, there is justice, fitness and policy, in allowing to the supreme governor those rights which are now denied him. One who is at the head of, and engaged in, the management of public affairs, ought to be protected against fraud and deception. The counts palatine, when those rights were transferred, were persons of consequence, and had honour nearly equal to the king, and might be more attentive to the interests of the people. 1 <em>Bl. Com. </em>118. <em>Bracton,l. </em>43. c. 8. s. 4. <em>Jura regalia </em>are the rights, privileges and exemptions, to which the supreme governor is entitled. 1 <em>Bl. Com. 117.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-9\">As to the question whether the lord proprietary has been injured by the grant: A grant of the king will be void, if it has not been granted upon a true and just consideration, or if it has been on <em>falsi suggestio </em>or <em>veri suppressio. </em>The Courts in <em>England </em>have, it is true, by-subtleties destroyed the operation of the king\u2019s grants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Here the consideration is, not true, and the land is granted on a supposition of facts which did not exist, and on a supposition of facts which were in the knowledge of the grantee. Suggestions which \u00e1re not true, flowing from the king, will not vitiate the grant. If it is an act' of benevolence, the grant is not void. The lord proprietary did not solicit <em>Greenfield </em>and <em>Jowles </em>to take the grant ; they obtained an assignment of the certificate, brought it to the land-office and requested a grant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-5\">As to <em>Legate's </em>case, and the cases in 3 <em>Lev. </em>135. and in Skinner, 663. the question was, whether the grant was void. The king was deceived in the suppression of a fact in the knowledge of the grantee. 4 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>211. It was the case of an advowson. It was immaterial how the king came by it. There was only a mistake in the description. The grant is good if there be sufficient certainty to identify the thing granted. It is not necessary that it should appear on the face of the grant that there was a deception. It did not appear on the grant in <em>Legate's </em>case that deception had been practised.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-6\">Feoffment with livery will convey a chattel interest. It does more; it subjects the feoffor to be considered by the reversioner as a disseisor. <em>2 Bac. Abr. 200. </em>Livery will not prevent the operation of a <em>deed; </em>where the livery is unnecessary, it is merely surplusage. In the case cited from <em>Levinz, </em>if the patent had not been void, the plaintiff must have recovered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-7\">Patents are not records, and may be averred against. Courts are now more liberal than they formerly used to be, in allowing parties to abide by the merits in ejectments. For where was the necessity of sending parties into Chancery, if the merits of the case could as well be tried at law ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-8\">As to payment of quit-rents and descents, the lord proprietary cannot be disseised, consequently a descent cannot be cast. <em>2 Bac. Abr. </em>98. Admitted that the payment of rent is an affirmance of the title of the king. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>But the receipt of rent is not a transfer of the interest. The rent is received as the services which are due, and no act <em>in pais </em>will strip the lord proprietary of his right; <em>2 Bl. Com. </em>244. and 1 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>174, 175. is good law, as to the lord in fee, but is not applicable to the lord pro prietary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-4\">The case of <em>Carvill's Lessee </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>was not similar to the present case in fact or in principle. There the common warrant was taken out, the survey made and the caution money paid after the escheat fell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-5\">Admitted the lord proprietary might grant the possibility of an escheat. It is the duty of the officers to inform themselves, when there is an application for a common warrant, so ' as to guard purchasers for a valuable consideration in that case.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b136-6\"> We regret that it has not been in our power to obtain the whole of the very able and learned arguments delivered by the counsel in thi cas^ ^</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b143-6\"><em>Harrison, </em>Ch.

What estate <em>William Blackman </em>acquired under the deed from <em>Greenfield </em>and <em>Jozules f</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\"><em>Answer. </em>An absolute fee-simple in the whole of two tracts of land called <em>Callicome </em>and \u201c <em>Jowles\u2019s Calf Pasture,\u201d </em>except such part thereof as lay within the lines of the tract called \u201c <em>Holbridge.\u201d </em>In this he acquired a. defeasible estate, liable to be destroyed by <em>Davie </em>or any assignee of his, besides <em>Greenfield </em>and <em>Jowles </em>chaining a patent for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">2. Whether <em>John Davie </em>had not the equitable interest in the tract of land called <em>Holbridge, </em>when Green<em>field </em>and <em>J ovules </em>executed their deed to <em>William Black-man ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\"><em>Answer. </em>From the facts, he had. the equitable interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">3. Whether <em>Davie\u2019s bond, endorsed </em>upon the deed from <em>Greenfield </em>and <em>J ovules to William Blackman, </em>did not ope-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>rate as a <em>release, </em>and transfer all <em>Davie's </em>right in the tract of land called <em>uHolbridge,\" </em>for which he had obtained a certificate <em>so far as it lay within </em>the tracts of land called \u201c <em>Callicome\" </em>and \u201c <em>Jowles's Calj Pasture P\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><em>Answer. </em>This point <em>cannot </em>be determined, for want of a <em>fact </em>being stated. A bond, like the one given by <em>Davie', </em>may operate <em>as a release, </em>and transfer an <em>equitable interest. </em>And if there existed nothing more in the case, <em>Davie's </em>bond might well be considered to have transferred all the interest he had in the tract called \u201c <em>Holbridge f </em>lying within the lines of \u201c <em>Callicome\" and u Calf Pastured' </em>But it appearing by the state of the case, that <em>Davie, </em>on the <em>same </em>day that he executed the bond to <em>Bhckman, </em>executed one to <em>Greenfield </em>and <em>Jowles, </em>for releasing \u201c all his right, title and interest, in \u201c a certain tract of land called \u201c <em>Holbridge,\" </em>contain- \u201c ing 260 acres,\u201d we cannot say that <em>Davie's </em>bond to <em>Blackman </em>transferred all his equitable interest, because it is not stated, that its execution was <em>prior </em>to that of the <em>other </em>bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">4. Could <em>Greenfield </em>and <em>Jowles, </em>by procuring an assignment of the certificate from <em>John Davie </em>of \u201c <em>Holbridge </em>u <em>Town,\" </em>and a patent upon the same, defeat and avoid their deed to <em>William Blackman, </em>for such part of \u201c <em>Hoi- </em>\u201c <em>bridge Town\" </em>as lies within \u201c <em>Callicome\" </em>and \u201c <em>Calf </em>\u201c <em>Pasture,\" </em>supposing he <em>were living, </em>against their warranty ?</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\"><em>Answer. </em>We are of opinion that they could not! their deed <em>with warranty </em>would always have <em>protected Blackman </em>and his heirs, and any assignee by <em>actual purchase </em>or assignment, against any claim which they or any claiming under them could set up. And the <em>relation </em>of the patent, obtained on the assignment of the certificate from <em>Davie, </em>could never have been carried <em>quo ad Black-man, his heirs and actual </em>assigns, beyond the date of their deed to \u2022 him.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>3. </em>Would not the proprietor, upon the <em>death </em>of <em>WilHam </em>Blackman, <em>without heirs and dying </em>intestate, stand in the place of <em>William </em>Blackman, and in consequence <em>estoppel </em>and <em>warranty </em>under the deed from <em>Greenfield </em>and <em>fowles </em>to Blackman, that <em>Blackman himself </em>would have been entitled to, had the action been between <em>Black-man </em>and them ? of his right in escheat be entitled to all the benefits of</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\"><em>Answer. </em>We are of opinion, under the circumstances of this case, that the proprietor could <em>not </em>take advantage of the warranty: because his right in escheat is by a title paramount, and an implied condition annexed to his grant. That he is in in the post, and he <em>could net </em>be considered, upon any ground of fair reasoning or construction, an assignee within the contemplation of the parties, or the expressions of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">6. And if the proprietor would have been entitled to the same advantages under the deed, that <em>William Black-man himself </em>would have been entitled to, <em>is not </em>his patentee, <em>John </em>Kelly, under the escheat warrant, for <em>want of heirs </em>of Blackman, entitled to the same benefit ?</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\"><em>Answer. </em>The proprietor not being entitled to the same benefits under the deed from <em>Greenfield </em>aud <em>Jowles </em>to Blackman, that <em>Blackman himself </em>would have been entitled to, of consequence his patentee could <em>not </em>be entitled to the same. But it is not a sound or a legal principle, that a patentee can take or have all the rights which the proprietor might be entitled to, even where it is clear, that an indefeasible title by escheat had fallen. He cannot take, by assignment, a right of entry, especially while the possession is full.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\"><em>7. </em>Had the proprietor the <em>same rights </em>with respect to Maryland, that the <em>king </em>of <em>Great Britain </em>had <em>in England, </em>in consequence of the fifth section in the charter to him by the king, from his being lord of the fee ?</p>\n<p id=\"AjD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>. <em>\u00bf{newer. </em>We are clearly of opinion he had <em>not. </em>His rights were derived under the charter ; the 4th section of which grants to him \u201c all and singular such ample fights, jurisdictions, &amp;c. as any <em>Bishop </em>of <em>Durham </em>within the hishopric or county palatine of <em>Durham </em>had.\u201d The law writers upon the subject of the palatinate ,rights, A. 60. <em>Davie, </em>Blackstone, &amp;c. ip <em>enumerating </em>the rights, have never .placed them upon a footing with the Court? of the king\u00bb and the maxim, \u2018f <em>nullum tempus occwrit </em>r.egi,\u201d has never been applied, that we cap find, to any but the king himself. And it is. a prerogative maxim, which if mu?t have ceased to have heen whenever it became applicable to any subject. Ip the hands of the crovm.it is an inconvenient one, but being placed there, jt is still permitted to continue j but even there it has been greatly restrained by the act of 9 <em>Geo. </em>III. <em>c. </em>\u2014.. It neyer was in the proprietor, because <em>never </em>in the Bishop of <em>Durham-, </em>apd there could have beep po very good pretext for the judges to adopt it here, because he <em>never busied himself </em>extremely in the affairs of <em>Maryland, </em>which was the ground of its being <em>at first </em>established in the case of the king ; <em>,i. e. </em>his constant attention to the public weal and the public concerns, to the neglect of his private affairs. Besides, it is an unjust, injurious and inconvenient rule, with respect to the citizens, and as such not being expressly given, it ought pot to be permitted to operate,</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">8. Whether would the acceptance of the rent by the proprietor or his- officers, from <em>Greenfield </em>and <em>fatales </em>and their heirs, supposing him entitled to the land? which <em>Blackman </em>had as an escheat, bar him of his right in escheat?-</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\"><em>Answer. We </em>are of opinion, that even if a right of escheat had ever, fallen, that the acceptance of rent? as, stated in the . case, would have barred the proprietor ;. his title by escheat was a tifie <em>in pais, </em>and no.t of record. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>The king\u2019s title by escheat is a title <em>in pais, </em>and the proprietor\u2019s title could only be completed by his entering into the land, or bringing a writ of escheat after the title by escheat fallen. For having once parted with the fee by a formal and solemn grant, he had nothing left in him but an interest in possibility. In reverter depending on the remote contingency of the patentee, or any assignee under him or his assignees <em>in futurum, </em>dying <em>without heirs, </em>and, therefore, till re-entry or bringing a writ of escheat, and a recovery, the estate is not revested in him ; and as the estate was to be revested in him by a matter <em>in pais, </em>\u201c an entry,\u201d it might be continued out of him by matter <em>in pais, viz. </em>acceptance of rent; and in this way-are all the authorities to be understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">10. Whether the proprietor could be disseised Or barred of his title in escheat by the possession which <em>Greenfield </em>and <em>fowles </em>had, their dying seised, and the descents to their heirs ?</p>\n<p id=\"ALq\"><em>Answer. </em>We are of opinion, that if ever he had a right in escheat, the descent would have barred him had he been a party in the present action ; <em>ex consequenti </em>his patentee. His right was <em>in pais, </em>and might be defeated by matter <em>in pais; </em>and upon the distinction of his right, being <em>in pais, </em>and of its being upon record, all the authorities are to be reconciled. Further the proprietor could not grant, even if he had a right in escheat, before he entered, nor a right of entry <em>cannot </em>be assigned ; and any patent issued by him <em>before </em>he had revested the estate by entry, was void, especially where the possession was <em>filled.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">11.

The latter, with little hesitation, declared, that in his opinion the cause might be decided on a single point, <em>viz. </em>that as the title to the land in question was in the proprietary, at the time of his grant to the persons under whom the defendants claim j and as that grant remains unrepealed by the Chancery Court, it must prevail against the younger grant obtained by the piaintiif, and issued on a younger survey and warrant. The subscriber observed, that under this impression he was for giving judgment in the defendants\u2019 <em>favour; </em>that there was no necessity for deciding on the points raised by the <em>counsel; </em>that it had always been, and perhaps would ever be, <em>Ms </em>practice, after giving his opinion on a point which put an end to the cause, to give no further opinion ; and that such practice had uniformly prevailed <em>in the </em>Court, since the said Chief Justice had presided. He then assigned his reasons, which to him appeared conclusive for continuing the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The Chief Judge, not acquiescing in the remarks of his colleague, applied, in his presence, to Judge <em>Golds-borough. </em>A debate ensued, and the result was, that Judge <em>Goldsborough </em>avowed a perfect coincidence in sentiment with Judge <em>Hanson. </em>But inasmuch as all three were in favour of the defendants, it was agreed that the Chief Judge should deliver the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The subscriber declares, that, to the best of his recollection and belief, neither Judge Goldsborough, nor himself, at that time, intimated to the Chief Judge any opinion in this cause, except that which has already been stated, <em>viz. </em>that a grant by the proprietary, in whom the title was at the time of the grant, shall, so long as it remains unvacated or unrepealed by the Chancery Court, prevail against any subsequent grant, made to another person, whose survey and location are younger than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>certificate, on which the said first grant had issued; that is to say, if a patent has issued from the land-office, un\u00bfer Sllch circumstances as, agreeably to the rules and practice of the office, required a warrant and proceedings, different from those which have been used on the occasion, no other grant, obtained on any warrant, after-wards issued, or on a survey, or location, afterwards made, shall prevail against the said patent; and that no advantage shall be taken on a trial at law, by the younger patentee of the' want of formality, or regularity, in obtaining the fir\u00e1t grant, or of imposition on the proprietary or other person, but that the said first grant shall stand, as any other grant, so long as it remains unvacated or unrepealed, by the Chancery Court. This doc* trine appeared to the two associate Judges to be per* fectly clear, and. the Chief Judge did not controvert it.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">- The Chief Judge, notwithstanding what had passed, about three weeks afterwards, delivered a long and learned opinion in writing, in which, it appears, eleven points, mad\u2019e by the counsel, or deduced from their arguments, are- decided. The subscriber remembers Well, that, as the opinio\u00f1, from the language, appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the Court, on many, if not on all the points therein discussed, he contemplated at the moment, a disavowal of his own concurrence, but for certain reasons, which perhaps ought not to have governed, he declined it.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">He now perceives cleai-ly, that he and Judge <em>Golds-borough </em>did wrong in not apprizing the bar, that the writing, aforesaid contained the opinions of the Chief Judge only; and that they neither concurred with, nor dissented from', the said opinions. All that he can <em>now </em>do with propriety, in order to place matters on then-proper footing, (and he earnestly hopes it is not too late,) is, in addition- to what he has already said, to protest \u25a0that neither he, nor (to the best of his recollection and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>belief) Judge Goldsborough, <em>at any </em>time, has concurred in the decisions of Judge <em>Harrison </em>in this cause, further than is already stated ; and that if the subscriber had conceived himself under an obligation of delivering his opinion on each of the eleven points stated in the aforesaid writing, he should not, on every point, have concurred with the Chief Judge. On some of the points, indeed, he did not even give himself the trouble of forming an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">He did not even consider as involved in <em>his </em>point, the question how far the royal rights, or prerogative, of the lord proprietary of <em>Maryland </em>extended : for he was under the impression, that a person in England, seised of land under a grant of the crown, passed many years ago, and still remaining unvacated or unrepealed, could not have a recovery against him, by a person claiming under a new grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The object of this narrative and declaration is merely to have it understood, as it ought unquestionably to have been from the beginning, that, although the decisions contained in the writing aforesaid, may be strictly conformable to law, they are entitled to no further authority than belongs to the name of Judge <em>Harrison </em>only. It is not the meaning of the subscriber to controvert any one of those decisions : But he has been applied to, to settle, so far as his declaration can settle, a dispute at the bar concerning the writing aforesaid; and he conceives it his duty to do that, which is in the power of no other man, to take care, that decisions in which <em>he </em>did not concur, shall not be quoted as <em>his </em>deliberate opinions, delivered by the mouth of the Chief Judge. He is well apprized of the distinguished reputation, which that excellent man had deservedly acquired <em>\u2022, </em>and it is probable, that the subscriber\u2019s opinion might be considered as affording but a slender support to that of Judge <em>Harrison. </em>But be this as it may, it can never be insisted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>opinion of Judge <em>Harrison </em>alone, on points of importanee, should be suffered to pass as the opinion of <em>Har</em>rison, <em>Hanson </em>and <em>Goldsborough.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-5\">A. C. HANSON, <em>Chancellor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">N. B. It may not be amiss to explain more fully the meaning of Judge <em>Hanson\u2019s </em>point. There is no doubt, that if a private man conveys land, in which he has a clear, pomplete title, to A., who enters, and is seised $ and the said private man afterwards conveys the same land to <em>B., </em>the said <em>B. </em>is not thereby enabled t\u00f3 recover the land from <em>A. </em>There is no difference between two deeds for the same land from a private person, and two patents from the king. In either case, it is the Court of Chancery alone which can enable any person to recover from the first grantee or patentee. In this view of things it is clear, that there was no necessity for deciding the several points raised by the counsel ; nor can'Judge <em>Hanson\u2019s </em>point be considered as a virtual or implied decision of any point <em>which he has not stated.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">A. C. HANSON,- <em>Chancellor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">With some hesitation Judge <em>Hanson </em>adds his decided opinion, that the proprietary could never be considered in a worse state than a private man. If the act of limitations was to operate against him, as against a private man, he must surely have been entitled to the benefit of the exceptions, made by the act in favour of a private man. It would be monstrous to say, first, that with respect to limitation of time, the proprietary was not exempt more than a private man from the operation of the act, and to say next, that notwithstanding the proprietary\u2019s real absence from his province, he must be supposed always present in his province. Would it not be more reasonable to Say, that, as he was supposed always occupied by the affairs of his province, and there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>fore not having it in his power to attend his private affairs, like a common man, the act of limitations ought not to-operate against him at alii Judge <em>Hanson </em>had always understood it to be settled, that, until some grant had been issued from the proprietary, mere adverse possession, of whatever duration, could not bar his entry. If that point was settled on proper grounds, why, in the name of common sense and justice, should an adverse possession of twenty years have barred the proprietary from his entry on lands theretofore patented, which had escheated to him ?</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">This is one of the great points, on which, if Judge <em>Hanson </em>had conceived himself obliged to decide in the cause of <em>Kelly </em>and <em>Greenfield, </em>he must have dissented. from the Chief Judge\u2019s opinion.
