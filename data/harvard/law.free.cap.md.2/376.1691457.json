Com. Dig. Indt., Q. C., citing Strange, </em>96, a.\u2014I would remark here, that if this position be true, the converse of it (which is our case) must of necessity be true. That the burning of a stack of hay is not a felony, I need only refer to the acts of Assembly, 1809, ch. 138, sec. 5, clause 2nd. And 1845, ch. 381. These enactments use no words that, even by inference, can constitute the burning of a stack of hay, felony. True, <em>arson </em>is felony, at common law; but burning a hay stack was not arson: nor does the acts of Assembly call or make it <em>arson </em>or <em>felony, </em>but only say how it shall be punished.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-7\">That the <em>local </em>description of the article burnt, is insufficient, see <em>Arch.

It is however only cumulative, and the indictment may still be in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>the words of the act of 1809: from which it only differs in using the term <em>\u201cmaliciously,\u201d </em>instead of \u201cwilfully,\u201d and <em>\u201cset on fire,\u201d </em>instead of \u201cburn.\u201d But this indictment is good under both these statutes, as it has every substantial requirement of the statutes. So far as the act of 1845 is concerned, the indictment charges a <em>burning, </em>which includes a <em>setting on fire, </em>and it is therefore sufficient under that statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-5\">But it is said that if the offence be (as this is) but a misdemeanor, then the insertion of the word <em>\u201cfeloniously,\u201d </em>vitiates the indictment. But I deny this to be law, and claim on authorities <em>expressly to this point, </em>that it may be rejected as surplusage. <em>Hess vs. State, </em>5 <em>Ohio, </em>13. 1 <em>Chit. Crim. Law, (4th Am. ed.,) </em>295. 2 <em>East. Pleas of the Grown, </em>1028. 2 <em>Russell on Grimes, </em>489. It is also said that <em>no place </em>is alleged where the hay stack stood; but it is enough to show that it was in Carroll county, and the property of its owner. Why describe the <em>locality of the stack </em>more particularly,- when the offence is the same, no matter whether it be near any house or not? Even if a place had been laid in the county <em>it need not be proved, </em>as it is immaterial. 2 <em>Russell on Crimes, </em>717. Of course, it results that, in charging the <em>burning of a hay stack </em>in Carroll county, it is no more necessary to say in <em>what part </em>of Carroll county, than in <em>charging a murder.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b386-7\">Le Grand, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Am8\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">This case comes before us on a writ of error; It appears that the appellant was indicted in Carroll county, for burning a stack of hay. The only count in the indictment on which he was tried is in the following words:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">\u201cThe jurors of the State of Maryland, for the body of Carroll county, do on their oaths present, that Daniel Black, late of Carroll county aforesaid, yeoman, not having the fear of God before his eyes, but being moved and seduced by the instigation of the devil, on the twentieth day of December, in the year of our Lord, eighteen hundred and fifty-one, with force and arms at Carroll county aforesaid, a certain stack of hay of and- belonging to one Aaron Miller, <em>feloniously, </em>un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>lawfully, wilfully and maliciously did burn, against the form of the act of Assembly,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The jury found the party guilty of having <em>\u2018 </em>feloniously,\u201d as well as unlawfully, wilfully and maliciously, burnt the stack of hay, and the question for the decision of this courtis, whether on such an indictment, and finding, a valid and legal judgment can be pronounced ?</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Neither at the common law, nor by the act, of 1809, ch. 138, nor by the act of 1845, ch. 381, is the .act of burning a stack of hay a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">This is admitted on the part of the State; but, it is contended, that the introduction of the word \u201cfeloniously,\u201d in the indictment and also in the verdict of the jury, is a matter of no importance, and ought, therefore, to be regarded .as mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">In support of this view several cases have been relied on. However great our respect may be for the learning of the court which pronounced the decision in the .case of <em>Hess vs. The Stale of </em>Ohio, 5 Ohio, 13, we cannot adopt, that decision, unsupported as it is by a single authority, and resting entirely as it does on the avowed desire of the court, to see that those who have offended shall be punished, to effect which they seem to have been disposed to observe neither the forms nor the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">In regard to the other cases cited on the part of the State, it need only to be observed, they were overruled in <em>Rex vs. Westbeer, 2 Strange, </em>1133, in which it was said by the court, that in the cases relied upon by the State, \u201cthe judges appeared to be transported by zeal too far.\u201d The doctrine of the case in Strange, was fully recognized by the supreme court of Massachusetts, in <em>Commonwealth vs. Newell and others, </em>7 <em>Mass., </em>245. In that case the prisoners had been indicted for <em>feloniously </em>and burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling house of Edward Dixon of Boston, with intent, unlawfully and feloniously to assault Dixon, and to cut off one of his ears, with an intention the said Dixon to maim and disfigure. To the indictment the prisoners demurred, and on their part it was contended that the crime charged in the indictment did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>amount to a felony; that to constitute the crime of burglary, there must be an intent to .commit a felony. And the court held, that the cutting off an ear with set purpose and malice aforethought, with the intention to maim and .disfigure, is not bythelaws of Massachusetts a felony;and having so held,they decided, in opposition to the argument of the attorney general, that the indictment could not be sustained as an indictment for a <em>misdemeanor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In principle that case is precisely the one before us, and we adopt it, because it appears to us to be founded in sound reason and to be in strict concurrence with the English authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">By the common law, a person convicted of an infamous crime is disqualified thereby as a witness, and to this disqualification our constitution by the fifth section of its first article superadds another, the deprivation of the elective franchise. The prisoner has been convicted of an infamous crime, to wit, of a <em>felony, </em>when the offence proved against him according to legal definition was not of that character, We are therefore of the opinion, that according to the principles of the law of pleading in criminal cases, no valid j udgment can be pronounced on [such indictment and verdict as are those in this case, and therefore we reverse the judgment of the county court.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
