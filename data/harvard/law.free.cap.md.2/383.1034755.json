The bill of exceptions was signed by H A.RRISON, Ch. J. The record transmitted to the Court of Appeals does notj(state which of the judges sat with the Chief Judge on this trial.

It is contended, on the part of the appellants, that this deed ought to have been located, otherwise the jury might be led to believe it proved the plaintiff\u2019s location, which it would not do, for the plaintiff\u2019s location differs from the courses of the de\u00e9d, and leaves out several descriptions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-5\">The ejectment is brought for the whole tract. The defendants could have no notice of what part the plaintiff claimed, but by his location. The defendants knew, he had no evidence to support his location, and, therefore, as he meant to controvert it, they made a different one. If the plaintiff meant to have offered record testimony to support his claim, he ought to have laid it down, that the defendants might have had notice. The defendants were therefore surprised, and the Jury too were induced to suppose, the deed supported the plaintiff\u2019s location, when it plainly appears if it had been located it would not have supported it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment at <em>3Iai\u00bf </em>term, 1792.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
