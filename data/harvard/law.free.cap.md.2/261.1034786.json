They had the first judgment for attachment, but <em>Smith's </em>attachment was first laid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-8\">The question then is, has <em>Smith </em>a right to a judgment of condemnation for the value of the goods ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-9\">If goods are consigned to <em>A., </em>he is the owner, and he must bring the action against the owner of the ship, if the goods are lost. And if a bill of fading is general to <em>A,, </em>and the invoice shows they are on account of <em>B-.t </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>A. </em>ought to bring the action, for the property is in him, 1 <em>Raym. </em>271. The consignee of a bill of lading, has such a property that he may assign it over. <em>Per Holt, </em>1 <em>Raym. </em>271. The consignment of the goods vests the property in the consignee, and the invoice signifies little. 3 <em>Salk. </em>290. 12 <em>Mod. </em>156. If goods are consigned to <em>A. </em>on account of <em>B., A. </em>is only a factor, and the property is in <em>B. </em>3 <em>Salk. 290. </em>12 <em>Mod. </em>156.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-10\">If two <em>fieri facias\u2019s </em>are delivered to the sheriff on the same day, he ought to execute that first which was first delivered. 1 <em>Raym. </em>252. And if the sheriff takes and sells goods on the election last delivered, (whether delivered on the same or a subsequent day,) the property of, the goods is bound by the sale, and they cannot be seized by virtue of the execution first delivered but the party may have his remedy against the sheriff. 1 <em>Raym. </em>252. 2 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>356. <em>Carth. </em>419, 420. The <em>teste </em>of the writ binds against all sales and acts of the party himself. <em>Per Holt, </em>1 <em>Raym. </em>252.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-12\">By stat, 29 <em>Car. </em>II. c. 3. no writ of <em>fieri facias, </em>or Other writ of execution, shall bind the property of goods, but from the lime the writ shall be delivered to the sheriff to be executed, and the sheriff shall, upon the receipt of such writ, endorse the day on which he received it. For the exposition of this statute, see 2 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>365.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-13\">If a factor sells goods, receives the money, and invests that money in other goods, and the money remains unpaid, those goods shall be taken, as part of the merchant\u2019s estate. 1 <em>Salk. </em>160.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-14\">\u25a0 This is clear, that if there is an authority never so general, by endorsement upon a bill of lading, without disclosing that the endorsee is factor, the owner (as between . him, and the factor) retains a lien till delivery of the goods, and before they are actually sold and turned into money, 4 <em>Burr. </em>2050, 1 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>628. 5 <em>Burr. </em>2680.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>if a factor sells goods for a principal, he may bring an action in his own name, or in the name of his principal, against the vendee, and the factor may make himself a witness. 1 <em>Atk. </em>248. If goods are delivered to a carrier, hoyman, or master of a ship, to be delivered to <em>A., </em>and the goods are lost by the carrier, &amp;c. the consignee only can bring the action, which shows the property to be in him. 1 <em>Atk. </em>248. The consignor may countermand the delivery of goods on the way, or <em>in </em>transitu, if he hears his consignee is likely to become a bankrupt. 1 <em>Atk. </em>248, 249. Cites also, 1 <em>Bac.

Abr. </em>692. <em>Act 1715, </em>c. 40. s. <em>7. </em>The property is not altered, until a judgment of condemnation takes place. 1 <em>Salk. </em>280. No attachment can be laid in the hands of a garnishee, of goods of which he has no property at the time. 1 <em>Com. Dig. 425.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-9\">An attachment is not an execution. There must be a judgment of condemnation, and an execution issues on the judgment of condemnation. An execution at common law binds, from the <em>teste </em>of the writ. 1 <em>Raym, </em>637. <em>271. 1 Bac. Abr. </em>692. <em>Priv.
