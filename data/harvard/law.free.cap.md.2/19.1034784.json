That it was the intention of the act of assembly, that the husband should be at such a distance that he could not hear what his wife said.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-9\"><em>Answer. </em>1. This part of the act of assembly is only-declaratory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-10\">2. <em>Privately </em>comprehends every thing necessary. No persons can be said to be in private, if another can hear and know their conversation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-11\">The certificate omits that she did not make the acknowledgment \u201c for fear of her husband\u2019s displeasure.\u201d It contains all the other expressions mentioned in the act of assembly, with the addition of the words, \u201c <em>of her own accord and </em>consent, and without being induced by fear of her husband\u2019s <em>menaces </em>or abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-12\">The words in the act of assembly, u for fear of her husband\u2019s displeasure,\u201d are superfluous, because every thing meant or intended by them is comprehended in the words <em>free </em>and willingly, for her acknowledgment could not be free and willing if she was induced to make it for fear of her husband\u2019s displeasure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-13\">Although the words or letter of the act is not strictly pursued, the intent, spirit and substance is complied with b3&gt;- using words synonymous and of the same import and signification as those mentioned in the act of assemblv. The intention of the act of assembly is, that a <em>feme covert </em>should not be barred of her land but by her own voluntary act; and the private examination is used to discover, whether she made the deed of her own accord or by the coercion of her husband.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-14\">It appears by the certificate, that the <em>feme covert </em>was examined, and that the examination was private, or out of her husband\u2019s hearing, and that she made her acknowledgment willingly and of her own accord; so that every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>thing required by the act of assembly has been substan tially complied with.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-4\">The mode of examination prescribed by our act of assembly, corresponds with the form observed in <em>En- </em>^ gland, when a <em>fane covert </em>levies a fine of her land. She Is privately examined, whether she acknowledges willingly and freely, or by compulsion of her husband. 2 <em>Black. Comm. </em>351. The words privately, solely, and secretly, are synonymous terms, and are used as such by <em>Blackstone. </em>2 <em>Black. Comm. </em>351. 1 <em>Black.

Wingate, </em>24. Also, <em>verba intentioni debent inservire.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-12\">In 1 <em>Black. Comm. </em>444. it is said, that all deeds executed, and acts done by a <em>feme covert </em>during her coverture are void except it be by fine or the like matter of record, in which case she must be <em>solely </em>and <em>secretly examined, </em>to learn if her act be voluntary.

Abr. 527. </em>1 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>275. 2 <em>Inst. </em>673. 1 <em>Black. </em>144. <em>Co. Litt. sect. </em>669, 670. If a wife alone or with her husband, bargain and sell her lands by deed indented and enrolled, it shall not bind her. 1 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>302. 2 <em>Inst. </em>673.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-15\">The act of assembly points out the mode by which <em>feme coverts </em>are to convey. To make the deed valid, it must appear by the deed that the several circumstances prescribed by the act of assembly are complied with. The acts point out the duty of the justices, and direct a certificate of what they are to do, to be made and enrolled. In making the examination, and taking the acknowledgment, the justices act in a ministerial and not in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>judicial capacity, in the same manner as commissioners for taking acknowledgments on common recoveries or fines. The power to the justices being a delegated one and in derogation of the common law, it ought to appear by the deed that it had been pursued. It is similar to the case of justices being empowered to take cognisance of offences in a summary way. 2 <em>Burr. </em>681, 682. 1 Burr. 155. 1 <em>Stra. </em>264. 437.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-3\">When the legislature gives a power, the court will presume, that the justices have pursued the power, unless the contrary appears. 1 <em>Stra. </em>46. 475, 476. 631. 117. 264. <em>2 Raym. </em>1375. <em>Plozu. </em>485. <em>Salk. </em>441. <em>pl. </em>3. 442. <em>pl. 5. </em>484. <em>pl. </em>10. <em>Fitzg. </em>254.

In the case of a fine, the examination by the judges or commissioners must be <em>in private. </em>1 <em>Wood's Conv. </em>553.
