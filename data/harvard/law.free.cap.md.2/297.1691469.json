The executors of William Blunt, assumed the administration of his estate in Louisiana, and in 1834, one John Harper -was duly and legally appointed by the heirs of the said James R. Blunt, and by the said Mrs. Ann White, their agent and attorney, to take all necessary and legal steps in the State of Louisiana, to -collect and receive for them from the executors of said William Blunt, their respective proportions of his estate under his will, and to take all necessary steps for their better security in the premises\u00bb In the fall of 1834, said Harper proceeded to Louisiana, and on his application to the court of probate in the parish of Concordia, the power of the executors under the will of William Blunt, was revoked, and one Tenney was appointed curator of the estate, and on the 6th of January 1837, inventories and appraisements of said estate were returned to said court. The inventory and appraisement of the estate, real and personal, in the parish of Concordia, called the \u201cWakefield Plantation,\u201d amounted to $98,332.25, and that in the parish of Catahoula called the \u201cHome Estate,\u201d to $73,652.25.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-6\">On the 13th of February 1837, the estate in the parish of Concordia, consisting of land, negroes, stock and farming utensils, was sold at public sale by the parish judge, under a decree of the probate court of said parish, to one James McIntosh Williams, for the sum of $218,000, who paid $10,000 in cash, and the residue in drafts and negotiable notes, payable to the heirs of the succession of said Wm. Blunt, secured by mortgage of the property to the heirs of the succession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>William Blunt, and on the same day the same judge by virtue of the same authority, also sold at public sale, the Catahoula estate, also consisting of land, negroes, stock and farming utensils, to one Josias Armstrong Lyle, for $175,000, of which the purchaser paid $10,000 in cash, and the residue in drafts and negotiable notes, payable as above, and also secured by a mortgage on the property to the heirs of the succession of William Blunt. The said Harper and David C. Newcomer, agents in fact of the testamentary heirs of the said William Blunt, were present, and for their principles assented to said sales, and became parties vendors thereto, and the said promissory notes to the amount of the interest of the said heirs of the said James Ringgold Blunt were then delivered to and received by the said Harper as their agent and attorney. The said real estate consisting of land, sold for $182,086, the other estate, (real by the laws of Louisiana,) consisting of negro.es, for $175,658, and the residue of said estate, being personal, for $35,255.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-5\">John A. Lyle, the purchaser of the Catahoula estafe, died in 1840, insolvent and unable to pay the purchase money. His mortgage was foreclosed, and the said estate was sold on the 16,th of February 1841, and purchased by David C. Newcomer, the defendant, in the name and for the heirs, devisees and legatees of the said William Blunt, by virtue of authority to him, duly given by the said heirs, devisees and legatees, and their respective husbands, including Orem, the plaintiff. Williams, the purchaser of the Concordia estate, made partial payments on his purchase, besides the cash payment of $10,000, but a large amount remaining unpaid, the mortgage was foreclosed, in January 1846, and the said estate was then sold and purchased by the said Newcomer for the heirs of the said William Blunt, under the same authority under which the Catahoula estate was purchased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-6\">The Concordia estate was afterwards, and subsequent to the death of the plaintiff\u2019s wife, sold by the said Newcomer, to one John A.

The proceeds of said estate of William Blunt received for rent, and to which the wife of the plaintiff was entitled in her lifetime, were duly paid over to him and her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-6\">There is now in the hands of the defendant, on deposit in Baltimore, the sum of \u00a72572.38, to which the legal representatives of the deceased wife of the plaintiff are entitled as their share of the proceeds of real estate. The sum of $533.41, part thereof, consists of the proceeds of sale of the Concordia estate, which came to defendant\u2019s hands after the death of the wife of the plaintiff, which said estate was sold subsequent to her death. The residue of said sum is the rent and income of the estate in the hands of the defendant, as agent for the heirs, devisees and legatees of said William Blunt. There is also another sum of \u00a7200 arising from the same sources, which came into the hands of the defendant, but which, by the direction of those interested, other than the plaintiff, he has not brought into this State, but has retained in Louisiana. All other money which at any time came to the hands of the defendant as agent as aforesaid, to which the wife of the plaintiff was entitled, was paid over to her and the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-7\">It was agreed, that if upon the above statement of facts, the court should be of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to all or any part of the said sums of money in right of his deceased wife, judgment should be rendered accordingly, otherwise for defendant, it was also agreed, that the counsel in their arguments, and the court in considering the cause might refer to and use the printed and published laws of Louisiana, in the same manner and with like effect as if the same were regularly incorporated into this statement of facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>The court rendered a <em>fro forma </em>judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $20,000, the damages laid in the declaration, and interest and costs.

That her interest in the notes taken by Harper as the proceeds of the sale of William Blunt\u2019s estate was never charged or ascertained, and in the absence of any acts of ownership by Orem over it, (her interest,) proceedings were had to sell the Catahoula estate to pay said notes, and <em>that estate </em>was bought by the defendant for the <em>heirs, devisees and legatees of William Blunt </em>in 1841; and this was done by virtue of a power derived from the plaintiff Orem, and his wife, with others. In like manner proceedings were had to sell the Concordia estate, which was also bought by defendant for the <em>heirs, devisees and legatees of Wm. Blunt. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s wife died in 1844. He never exercised ownership over the notes taken and held by Harper on account of the proceeds of <em>this estate. </em>In the year 1846, by virtue of proper authority, in which Orem and his wife joined in her lifetime, <em>this estate </em>was bought by defendant tor the <em>heirs, devisees and legatees of Wm. Blunt. </em>In this condition it was subsequently sold by defendant after the death of Mrs. Orem, by virtue of a proper authority derived from her in part, in her lifetime, in which the plaintiff below, her husband, joined, and another estate was bought by him for the same heirs, devisees and legatees of Wm. Blunt. The funds in the hands of the defendant are the proceeds of this last sale, and of rents of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>estates in his hands in trust for the heirs, devisees and legatees of Wm.

A statement of the principles applicable to such questions, will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>serve to guide us ia tracing and defining the interest of Mrs. Orem in William Blunt\u2019s estate, down to the commencement of this suit. \u201cWhere there is no express marriage contract, the law of the matrimonial domicil will govern, as to all the rights of the parties to their present property in that place, and as to all personal property every where, upon the principle, that moveables have no <em>situs, </em>and, that they accompany th\u00e9' person. As to immoveable property, the law, <em>rei sita, </em>will prevail. Where there is no charge of domicil, the same rule will apply to future acquisitions, as to present property.\u201d <em>Story\u2019s Gonfl. of Laws, secs. </em>186, 187. And it is, also, a well established principle, that the right and succession to personalty, must depend on the law of the domicil. But the' law of the place where the property is found must be appealed to, in determining whether the estate in question is moveable or immoveable. That being settled, the former passes according to the law of domicil, and the latter according to the <em>lex rei sita. Ditto, secs. </em>447, 481,482, 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">If, therefore, any part, of the fund in controversy was personal at the death of Mrs. Orem, and was not affected by any real law of the State of Louisiana, that is to say, by any law operating upon property, which is the distinction there made, (whether the property be real or personal,) the plaintiff below must recover in respect to such portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">It is unnecessary to inquire, whether the direction in the will of William Blunt, for the sale of the property, effected a conversion or not; because in our opinion, that change took place by the sales in 1837, and the division of the notes of the purchasers among the parties entitled, if not before. The counsel for the appellant relies on the case of <em>Hooke vs. Hooke, </em>14 <em>Louisiana, </em>22, to show, that such eifect was not produced by these proceedings in the present case. The cases are parallel down to the receipt of the notes, by the officer making the sale. But in the one cited, either the notes or the money was brought into court, and at the time the question arose were undivided. And the court said: \u201cThe licitation to effect a partition, although it vested the title in the purchaser, was not a sale as between the heirs; it was merely one of the acts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>partition. That act did not change the nature of the property to be divided; and as the children- of the'first marriage died while that property still remained in a state of indivisi\u00f3n, the rights of the defendants were the same as if no licitation had taken place.\u201d The question there was, whether the shares of two of the heirs who had died in another State pending the proceedings, should- descend according to the law of their domicil, or according to that of the place where the real estate was located. The latter law was allowed to prevail, because the fund was immoveable, not having been divided. But this case is different. The statement shows that the heirs and devisees of William Blunt,.by their agent, were present at, and became parties vendors to, the sale, and that the heirs of James R. Blunt received, by their agent, their shares of the proceeds of sale, in the notes of the purchasers, which were secured by mortgages on the estates. This sale and receipt of notes, changed the legacies into personal demands against the purchasers. It was decided in the case of State <em>vs. Krebs, </em>6 <em>Har. &amp; Johns., </em>31, that under a commissioners\u2019 sale in this State, \u201cthe mutation from realty to personalty may be determined to be complete, when the sale is ratified and the purchaser has complied with the terms of it by paying the money, if for cash, or by giving bonds to the representatives if the sale is on credit;\u201d and that such bond, passed to a wife, is a <em>chose in action. </em>The notes in this case were made \u201cpayable to the heirs of the succession of William Blunt,\u201d and the heirs of James R. Blunt taking <em>per stirpes-, </em>received notes to the amount of their interest. We suppose that a ratification of the sale can.not be necessary, when the sale is made by the parish judge himself, and not by commissioners or a trustee, as in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">. The property having undergone this change, we are of \u25a0opinion, that the interest of Mrs. Orem ceased to be governed by the laws of Louisiana, and became subject to those of their domicil, by virtue of which, the husband is the owner of the wife\u2019s <em>chases in action, </em>subject to the rights- of survivorship. This appears to be co'nsistent with the decision in the case of <em>Packwood\u2019s Succession, </em>9 <em>Robinson, </em>438, where a wife re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>moved to New York, after having acquired an interest in the community of <em>acquests and gains </em>during her residence in Louisiana. She died in New York, and the court held that the price or value of her share of the community, which her husband had sold during her lifetime, was a debt due from the husband to her estate: but that it was due to her in New York and not in Louisiana, and could not be administered as part of her estate in Louisiana, because it attached itself to her, at her domicil, and was distributable according t-o the laws of New York. It had been merged in a debt which was subject to the controlling influence of the laws of their common domicil. In contemplation of law, it was not in Louisiana at the time of Mrs. P\u2019s death. If a crop raised on the property belonging to the community had been on the place unsold, it may have been likewise common; but its proceeds in money could not be put down as part of her estate to be administered in Louisiana. It must be remembered, that by the laws of that State, those which govern and regulate the community of acquests and gains, are considered real laws. And yet, in the case quoted, the proceeds of the crop were not considered as real or immoveable, because the moment their identity was merged in a debt, the right to the debt was governed by the law of the State where the creditor resided. And so in the case of Hicks\u2019 <em>AArn'r vs. Pope, </em>8 <em>La., </em>554, where a married woman, residing in Louisiana, became entitled to a negro in Alabama by the death of her father, it was held, that the question of property as between the husband and wife, was to be settled by the laws of their domicil. This was said to be a necessary consequence of the doctrine, \u2018-'that <em>in domicilii loco mobilia intelliguntur cxistere. </em>\u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We do not find any thing in the code that regulates the conversion of estates; but it would seem by <em>Art. </em>466, that obligations for the payment of money, though accompanied by mortgage, are moveable. No distinction appears to have been drawn between obligations arising from transactions in regard to moveables and immoveables; nor any provision introduced, by which debts, originating in any source, are made the subject of real laws. Justice Story says, <em>sec. </em>399, <em>Conjl. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>Laws: </em>\u201cIn fact, a debt is not a <em>corpus, </em>capable of local position, but purely a <em>jus </em>incorporate.\u201d And he quotes, with approbation, front <em>Livermore\u2019s Dissertations </em>a passage, illustrative of these principles: \u201cIt was formerly doubted by some, whether personal actions should be considered as moveable, and whether they should not be considered to have a location in the domicil of the debtor. But the common opinion seems to be well settled, that considered actively and with respect to the interest of the creditor and his representatives, they must be considered as attached to the person of the creditor; and this although the payment of the debt is secured by an hypothecation upon an immov.eable property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Having shown, as we think, that th.e interest of Mrs. Orem in William Blunt\u2019s estate became a debt against the purchasers, and that that debt immediately attached itself to the person of her husband, as an incident of the marriage, let us next inquire how it stood at the commencement of this suit. In 1841, the mortgage on the .Catahoula estate was foreclosed, and the property bought in the name and for the heirs of William Blunt, including Mrs. Orem. It nowhere appears, that the plaintiff took any interest or estate in the property so purchased. In this condition it has remained, as far as we are informed, until this time; the parties entitled, including Mr. and Mrs. Orem, receiving their respective shares of the rents and income, up to the period of her death in 18.44. This properly being real, and having been purchased in the names of the heirs, including Mrs. Orem, in her lifetime, we are of opinion, that the rents and income since her death must go to her brothers and sisters, and not to the plaintiff as surviving husband, <em>Art. </em>908, 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The statement of facts, however, leaves the other estate, or rather the notes received on the sale of the Concordia estate, in a different predicament. Mrs. Orem died in 1844. The mortgage on this estate was foreclosed in 1846, and the property purchased in the name and for the heirs, and afterwards resold for $30,000; fifteen thousand of which were invested in another estate. If this debt belonged to the plaintiff in right of his wife, as we suppose, he was entitled to the proceeds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>sale when the claim was realized by a sale of the property, and, the money or proceeds being his, the investment of part thereof in other estate, must, also, enure to his benefit. The plaintiff is, therefore, entitled to judgment for $533.41, for proceeds of sales of this estate made to Sanderson. We do not award him any part of the sum said to be in hand for rents and income; because that amount must have accrued from the land that was sold to Lyle, and afterwards purchased for the heirs, in 1841. The Concordia estate was not sold until January 1846; this suit was commenced in May of that year, and it is not probable that any rents or income had then been received from the land that was purchased by a part of the proceeds of said sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The disposition of the sum of $200, said to have \u201carisen from the same sources,\u201d would depend on the principles heretofore stated, if we could determine how much was received from the sales of the Wakefield property, and what amount on account of rents and income of the Hope estate. In the absence of distinct averments on these points, we do not embrace that sum in our judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In the examination of this case we have considered it as unaffected by the argument of the counsel., in reference to the regulations of the code upon paraphernal and community property. The cases referred to by the appellee\u2019s counsel, do not apply to one like the present. <em>Saul vs. His Creditors, </em>3 <em>Cond. Rep., </em>663, and Coles\u2019 <em>Widow, vs. His Executor, </em>4 <em>Do., </em>146, were decided upon marriages contracted while the <em>Fuero </em>Real\u2014a law of Spain\u2014was in force. Under this law it was immaterial where the parties to the marriage resided. Hut it was repealed in 1828, since which there is no community of acquests and gains, between husband and wife, as to property found in that State, at the dissolution of the marriage, unless the parties reside there. <em>Dixon vs. Dixon, </em>4 <em>La., </em>188. <em>Note to </em>4 <em>Cond. Rep., </em>148.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">And, as to paraphernal estate, we do not find any article in the code, or decision, which declares that the law regulating such property is real, or exempts it from the general rule of public law, to which we have referred, which subjects person<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>alty to the control of the law of the domicil. If the parties to the marriage had resided in Louisiana, the case, probably, would have been subject to a different conclusion; but in a case like the present, her laws cannot have any extra-territorial influence over personal estate.'</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The discussion of the principles involved in the cause was attended with great embarrassment, in consequence of the difficulty of expounding the laws of another State, so different from our own. But we think that the conclusions to which we have arrived, are warranted by the code, and adjudged cases of that State, and the acknowledged rules of public law applicable to such questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\"><em>Judgment reversed, and judgment for the appellee for </em>$&gt;533.41, <em>and interest from May 16th, </em>1846, <em>and costs, to the appellant in this court.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
