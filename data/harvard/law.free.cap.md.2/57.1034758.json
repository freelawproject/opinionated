It is a fiction of law, <em>i. e. </em>a supposition in law for a good reason, against the real truth of the fact, in a matter which possibly may have been actually performed according to that supposition. <em>Law of </em>Forfeiture, 61.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-8\">This fiction, <em>seisina facit stipitem, </em>is founded in public utility, and for the preservation of property; and has been the law in <em>England, </em>ever since the time of <em>Edward </em>I. and has been determined to be so in this state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-9\">The seisin required is not a seisin in law, that is, a right or title to enter, but an actual seisin or possession in fact or <em>deed; </em>and this actual seisin may be by entry of the person, or by his own possession or that of his ancestor\u2019s lessee for years, or by reserving rent from the lessee of the freehold; and such seisin will create him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>an ancestor, or make him a <em>root </em>or <em>stock </em>from which . . all future inheritance by right of blood must be derived,</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGN\">This fiction, <em>seisina facit stipitem, </em>may be destroyed by showing a right in the land, to which title is made by this fiction, from the first purchaser, or from some person between the first purchaser and the person seised, to the claimant; but without deducing a title in the same land to the person claiming, the showing a prior seisin will not avail, because the subsequent seisin will be evidence of a descent from the person before seised ; <em>e. g. </em>by fiction of law, Carroll, from his seisin of <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour, </em>is supposed to be heir of the whole blood to <em>Thomas Cole. </em>If the defendant can show a title from <em>Thomas </em>Cole, or from any one entitled prior to Carroll, (and proof of seisin by such person before <em>Carroll </em>will be sufficient evidence,) the fiction that <em>Carroll </em>is heir to <em>Cole </em>will be destroyed ; but the showing that <em>Cole </em>conveyed to <em>A. </em>before <em>Carroll </em>was seised, will not be sufficient without deducing a title from <em>A. </em>to the defendant, because the fiction will make <em>Carroll </em>heir to <em>A. </em>as well as to <em>Cole. </em>If this was not the case, the fiction would be useless, and the inconvenience intended to be remedied, would still continue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-7\">The defendant sets up no claim to <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour </em>from <em>Thomas Cole </em>or any other person.

It (is impossible for two men to be in possession of the same thing at the same time. Two or more men may possess parts of the same thing, as a tract of land, at one time; but the law will adjudge him in the possession of the whole, who hath the right to the possession of the whole. In other words, the law determines the possession of the man who has no right, to be. the possession of the one who hath the right* -</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-11\">In the present case, <em>Carroll, </em>having possession of part, is in law in the actual possession of. the whole; so as that his heir or devisee may take. But if it be contend-, ed, that he was in possession of <em>Todd\u2019s Range </em>or <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour, </em>so far. as it extends within <em>Todd\u2019s Range, </em>it may be answered, that he claimed <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour; </em>and his possession of the tobacco ground beyond the lines of <em>Todd\u2019s Range, </em>located by <em>Howard, </em>proves that he possessed it as <em>Cole\u2019s Harbo</em>ur.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-12\">We find no.one in possession of <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour as'such, </em>but <em>Carroll </em>and those claiming under him, since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>year 1711. The defendant sets up no7 claim or possesSion to any part of <em>Cole's Harbour.

Suppose <em>Charles Carro llhni </em>never extended a possession at all into <em>Cole\u2019s </em>Harbour, <em>Lunn\u2019s </em>title eould not have been impeached by him on their pwn principles.

If this was the rule, it w.ould be a perpetual subject of <em>discord; </em>for if a man could enter wrongfully and keep possession till his death, he would transmit the estate without controversy to his descendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-7\">The meaning of the rule that the person must make himself heir to the person last seised is, that he must make himself heir to the person last rightfully seised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>that is, when none of the same family had a better right than himself, and when a man is rightfully seised, then he is the stock for the succession of his heirs.

This becoming impossible in process of time, a rule of evidence was substituted as a presumption of such descent, viz. to prove that he was heir to the person who died last seised, which was a presumption of his descent from the first purchaser. 1 <em>Bl.

It is a principle of reason as well as a maxim of law. If it were otherwise, there would be no difference between presumptive evidence and conclusive evidence. <em>Habet presumptio donee probatur in contrarium. </em>To take the rule as a rule of evidence is reasonable; to take it as \u00e1 rule of descent not to he controverted, would be unjust, and be the greatest incentive to wrongful acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-5\">2d. Where a man dies lawfully seised, then he becomes the stock from whom future descents are to be traced, and who take <em>jure representationis. Co. Lift. </em>10. b. For when a man dies seised, you are not to inquire who is the nearest of blood to the person from whom he claims, but who is his own heir, and that heir represents his former ancestor; for the law of descents is not regulated <em>jure propinquitatis, </em>but <em>jure </em>representationis. Example. <em>A. </em>has two sons, <em>B. </em>and <em>C. B. </em>dies leaving a son <em>D. </em>he shall be heir to <em>A. </em>though the younger son is living. This answers 3 <em>Wils. </em>526. and other similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>cases-; Cor .'there the'son. being rightfully seised, becomes the stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az\">But suppose this c\u00e1se had been, that the father of the 'son, or the son himself, had died tortiously seised, would that have prevented any evidence from being given to prove, that though the ancestor died seised, he had not a rightful seisin ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-4\">Suppose, therefore, the evidence had been sufficient to prove that <em>Charles Carroll </em>died seised- of <em>Cole\u2019s Har</em>bour, it could only amount to his being the stock from which his descendants might claim, but would have no operation to prevent others not claiming from him, to dispute his title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYJ\">The plaintiff is mistaken in both points. . 1st. He alleges, that if a man dies seised, nt&gt; proof ought to be admitted that he was wrongfully seised ;. and therefore, unless a title can be shown from him, the title is in his heirs, and those claiming under them.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-6\">2d. That no evidence shall ever be given to prove he was not seised, or if given, that it should have no effect, which amounts .to the same thing. This would be .trying a'cause strangely: 1st. Considering any evidence the plaintiff offers, to prove a seisin as conclusive, without regarding any evidence the defendant produced to prove there was no siich seisin, though it is- a fact triable by \u25a0the Jury. 2d. Turning a rule of evidence into a rule of descent not to be controverted, or in other words, first supposing a seisin, without a full examination of the proofs respecting it, and then giving a construction to such seisin contrary to law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-7\">. In 2 <em>Bl. Comm. </em>209. it is.said, that possession of part creates a seisin, and comes in lieu of the ancient investiture'; but this is only to gain a lawful seisin in fact. The law. 'Casts the inheritance on the heir, which is a seisin in law, and the entry makes a seisin in fact, though the . entry is into part only. <em>Blackstone </em>\u2022 is -.treating of . what circumstances will reduce a precedent seisin in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>law to a seisin in fact, and not what shall amount to an ouster to make a disseisin. Nor does he say if a man dies seised, though such seisin was gained by wrong, it shall prevent a person from showing it was by wrong.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-3\">Suppose <em>Charles Carroll </em>had been seised, yet such seisin is nothing to others, but would only apply to disputes between those claiming as his heir ; as if he had a sister, and a brother had been born after his father\u2019s death, there the rule of <em>possessio </em>fratris, fkc. would apply.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-4\">By their position, if a man has one thousand acres of land, and another buys fifty acres adjoining it, and happens to clear and tend into one acre of the thousand and dies, hisdieir may claim the thousand, under the idea of a dying seised,; and although the party and his ancestors have been in possession, another is to turn him out of possession unless he can show a title from the person dying seised, or trace one regularly from the first patentee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-5\">We have possession; they must show a better title : but any thing may be said to be a better title, if we are. not at liberty to destroy it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-6\">Suppose a suit had been brought against <em>Carroll </em>for a trespass on <em>Cole\u2019s </em>Harbour, could damages have been recovered for more than the extent of his possession ? if not, then there would lie different constructions on it. It is a possession or seisin of the whole if he is to claim, but of part only if he is to lose. There is a warranty in <em>Todd\u2019s </em>deed to Carroll, which shows he only meant to enter under it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-7\">Who would be safe in buying land ? A man encroaches on a small bit of his neighbour\u2019s land, and dies. The neighbour sells, and the purchaser is to be turned out by the heir, under the idea of a seisin.

And any record-evidence to prove or disprove <em>Todd's </em>title to <em>Cole's </em>Harbour, is proper for the Jury. The Jury may find deeds if they will, and may inquire of things alleged to be done before the memory of man. <em>Trials per pais, </em>207, 208. 368. 374.

This is taking it for granted, that <em>Todd </em>was seised in fee of <em>Colds Harbour.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-10\">The plaintiff contends, that <em>Cole's Harbour </em>and <em>Todd's Range </em>are synonymous terms, and are the same tract of land. But suppose <em>Cole's Harbour </em>was not disputed as to its location, and it was admitted to contain only fifty acres, would <em>Carroll </em>be tied down to this, and would he not claim to the extent of the boundaries in his deed of <em>Todd's Range? </em>Suppose also a man resurveys his land, the original containing fifty acres, and the resurvey one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>hundred, and he sells the original tract, will it pass the reSt <em>\u2022</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWY\">it j3 said a deed must be construed according to the intent of the parties. But the intent must be collected from the words of the deed, and if that is expressed, there is to be no construction <em>dehors. </em>If a man devises <em>Green </em>Acre, no evidence shall be admitted to prove he intended to convey <em>White Acre. </em>But if he has two acres, and both are called <em>Green </em>Acre, it is impossible to tell from the will which he meant, and evidence may be given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-5\">A case was cited to have been determined in the General Court, between <em>Norris </em>and Polect, about fourteen years since; where an ejectment was brought for land, which had both courses, distances and bounds. The conveyance contained courses and distances, but not the bounds. It was -held, that the party was not confined to the courses and distances. But that was not a similar case; the land there was mentioned, and that was sufficient. <em>Bac. L. </em>Tracts, 76. But here there are two tracts called by different names, and the question is whether, if a deed conveys the one, it shall pass the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-6\">. People often purchase parcels of larger tracts, and call them by particular names. Suppose a man who had the larger tract purchased in one of those small parcels which had a different name, and sold it again, would the rest of his land pass ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-7\">It is said for the plaintiff, that to make the question, it is essential the lands should be different. The deed to <em>Hurst </em>is for part of <em>Cole's </em>Harbour, and that to <em>Carroll </em>being for the residue of <em>Todd's </em>Range, they must be taken-together; and when <em>Todd </em>describes the land in his deed to Carroll, he does not do it by metes and bounds, but the words of \u201c the whole of the residue,\u201d The residue of what ? Not of <em>Cole's </em>Harbour, but of <em>Todd's Range. </em>Suppose it was a granted point, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>Cole\u2019s Harbour </em>contained less than <em>Todd\u2019s </em>Range, Would <em>Carroll </em>be restricted by <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour ?'</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-3\">As to the intention of the parties, it is plain they had in contemplation to buy and sell <em>Todd\u2019s Range </em>according to the bounds in the certificate of resurvey. Would <em>Carroll </em>have bought under a patent of <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour </em>which appears to have been defective and uncertain, by the patent of <em>Todd\u2019s Range </em>mentioned in his deed? Could <em>Todd </em>entertain any idea that he had any land beyond the bounds of <em>Todd\u2019s Range? </em>If he had, would he not have taken it on a resurvey made purposely to correct former defects ? Even if he had such land, it is plain, neither he nor <em>Carroll </em>knew it. How then could there be an intention respecting an unknown subject ? Every word about intention, then, if it was the same land, must fall to the ground. For any Court to say they are the same land, is undertaking to settle the bounds of them. The plaintiif having failed in proving a title in <em>Carroll </em>as heir to Cole, now contends he has a title to it under <em>Todd\u2019s </em>deed for <em>Todd\u2019s Range.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b83-5\"><em>The </em>Court, refused to give the direction to the Jury prayed by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, because in the first part of the prayer they impliedly request the Court to restrict the Jury to the testimony offered by the plaintiff, only with respect to <em>Charles Carroll\u2019s </em>dying seised of <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour; </em>because the testimony produced by the plaintiff to prove the seisin aforesaid may be believed by the Jury, although they may not believe that fact to be supported by the <em>testimony; </em>and because the Court are of opinion, that the testimony produced by the defendant to controvert the fact of <em>Charles Carroll </em>dying seised of <em>Cole\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>Harbour </em>and not of <em>Todd\u2019s Range </em>only, is proper for the consideration of the <em>Jury; </em>and that the Jury only can determine whether he died seised as aforesaid, which fact is material in making out the plaintiff\u2019s title.</p>\n<author id=\"AJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>(Harrison, Ch.

The Court were of opinion, that the law does not make a man in the seisin or possession of land, heir to another by fiction or supposition ; that conclusions of law are drawn from pre-established facts; and therefore, that when a man made title as heir to another, whether as a lineal or collateral heir, the law would not determine the fact, but he must prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>it; </em>but that, if an entry into land could afford any' presumption of atid under what character or description the person entering was, yet it could only be a presumption of the nature of evidence, and liable to be encountered and destroyed by other evidence; that presumptions of the nature of evidence could only stand till the contrary appeared ; and that suppositions must yield to facts. And the Court accordingly gave their opinion to the Jury, that if, upon the whole evidence submitted to them, they should be of opinion, that the said <em>Charles Carroll </em>last named, died in the seisin of the tract of land called <em>Cole\u2019s </em>Harbour, as the plaintiff has located the same on the plat, and that the said location is true, and that the devisees of the said <em>Charles Carroll </em>after his death, entered in virtue of his will, and were possessed of <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour </em>as located by the plaintiff on the plat, and that the devisees being so possessed, the said <em>Daniel Carroll </em>died in such possession, and that <em>Charles </em>Carroll, who executed the deed to the lessor of the plaintiff, was heir at law to the other <em>Charles Carroll </em>herein named, and that at the time of executing the deed he was possessed in the like manner, the plaintiff hath made -a sufficient title to the part of <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour </em>agreeably to his pretensions, and the Jury ought, accordingly, to find a verdict for the plaintiff. But if the Jury should be of opinion, that the said <em>Charles Carroll </em>died seised only of that part of <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour </em>which lies within <em>Todd\u2019s </em>Range, and that he entered into and was seised of the same as <em>Todd\u2019s Range </em>only, as located by the defendant, or if the Jury should be of opinion, that the said <em>Charles Carroll </em>died seised of <em>Cole\u2019s </em>Harbour, but that the true location thereof does not include any part of the pretensions for which the defendant has made defence, then the Jury ought to find a verdict for the defendant. <em>&gt;**\u25a0\u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\">The plaintiff excepted to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"AeY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>Second exception. </em>In addition to the grants of <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour </em>and <em>Todd\u2019s </em>Range, the plaintiff produced evidence to prove that the land so granted, had always since the grant of the tract of land called <em>Todd\u2019s </em>Range, been held and possessed under the said <em>James Todd\u2019s </em>title, from whence the plaintiff alleged that a title in fee-simple in the said land called <em>Cole\u2019s </em>Harbour, upon a resurvey of which the said grant of <em>Todd\u2019s Range </em>was made, would be presumed in the said <em>James Toddt </em>and the defendant, to encounter the presumption that the said <em>James Todd </em>was seised in fee as aforesaid, offered to prove by a witness, that it was the general reputation, that <em>James Todd </em>entered under authority of his mother under some contract, and not under any other title.

The plaintiff produced evidence, that since <em>Todd\u2019s </em>resurvey, the land was held under <em>Todd\u2019s </em>title j therefore, it was to be presumed, that the plaintiff had a title in <em>Cole\u2019s </em>Harbour, on which the resurvey was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The defendant offered to prove that <em>Todd </em>entered under his\u2019 mother, under some contract, and not under any other title, to encounter the plaintiff\u2019s presump-, tion.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The Court, so far from being wrong in permitting the defendant\u2019s evidence, would act properly in rejecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s evidence. <em>Todd's </em>being seised of <em>Cole's Harbour </em>is nothing to the purpose; for he only conveyed <em>Todd's Range. </em>For what presumption is there, that <em>Carroll </em>had a title in <em>Cole's Harbour ? </em>There was an enrolment law in 167\"4, so that if he had a conveyance, it would probably appear. Would he have purchased <em>Todd's Range </em>if <em>Cole's Harbour </em>lay in it, and he was entitled to <em>Cole's Harbour P Todd's </em>deed to Carroll, so far from inducing a presumption that <em>Carroll </em>had a title to <em>Cole's </em>Harbour, is the strongest presumption against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\">If the Court let the plaintiff\u2019s evidence go to the jury, it is right that the defendant\u2019s evidence go likewise. The plaintiff\u2019s might be rejected as not pertinent to the matter; but if pertinent, any presumption offered by the plaintiff, is in its nature proper to be encountered by evidence on the part of the defendant. This is another attempt to hear evidence only on one side.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">If Lord <em>Manfield's </em>case on presumption, <em>King </em>v. <em>Alston, 5 Burr, </em>is cited by the gentlemen, it may be answered by <em>Almon's Parliamentary Debates, A.

The question is not what estate passed by the grant; if that were the case, the Court might surely determine. Neither is the question what thing passes by the grant; if that were the case, it is equally clear that the Court might direct the Jury. As if the grant were of a tract of land, running certain courses and distances, containing 500 acres, and <em>no </em>more, and such courses and distances should be found to contain 1,000 acres. If the question, at this time of day, could arise upon the construction of such a grant, as to what passed thereby, the Court would be the proper jurisdiction to decide. But the present case appears to be a question merely on the intention of the parties. This intention, from the inconsistent expressions in the grant, is doubtful ; and to discover it, we must resort to such evidence as does not contradict the grant; and this evidence is proper only for the consideration of the Jury. One tiling is certain in the grant, that <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour </em>must run 320 perches before the N. N. E. course of <em>275 </em>perches can commence. This must be the case, or words in the grant, which admit of no doubt or diversity of opinion, must be rejected, and there could be no objection to directing the Jury as to this point. The inconsistent expressions are not doubtful, taken separately; but it seems all cannot be gratified. If one line runs west 320 perches, then the expression, bounding on the <em>NorthWest </em>Branch, is not complied with. On the other hand, if the 320 perches are expended on the <em>North-West </em>Branch, then the expression, running west, is of no significance. The question, then, is merely as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>intent of the- parties respecting <em>location; </em>and that' question, the Jury only can, with propriety, determine, upon such evidence as does not contradict that part of the grant, which, in their opinion of the intention of the parties, must be allowed to stand. As to that part which is to be rejected, it must be then considered as\" no part of the grant, and evidence may therefore be admitted to contradict it. But which part shall stand, and which shall fall, must be left to the Jury, who are to form their conclusions on evidence, to determine on which, is not within the province of the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"b92-4\"><em>Robert Hanson. Harrison, </em>Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AvO\">delivered the. following opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">I have no objection to determining the quality or nature bf the estate that passed from the proprietor to <em>Thomas Cole </em>the patentee, or what <em>land.; </em>and if it were a fixed, rule and the established usage, in questions concerning location, that a patentee and those claiming under him, should only hold land according to. the location that arises from a construction made upon the patent <em>itself, </em>independent of, and in exclusion of, all other proof whatsoever, not appearing upon the face of the patent itself, I should have no objection to taking up the matter of location, and determining upon it. But as this is not the r.ule and established usage in questions upon location <em>; </em>and inasmuch as the fact of location may be settled by other proofs, variant from that which would be setded from a mere construction, arising from a patent itself, independent of, and in exclusion of, all other proof, it is, my opinion, that the Court ought not to. direct the Jury in the case, so far as it concerns location, because their opinion, although founded on one piece of evidence only, might tend to impeach a location, where the location upon the whole proofs offered in a ease, might stand fair and good. I consider location <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>to be a fact, and that it may depend upon many <em>ex post facto </em>acts, such as the entry and possession, &amp;c. of a patentee after the grant, and especially in cases where the expressions in a patent are doubtful, and where the words of a patent admit, in any degree, as in the present case, of what may be called a double location, or a location with two aspects. It is a fixed rule, that every grant and every deed shall be taken and construed most strongly against the grantor, and most beneficially for the grantee. If a grantor uses expressions in his grant which admit of a double location, or a location either in this or that way, it is in the power of the grantee to determine, he being the first agent after the patent granted, by an <em>ex post facto </em>act, <em>his entry and </em>possession, which of the two locations he will have. Hence it is evident, that the point of location may depend upon matter and proofs out of the patent <em>itself. </em>And yet, if the Court were to decide in a case upon the patent alone, they might determine against that location which the patentee had elected to have by his entry and possession, and which the words of a patent, conformably to the rule'of law laid down above, that grants are to be taken most favourably for the grantee, would authorize.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Upon the whole, the Court are of opinion, that they ought not to give the direction prayed by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, so far as it concerns the question of location.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">To this opinion the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\"><em>Fifth exception. </em>In addition to the evidence before offered, the plaintiff produced in evidence several deeds, of the years 1711, 1759 and 1761, from different persons, conveying parcels of the tract called <em>Cole's Harbour, </em>as \u201c part of a tract originally called <em>Cole\u2019s Har - </em>bour, but afterwards resurveyed and called <em>Todd's flange.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"AuR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The plaintiff also produced evidence to prove that the whole of <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour </em>and <em>Todd\u2019s Range, </em>as located by the plaintiff, except so much as is included within the lines of <em>Twin's Tot, </em>as located by the defendant, has ever been held and possessed from the time of the grant of <em>Todd\u2019s Range </em>by the said <em>James Todd </em>and those claiming under him. And the Court having directed the Jury, that if they found these facts to be true, that they might and ought to presume that the said <em>James Todd </em>was seised in fee-simple of the said tract of land called <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour, </em>at the time of obtaining the grant of <em>Todd\u2019s Range; </em>but that the presumption arising from the above facts might be encountered by other evidence on the part of the defendant; but that the evidence then submitted by the defendant not being sufficient to encounter that presumption, they might and ought to determine that the said <em>James Todd </em>was seised in fee-simple of the tract of land called <em>Cole's Harbour. </em>But the Court did not, in this opinion or direction, determine the extent of the said <em>James Todd\u2019s </em>title, with respect to the location of the said tract of land, nor did the Court determine the effect of the defendant\u2019s possession under the title of <em>Turin\u2019s Tot. </em>And the counsel of the plaintiff having further offered evidence to the Jury, to prove that neither <em>James </em>Todd, nor any other person claiming under him, had ever held or possessed any part of the tract of land called <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour </em>lying on the west side of <em>Jones\u2019s Falls, </em>except the said <em>Charles Carroll </em>the father, and those claiming under him, since the time of the said deed from <em>James Todd </em>and wife to the said <em>Carroll.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel prayed the direction of the Court to the Jury, that if they should be of opinion, that the tract of land called <em>Cole\u2019s </em>Harbour, and the tract of land called <em>Todd\u2019s </em>Range, were, at the time of the execution of the said deed from <em>Todd </em>and wife tQ, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>Charles Carroll, </em>reputed, and by the parties thereto taken and esteemed, to be the same, then the said deed <em>was </em>sufficient in law to pass to <em>Carroll </em>all the right and title which <em>Todd </em>had in the tract of land called <em>Cole's Harbour, </em>except so much thereof as is contained and described in the deed from <em>Todd </em>and wife to <em>Hurst.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\">Cooke, for defendant.

Also the act of September, 1704, ch. 4. entitled \u201c an act repealing all former acts of assembly heretofore made, saving what are hereby excepted ;\u201d which act has a clause \u201c saving always to all and every person and persons, whatsoever was his and their just rights and benefits, which he or they had by the former acts of assembly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The counsel for the defendant produced to the Court the following acts of assembly, viz. \u201c An act declaring an act entitled an act, ascertaining the bounds of land to be in force,\u201d passed at a session of assembly held in April, 1706. An act entitled <em>\u201c </em>an act for ascertaining the bounds of land within this province,\u201d passed at <em>June </em>session, 1715. And an act entitled \u201c an act for ascertaining the bounds of land within this province,\u201d passed at <em>April </em>session, 1717. (For the several acts here offered in evidence, see the Appendix.)</p>\n<p id=\"AiS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>The counsel for the plaintiff prayed the opinion and direction of the Court, to the Jury, that the rights and benefits of <em>James Todd, </em>the patentee, and <em>Charles Carroll, </em>who purchased from him, derived under and by the act of 1699, were saved and reserved by the act of 1704, .and that the deed aforesaid, from <em>Todd </em>and wife, to <em>Charles </em>Carroll, conveyed all the right and title which the said <em>James Todd </em>had in <em>Todd's Range, </em>except such part as was sold to <em>Hurst, </em>and that <em>Charles Carroll, </em>notwithstanding the act of 1704, and the acts produced by the defendant, was entitled to the rights and benefits under the act of 1699, as to the extent and quantity of the said land mentioned to be sold to him by the said deed, in the same manner as if the said act of 17.04 had not passed. The plaintiff also produced the said act of 1699, to prove, that by the said law the lines and extent pf the tract called <em>Todd's Range, </em>did include the whole of the tract called <em>Cole's Harbour, </em>at the time of the executing of the deed,</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\"><em>Cooke, </em>for defendant. The plaintiff contends, that the rights acquired under the act of <em>1699, </em>were saved by the act of 1704, and that the deed from <em>Todd </em>and wife to <em>Carroll, </em>conveyed all the right in <em>Todd's Range </em>to. <em>Carroll, </em>as to extent and quantity, as if the act of 1704 had not passed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq7\">The act of 1699 says, \u201c If a certain number of perches be prescribed to run by a creek, river or branch side, and no marked tree, nor certain course expressed, the number of perches shall not be spent away by the several windings of the river, creek or cove, but brought to a straight line of that length.\u201d But <em>Todd's Range </em>calls for a tree, and has a certain course, therefore it is not within the act, and could have no right saved by the act of 1704.'</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>As <em>Toad\u2019s Range </em>is younger than <em>Lunds </em>Lot, there epuld be no right under <em>Todd\u2019s </em>Range, that could affect the proprietor of <em>Lunds Lot. </em>The saving clause, if it js to have any effect, can only operate to confirm those rights which had been ascertained and acknowledged under any of the repealed laws, by some act done. The words are in the preterperfect tense.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">The plaintiff cannot be injured for two reasons. First, the act does not apply where bounds are called <em>for; </em>and, secondly, <em>Lunds Lot </em>is eider than <em>Todd\u2019s Range.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Matter in law is not to be given in evidence, for the Jury are to try only matter of fact. Duncomb, 317. <em>Vaugh. </em>143. A saving in a statute which is repugnant to the purview, is void. 1 <em>Co. </em>47. <em>Plow. </em>564. 1 <em>To. </em>339. 10 <em>Mod. </em>115. There can be no proceedings under a repealed law. 1 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>451. A subsequent law enforcing the provisions of one expired, is void. <em>Burn\u2019s </em>Fust. 281. A cancelled deed is void, and cannot be given in evidence. <em>Het. </em>138. <em>Vin. Evid. </em>106.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">The plaintiff contends, that the act of 1699 is evidence to prove the lines of <em>Todd\u2019s Range </em>did include the whole of <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour. </em>But there was no title proved by the plaintiff to <em>Cole\u2019s </em>Harbour, either by descent or purchase. And the act was repealed by the act of 1704.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">Jenings, for the defendant. Concerning the act of 1699, commonly called the land law, how far it ought to be given in evidence in this cause. This act expired the 15th <em>Aprils </em>1707. <em>Cole\u2019s Harbour </em>was taken up before the and law passed, and <em>Todd\u2019s Range </em>during its continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">In the general repealing law of 1704, ch. 77. there is the following clause : \u201c Saving to all and every person or persons, whatsoever was, and is, their rights and benefits, which he or they had by the former acts of assembly, any thing in this present act contained to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d By ch. 79. of the same session, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the act concerning the bounds of land is declared to be in force. It was revived <em>by the net </em>of 1705, ch. 10. and <em>,iyo6, eh. </em>11;</p>\n<p id=\"AU4\"># General rules of construction applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Statutes on the same subject are to be construed together. <em>Plow. </em>206. 1 <em>Burr. </em>447. 4 Bac. 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">By reviving an act which had been repealed, the repealing act is made of no force. 2 <em>Inst. </em>686. <em>Plow. </em>203, 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">By the statute of 7 <em>Edw. </em>VI. if any treasurer, receiver or minister-accountant, or their deputies, take or receive more than legal fees, he is to be fined. It was held, that though this statute was general in the words, it extended only to the king\u2019s receivers, &amp;c. and a clause in a former statute, 32 <em>Hen. </em>VIII., was resorted to, to.construe the other. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">It was held that general words should be construed as particular words, where the intent was particular. <em>Plow. </em>204, 205. 464. , .</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">Suppose the legislature had said in the continuing acts that they did not mean to include the act of 1699 in the repealing law, therefore they continued it,- would not this satisfy any one ? And yet their meaning, from a construction of the continuing laws, is equally plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">The intent of the legislature is to be collected from all parts of the act. 3 <em>Co. </em>59. b. 4 <em>Bac. </em>648. It is objected, that in cases where two statutes cross one another, yet both shall stand. It may be answered, that this must apply to cases where it is possible. Where two statutes are made together, and one contrary to the other, reasonable construction shall be made. And where the penning of a statute is dubious, usage is a just medium to expound it by, for <em>.jus et norma locjuendi </em>is governed by usage. Usage is the hest interpreter. 2 <em>Rep. </em>81.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">What effect has the repealing law, according to the construction given to it bj\u2019 the plaintiff\u2019s counsel? By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the continuing law, the act of 1699 exists. Does the repealing law give it any other effect ?</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">By their construction, the act of 1699 is repealed, and yet the rules in it are to continue. The continuing laws say the rules in it shall continue. If the repealing law extends to this case, what does it do more than the continuing law ? for this preserves in full force the act of 1699. Therefore it supposes the assembly meant to keep that act in force by the repealing law, and yet immediately after did not know their meaning on the effect of it, and therefore passed another law to the same purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">What was saved in the repealing law ? (if it applies to the act of 1699.) Certainly nothing but what was in it. But every thing in it is continued in force- by the continuing laws. <em>Then </em>what effect has the repealing law ?</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Adjoining lands have been taken up without paying any respect to this law, on the general rule, that a party is to go to his boundary, if proved <em>; </em>if not, to be limited by his course and distance. This law would unsettle every thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\"><em>Carroll </em>bought under boundaries, and he has more land than is contained within <em>Todd's Range.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Suppose a power had been given to the Judges, to decide according to the provisions of the act of 1699, and it was afterwards repealed; would the jury, in such case, be excluded from determining the location ? Suppose there had been no conveyance ; would not the expiration of the law leave every one as they were before it had passed ? Then can the conveyance give a more extensive right than the party himself would have had, if he had not conveyed ? How could he transfer sucha supposed right ? Such right must also have descended, if it could be conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">What necessity was there for <em>Todd </em>to have a resurvey, if the law gave him more land without it ? Certainly the only kind of right given by the act, was to have the rule it established applied so long as it lasted. By their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>argument, a man exempts himself from legislation ; for if he purchases during the existence of a particular law, it can never be altered afterwards. Apply this to <em>Lunn, </em>who took up this land before the law. What right had the legislature to make <em>ex post facto </em>rules to take his land from him ? How could the legislature pass an act for perpetuating bounds, if they had any idea the act of 1699 was in force ? In that act there is a mode pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">This is an attempt to establish a rule, that in all cases antecedent to the expiration of the land law in 1706, the boundaries are to be disregarded, and the course and distance to govern the running. The act of 1723, ch. 8. speaks of lands depending on bounds ; but it seems they must depend on the land law <em>; </em>and if the case does not come within the provisions of that law, then the bounds are to be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">An affirmative act is a repeal of a former affirmative-act, if contrary thereto, although there are no negative words in it. 1 <em>Ray. </em>159, 160. Now, if the repealing Ltw gives greater affirmative rights than the subsequent continuing acts, then it is a repeal of such further rights. There are two continuing acts after the session of 1699.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">If it is objected, that we say the law of 1699 was not repealed by the act of 1704, then the continuing laws are of no effect; for that act being perpetual, and the continuing laws for a particular time, it does not repeal them. <em>T. Raym. </em>397. It may be answered, that this does not ans wer the objection, that a law repealed being revived, that the repealing iaw is destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">The continuing law being for a time, if it does not repeal a perpetual law, yet it shows they did not intend the repealing law should take effect in that case, and to explain their intention, they passed the continuing law, and intended it to operate as a repeal of any construction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>which might arise from the general words of the repealing law, that the act of 1699 was repealed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\">Suppose the law makers present, and they were questioned as to their intention. 4 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>649. Statutes creating a new jurisdiction must be construed strictly. 4 Bac. <em>Abr. </em>653. 1 <em>Stra. </em>258. 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">All the most valuable lands in the country, especially In the lower counties, and the eastern shore, were taken up before the year 1707\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">If the construction of the law given by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel were right, would we be permitted to prove any boundaries of <em>Todd\u2019s Range ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">See the act of 1718, ch. 18. and the former laws for pointing out a different mode for settling boundaries. The law of 1718 is a general law, and relates to|all former surveys.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">It is said to be a hard case, that a person buying under the act of 1699, should not be benefited by it. Is it not equally hard, that people who took up land before the law, (as was the case with <em>Lunn\u2019s </em>Lot,) should be stripped of the property they had before purchased ? By the act of 1723, ch. 28. the boundaries of creeks, &amp;c. are not to be concluded by any former laws. If land, being a junior survey, had been laid out from a boundary of <em>Todd\u2019s </em>Range, would it be permitted, by running <em>Todd\u2019s Range\u2019 </em>without regard to boundaries, so as to take it away under the law of 1699 ? Might it not with equal propriety be contended, that a person who took up land during the existence of the law of 1718, or the other precedent similar laws, should have a right to establish his boundaries by commissioners, as provided for in those laws ?</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel cited the case of <em>Crow\u2019s Lessee </em>v. Scott, of <em>April </em>term, 1751, determined in the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> wherein it was decided, that the proceedings of the commissioners were conclusive evidence. Th-v <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>law was dissented to in 1721. But if the law of 1600 was a constant rule of property, why was the dispute taken up under the commissioners\u2019law of 1718 ? 1</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\"><em>The Court </em>were of opinion, that if <em>James </em>Todd, the patentee, and <em>Charles </em>Carroll, who purchased from him, had any rights and benefits under the act of 1G99, that the same were saved and reserved by the said act of 1704. But they were of opinion, upon consideration of the repealing act in 1704, ch. 77. and the subsequent act of the same session, ch. 79. also another act in 1706, respecting the said act of 1699, that the words in the latter part of the said act of 1704, \u201c saving always to all and every person and persons, whatsoever was his and their just rights and benefits, which he or they <em>had </em>by the former acts of assembly,\u201d repealed by the said act of 1704, can only mean, in the true construction of that law, and-from a construction drawn from analogy in like cases, that interests or estates, acquired under the faith or sanction of preceding laws, and <em>existing </em>at the time of making the said repealing law in 1704, and ascertained by some act done, under the permission or authority of the preceding laws, should be preserved; and that the said words, in the said repealing clause in the act of 1704, do <em>not mean </em>upon any principle of sound construction, that the rules prescribed in the body of the said act of 1699, should be set up as rules of decision, because such \u00e1 construction of the saving clause in the said act, would be in direct opposition to the plain and obvious intent and meaning of the legislature, expressed in the purview and body of the said act, \u201c That all acts of assembly made before <em>(except two particularly therein </em>excepted) should be null and void-\u201d And because the said act of 1699 is <em>repealed,(a) </em>and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u25a0therefore, that no rules prescribed thereby are of efficacy, further than as they may have been adopted. Upon this point they were of opinion, that the point of location between the parties must be determined upon the whole of the evidence adduced by the parties, and that the act of 1009 shall not be read to the Jury. They were also of opinion, that the deed from <em>James Todd </em>and wife conveyed all the right and title which the said <em>Todd </em>had, and could legally and rightfully convey, in the tract of land called <em>Todd\u2019s </em>Range, to <em>Charles Carroll.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"AGR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>(Harrison, Ch.

And the Court were of opinion, that the said repealing act of 1704, \u201c saving to all and every person and persons, whatsoever was his and their just rights and benefits, which he or they had by the said acts,\u201d repealed thereby, can only mean, in the true construction of law, that interests or estates acquired under those acts, and existing at the time of passing the said repealing act, should he preserved; but the saving does not mean, that the rules of construction prescribed by the act of 1699, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>ascertaining the bounds of land, should be preserved under the idea of the said rules being rights and benefits, which any persons had at the time of passing the said repealing act. The said' rules never did confer those interests and estates ; and, therefore, the said rules were not preserved by the saving clause in the repealing act. They were only meant to govern the decision of Juries, with respect to the extent of land contained in certificates and grants, when controversies thereupon should arise-during the existence of the act of 1699. But they never can be considered as rights and benefits, vested in individuals, and comprehended and saved by the saving clause of the repealing act. To give them such a construction as is insisted on by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, would render the repealing clause of no effect, and such a construction cannot prevail without contradicting the established rules for the construction of statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted to the opinions of the Court, on both the bills of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals, where the judgment was <em>affirmed, </em>at <em>October </em>term, IT'S/.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\"> Judge <em>Goldsborough </em>having, previous to his appointment as Judge, been counsel for one of the parties, did not sit at the trial of this cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u0430) See an abstract annexed oF the plat filed in this cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\"> <em>Jenings's </em>notes on this exception states, that <em>Harrison, </em>Ch.
