August 185\u00cd.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-10\">The appellee is the daughter of Caroline, named in the will of Ignatius Bright, and claims to be entitled to her freedom under that will. The said will contains the following clauses: \u201c I will and bequeath my negro woman Caroline, to be and go free at the age of thirty-six years old, both she and her increase, she being at this time seventeen years old..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-11\">\u201cItem.\u2014I will and bequeath my negro boy Joshua, son of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>said Garoline, to be and go free at the age of thirty-six years, he being at this time four months old.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-5\">A provision was made for the widow, but she was dead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">According to the testimony, the petitioner was bom about the year 1830 or 1831. Caroline had other children, some older and some younger than the petitioner. Caroline, the mother, died about the year 1836 or 1837, before she arrived , at the age of thirty-six. At the date of the will she had but one child, the boy Joshua, who is named therein. The testator owned Caroline, and died in possession of her. The will was executed 19th August 1823. A settlement in the orphans court was offered in evidence. Verdict being for the petitioner, the defendant appealed, and upon the exceptions taken, the following questions arise:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-7\">1st. Was Thomas W. Stinchcomb a competent witness? Upon his <em>voir dire </em>he testified, that he had not been paid by the petitioner, or any one for her, for his attendance as a witness ; nor had he received any security for such payment, in any manner, by the petitioner, or any one for her, and that he did not expect to be paid at all for his attendance as a witness, unless the verdict was against the defendant, in which case he expected to be paid by the defendant, although there had been no promise or understanding between them to that effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-8\">2nd. Was the petitioner entitled to her freedom, although Caroline, her mother, did not live until she attained the age of thirty-six years?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-9\">3rd. Was the petitioner entitled to her freedom, until she attained the age of thirty-six years?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-10\">4th. To entitle the petitioner to her freedom, was it necessary for her to offer evidence of the distribution of the balance of the personal estate of the testator, or evidence that the widow abided by his will, or that the administrator <em>cum testamento annexe, </em>assented to the bequest of freedom to Caroline, and her increase?</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b91-11\">This case was argued before Le Grato, C.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AlY\">delivered the- opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">There have been many questions of importance presented and discussed with ability by the respective counsel in this case:, which, in the view we have-, it is unnecessary for us to notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">The petitioner claims her freedom under the will of Ignatius Bright. The items under which the claim is preferred are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">\u201cItem.\u2014I will and bequeath my negro woman Caroline, to be and go free at the age of thirty-six years old\u2019, both she and her increase, she being at this time seventeen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">\u201cItem.\u2014I will and bequeath my negro boy Joshua, son of said Caroline, to be and go free at the age of thirty-six years he being at this time four months old.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-15\">The petitioner is a child of the negro woman Caroline, and was not at the time of the filing of her petition, nor is she now, thirty-six years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-16\">The question then is, can the petitioner, so predieamented, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>be entitled under the will of Ignatius Bright, to her freedom? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The rule o.f construction which obtains in all cases is, that the intention of the1 testator must prevail, unless it be opposed t@&gt; some principle of, or to the policy of the law. This being so,, we are then to determine- what was the intention of the testator, in this respect, as displayed in- that portion of his will which we- have given. It is contended on behalf of the petitioner that, the testator designed to manumit his slave Caroline- when she should attain the age of thirty-six years, and her issue when the-period arrived at which Caroline would be thirty-six years old. To this view we cannot assent. Did the first item which we have- quoted stand alone, there might5 be room, for ingenious, philological discussion as to the intention; of the testator; but, we think, when it is considered in connection, with the succeeding clause; the will of the testator becomes-manifest, and is, that-he designed to manumit Caroline- when she should become thirty-six years old, and, also, to manumit eadi and every of her children when they should respectively attain-, the same age, and not before. We are aware-that this-interpretation of the language is deemed opposed. to that given in <em>Hart vs. Fanny Ann, </em>6 <em>Monroe, </em>49, a case,.in its general character, much resembling the one before us. With all respect for the judgment of that learned court, we cannot admit its authority in this- instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In-the-case before us, wherever Caroline-or her child Joshua are mentioned by name, the age of thirty-six years is clearly and explicitly designated as the age at which each of them is to be entitled to her or his freedom, and from this circumstance but one- conclusion can be properly drawn, and that- is, that he had fixed in his m-ind the age of thirty-six years- as the proper age at' which each of his slaves should go free.- At the time- of the making of his will,, the proof shows Caroline had but one child,. Joshua, .who was then-four months old, and the testator, in framing his will, deals <em>eo nomine </em>with alibis slaves then <em>in. esse, </em>designating, in language beyond all-dispute-^ the age of thirty-six years as that at which each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>them should be entitled to freedom. In the absence of all supposable reason for a different intention in regard to children thereafter to be born, we are forced to give such a construction to the first item of the will which we have quoted, as will conform it to what is the manifest intention of the testator in regard to Caroline and her child, living at the time the will was proclaimed. In doing this, we but indulge the privilege which, it is admitted on all sides, belongs to the court, to transpose the words of the will, so as to make them read in a manner conformable to what appears to be the general and predominating intention of the testator. All the difficulty of interpretation which the first item presents, grows out of the location in it of the words, <em>\u201cboth she and her </em>increase.\u201d Situated as they are in the sentence, the latter clearly is susceptible of two meanings, of the correctness of each of which much may be said; but by transposing these words, so as to introduce them after the word \u201cCaroline,\u201d the whole instrument is made consonant in all its parts, and the wish of the testator effectuated. These words, thus transposed, would make the clause read as follows:\u2014\u201c Item. I will and bequeath my negro woman Caroline, both she and her increase, to be and go free at the age of thirty-six years old, she being at this time seventeen years old-\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In thus translating the will of Ignatius Bright, we give to it not only the meaning of the testator, as we understand it, but also observe the policy of the State as indicated in its legislation. The proof in the cause shows, that Caroline had ether children than the petitioner and Joshua. It is but fair to suppose, that the testator contemplated that Caroline would have children up to the period fixed for her manumission, and it is equally just to suppose, that in regard to the children born within a period near to the time designated for her manumission, that he did not design to cast them unprotected upon the world. The 13th section of the act of 1796, ch. 67, forbids the manumission of any slave who shall not be, at the time of manumission, <em>\u201cable to work and gain a sufficient maintenance and livelihood; </em>\u201cand the Court of Appeals, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><em>Hamilton vs. </em>Cragg, 6 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; John., 18, have recognised the binding force of these words of inhibition on the acts of testators. We are clearly of opinion, that the petitioner is not now, nor was she entitled to her freedom at the time of the filing of her petition. And from this it necessarily follows, that we dissent from the circuit court\u2019s ruling in regard to defendant\u2019s second prayer. This view dispenses with the necessity of our noticing the other points.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and no procedendo awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
