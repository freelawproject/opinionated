In 1716, <em>Catharine </em>married <em>Orlando Griffith, </em>and in 1721 <em>Rachel married Charles Ridgely, </em>On the 30th <em>October, </em>1725, <em>Griffith </em>and wife obtained an act of Assembly vesting the estate to them in fee-simple jointly, with power to convey in the same manner as if it had been devised to the wife in fee by the will aforesaid. On the 14th September, 1726, <em>Orlando Griffith </em>conveyed to <em>Charles Ridgely, </em>but his wife did not execute the deed: she only relinquished her right on examination before two Justices of the Peace. On the 2d <em>February, </em>1744, <em>Charles Ridgely </em>executed a warrant of resurvey, added vacancy, and called the whole <em>Timber </em>Neck.

It is also contended by the plaintiff, that at the time of the acknowledgment of these deeds, <em>Catharine </em>was insane. She died in 1783.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-8\">1st. By the act of Assembly, passed in 1725, c. 17. the estate-tail of Catharine, in a moiety of the premises, was changed into an estate in fee to the husband and wife ia the entirety. The act declares they shall hold in <em>fee-</em>simple, an absolute estate of inheritance, and makes no limitation of the estate in case they die without issue ar the will had done, which gave it to the wife in tail.

The first law whereby they were restrained was the statute of <em>Gloucester, </em>which barred only a tenant by the curtesy from making a warranty, unless he left assets to descend. But all others stood as they did at common law. Then came the statute <em>ds donis, </em>which creates an estate-tail, and restrains the alienation of it; otherwise estates-tail would have been in the same situation as all other estates' at common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-9\">Warranties arc not mentioned in the statute <em>de donis, </em>but the Judges, adopting the rule in the statute of <em>Gloucester, </em>by the equity of the statute <em>de donis, </em>made it necessary that a lineal warranty to bar an estate-tail should have assets to descend. Frcem. 60.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-10\">Antecedent to the statute <em>de donis, </em>the distinction of lineal and collateral warranty was unknown and never heard \u00a9f till a considerable time after this statute <em>; </em>but the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>conveniences of preventing alienation having soon appear-; ed, the construction of the Judges, and other statutes, soon broke the fetters of this kind of inheritance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-3\">The Judges in <em>Taltar am?s </em>case let in common recoveries in <em>lien. </em>Vllth\u2019s time. 4 <em>Hen. </em>VII. c. 24. and 32 <em>Hen. </em>VIII. c. 36. let in alienation by fine. 26 <em>Hen. </em>VIII. c. <em>17. </em>forfeitures for treason; and by 33 <em>Hen. </em>VIII. c. 39. liable to the debts of the king.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-4\">Soon after this the Judges determined that the statute <em>de donis </em>did not provide absolutely against the alienation of estates-tail, but only against the alienation of the donee ; and therefore, that the warranty of any other person descending on the issue in tail without assets, should bar him; and this introduced the collateral warranty. <em>Harg. </em>Co\u00bb <em>Lift. 373. </em>b. <em>note.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-5\">Thus stood the laty until the act of 4 Anne, c. 16. s. 21. which takes away collateral warranty, unless the ancestor is seised of an estate of inheritance in the land at the time of \u2022making the warranty. 2 <em>Bl.

Can the release be better than the deed of 1726, if good. That deed being a deed under the statute of uses, conveyed to <em>Charles Ridgely </em>and Ms heirs all the estate <em>Orlando Griffith </em>had. A release or confirmation to a person having a legal estate cannot confer a greater estate than was before granted. Admit <em>Orlando Griffith </em>to be tenant at will, yet the second deed of release could only enlarge the estate as far as <em>Orlando Griff* fith </em>had it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-9\">\u2022 The second deed can only operate as a release. A release operates in one of four ways; by 1. <em>Mitter le estate.. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number><em>2, Mitter le droit. </em>3. Extinguishment. 4. Enlargement, This release operates as an enlargement, but can only con\u00bb vey as far as <em>Griffith </em>had a right to dispose of the land, that is, all his interest and no more. And this is on the suppo= sJtion that <em>Charles Ridgely </em>was not tenant in common, which he was, and therefore could take no release. Will the release create a greater estate than <em>Orlando Griffith </em>had in the land; devest the estate of <em>Catharine Griffith, </em>and there by work a wrong.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-4\">A warranty cannot operate both as a lineal and collateral warranty. The plaintiff might have inherited from <em>Orlando Griffith </em>if he had survived his mother, but as the mother survived the father, he inherits from his mother, and this is a lineal warranty, because <em>Orlando Griffith </em>had a right, conjointly with his wife, and a chance of the whole if he survived. A warranty by the ancestor, if he had no yight but by disseisin, will bind his issue on the supposition that no ancestor will injure his heir without giving him a recompense or satisfaction. A collateral warranty does not enlarge an estate passed by conveyance, 10 <em>Co. 97. Orlando Griffith </em>could pass no estate but one determinable on his death, if his wife survived. If an estate passes by a conveyance with warranty, it does not enlarge it; but when the estate is avoided or ceases, the warranty ends with it, <em>5 Bac. Abr. </em>449. 10 <em>Co.

The words of the statute of <em>Gloucester </em>does include the present case. The statute of <em>Gloucester </em>is to have a liberal construction, and if the case is within the letter and the mischief of the statute, it should be construed to be within the statute. The first clause pre ents te <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Hants by the curtesy from injuring the heir, and extends to tenants for life. The heir cannot be barred by a convey - ance and warranty made by the father in the life of the mother. This case is within the mischief of the statute of Gloucester, or it is not. If within the mischief, the decision ought to be for the plaintiff. The warranty is lineal, and cannot bar the person claiming from his mother and no <em>% </em>from his father, \\vho made the warranty, The deed of <em>Orlando Griffith </em>either turned the estate of his wife to a naked right, or it did not. If it did, it is a disseisin, and the warranty cannot operate. If it did not, but only passed an estate for the life of <em>Orlando </em>Griffith, then the warranty expired on his death. <em>2 Bl. </em>302.

And further gave in evidence the depositions of the two justices before whom the said deeds were acknowledged, stating that the deeds were not read to the said <em>Catharine </em>by them, and that she was very deaf, and that the said <em>Joshua Griffith </em>received from the said <em>Charles </em>the consideration for which the said deed was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\">The plaintiff further offered in evidence that the said <em>Catharine </em>Griffith, at the time of the execution and acknowledgments of the said deeds had not sufficient reason and understanding to make a deed to convey land or dispose of property; and offered further to prove this fact by hearsay; and that the said <em>Joshua Griffith, </em>some little time after the execution and acknowledgments, did declare, that he was present at the execution of the said deeds and acknowledgments thereof; that his mother, the said Catharine, knew nothing- of it; that he g-uided her hand and transacted the whole business, and that she had not at that time sufficient reason and understanding to convey her hand or to make a deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">To this evidence, so offered to be given, the defendant objected, and the Court (Johnson, Ch.

So that the nature of <em>Orlando Griffith\u2019s </em>estate enabled him, even by a mere conveyance to uses, to pass a base fee in the entirety, defeasible by a subsequent entry of those who had right.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\"><em>Third point. </em>The first deed (in 1726) will make the person entering under it <em>(Charles </em>Ridgely) tenant at will to <em>Orlando Griffith.

And a release to a tenant at will is good. <em>Shep. </em>Touchst. 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">The two deeds then, taken together, operate as a transfer of a base fee in the entirety to <em>Charles Ridgely; </em>so that unless Mrs. Griffith, in her life-time, (after her husband\u2019s death,) did actually enter and avoid, <em>Charles </em>Ridgely, or those claiming under him, had at the time of her death abase fee, which could only then be avoided by the entry of her heir. But</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\"><em>Fifth point. </em>The heir could not enter and avoid, because he was rebutted by the warranty contained in the deed of 1752.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-15\">Warranties are to be favoured. <em>5 Bac.

The warranty therefore is <em>lineal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Let us now consider, then, whether as a lineal warranty it will bind under all the circumstances of the case.

His warranty rebutted in all possible instances, that by disseisin excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">As this is unquestionably the general rule, we must endeavour to discover whether the present case comes within any known exception to it; and</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">1st. It was objected in the court below, that this warranty is void, <em>quia it commenced by </em>disseisin\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">I answer. To constitute a <em>xvarranty by disseisin </em>is impossible where no disseisin exists: for to make such a warranty, it is necessary not only that there should be a disseisin committed, but that it should be committed by the ancestor warranting, or that he should at least be a party to it. And again, tha; the warranty and disseisin should be <em>simitl and semel, </em>or at least that the disseisin should have been with intent to make the warranty, and <em>quasi uno tempore </em>with the warranty. 2 <em>Bl. Comm. </em>302. <em>Lift, </em>sect. 698, 699. 702. <em>Co. Lin. </em>367. a. 369. b. (bottom.)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\"><em>Examples. </em>The son purchases land and lets to the father for years or at will. The father enfeoffs another with warranty. The feoffment is a disseisin to the son, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>warranty therefore void. <em>Litt. sect. </em>698. So if the father be tenant by elegit, or statute, of the son\u2019s land, and make a feoffment with warranty. <em>Litt. sect. </em>698. So if the father be tenant for years, with remainder to the son in fee. 2 <em>Bl. Comm. </em>302. So if the father disseise the son by an entry and ouster, with intent to enfeoff with warranty. <em>Co. Litt. </em>367. a.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\">All these warranties are void, because either a previous disseisin is committed <em>by the </em>ancestor, <em>with the express intent </em>of enfeoffing with warranty, which, if after-wards done, the law couples on account of the intent, with the disseisin, or the very deed in which the warranty is con\u00bb tained operates in itself as a disseisin.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">But in our case, <em>Orlando Griffith </em>disseised nobody, either previously to his release, or <em>by </em>it. He could not make a disseisin as to his moiety, because he was seised of the inheritance himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">To disseise tlv. heir was impracticable at any rate, for living' his ance.-.iors he had nothing in die premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">This could not, therefore, be a <em>zvarranty commencing by</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Sidy. It was also objected in the Court below, that this wmrainy is inoperative on the heir upon another ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">1st- That a release is an equitable conveyance, and transfer' \u00bbo more than the party had a right to pass; and that of coursi <em>Criando </em>Griffith, by his release to <em>Charles </em>Ridgely, om&gt; transferred an estate for his own life. 2 <em>Burr. 704 </em>\u2014 715. 10 <em>Co. </em>96,</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">2d. That a warranty is only commensurate with the estate to which it is annexed, for that it cannot enlarge an estate, and ceases with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">I answer as to the first position. It might he contended that it is not law to the extent laid down, agreeably to the authorities already cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">I might argue that it is true a release without more does not toll an entry, as a feoffment does, after the determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>tion of the estate which the grantor had a right to pass 5 hut that an estate granted by a release or bargain and sale, continues till avoided by entry. That the true difference is this: if a man having only a defeasible or limited estate conveyS jn fee by reieaS(J or bargain and sale, the person having right may enter on the expiration of the grantor\u2019s right, and avoid, but the estate continues until so avoided. But if, instead of a release or bargain and sale, <em>afeoffment </em>is used, the estate cannot be avoided by an entry, but only by judgment in a real action. In a word, that the feoffment works a discontinu anee, which the release, or bargain and sale, without more, does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">But it is totally immaterial, <em>quacunque via </em>data, for let the operation of a release (as an equitable conveyance) be what it may, unconnected with a warranty, yet when so connected, it has all the effect of a feoffment to pass a fee, and equally produces a discontinuance. <em>Gilb. </em>Tenures, 120. <em>Harg. Co. Litt. </em>(note) 330. b. <em>Litt. sect. </em>601. <em>Salk. </em>245. 8 <em>Vin. </em>513, 514, 515. 517. 523, 524, 525, 526. 532, 533. 2 Reeves, 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The reason is obvious. The release passes a defeasible fee, avoidable by entry, and the warranty annexed rebuts the entry. For it is to be understood that a warranty passes no right in itself, but merely rebuts the right of another. <em>Shep. Touch. </em>327. 5 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>447.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The principles contained in this objection would be ex-tremelyjust and applicable if the warranty was distinct from the release, and not inserted in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">As it stands, it is no objection at all, for at common law the release of tenant by the curtesy, or even of an ancestor <em>having no interest at all </em>with a 'warranty annexed, was a complete rebutter to the heir. This is proved by the <em>statute of Gloucester </em>of 11 <em>Hen. </em>VII. and by <em>Co. Litt. </em>385. 387. <em>Litt. sect. </em>738. <em>Shep. </em>181. 327. <em>Co. Litt. </em>265. 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">When it is said in the books that a warranty cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>enlarge an estate, the meaning is where the warranty is not contained in the deed creating the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Thus, if a deed without warranty passes no more than a life estate, no subsequent warranty operating upon or having reference to that deed can enlarge or have effect beyond it. Such is <em>Seymour\u2019s </em>case, 10 <em>Co. 97. </em>which was cited against us, in the General Court, in support of the objection now under consideration. In <em>Seymour\u2019s </em>case there was no discontinuance, because the warranty was not coupled widt the deed. In our case there was a discontinuance for the reverse cause. The fine in <em>Seymour\u2019s </em>case operated on what passed by the deed, and so the warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">But <em>Seymour\u2019s </em>case is fully explained in <em>S Bac. Abr. </em>96 and 2 <em>Burr. </em>704 \u2014 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The rule, too, that a warranty ceases with the estate to which it is annexed, is to be explained in the same manner, 2. <em>e </em>the estate on the face, o\u00ed the deed in which the warranty is contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">As, if the estate be on condition, the warranty is extinguished when the condition is broken. <em>Co. Litt. </em>385. a. 387. a. 10 <em>Co. </em>96. b. And so is 5 <em>Bac. </em>449. (cited against us in the General Court,) \u201c the defeasance of the estate destroys the warrant}.\u201d I take this objection, therefore, not to be supportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">3dl&gt;,. It was also said in the General Court that a warranty never rebuts but where the estate is put to a right, or, in otlu r words, discontinued. This is the true principle of <em>Seymour\u2019s </em>case, and is good law. But here it is proved by the authorities that the estate was discontinued by the release with warranty; and so would it have been in <em>Seymour\u2019s </em>case, had the warranty been inserted in the deed, or the deed and fine had been taken as one conveyance, as in 2 <em>Burr. </em>704 \u2014 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">4 hly. It was also said that none but <em>collateral </em>warranties barred at common law, where the party warranting could not rightfully transfer the interest warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"A7n\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>I answer. I should like to hear a reason for this distinction, because I can think of none myself but what \u00b0Perates against it. <em>Litt. sect. </em>704. 706. are both lineal warranties where ancestor had nothing in the premises, and yet goodj and so are all the cases in <em>Littleton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">5thly. It was also said that lineal warranty only bars where the heir claims under the title of the warranting ancestor, and in this case he claims <em>ex parte materna.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">I answer. This would destroy the definition of lineal warranty, \u201c may by possibility.\u201d It is further answered by the authorities in <em>Litt. sect. </em>706, 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">6thly. It was also said that there could be no release of one tenant in common to another for want of privity, and that therefore our release, and of course the warranty, was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">I answer. This release was to tenant at will, and that is good according to <em>Sheppard </em>before cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">7thly. Another objection was, that the warranty descended before the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\"><em>Co. Litt. </em>371. a. is an answer to this.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">Sthly.-The next and last objection taken to the operation of this warranty at common law was, that <em>it did not bar without assets. </em>And of this opinion were the General Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">I answer. The distinction is between <em>fee </em>and <em>tail. Litt. sect. </em>711, 712. <em>Coke\u2019s Comm. </em>374. a. and b. 5 <em>Bac. </em>441. expressly, and cites <em>Litt. ubi supra. </em>See also, <em>Vaugh. </em>375 3 <em>Com. Dig. </em>432.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">The arguments of counsel, and the opinion of the General Court, were grounded on what is said in 2 <em>Bl. Comm. </em>302. where, although it is positively laid down that a <em>lineal warranty rebuts an heir in fee, </em>without assets, yet this reason is given for it, \u201c for if he (the heir) could succeed in such claim, <em>(i. e. </em>against the warrantee,) he would then have assets by descent, though he had them not before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">In favour of the rebutter without assets, no authority can be more express; but the reason given is to destroy the whole force of the operation itself. Let us examine it.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>1st. The reason assigned by <em>Blackstone </em>only applies to the original introduction of the rebutter. He only means to shew the student his idea of the grounds upon which a lineal warranty was at first held to be a rebutter to the heir without assets. Buthe himself goes onto shew that the rule as to the rebutter was always extended beyond the supposed reason; for it was extended to <em>collateral </em>warranties where it was impossible the reason could have any application. He lays down the rule, and then proceeds to state the cause of its being introduced, but by this he never meant to limit the operation of the rule itself, which he states without any such qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">That the rule has no such limitation, is clear from undeniable authority already cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">2dly. But <em>Blackstone </em>does not assign the true reason. A more simple, and a much more consistent and probable one is given by Lord <em>Coke. (Co. Litt. </em>373. a. <em>Comm, on sect. </em>709.) It is more in the spirit of the times which gave use to these rebutters. \u201c <em>Ncemo prmsumitur alienamposleritatem sum prostulisseP </em>And the same reason is assigned by <em>Blackstone </em>himself, as will be shewn hereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Sdlv. Let the reason of the first introduction of the rule be what it may, it is impossible the doctrine of the General Court can be right.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">The principle contended for, is, \u201c that no lineal warranty was a rebutter at common law, unless where the land warranted, if recovered by the heir, would be assets from the warranting ancestor, and <em>liable on a xvarrantia chartmP</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">If this be the case, all lineal warranties (as rebutters) without assets, are annihilated at once, and no possible case exists, or ever did exist, since the statute of <em>quia emptores,' </em>where they can or could operate; for no instance can be conceived where the land warranted would, if recovered by the heir, be assets from the warranting ancestor, except where the warranting ancestor had good right to convey, and was seised of the fee. But in such a case the deed itself would be a sufficient title without the aid of warranty, and of course the warranty would be to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>tally inoperative as a rebutter. <em>Harg. Co. Litt. </em>(note) 374. b.</p>\n<p id=\"AEn_\">Thus would this doctrine totally destroy the whole force and efficacy of the rule, that a lineal warranty rebuts, withassetSi) an heir jn fee-simple ; for, according to it, a lineal warranty never rebuts but where there is no use for it, <em>i. e. </em>where the ancestor was tenant in fee, and of course had given a good title by his mere deed ; so that, to gratify the reason given in <em>Blackstone's </em>Commentaries, the rule' he lays down is to be subverted, and to be made applicable to not a single case that can be conceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Let us now look into the authorities, and see what are the lineal warranties that have been held to be bars <em>without assets. </em>Are they the cases alluded to by the General Court, <em>i. e. </em>where the land, if recovered, would be assets ? Directly the reverse. And there is not a case in Littleton, upon lineal warranty, that would be law if the General Court are right.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\"><em>Litt. sect. </em>706. \u201c Grandfather, father and son; grandfather is disseised ; the father releases with warranty and dies ; the grandfather dies ; the son is barred by this <em>lineal \u25a0 </em>warranty, because he could not convey the right to the lands but through the father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\"><em>Coke's Commentary. </em>\u201c Here <em>Littleton </em>putteth an example where the son must claim the land as heir to his grandfather, and yet, because he cannot make himself heir to his grandfather, but by his father, it is lineal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\"><em>Litt. sect. </em>707. is another case in point. <em>Coke's </em>commentary thereon: \u201c Here <em>Littleton </em>putteth an example where the heir that is to be barred <em>is not to make his descent by him that made the </em>warranty, as in the case before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">In this case it is clear the land would not have been assets from the elder brother making the warranty, and yetno assets are required to make it a bar. And in all Littleton, \u00aer <em>Coke's </em>Commentaries, there is not a case on lineal warranty operating as a rebutter without assets, where the land, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>if recovered, would have been assets, &amp;c. There is no such case to be found in any authority, because it is impossible it can exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">It is further to be remarked, that no attempt has been made to produce any case recognising the distinction taken by the General Court, except <em>Blackstone\u2019s </em>Commentaries, which is the reverse of their opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">It is plain, then, that assets are not necessary to perfect a lineal warranty at common law,,</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">But let us now consider the cause why warranties were introduced in deeds of alienation, and we shall find that they were not resorted to so much with a view to the yielding other lands in case of eviction, as to produce a rebutter against the heir, whether assets descended to him or not. <em>Vide Dalrymp. Ten, 96 </em>\u2014 1 02.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">It is tv ell known that after feuds became hereditary, and before the statute of <em>Hen. </em>I. c. <em>70, </em>which in part opened the door to transfers of real property, and the statute or <em>quia </em>emptores, which gave the power of unlimited alienation, the feudatory could not aliene his feud for more than his own life, without the consent of his next heir apparent, as well as that of the lord. 2 <em>BL Comm, 287, </em>288.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">A restriction so inimical to all the .objects of commercial and civil intercourse was submitted to with difficulty, and every means devised to evade its operation. With <em>a </em>view to the heir it was found to be practicable, by inserting; in the deed of alienation a covenant real, called a danse o\u00ed warranty, which, descending upon him, rebutted his claim, and thus effectuated the subinfeudation, not by giving a right to the subinfeudatory, which was impracticable, but by repelling the right, of the heir, who alone could hat\u00ab defeated it.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-14\">The justice and propriety of this mode of eluding the strictness of the feudal policy, to the disherison of the heir, were supported by a reason, in all probability, seldom founded in fact, viz. that it was presumable u no ancestor would wantonly disinherit bis next of blood; and. therefore\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>that the heir had received a valuable consideration either in land, or in money which had purchased land, and that this equivalent descended to the heir together with the ancestor\u2019s warranty.\u201d 2 <em>Bl. Comm. </em>301.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">\u201c So that (2 <em>Bl. Comm. </em>301. in continuation) when either an ancestor, being the rightful tenant of the freehold, conveyed the land to a stranger and his heirs, or released the right,in fee to one who was already in possession, and superadded a warranty to his deed, it was held\u201d (on the <em>presumption </em>of assets, not that he really had) \u201c that such warranty not only bound the warrantor, but also his heir: and this, whether the warranty was lineal or collateral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">It appears from this deduction, that the sole object of warranties, in their original, was to rebut the heir from claiming his inheritance from the subinfeudatory of his ancestor ; and that to complete the rebutter, proof of assets was never required, the law in favour of alienations always <em>presuming </em>an equivalent had been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">And if this was so in the original, we have seen that instead of warranties being narrowed in their effect by super-induced restrictions, they were still farther extended with the progress of commerce, until statutes were passed producing alterations. Of this, the almost endless cases on collateral warranty to be found in the books is clear and decisive proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">Before the statute <em>de donis </em>the distinction between lineal and collateral warranties was unknown. That statute introduced it&lt;; and, of course, at common law, the operation of both warranties is precisely the same. See Reeves. And it is admitted that collateral warranties barred without assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">On this part of the case the note in <em>Harg. Co. </em>Litt. <em>373. </em>a. hadsome weight in the court below. I see nothing in it that entitles it to the slightest. Part of that note is obviously not law. Examples: \u201c Without assets the ancestor\u2019s warranty never did, and does not now, bind the heir, except when he takes by purchase.\u201d I apprehend this must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>\u00a1\u2022mean \u201c an obligation to yield other lands on eviction.\u201d If ... so it is true. Rut if the annotator is here speaking with a view to the rebutter, his remark is not true <em>in a single instance </em>at common law, and in <em>few now.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\"><em>^ </em>Did the heir of tenant by the curtes) take by <em>purchase P </em>Did the heir of tenant in dower ? Did the heir take by-purchase in any instance of either lineal or collateral warranty in <em>Coke Littleton P</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">And yet in all these cases the warranty at common law <em>rebutted without assets.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">\u201cUpon inquiry it will be found that the cases where the operation of warranty still remains are reduced to two: 1. Tenant in tail to bar issue with assets ; 2. Tenant in tail to bar those in remainder without assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">I answer that upon inquiry it will be found there is hardly a syllable of truth in the whole of this position. And as it falls in with the course of the argument in this sause, I shall endeavour to shew it.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">1 take it that warranties remain at this day as they were at common law, except so far as they have been altered, by statute. We have already seen the extensive ope* ration of them at common law, and it now remains to consider how far statutes have interfered with, or narrowed, their operation. This inquiry is the more material, as, in the Court below, statutable restrictions were relied on by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in defeasance of this warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">1. The first statute that had any effect on warranties was the statute of Gloucester, 6 <em>Edw. </em>I. c. 3. by which the collateral warranty of tenant by the curtesy either during the wife\u2019s life, or after her death, was declared to be no bar without assets. <em>Hargr. </em>note, <em>ubi sup. </em>2 <em>Inst. </em>292, 293, 294. 3 <em>Bl. Comm. </em>302, 303. 3 <em>Com. Dig. </em>432\u201e 433. <em>Gilb. Ten. </em>141, 142. There may be tenants by the curtesy, living the wife. 2 <em>Bl. Comm. 127.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-18\">2. <em>Statute de </em>donis, 13 <em>Edw. </em>I. c. 1. On the construction whereof, by analogy to the statute of Gloucester, it was held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>that the warranty, of the tenant in tail should not bar the issue <em>without </em>assets, which proves it always did in fee-simple cases. See <em>Gilb. Ten. </em>142. <em>Reeves.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><em>3. </em>Statute 11 <em>Hen. </em>VII. c. 20. makes void the warranty of <em>tenant in dower.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">4. Statute 4 and <em>5 Ann. </em>c. 10. vacates all warranties by tenant for life, and the <em>collateral </em>warranty of any ancestor not having an estate of inheritance in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">These are all the statutes in any manner affecting warranties, none of which, except the statute <em>de </em>donis, with a view to the heir in tail, relate to <em>lineal warranties. </em>Subject to the restrictions and provisions of these statutes, Warranties are now as at common law. It follows, that instead of what is laid down as to the present state of warranties by <em>Hargrave </em>in his note, <em>lineal warranties </em>descending upon an heir in fee-simple have, without assets, as full and complete an operation in all respects as they had at common law. <em>Collateral </em>warranties are indeed much narrowed ; for, except the case of tenant in tail barring those in remainder by his warranty, I do not know a case where collateral warranty without assets would now be a bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">I have shewn, then, that this warranty is a good lineal Warranty, and would bar at common law without assets. I I have also shewn that no statute impeaches it,- or makes assets necessary to its efficacy. It follows that on this part \u00a9f the case the plaintiff was barred of his ejectment, and that therefore the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">But admitting that the warranty did not bar <em>without assets, </em>still it appears from what has been shewn that the plaintiff could not bring ejectment.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">1. To recover in ejectment the plaintiff must have a <em>right of, entry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">2. A discontinuance tolls the entry of the heir.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">3. We have shewn that the release with'warranty discontinued the estate and put it to a right.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>If the tenant in tail releases with warranty, it is no re-butter to the issue if no assets descend. But it still puts him to his formedon. He cannot bring ejectment.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Feoffment with warranty binds the heirs only to render the value <em>as it was at the time of the </em>feoffment. 2 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 129. <em>Co. Litt. </em>32. a. <em>Perk. </em>328.

Otherwise, if the heir of the husband improve after husband\u2019s death, for then she shall have dower of the improved value, <em>quia </em>her title consummate at the husband\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\"><em>On the third hill of exceptions. </em>The sole question on this exception arises on the deeds of lease and release executed by Mrs. <em>Griffith, </em>afterh er husband\u2019s death, to <em>Charles </em>Ridgely, the heir, in 1773, <em>(March </em>9th and 10th,) acknowledged before two Justices of <em>Anne Arundel </em>County, where Mrs. <em>Griffith </em>resided, and recorded in the Provincial Court <em>\u00a1 </em>and the Court below have adjudged them good.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\"><em>By </em>the act of <em>November </em>session, 1766, c. 14, s. 3. it is provided that when the person, &amp;c. making any deed, &amp;c. \u201c shall live remote from the <em>Provincial </em>Court, or out of the County,\u201d See. \u201c such person to acknowledge the same in the County Court of the said County, or before two Justices of the said County, wherein he, she, or they, shall re-, side,\u201d &amp;c. &amp;c. \u201c Such deed or conveyance shall be taken, &amp;c. and shall be as good and valid as if the same had been acknowledged in manner <em>first herein </em>mentioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">And the <em>manner first therein mentioned </em>in the <em>second sec*lion (the first section </em>being merely the preamble) is, that if the deed is acknowledged in the Provincial Court, or before one of the Justices thereof, &amp;c. it may be recorded either in the records of the County where the land lies, or in the records of the Provincial Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AgK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>To give this act a rational construction, it cannot bo presumed that the Legislature meant to confine the recording of such a deed to the County Court, win.-.: all others are permitted to be recorded in the Provincial (now General) Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\">The only argument that can be raised against us is on the words \u201cand such certificate shall be a sufficient warrant for the Clerk of such County where the lands, &amp;c. dolie to enrol,\u201d &amp;c. Had it not been for these words, there could, have been no doubt; and it appears to me they ought to create none. There was a propriety in this provision, and no necessity to say any thing of the Provincial Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">The General Court are supposed to know who are Justices in the several Counties, and who are not, the commissions being all recorded in their records. In another County they are not supposed to know it, and therefore this provision. Had it not been for this provision, the deed could not have been recorded in the County Court at all. The act ought to receive a liberal construction,</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In this case there are four exceptions, one by the defendant, and the others by the plaintiff; and although the Court of Appeals should differ from the General Court on the opinion in favour of the plaintiff, yet if on the other exceptions it appears that the ultimate judgment is right, they will not reverse. <em>Cowp. </em>502. <em>Lord Munsfield\u2019s Opinion. </em>504. J. <em>Ashhurst's Opinion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In our case two titles were brought before the Court, and if on one of these titles we were entitled to a verdict and 'judgment, and it so appears upon the whole record, the Court of Appeals will affirm our. judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">If the judgment is reversed here, the plaintiff can only begin again, for the cause cannot be remanded, having come up before the late act.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b461-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>Martin, </em>Attorney-General, <em>S.
