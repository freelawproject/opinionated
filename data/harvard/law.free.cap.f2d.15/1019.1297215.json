See Re Novo Pathic Co. (C. C. A. 6) 14 F.(2d) 955, Oct. 16, 1926.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-12\">The case illustrates the necessity for insisting upon findings under this rule. It is a petition for a \u201cturnover\u201d order. The evidence of an accountant for the trustee is said to show a shortage; the accountant for the bankrupts shows a loss from sales below costs. This loss is claimed to be'a complete explanation for the shortage, and thus to leave no legal basis for the referee\u2019s conclusion that the bankrupt was keeping property back from the trustee. This depends upon whether the trustee\u2019s accountant\u2019s finding related to property which had not been sold at all, and so must be on hand. Upon this question there is nothing in the record to compel a negative answer, even if we might go to the referee\u2019s certificate for findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-13\">Petition dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
