Pence Company did not pay, and this action was brought on the bond and against the principal and surety thereon, under the Act of August 13, 1894 (28 Stat. 278), as amended (Comp. St. \u00a7 6923).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-21\">As has been often pointed out, nothing but this special statute gives jurisdiction; action on the bond is specially permitted, but for a proceeding of any other kind there .is neither diversity of citizenship nor a sufficient amount involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-22\">It may be admitted that Pence Company committed a breach of contract in not furnishing the agre.ed kind of bond, and also that such breach may give a cause of action to men like Zambetti. But we do not consider as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>new question whether there was a breach of condition of the bond, in that Fence Company had not fulfilled its contract agreement to give a bond that would protect such as Zambetti. The case is within the following decisions: United States v. Stewart (C. C. A.) 288 F. 187, citing Babcock v. American, etc., Co., 236 F. 340, 149 C. C. A. 472, and United States v. Montgomery, etc., Co., 255 F. 683, 167 C. C. A. 59, and we follow those authorities. See, also, for a case where the promise to pay materialmen <em>was </em>inserted in the contract, Peake v. United States, 16 App. D. C. 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
