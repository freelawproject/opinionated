There was a default in the payment of the note, and the stock was sold by the defendant; the proceeds being applied to the payment of the note and the balance deposited to the credit of the husband, who checked out this balance. The good faith of the defendant is not questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-17\">On the part of the defendant it is. contended that, since no title passed by a forged indorsement, the defendant, as the innocent purchaser of the stock, did not acquire and plaintiff did not lose title, and that plaintiff\u2019s remedy is through an action tt&gt; compel Durant Motors, Inc., to reissue to her 50 shares of stock transferred on the forged indorsement. Doubtless plaintiff might have elected to pursue such a course. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Davenport, 97 U. S. 369, 24 L. Ed. 1047. But where, as here, the stock has been sold by the pledgee, and there has been a conversion in the strict sense of the term, the owner may elect to sue for its value. Morton v.
