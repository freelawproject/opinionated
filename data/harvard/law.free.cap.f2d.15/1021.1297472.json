Prom a decree awarding the libelants full damages this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-13\">It is conceded that the submarine was at fault. The sole contention is that the schooner was likewise at fault \u2014 that she also was proceeding at an immoderate speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-14\">After giving due consideration to the extended arguments of counsel and the evidence in the case, we are satisfied that the court below did not err in the particular complained of, and that its decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-15\">The decree of the District Court is affirmed, with costs to the appellees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
