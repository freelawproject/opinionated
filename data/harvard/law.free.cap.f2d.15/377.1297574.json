We think no fault is attributable to the boats in tow that were injured, because, if they had attempted to steer, they could not have affected the drift of the tow. We think the testimony for the boats Catherine and Fallon was sufficient to show that they received some injuries on the reef off Valeour Island.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-18\">Decrees affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
