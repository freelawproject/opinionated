The single question presented is whether a shipowner, on the happening of a general average loss, may insist as a prerequisite to delivery of cargo on the payment to him of a reasonable estimate of the cargo owner\u2019s average share. This right, if it exists, implies the further right to reject any and every other form of security tendered by the cargo owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The argument is based upon the assumption that the shipowner\u2019s maritime lien for general average payable by the cargo is in its nature possessory, and from that word is drawn the conclusion that nothing but cash in hand can deprive the shipowner of possession. The legal origin of the American maritime lien for freight (which includes that for general average) is sufficiently set forth in Wellman v. Morse, 76 F. 573, 22 C. C. A. 318, and The Saturns, 250 F. 407 at page 409, 162 C. C. A. 477, 3 A. L. R. 1187. It is enough for present purposes that the lien is maritime, is enforceable in the admiralty, and is therefore subject to the plastic and equitable treatment of admiralty law.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">It may be admitted that we have derived the lien, not from the privilege of continental law, but the possessory lien of the common .law. But that does not change the modem truth that in the United States the lien for freight and/or general average is maritime, and therefore \u201cnot governed by the strict and technical rules of the common law,\u201d but to be dealt with \u201cupon equitable principles and with reference to the usages and customs of trade.\u201d Bags of Linseed, 1 Black, 108 at page 114 (17 L. Ed. 35).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Therefore the question here is: What equitable considerations arise, and what are the usages and customs of trade in respeet of securing liens for general average? . Until an adjustment is made, the lien under consideration is inchoate; it attaches, but its amount cannot be ascertained until adjusted. The Alliance (D. C.) 64 F. 871, affirmed 79 F. 989, 25 C. C. A. 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">The practical difficulties arising in attempting enforcement of such a demand as this shipowner makes were pointed out in 1896 by Putnam, J., in Wellman v. Morse, supra. That very experienced admiralty judge there said: \u201cThe theoretical remedy of a cash settlement is so impracticable that Lowndes states in substance that something else is imperative\u201d \u2014 and proceeded to agree with Mr. Lowndes\u2019 dictum. We likewise agree. Since 1896, new editions of substantially all the text-books referred to in the Wellman Case have appeared, and all of them set forth in detail the usage and the necessity for bond or deposit, and none recognizes a right in the shipowner to demand payment to him of an estimated amount (however reasonable) in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-16\">We think American usage and law are sufficiently set forth in Mr. Coe\u2019s treatise on the Law and Practice of General Average in the United States. He states (page 77):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMQy\">\u201cAccording to invariable custom in the United States, before the delivery of the merchandise, the consignees sign an average bond or agreement and in addition furnish a satisfactory guaranty. This guaranty is unlimited, and is an absolute obligation to pay any charges for which the particular shipment is liable. It is customary to accept the guaranty of underwriters legally doing business in the United States, or the guaranty of bankers or other satisfactory sureties. When such guaranties are not available, a deposit is made with the trustees named in the average bond, who are usually the average adjusters. <em>\u25a0* </em>* * The deposits taken are placed in trust accounts, and the interest earned on them is credited in the average statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-19\">See, on this general subject, Serutton on Charter Parties (10th Ed.) p. 310; Carver (7th Ed.) p. 606; Gourlie, General Average, pp. 428 and 430; Maclachlan (6th Ed.) p. 560; Abbott\u2019s Law of Merchant Ships (13th Ed.) p. 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-20\">Undoubtedly, if the contributive share of a given cargo owner is neither paid nor secured, the shipowner\u2019s lien permits a retention of possession. But never, we think, has' the shipowner\u2019s right of possession been stated more broadly than as one authorizing retention until the contributive share \u201cis either paid <em>or </em>satisfactorily secured.\u201d United States v. Wilder, 3 Sumn. 308, Fed. Cas. No. 16,694, per Story, J.; Simons v. White, 3 B. &amp; C., 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-21\">Appellant greatly relies on Huth v. Lamport, 16 Q. B. D. 735, affirming 16 Q. B. D. 443. That case held no more than that the conditions of deposit and the form of the bond there required of the consignees were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>\u25a0unreasonable and could not be insisted upon, and Lindley, L. J., pointed out that it was in that case \u201cunnecessary to say whether he (the master) can refuse (to deliver) if reasonable security is offered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">That question is presented here and in the admiralty, and we, treating the maritime lien involved in accordance with the\u2019 usages and customs of trade, answer the question in the negative. It is admitted that the security here tendered (and actually given) is reasonable. Therefore the refusal of the shipowner to deliver the cargo was unreasonable, and this possessory action lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Thus far we have considered merely the rights growing out of the maritime lien, but appellant by its assignments of error also relies upon the fact that the paragraph in the bill of lading under which these goods were carried contains a clause that, in respect of general average, \u201call consignees agree to deposit with the [shipowner] the amount requested by [the shipowner] as a guaranty for the contribution which they may be called to pay in the average adjustment.\u201d The same bill of lading provided that, in ease of general average, \u201cthe adjustment shall be made at Genoa at the request of\u201d the shipowner. The shipowner is an Italian corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">This point has not been stressed in appellant\u2019s argument, and there is no evidence before us except the bald language of the bill. It seems to us that under The Queen of the Pacific, 180 U. S. 56, 21 S. Ct. 278, 45 L. Ed. 419, and many cases following thereupon, we are required to pronounce upon the reasonableness of this proviso in the bill of lading* We think it unreasonable, because it attempts to bind shippers to \u00e1ny amount the carrier chooses to exact, and puts their money at the hazard of the owner\u2019s solvency. Cf. Colton v. N. Y. &amp; Cuba, etc., Co., 17 F.(2d)-, 1925 A. M. C. 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Decree affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
