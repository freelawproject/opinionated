Weyerhaeuser cross-petitions, asserting, as does claimant, that the Board erred in holding it, not EBI, responsible for claimant\u2019s psychological condition after January 8,1985.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Claimant suffered a compensable low back injury in 1972, while working for Weyerhaeuser. After the injury, he had severe emotional difficulties. In May, 1984, a referee found that the 1972 injury materially contributed to claimant\u2019s psychological condition and held Weyerhaeuser responsible. Weyerhaeuser did not appeal the referee\u2019s finding and does not now assert that it is not responsible for claimant\u2019s psychological condition before the events of January 8, 1985, or his back condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In August, 1984, claimant began to work at EBI as a vocational consultant. He told his psychiatrist that he felt unqualified and apprehensive about the position. Because of the driving required by the position, he experienced increased back pain and lost some time from work. He also found the job extremely stressful. On January 8, 1985, he received a telephone call from a client in which the client either threatened to kill claimant or claimant reasonably perceived the caller to threaten that. During the call, he went blank. The next thing he remembers is that he was going down the back stairs of the building and was terribly frightened. He has not worked since.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Claimant sought payments for medical treatment and temporary disability benefits from both Weyerhaeuser and EBI. On February 1, 1985, Weyerhaeuser refused to reopen the 1972 claim on the ground that claimant\u2019s aggravation rights had expired. On April 5,1985, EBI denied the claim \u201cin its entirety\u201d on the ground that claimant\u2019s employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>with EBI had not caused his back condition or psychiatric disabilities but that both conditions predated his employment with it. On June 3,1985, Weyerhaeuser denied responsibility for claimant\u2019s \u201ccurrent psychiatric condition\u201d on the ground that EBI was responsible for \u201ca new injurious exposure.\u201d The denial recited that \u201c[t]he giving of these reasons for the denial do[es] not preclude there being other reasons for denial.\u201d The Workers\u2019 Compensation Department denied claimant\u2019s request for an order under ORS 656.307, partly on the ground that it \u201cread EBI\u2019s denial as one of compensability, not responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Claimant requested a hearing on Weyerhaeuser\u2019s June 3, 1985, denial and on EBI\u2019s April 5, 1985, denial. The referee found that claimant was unable to handle the stress associated with his job at EBI because of his preexisting compensable condition, that the threatening phone call was the culminating event but was not a causative factor in claimant\u2019s worsening and inability to work and that claimant\u2019s employment at EBI did not contribute independently to his psychological condition or cause a permanent worsening of the underlying condition, but was merely the scene where the ongoing preexisting psychological condition manifested itself. He affirmed EBI\u2019s denial. Because claimant\u2019s aggravation rights had expired, he recommended that the Board exercise its own motion jurisdiction and order Weyerhaeuser to provide TTD and PPD benefits because of the exacerbation of the 1972 injury. <em>See </em>ORS 656.278. He also set aside Weyerhaeuser\u2019s denial of June 3,1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Claimant requested, and Weyerhaeuser cross-requested, review of the referee\u2019s order. Weyerhaeuser\u2019s cross-request stated that the^issues for Board determination were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">\u201c1. Compensability of medical services for a low back and psychiatric condition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">\u201c2. Claimant\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Claimant did <em>not </em>argue that his aggravation rights had not expired. Both claimant and Weyerhaeuser, in their briefs before the Board, urged that EBI\u2019s denial be set aside. Weyerhaeuser also urged that the Board reinstate its denial of June 3,1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">The Board adopted the referee\u2019s findings of fact and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>affirmed the order of the referee. It also stated that the issue is responsibility. It ruled that claimant\u2019s worsening was an aggravation of the 1972 injury, for which Weyerhaeuser is responsible. The Board also ruled that claimant was not entitled to an employer paid attorney fee at the Board level. It stated, in part, that, although Weyerhaeuser cross-requested review, \u201cits goal on review was exactly the same as claimant\u2019s \u2014 to have EBI\u2019s denial set aside.\u201d The Board noted that claimant had requested claim reopening by the Board under the provisions of ORS 656.278 if Weyerhaeuser were found to be responsible for claimant\u2019s condition. On its own motion, the Board ordered Weyerhaeuser to reopen the 1972 claim, effective January 8,1985, and to pay claimant temporary total disability until closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">In his petition, claimant assigns as error that the Board upheld EBI\u2019s denial of responsibility for the back and psychological conditions. In its cross-petition, Weyerhaeuser assigns as error that the Board held it responsible for claimant\u2019s psychological condition after January 8, 1985. Weyerhaeuser does not argue that his psychological condition is unrelated to the pre-existing psychiatric condition for which it is responsible or that claimant had not experienced a worsening of that condition that left him less able to work. It argues, however, that the employment at EBI independently contributed to that condition. Both claimant and Weyerhaeuser assert that the psychiatric condition, previously diagnosed as a moderate depression, had become a major depression as a result of his employment at EBI.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We agree with the Board, for the reasons that it gave, that the work at EBI did not independently contribute to claimant\u2019s back and psychological conditions and that Weyerhaeuser is responsible for those conditions, both before and after January 8,1985. We affirm the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Claimant asserts, relying on <em>Travis v. Liberty Mutual Ins., </em>79 Or App 126, 717 P2d 1269, <em>rev den </em>301 Or 445 (1986), that, because Weyerhaeuser initiated a cross-request for review and the Board did not disallow or reduce claimant\u2019s award, he is entitled to insurer-paid attorney fees for services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>at the Board level. ORS 656.382(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Weyerhaeuser first responds that OAR 438-47-075 precludes an award of attorney fees to claimant. We have held to the contrary. <em>Kordon v. Mercer Industries, </em>94 Or App 582, 766 P2d 1050 (1989); <em>Littleton v. Weyerhaeuser, </em>93 Or App 659, 763 P2d 742 (1988). It also asserts that it did not \u201cinitiate\u201d a request for review, <em>citing Saiville v. EBI Companies, </em>81 Or App 469, 473, 726 P2d 394, <em>rev den </em>302 Or 461 (1986), because its cross-request to the Board did not raise any issues that claimant did not raise before the Board. Weyerhaeuser, however, did file a cross-request and that constitutes initiation of a request for review under ORS 656.382(2). <em>Kordon v. Mercer Industries, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Weyerhaeuser also argues that claimant is not entitled to attorney fees before the Board, asserting that the only issue before the Board was responsibility. <em>See Petshow v. Farm Bureau Ins. Co., </em>76 Or App 563, 569, 710 P2d 781 (1985), <em>rev den </em>300 Or 722 (1986). Claimant took the position that EBI was responsible on the ground that he had suffered a new injury, actively litigated that point and filed a brief before the Board. He had a stake in the outcome of that determination. If EBI was responsible, claimant\u2019s TTD would be increased. If EBI was not responsible, and if the Board did not exercise own motion jurisdiction and reopen the 1972 claim, claimant\u2019s claim for his psychological condition after January 8, 1985, other than for medical benefits under ORS 656.245, might not be compensated.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">When claimant participated before the Board, he did not know whether it would exercise own motion jurisdiction. Moreover, when he filed his brief before the Board, claimant knew that, on June 3, 1985, Weyerhaeuser had denied his claim for medical benefits, had not limited its denial to the issue of responsibility and had stated in its cross-request for Board review that one of the issues was \u201ccompensability\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>medical services. Accordingly, his attorney justifiably and actively participated in the proceeding before the Board. <em>See SAIF v. Phipps, </em>85 Or App 436, 737 P2d 131 (1987); <em>Petshow v. Farm Bureau Ins. Co., supra, </em>76 Or App at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Weyerhaeuser is responsible for attorney fees. Contrary to the Board\u2019s interpretation, Weyerhaeuser\u2019s goal before the Board was not exactly the same as. claimant\u2019s. Weyerhaeuser wanted the Board to reinstate its denial of June 3,1985, a request which claimant did not make and which was contrary to his position throughout. Furthermore, review of the referee\u2019s order, which claimant and Weyerhaeuser both requested, included review of the referee\u2019s ruling upholding EBI\u2019s compensability denial. As noted, Weyerhaeuser\u2019s cross-request also stated that one of the issues was compensability for medical services. Accordingly, its cross-request, together with its request for reinstatement of its total denial of June 3, 1985, placed claimant at risk and justified his active participation before the Board. <em>See SAIF v. Bates, </em>94 Or App 666, 767 P2d 87 (1989).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">In Case Nos. 85-05079 and 85-11948: on the petition, reversed as to attorney fees and remanded for award of attorney fees to claimant for services before the Board; otherwise affirmed on the petition and on the cross-petition. In Case No. 85-0050M, affirmed on the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-8\"> Weyerhaeuser petitioned for judicial review of the Board\u2019s own motion order. We consolidated the reviews, and Weyerhaeuser makes no separate argument relating to the Board\u2019s own motion order. Accordingly, we do not separately address the petition for review of that order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-6\"> ORS 656.382(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">\u201cIf a request for hearing, request for review, appeal or cross-appeal to the Court of Appeals or petition for review to the Supreme Court is initiated by an employer or insurer, and the referee, board or court finds that the compensation awarded to a claimant should not be disallowed or reduced, the employer or insurer shall be required to pay to the claimant or the attorney of the claimant a reasonable attorney fee in an amount set by the referee, board or the court for legal representation by an attorney for the claimant at and prior to the hearing, review on appeal or cross-appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b126-6\"> Weyerhaeuser does not argue in its brief that its cross-request was not the cause of claimant\u2019s active participation before the Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
