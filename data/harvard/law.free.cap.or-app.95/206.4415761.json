Orton and Riddle alleged claims for gambling losses, and all plaintiffs alleged violations of the Oregon Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organization Act (ORICO). ORS 166.715 <em>et seq. </em>The trial court struck the unlawful gambling claims that arose more than three years before the filing of the complaint and granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 ORICO claims. It also denied defendant Nyberg\u2019s motion to amend his pleading to claim attorney fees under ORS 20.105. Plaintiffs and Nyberg appeal. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We turn first to a procedural matter. ORS 19.033(2) (a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\"><em>\u201cThe following requirements </em>of ORS 19.023, 19.026 and 19.029 <em>are jurisdictional </em>and may not be waived or extended:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">\u201c(a) <em>Service of the notice of appeal on all parties identified in the notice of appeal as adverse parties </em>or, if the notice of appeal does not identify adverse parties, on all parties who have appeared in the action, suit or proceeding, as provided in ORS 19.023(2)(a), within the time limits prescribed by ORS 19.026.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Jensen\u2019s ORCP 67B judgment specifically excludes her claim against Hainline &amp; Pope, P.C. The record does not show that Hainline was ever served or that it ever appeared in trial proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nonetheless, Jensen named it as an adverse party on appeal but did not serve it with a copy of the notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Before 1985, ORS 19.033(2) provided that a notice of appeal must be served on all parties who have appeared in the action. The statute was amended in 1985 to provide for service only on named adverse parties in order to end the practice of dismissing timely appeals because of a failure to serve parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>who had been dismissed earlier in an action and who had no active interest in the litigation. <em>Rhodes v. Eckelman, </em>302 Or 245, 249, 728 P2d 527 (1986); <em>Maduff Mortgage Corp. v. Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, </em>83 Or App 15, 22, 730 P2d 558 (1986), <em>rev den </em>303 Or 74 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">It would be contrary to the legislative purpose to dismiss Jensen\u2019s entire appeal because of her failure to serve Hainline when Hainline has never appeared in the action, is specifically excluded from the judgment and has no interest in the appeal. We do not believe that the statutes command such a result. ORS 19.033(2) (a) requires service on all parties <em>who appeared </em>in the action, if adverse parties are not named, and refers to ORS 19.023, ORS 19.026 and ORS 19.029 for the requirements that are jurisdictional. None of those statutes requires service of the notice of appeal on a party who has not appeared in the action. It would be anomalous for the statute to require dismissal of Jensen\u2019s entire appeal because Hainline was inadvertently named as an adverse party. We decline to do so. However, because the appeal against Hainline has not been perfected, we dismiss the appeal as to it. We decline to dismiss Jensen\u2019s appeal against the other parties and turn to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Plaintiffs Riddle and Orton assign error to the trial court\u2019s striking of the claims for gambling losses that occurred more than three years before the complaints were filed. They argue that the statutory basis for their claims is ORS 30.780:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\u201cAny person violating ORS 167.117 to 167.162 [criminal gambling statutes] shall be liable in a civil suit for all damages occasioned thereby.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">They argue that the applicable limitation is six years under ORS 12.080(2), which provides that an</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">\u201caction upon a liability created by statute, other than a penalty or forfeiture * * * shall be commenced within six years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Plaintiffs are not correct. Even if a claim under ORS 30.780 is subject to the six-year limitation of ORS 12.080(2), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>they did not bring their claims under that statute. Their complaints seek double damages under ORS 30.740,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which provides for a penalty or forfeiture, <em>see Mozorosky v. Hurlburt, </em>106 Or 274, 198 P 556, 211 P 893 (1923); therefore, on its face, ORS 12.080(2) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The trial court held that the applicable Statute of Limitations is ORS 12.100(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">\u201cAn action upon a statute for penalty or forfeiture, where the action is given to the party aggrieved, or to such party and the state, excepting those actions mentioned in ORS 12.110, shall be commenced within three years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Although defendants did not assign error to the trial court\u2019s determination, at oral argument they postulated that the applicable provision is ORS 12.130:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">\u201cAn action upon a statute for a penalty given in whole or in part to the person who will prosecute for the same, shall be commenced within one year after the commission of the offense * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">We conclude that the limitation is three years under ORS 12.100(2). The distinction between earlier versions of ORS 12.100(2) and ORS 12.130 was pointed out by the Supreme Court in <em>Howe v. Taylor, </em>6 Or 284, 294 (1877):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">\u201c[W]hen the action is given to the party aggrieved to recover a forfeiture under a statute or to the state, with such party three years is the limitation, and when it is given generally to an informer, one year is the limitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Riddle and Olson alleged that they sustained gambling losses. They are \u201caggrieved\u201d parties who may seek to recover twice their losses within three years. <em>See Mozorosky v. Hurlburt, supra, </em>106 Or at 290. The trial court properly struck the claims for losses sustained earlier than that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">Plaintiffs assign error to the trial court\u2019s ruling that their complaints failed to state ultimate facts sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>state a claim under ORICO. ORCP 21A(8). At the pretrial hearing, defendants moved to dismiss on that ground and argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the pleadings fail to show a distinction between the \u201centerprise\u201d and the \u201cperson,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as required by ORS 166.720.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court agreed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judgment of dismissal was entered on the general ground that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim and recited that they had pled their strongest case and did not seek leave to plead over.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Plaintiffs contend that they need not plead a distinction between the person and the enterprise.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendants argue that we can affirm the trial court on any basis sufficient to sustain the judgment, <em>see Rader v. Gibbons and Reed Company, </em>261 Or 354, 365 n 3, 494 P2d 412 (1972), and need not reach the substantive issues of ORS 166.720, because plaintiffs have failed to meet general pleading requirements. Defendants contend that the pleadings must set forth factual allegations which, if proved, would establish plaintiffs\u2019 right to prevail, <em>see Davis v. Tyee Industries, Inc., </em>295 Or 467, 476, 668 P2d 1186 (1983), and that the pleadings do not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"> Plaintiffs must allege facts to show that they are entitled to bring the statutory cause of action. <em>See Demars v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number><em>Erde, </em>55 Or App 863, 640 P2d 635, <em>rev den </em>293 Or 146 (1982). They must allege facts relating to each element of the cause; total omission of a material allegation renders the complaint fatally defective. <em>Fuhrer v. Gearhart By The Sea, Inc., </em>306 Or 434, 442, 760 P2d 874 (1988); <em>see also Baker v. State Bd. of Higher Ed., </em>20 Or App 277, 289, 531 P2d 716, <em>rev den </em>(1975). Facts not alleged are presumed not to exist. <em>See Pickett v. Washington County, </em>31 Or App 1263, 1270, 572 P2d 1070 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">At oral argument, plaintiffs contended that they had stated an ORICO claim by alleging the elements of ORS 167.720: An enterprise consisting of the Lodge, its Board of Trustees and chair officers operated numerous gambling activities, received money from the players, collected unlawful debts, used coercion to collect the debts and, \u201cas a result of the activity,\u201d damaged plaintiffs. However, to show that they have an ORICO cause of action, plaintiffs must not only properly allege the elements of ORS 167.720; they must show that they come within the provisions of ORS 166.725(7)(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">\u201cAny person who is injured by reason of any violation of the provisions of ORS 166.720(1) to (4) shall have a cause of action for three-fold the actual damages sustained and, when appropriate, punitive damages. Such person shall also recover attorney fees in the trial and appellate courts and costs of investigation and litigation, reasonably incurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">A plaintiff may not bring a civil ORICO claim for generalized harm suffered by the world at large. The language of ORS 166.725(7)(a), that a person may claim three-fold the <em>actual </em>damages suffered, gives a cause of action to a particular person for particular damages. In turn, that damage must have resulted from the defendants\u2019 violation of ORS 166.720. Plaintiffs failed to allege the required elements of particular damage and the relationship between defendants\u2019 conduct and that damage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Plaintiffs allege that defendants conducted general ongoing racketeering activity and practiced unlawful debt collection. They then conclusorily state that, as a result of defendants\u2019 activities, they \u201csustained damages.\u201d There are no allegations showing that the damages are personal to them. Plaintiffs alleged that the \u201centerprise\u201d cashed checks made to pay gambling loss, but they do not allege that the checks were made by them or that they were targets of the alleged unlawful debt collection. No facts are pleaded to show that the alleged gambling activities resulted in personal losses. Plaintiffs have alleged that defendant conducted a smorgasbord of gambling activities, but they make no allegations about when or whether they participated in the gambling. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints do not allege facts required by ORS 166.725(7)(a) to show personal damage caused by defendants\u2019 illegal activity. Plaintiffs refused to plead further, and we will not add facts to their complaints. <em>Doyle v. Oregon </em>Bank, 94 Or App 230, 764 P2d 379 (1988). The complaints fail to state an ORICO claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Defendant Nyberg has separately appealed from the denial of'his motion to amend his answer to Riddle\u2019s and Orton\u2019s complaints to include a demand for attorney fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>under ORS 20.105.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The motion was made at the pretrial hearing and, in response, plaintiffs moved to dismiss Nyberg. The trial court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion and denied Nyberg\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Nyberg argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion, because there was no showing of prejudice to plaintiffs and the amendment was not beyond the scope of the issues framed by the original pleadings. <em>See Jackson v. Mult. Co., </em>76 Or App 540, 544, 709 P2d 1153 (1985). We agree. A determination of whether plaintiffs acted in bad faith, wantonly or solely for oppressive reasons would be based on the facts and the series of events that gave rise to plaintiffs\u2019 claims and would not introduce new issues. Nyberg\u2019s motion should have been considered on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">During trial colloquy, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel admitted that, at the time of depositions, apparently months before trial, it was agreed that the claim against Nyberg would be dismissed. Nyberg\u2019s attorney was informed that it would be. Yet it was not until Nyberg\u2019s pretrial motion that plaintiffs moved to dismiss him from the action. Nyberg was thus forced to prepare for trial. Dismissal of the claims against him immediately before trial does not remove the grounds for his motion. The amendment should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Appeal dismissed as to defendant Hainline and Pope, P.C., in CA A46098; judgment reversed as to appellant Nyberg in CA A43857 and in CA A43858 and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-10\"> ORCP 67B judgments were entered on Orton\u2019s second amended complaint, Riddle\u2019s amended complaint and Jensen\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b244-11\"> An attorney apparently representing Hainline was served with copies of some of the pleadings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b246-12\"> ORS 30.740 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-13\">\u201cAll persons losing money or anything of value at or on any unlawful game described in ORS 167.117, 167.122 and 167.127 shall have a cause of action to recover from the dealer winning the same, or proprietor for whose benefit such game was played or dealt, or such money or thing of value won, twice the amount of the money or double the value of the thing so lost.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b246-14\"> ORS 12.130 has been moribund since its earliest version in 1862.

After the Lodge filed ORCP 21 motions, they volunteered to add additional defendants to \u201cmore clearly illustrate the enterprise.\u201d Plaintiffs then filed amended complaints adding the individuals as defendants and adding allegations in the statutory language of ORS 166.720. Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss were argued almost entirely on the ground that a person-enterprise distinction is required under subsection (3). On appeal, plaintiffs appear to have abandoned any contention that their complaints meet the requirements of ORS 166.720(3). They argue that, under ORS 166.720(1) and (2), the person and the enterprise can be the same, but leave unclear why the individual defendants remain necessary parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\"> The result of the trial court\u2019s striking of the gambling claims arising more than three years before the filing of the complaint was that Riddle\u2019s only claim was the ORICO violation. Orton\u2019s action still includes a gambling claim, as well as an ORICO claim. In <em>Dotson v. Smith, </em>307 Or 132, 764 P2d 540 (1988), the Supreme Court considered whether allegations from one claim could be considered in deciding an ORCP 21A(9) motion to dismiss against an alternative claim. The court held that each claim stands alone and must be tested separately. It did not determine whether the same result holds true for other than ORCP 21A(9) motions, but did approve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>reasoning in the dissent in this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">\u201cThe language of ORCP 21A is unclear as to whether allegations may be pulled from one claim to defeat another claim; however, the following reasoning from the Court of Appeals dissent is sound:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">\u201c \u2018ORCP 21A permits certain defenses to be made by motion to dismiss. It begins by prescribing how a pleader is to assert a \u201cdefense, in law or fact, <em>to a claim for relief.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) That wording suggests that each \u201cclaim for relief\u2019 must be considered to be separate for the purpose of analysis under the rule. Further, the court may consider facts that \u201cdo not appear on the face of the pleading and matters outside the pleading\u201d only on motions asserting defenses (1) through (7). Here, the motion asserts defense (9). Read as a whole, ORCP 21A(9) means that each \u201cclaim for relief\u2019 is, in effect, a separate \u201cpleading\u201d when considering a motion under ORCP 21A(9).\u2019 <em>Dotson v. Smith, </em>91 Or App 400, 406, 755 P2d 728 (1988) (Van Hoomissen, J., dissenting.)\u201d 307 Or at 137 n 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The same reasoning applies to an ORCP 21A(8) motion, which does not permit consideration of matters outside the pleadings. We conclude that, as in an ORCP 21A(9) motion, each claim stands alone and must be tested separately. Therefore, we do not consider any allegations of Orton\u2019s gambling complaint which were not realleged in the ORICO claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\"> The allegations against the individuals are even more attenuated than those against the Lodge and give no indication as to how the individuals\u2019 conduct resulted in damage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\"> ORS 20.105(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">\u201cIn any civil action, suit or other proceeding in a district court, a circuit court or the Oregon Tax Court, or in any civil appeal to or review by the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court, the court may, in its discretion, award reasonable attorney fees appropriate in the circumstances to a party against whom a claim, defense or ground for appeal or review is asserted, if that party is a prevailing party in the proceeding and to be paid by the party asserting the claim, defense or ground, upon a finding by the court that the party wilfully disobeyed a court order or acted in bad faith, wantonly or solely for oppressive reasons.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
