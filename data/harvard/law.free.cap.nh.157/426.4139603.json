We vacate and dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The Daines divorced on February 2,2003, pursuant to an order issued by the Littleton Family Division. During the six-month period after then-separation but before the final divorce decree was issued, the defendant lived in the marital residence. During that time, the plaintiff continued to pay the mortgage, taxes and all utilities, including electricity, heating, telephone, rubbish removal, television and internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In 2007, the plaintiff brought a small claims action in Littleton District Court to recover amounts he paid during the pre-divorce separation. Following a hearing, the court awarded the plaintiff $3,317.61 plus his costs of $60.00. The defendant appeals, arguing that the plain language of the final divorce decree makes it clear that the plaintiff was solely responsible for the payments made and that the \u201cDoctrine of Res Judicata, specifically collateral estoppel, should have precluded this case from being heard in Small Claims Court.\u201d We agree that the case did not belong in the Littleton District Court, but for different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u201cThe court\u2019s authority in matters of marriage and divorce is strictly statutory.\u201d <em>Walker v. Walker, </em>119 N.H. 551, 553 (1979); <em>see Rockwood v. Rockwood, </em>105 N.H. 129, 130 (1963). Because divorce is statutory, the court has only such power in that field as is granted by statute. <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>108 N.H. 193,195 (1967). As the New Hampshire Constitution states, \u201cAll causes of marriage, divorce and alimony... shall be heard and tried by the superior court until the legislature shall by law make other provision.\u201d N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Pursuant to RSA chapter 490-D (Supp. 2007), the legislature established the judicial branch family division. <em>See </em>RSA 490-D:l. The statute provides that jurisdiction over, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[petitions for divorce, nullity of marriage, alimony, custody of children, support, and to establish paternity,\u201d are \u201cexclusively exercised through the judicial branch family division as procedurally jurisdiction was previously exercised in the superior . . . court[].\u201d RSA 490-D:2, I. Accordingly, in this state, original jurisdiction is granted to the judicial branch family division regarding divorce matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\u201cThe law is well settled that jurisdiction in divorce proceedings is a continuing one with respect to all subsequent proceedings which arise out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>of the original cause of action.\u201d <em>Stritch v. Stritch, </em>106 N.H. 409, 411 (1965) (quotation omitted). After granting a divorce, the court retains jurisdiction to \u201crevise and modify any order made by it,. .. make such new orders as may be necessary, and... award costs as justice may require,\u201d RSA 458:14 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\u201c[A] court lacks power to hear or determine a case concerning subject matters over which it has no jurisdiction.\u201d <em>In re Matheisel\u2019s Appeal, </em>107 N.H. 479, 479 (1966). \u201cThe issue of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time in the proceedings because it cannot be conferred where it does not already exist.\u201d <em>State v. Polk, </em>154 N.H. 59, 59 (2006) (quotation and brackets omitted). \u201cThus, we may address jurisdictional issues even if they are raised for the first time on appeal, and even if they are not raised by the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\"> \u201cConsent cannot confer jurisdiction where none exists. Whenever it appears that a court has no jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the suit, the proceeding is dismissed, even if no objection is made.\u201d <em>Burgess v. Burgess, </em>71 N.H. 293, 293 (1902). \u201cWhere the objection goes to the jurisdiction of the original tribunal over the subject-matter, the judgment is void, and the appellate tribunal acquires no jurisdiction of the merits upon appeal.\u201d <em>Bickford v. Franconia, </em>73 N.H. 194, 196 (1905).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The parties\u2019 divorce decree, which contains provisions regarding allocation of debt related to the marital homestead, was issued by the Littleton Family Division, which retains continuing jurisdiction. We conclude that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this case. Therefore, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and dismiss the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">\n<em>Vacated and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b468-9\">Dalianis, Duggan, Galway and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
