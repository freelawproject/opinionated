He appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of various witnesses. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">The following facts appear in the record. During the overnight hours of June 24-25, 2006, Denoncourt rode his motorcycle to the Three Cousins Pizza and Bar (Three Cousins) in Manchester. When he arrived he encountered William Hill and Tracey Beardsell outside. Shortly thereafter an argument ensued when Hill asked to ride Denoncourt\u2019s motorcycle, but Beardsell objected because she was concerned about his intoxication. Also, Beardsell and Denoncourt began arguing after she told him that she was concerned about his shirt and that he ought not wear it inside Three Cousins. Denoncourt was wearing what was known as a \u201csupport shirt,\u201d with symbols indicating sponsorship of the Hells Angels motorcycle club. Three Cousins was known as a meeting place for members of a rival group, The Outlaws. Also, Three Cousins had a standing policy prohibiting support shirts and similar clothing. The defendant was a member of the Outlaws. Denoncourt did not remove his shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">At some point, the arguments outside attracted the attention of those inside Three Cousins, and numerous people, including the defendant, exited the bar. Outside the bar a melee began, though it is not clear who was involved. During this fight, several gunshots were fired, one of which struck Denoncourt in the chest. Denoncourt ran, but after approximately 350 feet he collapsed and died. Immediately thereafter, Beardsell ran into Three Cousins and announced that everyone should leave because the Hells Angels would be coming. The bar quickly emptied, and some witnesses reported seeing the defendant depart in a white sport-utility vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The defendant was subsequently indicted on two alternative counts of second degree murder. Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted on both counts. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">\n<em>I. Statements of Cheryl Diabo</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">The defendant contends that the trial court erred in permitting the introduction of a statement to the police by an eyewitness, Cheryl Diabo, in violation of his rights under the State and Federal Constitutions. During trial, the State moved <em>in limine </em>for the admission of Diabo\u2019s June 25,2006 statement to the police in which she identified the defendant from a photographic line-up, as well as her recorded interview with the police on July 24, 2006. The State sought to admit these statements because Diabo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>claimed to have no current memory of the shooting or her interactions with the police. Her memory loss was alleged to be a result of emotional trauma resulting from the unrelated murder of her boyfriend, Mark McManus, some months after Denoncourt\u2019s death. The defendant objected to the admission of both statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The trial court convened a hearing on the motion at which Diabo confirmed that she had lost her memory of Denoncourt\u2019s shooting and her subsequent interactions with police. Diabo\u2019s psychiatrist, Dr. Elizabeth Blencowe, testified that Diabo did not have \u201ctrue\u201d memory problems, and that continued treatment might aid in the recovery of her memory. Dr. Blencowe also opined that while she believed Diabo was not \u201cdeliberately or consciously trying to portray herself as not having memory,\u201d she could not give a professional opinion on whether Diabo was being \u201ccompletely truthful\u201d about her memory loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Following this hearing, the trial court issued an order stating, in part, that it was \u201cnot convinced that [Diabo] does not have a present memory of the circumstances surrounding John Denoncourt\u2019s murder.\u201d Therefore, the trial court did not permit the State to introduce the July 24 recorded interview. The trial court, however, did permit the State to introduce Diabo\u2019s statement of identification during the photographic line-up, but only through the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">In front of the jury, Diabo testified consistently with her testimony at the earlier hearing. After giving some background testimony, Diabo averred that she had no memory of the events surrounding Denoncourt\u2019s murder and that despite reviewing her earlier statements, her memory had not been restored. During cross-examination, the defendant asked only two questions, both seeking information about whether Diabo had been threatened. She answered both questions. The State then, through Detective Joseph Mucci of the Manchester Police Department, introduced evidence that Diabo had identified the defendant in a photographic line-up, that she was nervous about cooperating, and that she had stated she feared retaliation. On appeal, the defendant contends that the introduction of Diabo\u2019s statement of identification violated the State and Federal Constitutions. We deal first with the defendant\u2019s claim under the State Constitution. <em>See State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 232 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">The defendant contends that admitting Diabo\u2019s statement of identification violated his confrontation rights under the New Hampshire Constitution, as well as the New Hampshire Rules of Evidence. While the United States Supreme Court has recently modified its Confrontation Clause analysis, <em>see Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36 (2004), we have not adopted, and neither party argues that we should adopt, <em>Crawford </em>as applicable to claims under the State Constitution. Instead, we have applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>the analysis in <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66 (1980). <em>See State v. Munoz, </em>157 N.H. 143, 148 (2008); <em>State v. Ayer, </em>154 N.H. 500, 511 (2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>128 S. Ct. 63 (2007). As neither party argues for the imposition of a different standard, we confine our analysis to the <em>Roberts </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-3\">Under <em>Roberts, </em>a prior statement of an unavailable hearsay declarant is admissible if it bears adequate \u201cindicia of reliability,\u201d or if there is a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66. Reliability \u201ccan be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">Here, the defendant argues that Diabo was unavailable, but that her out-of-court statement did not fall within New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(C), which he concedes is a firmly rooted hearsay exception. As noted by the defendant, his claims under the constitution and the rules of evidence overlap: \u201cThus, if Evidence Rule 801(d)(1)(C) does not cover the statement, the [trial] court erred in admitting it both under the Rules of Evidence and under the New Hampshire Constitution. Conversely, if that rule covers the statement, Legere\u2019s State constitutional claim and his evidence rule claim alike would fail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\"> Even if we assume that Diabo was unavailable, we would conclude that Diabo\u2019s statement falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. Rule 801(d)(1)(C) of the New Hampshire Rules of Evidence provides that a statement is not hearsay if the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is one of identification of a person made after perceiving the person. This rule \u201crequires only an opportunity for cross-examination; this requirement is satisfied if the declarant testifies and is available for cross-examination, regardless of whether the declarant is actually cross-examined.\u201d <em>State v. Delgado, </em>137 N.H. 380, 382 (1993). \u201cApplication of Rule 801(d)(1)(C) . . . does not hinge on a contradiction between a witness\u2019s in-court and out-of-court statements; it turns on the existence of a statement of identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 382-83. The rule is intended \u201cto address situations where a memory loss makes it impossible for the witness to testify about details of the events underlying an earlier identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383 (quotations and ellipses omitted). \u201cAdmitting only those portions of the prior identification that mirrored a witness\u2019s in-court testimony would likely compound confusion created by omissions or inconsistencies in the witness\u2019s in-court testimony, and frustrate the purpose of the rule.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Here, Diabo made an earlier statement of identification, and was produced for cross-examination at trial. The defendant, therefore, had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>opportunity to cross-examine her, thus satisfying the rule, regardless of whether she was actually cross-examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Citing <em>People v. Learn, </em>863 N.E.2d 1173 (Ill. App. Ct. 2007), the defendant argues that because Diabo\u2019s memory loss was more acute than that of the declarant in <em>Delgado, Delgado </em>is not controlling. We do not agree. First, nothing in <em>Delgado </em>defines a point at which a witness\u2019s memory loss, or professed memory loss becomes so pronounced as to render a prior identification inadmissible. As regards <em>Learn, </em>the rule of evidence at issue there was significantly different from Rule 801(d)(1)(C), making any meaningful comparison difficult. <em>See Learn, </em>863 N.E.2d at 1178. Additionally, the court in <em>Learn </em>determined that the witness did not \u201ctestify\u201d as contemplated by the rule because she did not testify meaningfully to any background information before beginning to cry and then not answering any more questions. <em>Id. </em>Here, in contrast, Diabo did testify to background information and was available for cross-examination and thus satisfied the requirements of the rule. <em>See Delgado, </em>137 N.H. at 382-83. For these reasons, we conclude that Diabo\u2019s prior statement of identification fell within a firmly rooted hearsay exception and, therefore, its admission did not violate the rules of evidence or the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Relying upon <em>Crawford, </em>the defendant next contends that the introduction of Diabo\u2019s identification violated his right to confrontation secured by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In <em>Crawford, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated that the Confrontation Clause\u2019s \u201cultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence\u201d and that this reliability was to \u201cbe assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61. To preserve the goal of reliable evidence tested by cross-examination, the Supreme Court held that testimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial are admissible \u201conly where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59. Here, it is undisputed that Diabo\u2019s identification was testimonial, and that the defendant had no prior opportunity to cross-examine her about it. Accordingly, the admissibility of her statements depends upon whether, despite her physical appearance at trial, Diabo was, in effect, \u201cunavailable\u201d as pertains to a federal Confrontation Clause analysis. Because this is an issue of first impression in New Hampshire, we look to the guidance of other jurisdictions. <em>See State v. O\u2019Maley, </em>156 N.H. 125, 134 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Recently, the Supreme Court of Minnesota addressed this issue on similar facts. In <em>State v. Holliday, </em>745 N.W.2d 556 (Minn. 2008), the defendant was charged with shooting and killing another man. <em>Id. </em>at 560. At trial, the State called A.A. to testify regarding information he gave in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>interviews with the police and the prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 561. After taking the stand, A. A. claimed no memory of his prior discussions. <em>Id. </em>He recalled only that he had talked with someone in the prosecutor\u2019s office, but could not remember the substance of that conversation. <em>Id. </em>The contents of A.A.\u2019s statements were then introduced into evidence through other witnesses. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The defendant argued that admitting A.A.\u2019s statements violated the Confrontation Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 564-65. In conducting a thorough analysis of <em>Crawford, </em>the court noted that \u201c[l]anguage from the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Crawford </em>decision indicates that the admission of a witness\u2019s prior statements does not violate the Confrontation Clause where the witness appears for cross-examination and claims that he or she cannot remember either making the statements or the content of the statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565. Specifically, it relied upon the conclusion in <em>Crawford </em>that \u201cwhen the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements. It is therefore irrelevant that the reliability of some out-of-court statements cannot be replicated, even if the declarant testifies to the same matters in court.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 59 n.9 (quotations and citations omitted); <em>see Holliday, </em>745 N.W.2d at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The Minnesota court noted that the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that the Confrontation Clause does not bar the admission of prior testimonial statements as long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it could be interpreted to mean that the declarant must actually defend or explain the prior statement. <em>Holliday, </em>745 N.W.2d at 565. We agree, however, with the Minnesota court\u2019s conclusion that this</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-7\">interpretation both ignores the fact that the [Supreme] Court\u2019s language still focuses on presence and ability to act without requiring that the record show the declarant actually did defend or explain the statement, and is at odds with the Court\u2019s more explicit assertion that when the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 565-66 (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">The Minnesota court relied, as have other courts, <em>see, e.g., State v. Pierre, </em>890 A.2d 474, 499-500 (Conn.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1197 (2006), upon a line of United States Supreme Court cases beginning with <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149 (1970). In <em>Green, </em>the Supreme Court reversed the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision to exclude, on Confrontation Clause grounds, the testimony of a witness present at trial, but who claimed not to recall the relevant events. <em>Id. </em>at 151-52, 164. In so ruling, it stated that \u201cwhere the declarant is not absent, but is present to testify and to submit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>cross-examination, our cases, if anything, support the conclusion that the admission of his out-of-court statements does not create a confrontation problem.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Following <em>Green, </em>in <em>Delaware v. Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 20 (1985), the Supreme Court, after referencing Justice Harlan\u2019s concurrence in <em>Green </em>that \u201c[generally speaking, the Confrontation Clause guarantees an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish,\u201d concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-6\">the assurances of reliability our cases have found in the right of cross-examination are fully satisfied in cases such as this one, notwithstanding the witness\u2019 inability to recall the basis for his opinion: the factfinder can observe the witness\u2019 demeanor under cross-examination, and the witness is testifying under oath in the presence of the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Thus, the Court concluded that the prosecution\u2019s expert witness testimony was admissible even though he had forgotten the basis for his professional opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 16. The Court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-8\">The Confrontation Clause includes no guarantee that every witness called by the prosecution will refrain from giving testimony that is marred by forgetfulness, confusion, or evasion. To the contrary, the Confrontation Clause is generally satisfied when the defense is given a full and fair opportunity to probe and expose these infirmities through cross-examination, thereby calling to the attention of the factfinder the reasons for giving scant weight to the witness\u2019 testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">In <em>United States v. Owens, </em>484 U.S. 554, 564 (1988), the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause was not \u201cviolated by admission of an identification statement of a witness who is unable, because of a memory loss, to testify concerning the basis for the identification.\u201d Relying upon <em>Fensterer, </em>the Court stated that the opportunity for effective cross-examination</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-11\">is not denied when a witness testifies as to his current belief but is unable to recollect the reason for that belief. It is sufficient that the defendant has the opportunity to bring out such matters as the witness\u2019 bias, his lack of care and attentiveness, his poor eyesight, and even (what is often a prime objective of cross-examination) the very fact that he has a bad memory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 559 (citation omitted). \u201cThe weapons available to impugn the witness\u2019 statement when memory loss is asserted will of course not always achieve success, but successful cross-examination is not the constitutional guarantee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-3\"><em>Crawford </em>neither overruled nor undermined either <em>Fensterer </em>or <em>Owens. See State v. Price, </em>146 P.3d 1183, 1191 (Wash. 2006); <em>State v. Real, </em>150 P.3d 805,807-08 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2007). Indeed, it specifically relied upon <em>Green </em>in concluding that a declarant\u2019s appearance at trial removes all Confrontation Clause constraints on the use of prior testimonial statements. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 59 n.9. As such, <em>Green, Fensterer </em>and <em>Owens </em>remain good law.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">Other jurisdictions considering the issue have also concluded that memory loss does not render a witness unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes. In <em>Pierre, </em>the Supreme Court of Connecticut noted: \u201cThe defendant\u2019s argument equates a declarant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to remember prior statements made to the police with a general unavailability from cross-examination in its entirety.\u201d <em>Pierre, </em>890 A.2d at 498. The court was not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument and concluded that although the witness claimed no memory of his prior statements, he was, nonetheless, available because he was placed on the stand, under oath and responded willingly to questioning. <em>Id. </em>at 501-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Likewise, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine has concluded that \u201ca witness is not constitutionally unavailable for purposes of Confrontation Clause analysis when a witness who appears and testifies is impaired.\u201d <em>State v. Gorman, </em>854 A.2d 1164, 1177 (Me. 2004) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 928 (2005). Thus, a witness who claimed a lack of memory as well as a potential for delusional thoughts due to medication was not deemed unavailable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Accordingly, like most courts that have considered the issue, we conclude that when a witness is presented for cross-examination, the Confrontation Clause does not bar the admission of a prior statement. <em>Accord, e.g., Price, </em>146 P.3d at 644, 650; <em>Real, </em>150 P.3d at 808; <em>Johnson v. State, </em>878 A.2d 422, 428-29 (Del. 2005); <em>People v. Gunder, </em>59 Cal. Rptr. 3d 817, 823-24 (Ct. App. 2007); <em>People v. Sharp, </em>825 N.E.2d 706, 713 (Ill. App. Ct. 2005). <em>But see People v. Learn, </em>863 N.E.2d at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The defendant urges us to distinguish <em>Green, Fensterer, </em>and <em>Owens </em>on the grounds that: (1) there is good reason to doubt the genuineness of Diabo\u2019s claim of memory loss; (2) her claim of memory loss is factually distinguishable from <em>Owens; </em>and (3) there are no \u201crealistic weapons\u201d with which to attack Diabo\u2019s statement. <em>See Owens, </em>484 U.S. at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">First, the defendant argues that \u201c[t]he falsity of Diabo\u2019s claim of memory loss brings this case within the rule of cases finding no adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>opportunity to cross-examine when a witness, properly or otherwise, simply refuses to answer questions at trial.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 420 (1965). However:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-3\">The circumstance of feigned memory loss is not parallel to an entire refusal to testify. The witness feigning memory loss is in fact subject to cross-examination, providing a jury with the opportunity to see the demeanor and assess the credibility of the witness, which in turn gives it a basis for judging the prior hearsay statement\u2019s credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><em>Gunder, </em>59 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 823-24. Moreover, \u201c[t]he feigned or real absence of memory is itself a factor for the trier of fact to establish, but does not render the witness unavailable.\u201d <em>Fowler v. State, </em>829 N.E.2d 459, 466 (Ind. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1193 (2006); <em>see also United States v. Keeter, </em>130 F.3d 297, 302 (7th Cir. 1997) (witness feigning amnesia during trial still subject to cross-examination), <em>cert. denied, </em>523 U.S. 1034 (1998). Regardless of the authenticity of Diabo\u2019s claim of memory loss, because she was present at trial and subject to whatever cross-examination the defense wished to attempt, the jury had the opportunity to assess her credibility and, by extension, the credibility of her earlier statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Second, the defendant argues that because Diabo\u2019s memory loss is more acute than that in <em>Owens, </em>this case is distinguishable from it. While Diabo\u2019s claim of memory loss is more severe than in <em>Owens, </em>we are not persuaded that a contrary result is compelled by that difference. Remembering that a prior statement was made, yet not recalling the reasons for it or the circumstances leading up to it, imparts little, if any, information about the veracity of the declarant that could not otherwise be established or challenged by cross-examination. Thus, we do not agree that the severity of Diabo\u2019s memory loss requires a departure from <em>Owens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Finally, the defendant contends that, in <em>Owens, </em>the defense had \u201crealistic weapons,\u201d <em>Owens, </em>484 U.S. at 560, with which to dispute the reliability of the out-of-court statement, whereas no such dispute could be raised here. We do not agree. Diabo testified at trial about, for example: arriving at the bar with her boyfriend, setting up for her friend\u2019s party in the back room, that the bar was busier than usual that night, that she and her sister cleaned up the back room after the party, that after cleaning up she went out into the main portion of the bar for a drink, that she was drinking \u201cAbsolutQ grapefruit,\u201d and that her boyfriend stayed with her during the course of the evening. The jury had the opportunity to assess her testimony and its reliability and the defendant had the opportunity to confront her about any or all of these recollections. Moreover, the defendant was able to show that which is often a prime objective of cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>examination, that Diabo had a bad memory. <em>See id. </em>at 559. Accordingly, we do not agree that the defendant was without \u201crealistic weapons\u201d with which to test her credibility. For these reasons, we conclude that Diabo was not \u201cunavailable\u201d for purposes of the Federal Confrontation Clause and that her prior statement was not barred by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">\n<em>II. Expert Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The defendant contends that the trial court erroneously admitted certain expert testimony about the Outlaws on the ground that its prejudice substantially outweighed its probative value. Prior to trial, the State filed two motions <em>in limine, </em>to which the defendant objected, seeking the admission of evidence about the defendant\u2019s involvement with the Outlaws, the organizational structure of the Outlaws, the rivalry between the Outlaws and the Hells Angels, and the meaning of the symbols on Denoncourt\u2019s shirt. The State contended that the evidence was relevant to the issues of the defendant\u2019s identity and motive to shoot Denoncourt, as well as the credibility of other testifying witnesses. The first motion was directed at the general admissibility of this evidence. The second was concerned with the admission of expert testimony. It is only the expert testimony that is now at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">The trial court ruled, in relevant part, that it would allow expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">a. Relating to the histories (briefly) of the Hells Angels and Outlaws;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-9\">b. That the Hells Angels and Outlaws have had a violent rivalry, particularly surrounding territorial issues; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-10\">c. The shirt the victim was wearing on June 25, 2006 was a Hells Angels support shirt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">The trial court also ruled that the State could not introduce evidence that the defendant was \u201can enforcer,\u201d in part because it would be highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">At trial, the State\u2019s expert witness, Terry Katz of the Maryland State Police, testified about the Outlaws, Hells Angels and other similar motorcycle groups, and about their size, history and organizational structures. Regarding the Outlaws, Katz testified that there are local chapters organized under the auspices of regional and national bodies, and that unauthorized formation of a club \u201cwould subject you to severe repercussions, to include violence.\u201d He also stated that if a member of the Outlaws did not follow the club\u2019s rules, the consequences range \u201cfrom being fined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>taking a physical beating to be thrown out of the club or taking a beating, all the way up to \u2014 there\u2019ve been homicides for people that have violated the rules.\u201d He also testified to groups like the Outlaws defining themselves as \u201cone percenters,\u201d signifying that they \u201cexist by their own rules, not society\u2019s.\u201d Katz then testified to the various terms used to designate degrees of membership and what it means for a person to be a \u201cfull patch member.\u201d He defined the term \u201cassociates,\u201d in part, by stating that \u201c[t]hey are people that do legal \u2014 or illegal things with [members].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\">Katz next testified about the decades-long antagonistic relationship between the Outlaws and the Hells Angels. He testified that the groups are very territorial, that the territory can include clubhouses, bars and restaurants, and that violence can result from one group\u2019s invasion of another\u2019s territory. He also testified about the different groups\u2019 \u201csupport gear,\u201d that this gear can be obtained in any number of ways, including over the Internet, and that people not associated with the group can and do buy and wear this gear, sometimes without knowledge of its meaning. He then offered the example of a man in Florida who had, unknowingly, worn a Hells Angels shirt to an Outlaws event and was confronted by members of the Outlaws before police intervened to protect him.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Katz also testified that, \u201c[u]nlike what normal people or the average citizen would think of respect, respect in the Outlaw motorcycle gang, in my experience, means fear.... So to be disrespected means you don\u2019t fear me.\u201d Finally, he testified that cases involving the Outlaws are difficult to investigate because witnesses do not want to be involved because they do not want to make an enemy of the Outlaws. He stated that one of the mottos of the Outlaws was \u201cSnitches are a dying breed.\u201d During Katz\u2019s testimony, the defendant raised only one objection. At no point did the defendant request, or the trial court give, a limiting instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The defendant now argues that parts of Katz\u2019s testimony falling into categories (a) and (b), as defined by the trial court, were unfairly prejudicial and should not have been admitted. \u201cWe accord the trial court considerable deference in determining the admissibility of evidence, and we will not disturb its decision absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Yates, </em>152 N.H. 245, 249 (2005). To demonstrate an unsustainable exercise of discretion, the defendant must show that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. <em>Id. </em>\u201cNew Hampshire Rule of Evidence 401 defines relevant evidence as \u2018evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u2019 However, evidence that is relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>Id,.; see </em>N.H. R. Ev. 403.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\">Evidence is unfairly prejudicial if its primary purpose or effect is to appeal to a jury\u2019s sympathies, arouse its sense of horror, provoke its instinct to punish, or trigger other mainsprings of human action that may cause a jury to base its decision on something other than the established propositions in the case. Unfair prejudice is not, of course, mere detriment to a defendant from the tendency of the evidence to prove his guilt, in which sense all evidence offered by the prosecution is meant to be prejudicial. Rather, the prejudice required to predicate reversible error is an undue tendency to induce a decision against the defendant on some improper basis, commonly one that is emotionally charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-6\"><em>Yates, </em>152 N.H. at 249-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The defendant does not challenge Katz\u2019s certification as an expert. Additionally, he acknowledges that expert evidence, at least as is relevant to motive and the credibility of witnesses, is permissible, a view in accord with that of courts around the country. <em>See, e.g., </em>Annotation, <em>Admissibility of Evidence of Accused\u2019s Membership in Gang, </em>39 A.L.R.4TH 775, 776 (1985 &amp; Supp. 2008) (\u201cGang membership has frequently been found to be probative and admissible, for example, as evidence of a possible motive for the crime, particularly in homicide cases where the defendant and his victim are shown to have been members of rival gangs . . . .\u201d). The defendant, however, argues that despite its relevance, parts of Katz\u2019s testimony were sufficiently prejudicial that they ought not to have been admitted. We now turn to the defendant\u2019s specific claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">The defendant first takes issue with some category (a) evidence, specifically Katz\u2019s testimony relating to: (1) what he describes as evidence of the crimes and/or criminal propensities of the Outlaws, apart from that relevant to the rivalry with the Hells Angels or the Outlaws\u2019 capacity to intimidate; (2) \u201cone percenters\u201d who \u201cexist outside society\u2019s rules;\u201d (3) a culture of respect based upon fear; (4) \u201cassociates\u201d who \u201cdo legal \u2014 or illegal things\u201d with full members; and (5) the punishments visited upon those who do not follow club rules. Regarding category (b) evidence, he objects to evidence relating to incidents of violence between the groups where the defendant was not involved, most particularly, the incident in Florida. According to the defendant, this testimony\u2019s probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect, or, if not, there was similar, less prejudicial evidence which made this testimony unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>As to Katz\u2019s testimony about the Outlaws being \u201cone percenters\u201d who exist by their own rules, and who have a culture of respect founded upon fear, with violent retribution for failure to adhere to club rules, and about their lengthy feud with the Hells Angels, we conclude that such testimony was highly probative of both the defendant\u2019s intent and motive, as well as on the issue of witness credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\">Katz\u2019s testimony helped to explain the Outlaws\u2019 code of conduct generally and informed the jury of the manner in which the group would discipline those who violated club rules. It, therefore, provided context for the kind of reaction a member of the Outlaws might have to a person who had ventured into Outlaws\u2019 territory while demonstrating support for a rival club. Moreover, it clarified that it was not simply support for a rival group that was at issue, but support for a group with which the Outlaws had a long, hostile and even violent relationship. The defendant himself believed that the issue of the rivalry was important when, in a recorded telephone call from jail, he stated that he believed the Hells Angels were attempting to downplay the fact that Denoncourt \u201cwas wearing one of their shirts, coming to one of our bars.\u201d As such, this evidence helped to explain an otherwise inexplicable act, <em>ie., </em>the murder of a man for wearing a particular shirt. <em>See Ayala v. State, </em>923 A.2d 952, 961 (Md. Ct. Spec. App.) (the evidence of defendant\u2019s gang affiliation served to explain the otherwise inexplicable by providing a motive for the murder), <em>cert. denied, </em>931 A.2d 1095 (Md. 2007); <em>People v. Gonzalez, </em>25 Cal. Rptr. 3d 124, 133 (Ct. App. 2005) (\u201cThe law does not disfavor the admission of expert testimony that makes comprehensible and logical that which is otherwise inexplicable and incredible.\u201d); <em>State v. Ruof, 252 </em>S.E.2d 720, 725 (N.C. 1979) (evidence of defendant\u2019s affiliation with Outlaws admissible to show motive though motive not an element of the charged offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Furthermore, informing the jury that those who failed to follow the rules faced violent retribution explained why an Outlaws member might react with violence to protect the group\u2019s territory. Evidence that these groups are willing to use violence to enforce their rules, and that there was a need to defend what they believed was their territory, demonstrated a motive for the defendant to violently defend his territory to build respect through fear, and to avoid the risk of being seen as having violated club rules by failing to protect the group\u2019s territory. <em>See People v. Gonzalez, </em>135 P.3d 649, 657 (Cal. 2006) (\u201cIt is difficult to imagine a clearer need for expert explication than that presented by a subculture in which this type of mindless retaliation promotes \u2018respect.\u2019 \u201d (quotation omitted)). As such, Katz\u2019s testimony about the culture of violence and the long-standing feud with rival groups, particularly the Hells Angels, aided the jury in understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>why the defendant might violently retaliate for the perceived slight of wearing a Hells Angels support shirt in Outlaw territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-3\">Additionally, evidence of the Outlaws\u2019 violent nature and disregard for society\u2019s rules was probative on the issue of witness credibility because it explained why some witnesses might be reluctant to cooperate. For example, Detective Mucci testified that Diabo was reluctant to cooperate with the police because she feared retaliation, and other officers testified that they had encountered reluctant witnesses. Even the defendant\u2019s mother, in a recorded telephone call, stated that she was afraid of what might happen to her because she feared retaliation. At trial at least one witness expressed reluctance to be involved for fear of retaliation. \u201cEvidence that a witness is afraid to testify or fears retaliation for testifying is relevant to the credibility of that witness . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>Knowledge of the witnesses\u2019 fears of retaliation coupled with the understanding that such fears were common in cases of this nature would give the jury a basis to evaluate their credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">As to prejudice, we note that the potential for prejudice in the introduction of gang evidence is apparent. <em>See People v. Cruzado, </em>700 N.E.2d 707, 715 (Ill. App. Ct. 1998) (\u201cCourts acknowledge that a strong prejudice against... gangs may exist, particularly in metropolitan areas.\u201d); <em>People v. Davis, </em>779 N.E.2d 448, 456 (Ill. App. Ct. 2002), <em>appeal denied, </em>787 N.E.2d 176 (Ill. 2003). This risk is of particular concern where the evidence is only tangential to the charged offenses. <em>People v. Albarran, </em>57 Cal. Rptr. 3d 92, 99 (Ct. App. 2007); <em>People v. Partida, </em>16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 777, 785-86 (Ct. App. 2004), <em>superseded by People v. Partida, </em>122 P.3d 765 (Cal. 2005). This potential for prejudice, however, does not necessarily make the evidence inadmissible; the question is whether the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. <em>Yates, </em>152 N.H. at 249-50; N.H. R. Ev. 403. The defendant contends that Katz\u2019s testimony was unfairly prejudicial because it attributes a propensity to commit crimes to the Outlaws, and, by extension to the defendant, and because it \u201cfosters in the jury an antipathy toward the Outlaws\u201d and the defendant as a member.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Katz\u2019s testimony was directed at the general functioning of these groups and the history of their rivalry, not at the defendant or any member of his local chapter. While he testified that these groups have a violent past and that they deal harshly with breaches of acceptable protocol, his statements were in the context of explaining the reasons why a member might act violently in upholding club rules and why witnesses might fear being involved. While this evidence was prejudicial, we do not agree that the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed its probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>As for the Florida incident, we find that Katz\u2019s testimony, considered in context, was probative. Katz was asked to explain support gear, what it means for people to wear it, and whether those wearing it understand the potential dangers created by wearing it in \u201crival territory.\u201d It was in this context that he spoke of the Florida incident. His testimony demonstrated the gravity of wearing one club\u2019s clothing in another\u2019s territory. As such, it was probative of the defendant\u2019s motive in confronting Denoncourt for wearing a Hells Angels support shirt in an area understood as belonging to the Outlaws. Additionally, reference to this incident was not unfairly prejudicial because Katz did not mention any violence and did not mention the defendant, or anyone in his local club. He spoke generally about the incident to explain one group\u2019s reaction to another\u2019s support gear.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Next, the defendant objects to Katz\u2019s testimony defining \u201cassociates,\u201d in part, as \u201cpeople that do legal \u2014 or illegal things with [members].\u201d The statement was made in the context of describing the general hierarchy and functioning of the organization and Katz made clear that associates are not members, but are affiliated with a group through their social interactions and relationships with members. Here, many witnesses to the incident were social acquaintances of the defendant, whom they knew to be a member of the Outlaws. Thus, if the jury determined that any witness could be considered an \u201cassociate,\u201d it would have a basis for evaluating that witness\u2019s credibility. While Katz did state that \u201cassociates\u201d do illegal as well as legal things, he did not mention the defendant or any person the defendant knew. Also, as pointed out by the State, acquaintances of the defendant who were at Three Cousins, and who might have been \u201cassociates,\u201d admitted that they might have been using illegal drugs that night, though not with the defendant. Therefore, there was already testimony in evidence of illegal activity by social acquaintances of the defendant, which diminished any potential prejudice from Katz\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Finally, the defendant objects to Katz\u2019s testimony relating to other incidents of violence that did not involve the defendant. Specifically, he objects to Katz\u2019s testimony that \u201c[t]here [have] been homicides where individuals have been killed between the gangs in gang fights. There have been severe beatings, stabbings, assaults. A variety of violence directed against members, and in some cases associates of \u2014 of those two organizations.\u201d Immediately preceding this statement, however, Katz was asked to explain the \u201crelationship of antagonism\u201d between the Outlaws and Hells Angels. As we have already concluded, the rivalry between these groups was probative as to the defendant\u2019s motive to attack a supporter of the Hells Angels. We conclude that its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>25 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>The defendant contends that even if the above-challenged evidence was probative, the State had other, more pertinent evidence and need not have introduced the objectionable portions of Katz\u2019s testimony. As an example, in regard to witness credibility, the defendant argues that Katz testified that witnesses do not want to be involved in cases like this one and it is difficult to get people to cooperate. Thus, there was no need to introduce evidence of the Outlaws\u2019 violence and criminal nature. He makes a similar argument regarding the defendant\u2019s motive. In light of this alternative evidence, the defendant argues that the challenged evidence was minimally probative and unnecessarily cumulative. <em>See State v. Watkins, </em>148 N.H. 760, 768 (2002) (probative value must be considered in the context of its incremental value and the extent to which the issue is established by other evidence). We do not agree that the evidence was as lacking in probative value as the defendant contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-3\">Katz\u2019s testimony about the violent nature of these groups, and that they lived by their own rules and without regard to society\u2019s rules, was evidence not only of why the defendant acted the way that he did, but also why witnesses were not as forthcoming as they might otherwise have been. Had Katz simply testified that the groups were known to be violent or that other people in unrelated incidents might not be cooperative, he would not have given the jury an understanding of the nature of the relationship between the Hells Angels and Outlaws or the degree to which witness intimidation is a factor. We conclude that the challenged evidence was not, as the defendant contends, minimally probative or unnecessarily cumulative, but was highly probative on issues in dispute. Further, had the defendant feared the jury\u2019s use of the challenged evidence when he believed other evidence was available, he could have requested a limiting instruction. He did not do so. For the above reasons, we conclude that the probative value of the evidence challenged by the defendant was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and, therefore, the trial court did not err in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">\n<em>III. Testimony of Detective John Patti</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Finally, in his <em>pro se </em>brief, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting certain evidence about Mark McManus. During trial, Detective John Patti of the Manchester Police Department testified that he interviewed McManus the day after the shooting. Patti testified only that McManus was \u201cshaken up\u201d and was \u201cconcerned for his safety\u201d during the interview. Patti did not relate any of the substance of McManus\u2019 statements. The defendant objected to Patti\u2019s testimony on the ground that it constituted hearsay. The defendant now argues that because McManus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>died prior to trial, admitting Patti\u2019s testimony about McManus violated <em>Crawford, </em>as well as the rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\">As to whether Patti\u2019s testimony violated <em>Crawford, </em>we conclude that the issue has not been preserved. The general rule in this jurisdiction is that a contemporaneous and specific objection is required to preserve an issue for appellate review. <em>State v. Winstead, </em>150 N.H. 244, 246 (2003). The objection must state explicitly the specific ground of objection. <em>Id. </em>The sole objection raised during Patti\u2019s testimony was that his statements constituted inadmissible hearsay. As neither <em>Crawford </em>nor the Confrontation Cause was raised in the trial court as an objection to Patti\u2019s testimony, we conclude that the issue has not been preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">As to the defendant\u2019s argument under the rules of evidence, we review a trial court\u2019s decision on the admissibility of evidence under an unsustainable exercise of discretion standard. <em>State v. Hall, </em>152 N.H. 374, 378 (2005). To meet this standard, the defendant must demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s rulings were clearly untenable or unreasonable to his prejudice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\"> The defendant contends that Patti\u2019s statements regarding McManus\u2019 concerns are inadmissible hearsay. The State counters that Patti\u2019s testimony is admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule in New Hampshire Rules of Evidence 803(3). That rule states, in relevant part, that, \u201cA statement of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensations, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed\u201d is not excluded by the hearsay rule. N.H. R. Ev. 803(3). To be admissible under this exception, the declaration must concern the mental state of the declarant and have reference to the time at which the declaration was made. <em>Hall, </em>152 N.H. at 378. Here, the statements were introduced to show McManus\u2019 state of mind at the time he was interviewed by the police, which included concern for his safety. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision to admit Patti\u2019s testimony about McManus\u2019 state of mind at the time of his interview was not an unsustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The defendant argues that even if a general statement of McManus\u2019 \u201cconcern\u201d was admissible, the statement that he was \u201cconcerned for his safety\u201d is not because it expresses a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered. We do not agree. Stating that McManus was merely \u201cconcerned\u201d does not explain his state of mind. Concern for one\u2019s safety is not the same as, for example, concern about the fates of Denoncourt or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>defendant. In testifying that McManus was concerned for his safety, Patti was relating the then-existing state of McManus\u2019 mind. Thus, his testimony falls within the ambit of Rule 803(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b805-4\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
