This is an interlocutory appeal, <em>see </em>Sup. Ct. R. 8, from rulings of the Portsmouth Family Division <em>(DeVries, </em>J.), entered on the recommendation of a Marital Master <em>(Fishman, </em>M.), denying the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss. We affirm and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The record reveals the following facts. In November 2001, the respondent, J.G., gave birth to a child, A.B., at Wentworth-Douglass Hospital in Dover. The petitioner, J.B., was listed as the child\u2019s father on the birth certificate. The parties, who never married, also executed an affidavit of paternity at the time of A.B.\u2019s birth, recognizing the petitioner as the child\u2019s father. <em>See </em>RSA 5-C:24 (Supp. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Although the parties have not lived together since A.B.\u2019s birth, the petitioner has consistently maintained contact with the child. The respondent acknowledges that from 2003 through September 2006, A.B. was in the petitioner\u2019s care three or four days each week and that in 2004, she obtained a child support order against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">After the parties had a disagreement about AB.\u2019s schooling in September 2006, the petitioner filed a parenting petition in the family division to establish his parental rights and responsibilities. <em>See </em>RSA ch. 461-A (Supp. 2007). In her reply, the respondent alleged that the petitioner was not A.B.\u2019s biological father. Thereafter, the trial court, in response to requests from both parties, ordered paternity testing. <em>See </em>RSA 522:1 (2007). The results of that testing demonstrated that the petitioner was not A.B.\u2019s biological father. We have not been asked to decide if the trial court erred in ordering such testing, but we note our recent decision in <em>In the Matter of Gendron &amp; Plaistek, </em>157 N.H. 314 (2008) (where out-of-state acknowledgement of paternity signed at birth established legal father, trial court erred in ordering genetic marker testing).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">After receiving these test results, the respondent moved to dismiss the petitioner\u2019s parental rights action. She argued that the petitioner did not fall within the class of persons entitled to such rights under RSA chapter 461-A, and that granting parental rights to the petitioner would violate her constitutional right, as a fit natural parent, to raise and care for A.B., <em>see In the Matter of Nelson &amp; Horsley, </em>149 N.H. 545, 547 (2003). After initially granting the respondent\u2019s motion, the trial court later reversed itself and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>ordered an immediate resumption of contact between the petitioner and the child. This interlocutory appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s order on a motion to dismiss, \u201cwe assume the truth of the facts alleged by the [petitioner] and construe all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the [petitioner].\u201d <em>Tosta v. Bullis, </em>156 N.H. 763, 766 (2008) (quotation omitted). \u201cWe then engage in a threshold inquiry that tests the facts in the petition against the applicable law. Where the facts alleged by a [petitioner] are reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit legal relief, we will uphold the denial of a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation, brackets, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The family division transferred the following questions for our consideration, which guide our \u201cthreshold inquiry\u201d in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">(1) May petitioner maintain a parenting petition under N.H. RSA [chapter] 461-A, when he is neither a stepparent, biological parent, or grandparent to the child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">(2) Would allowing this petitioner to maintain a parenting petition violate respondent\u2019s fundamental liberty interest to raise her son, as secured by both [the] Federal and State Constitutions?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">We answer the first question in the affirmative, the second question in the negative, and accordingly affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">We turn first to the statutory question presented by this appeal. \u201cIn matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole. We look first to the statutory language itself, and where possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to words used.\u201d <em>Appeal of Regenesis Corp., </em>156 N.H. 445, 455 (2007) (quotation omitted). \u2018We do not consider words and phrases in isolation, but rather within the context of the statute as a whole. This enables us to better discern the legislature\u2019s intent and to interpret statutory language in light of the policy or purpose sought to be advanced by the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Grand China v. United Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>156 N.H. 429, 431 (2007) (citation omitted). \u201cWhen interpreting two statutes that deal with a similar subject matter, we construe them so that they do not contradict each other, and so that they will lead to reasonable results and effectuate the legislative purpose of the statutes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>RSA chapter 461-A, titled \u201cParental Rights and Responsibilities,\u201d was enacted by the legislature in 2005. RSA 461-A:6 lays out the framework within which \u201cparental rights and responsibilities\u201d (formerly known as custody rights) are to be allocated. The term \u201cparental rights and responsibilities\u201d is defined to mean \u201call rights and responsibilities <em>parents </em>have concerning their child.\u201d RSA 461-A:1, IV (emphasis added). The chapter does not explicitly define the term \u201cparent.\u201d It does, however, contemplate an award of parental rights to a stepparent or a grandparent, if in the best interests of the child. RSA 461-A:6, V.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Neither party asserts that the petitioner could be considered a stepparent or grandparent of A.B. In her brief, the respondent argues that the petitioner also cannot be considered AB.\u2019s \u201cparent\u201d under RSA chapter 461-A. She urges us, citing a dictionary only, to adopt a definition of \u201cparent\u201d as \u201cone that begets or brings forth offspring.\u201d The respondent then reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">DNA testing conclusively proves that Petitioner is not A.B.\u2019s biological father, and in no way did Petitioner \u201cbeget\u201d or \u201cbring forth\u201d A.B.... Because Petitioner is not within any of the classes of people who may be awarded parental rights and responsibilities under N.H. RSA [chapter] 461-A, the Family Division incorrectly failed to dismiss the Parenting Petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">We cannot agree, however, that the legislature intended such a limited definition of the term \u201cparent\u201d when it repeatedly employed that term in RSA chapter 461-A. After considering the overarching statutory scheme in this area, as we must, we observe that the legislature has set forth too many alternative routes to establish parental status that do not require proof of biological ties for us to give the respondent\u2019s argument much weight. <em>See, e.g., </em>RSA ch. 170-B (Supp. 2007) (outlining adoption procedures); RSA 458:23 (2004) (legitimacy of child presumed when born of a marriage entered into in good faith); RSA 168-A:2, 1(a) (2002) (paternity may be established by voluntarily petitioning court). The petitioner\u2019s lack of a biological connection to A.B. is therefore not fatal to his request for parental rights and responsibilities under RSA chapter 461-A, so long as he alleges sufficient facts to establish his status as a parent by other means.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">The petitioner has met this threshold. We have long held that \u201cthe establishment of paternity is \u2018an essential prerequisite to imposing the obligation for child support.\u2019 \u201d <em>In the Matter of Haller &amp; Mills, </em>150 N.H. 427, 429 (2003) (quoting <em>Watts v. Watts, </em>115 N.H. 186, 188 (1975)). Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>when the respondent actively sought and received a child support order against the petitioner in 2004, she necessarily acknowledged his status as A.B.\u2019s parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\">Further, we note that in this state, \u201c[p]aternity [is] established upon the filing of... [a]n affidavit of paternity with the clerk of the town where the birth of the child occurred pursuant to RSA 5-C:24.\u201d RSA 168-A:2, 1(b) (Supp. 2007). An affidavit of paternity requires information about a child\u2019s supposed \u201cnatural\u201d father, and must be signed by the child\u2019s mother. RSA 5-C:25, 1(b), (c) (Supp. 2007). \u201cThe affidavit of paternity [has] the legal effect of establishing paternity without requiring further action pursuant to this chapter, unless rescinded pursuant to RSA 5-C:28.\u201d RSA 168-A:2,1(b). RSA 5-C:28,1 (Supp. 2007), in turn, provides: \u201cA parent or legal guardian may request to rescind an affidavit of paternity from the clerk of the city or town where the birth occurred within 60 days of the filing of an affidavit of paternity unless an administrative or judicial proceeding related to the child results in an earlier date.\u201d After this sixty-day rescission period has passed, \u201cany challenge to the affidavit shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d RSA 5-C:28, III (Supp. 2007). In this case, no challenge to the parties\u2019 affidavit of paternity has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">On the record before us, the petitioner has made sufficient allegations to establish that he is a parent of A.B. To date, no court has entered an order terminating the petitioner\u2019s child support obligation, or rescinding the parties\u2019 affidavit of paternity, <em>see </em>RSA 5-C:28, III. Consequently, we hold that the trial court properly denied the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss, and that the petitioner has standing to seek full parental rights and responsibilities under RSA chapter 461-A, which shall be assigned in accordance with the best interests of the child. <em>See </em>RSA 461-A:6.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We do not address the soundness of an order that would directly or indirectly grant the respondent\u2019s request, as set forth earlier in her proposed order on her motion to dismiss, that the petitioner be \u201cadjudicated to not be the father of [A.B.],\u201d as the issue is not before us. <em>But see McRae v. McRae, </em>115 N.H. 353, 355 (1975) (allowing challenge to paternity after lengthy period of acquiescence, and passage of several opportunities to raise the issue, \u201cwould contravene the policy of this State\u2019s law to protect the child and the spouse from the belated resort to scientific proof\u2019 in an effort to terminate parental responsibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">We next consider the second transferred question. Because the petitioner has alleged sufficient facts to establish that he is a parent of A.B., we presume that he currently enjoys rights equal to those of the respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>dent to raise and care for the child. <em>Cf. Nelson &amp; Horsley, </em>149 N.H. at 547. As a result, we see no unconstitutional intrusion on the respondent\u2019s right to raise and care for A.B. by the trial court\u2019s continued consideration of the pending parenting petition, and, therefore, hold that it correctly denied the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b622-6\">Dalianis, Duggan, Galway and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
