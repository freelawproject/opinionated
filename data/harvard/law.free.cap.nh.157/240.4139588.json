Glick, D.D.S., appeals an order of the Superior Court (O\u2019Neill, J.) denying his petition for specific performance of a right of first refusal he holds for land owned by the respondent, Chocorua Forestlands Limited Partnership (Chocorua). Chocorua cross-appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in finding that Glick possesses valid first refusal rights. We reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-19\">The trial court found the following facts: In March 1974, Glick purchased a tract of land that straddles the Ossipee and Moultonborough town line. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>That property is abutted by Masonian lots 122 and 129 in the town of Ossipee, and Masonian lots 10 and 11 in the town of Moultonborough (Masonian lots). These lots are part of a much larger tract owned by Chocorua.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">From 1983 through 1986, Glick and Chocorua engaged in negotiations regarding, among other things, Glick\u2019s desire to obtain rights of first refusal over the Masonian lots and Chocorua\u2019s desire to obtain certain rights of way across Glick\u2019s property. These discussions culminated in an agreement, on June 26,1986, between Glick, his former wife, Victoria, and Chocorua (the Agreement). Victoria\u2019s interests in this matter were subsequently transferred to Glick during their divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In the Agreement, Chocorua agreed to: (1) convey to Glick its right, title and interest in all rights of way allegedly burdening the Glick property within five days of the date of the Agreement; (2) convey to Glick approximately thirteen acres in Ossipee and Moultonborough that abutted the Glick property; (3) split all costs incurred for survey work associated with the Agreement; and (4) make \u201creasonable efforts to construct a stone and/or earthen barricade at the easterly end of\u2019 a road located near the parties\u2019 property. In addition, Chocorua agreed to, at \u201cclosing,\u201d \u201cdeliver to the Glicks rights-of-first refusal over the\u201d Masonian lots. Those first refusal rights were to contain, among others, the following three terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">(a) [Chocorua] or its successors and assigns shall, within fourteen (14) days of executing a purchase and sale agreement with a bona fide purchaser with respect to all or any portion of the encumbered Lots, send to the Glicks by certified mail, return receipt requested, a copy of the purchase and sale agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">(b) The Glicks shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of said notice to exercise their rights-of-first refusal by tendering to [Chocorua] the proposed purchase price by cashiers or certified check. In the event of such a tender, closing shall be held at the same time as called for in the purchase and sale agreement.... In the event such a tender, is not made within the time specified herein or in the event of a failure by [the] Glicks to close as provided herein, the rights-of-first refusal shall terminate as to that portion of the encumbered lots in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">(c) In the event of termination of the rights-of-first refusal with respect to all or a portion of the Lots as provided hereinabove, [Chocorua] or its successor in interest where applicable may but shall not be required to ... record in the Carroll County Registry of Deeds an affidavit setting forth a description of the Lots <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>affected, and a statement that a copy of the affidavit was mailed to the Glieks by certified mail return receipt requested fifteen (15) days prior to the recording of the affidavit at the Carroll Country [sic] Registry of Deeds and that no objection by the Glieks was received by [Chocorua] or its successor in interest prior to recording of the affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-3\">In the Agreement, Glick agreed to: (1) convey to Chocorua two rights of way over his property; (2) convey to Chocorua a specified acre of land that would facilitate Chocorua\u2019s access to its property; and (3) pay Chocorua $6,100 for the thirteen acres. Although the Agreement provided that subsequent conveyances would be made, it also dictated that \u201call obligations and rights under this [A]greement shall survive the delivery of the deeds contemplated in this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The deeds contemplated by the parties in the Agreement were recorded on September 3, 1986, and Glick transferred $6,100 to Chocorua approximately one month later. But the \u201cclosing\u201d referenced in the right of first refusal provision never occurred, and no further documents regarding those rights were created. Instead, on October 16, 1986, the Agreement itself was recorded in the Carroll County Registry of Deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The testimony offered at trial regarding the recording of the Agreement varied. According to Glick\u2019s attorney at the time, Edward E. Lawson, he and Chocorua\u2019s attorney, David W. Rayment, agreed that the Agreement adequately defined the rights of first refusal and, thus, that there was no need to prepare the additional document originally contemplated by the parties. Lawson testified that Rayment concurred that recording the Agreement itself would be sufficient to place third parties on record notice of Glick\u2019s first refusal rights. In support of Lawson\u2019s testimony, Glick submitted a letter he received several months after the Agreement was recorded in which Lawson states that Rayment had \u201cagreed that recording the [A]greement was sufficient... [and that t]he right of first refusal is on the record and in effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Rayment, in contrast, could not recall having any conversation with Lawson regarding the recording of the Agreement. Moreover, he asserted that he never would have agreed to record the Agreement because it lacked \u201cessential terms\u201d \u2014 such as a provision granting Chocorua access to its remaining land in the event of the sale of the Masonian lots \u2014 and contained provisions he did not want disclosed to the public. According to Rayment, the parties had agreed that Lawson would draft the separate first refusal document, but they had \u201csimply forgotten\u201d about the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Following the recording of the Agreement, there were no further communications between the parties regarding the rights of first refusal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>until November 4, 1998. At that time, Glick received a letter from Chocorua\u2019s then counsel, Robert Lloyd, informing him that Chocorua had entered into a purchase and sale agreement (P&amp;S Agreement) with F. Colin Cabot and FCC Acquisition Co. (Cabot) for \u201call of the land that is subject to an apparent right to first refusal granted to [Glick] and the former Mrs. Glick by Chocorua.\u201d Lloyd stated that \u201c[u]nder the terms of the right of first refusal [Glick] ha[d] thirty (30) days from the receipt of th[e letter] to exercise [his] rights of first refusal by tendering to [Chocorua] the proposed purchase price\u201d of $375,000. Attached to the letter was a copy of the P&amp;S Agreement, which similarly acknowledged Glick\u2019s first refusal rights. The record indicates that the sale of the Masonian lots was part of a much larger multi-million dollar sale of essentially all of Chocorua\u2019s assets to Cabot.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\">Following Glick\u2019s receipt of notice of the P&amp;S Agreement, the parties\u2019 lawyers exchanged several communications regarding Glick\u2019s belief that: (1) the purported purchase price was excessive; (2) the thirty-day period originally prescribed by the Agreement should be extended in recognition of the fact that subdivision approval would be required for the sale of the lots; and (3) he should be permitted to exercise his rights of first refusal over only a portion of the Masonian lots. These communications continued until November 25,1998, when Lloyd sent Glick and Lawson a fax, advising them that the Agreement had been \u201ccancelled and terminated\u201d and that \u201cany right of first refusal [Glick] may have is\u201d no longer exercisable.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">That same day, Cabot\u2019s counsel, Howard G. Seitz, sent a fax to Lloyd confirming a conversation which they had that morning. In that fax, Seitz acknowledged that Cabot had cancelled the P&amp;S Agreement, but noted they had \u201cagreed to review the transaction pursuant to which [Cabot was] to acquire the Chocorua lands subject to equitable adjustment for the so-called \u2018Glick Property\u2019 with the thought, amongst others, that, if appropriate, [Cabot] might acquire the partnership interests of Choeorua[\u2019s] partners rather than the property itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">At trial, Lawson testified that, immediately prior to receiving notification that the P&amp;S Agreement had been cancelled, he spoke with Lloyd and informed him that Glick intended to exercise his first refusal rights. Glick also testified that several days prior to receiving Lloyd\u2019s fax, he spoke with Seitz and informed him of the same. However, the trial court found that \u201cno documentation or communication was exchanged between respective counsel or the parties that indicated that Glick was unconditionally accepting the terms of the P&amp;S Agreement prior to Glick\u2019s notification of its cancellation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">In February 1999, roughly two months after terminating the P&amp;S Agreement, the general and limited partners of Chocorua sold their partnership interests, including their interest in the Masonian lots, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Cabot. In response, Glick filed the present action, arguing that his first refusal rights entitle him \u201cto a decree of specific performance, compelling the defendant to sell him the . . . [Masonian lots], at [their] fair market value.\u201d Chocorua objected, claiming that Glick did not have first refusal rights because the separate document referenced in the Agreement was never executed. Moreover, Chocorua argued that even if Glick had such rights, they would not have been triggered by the transfer of the partnership interests in Chocorua to Cabot.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\">Both parties subsequently filed motions for summary judgment. In his motion, Glick argued, among other things, that \u201conce the Rights of First Refusal were triggered [by his receipt of notice of the P&amp;S Agreement, he] had an option to purchase the land in question.\u201d Because numerous material facts remained unresolved \u2014 including the actual acreage of the Masonian lots, the enforceability of the Agreement, whether the Agreement memorialized the parties\u2019 intentions, whether the parties had acted in good or bad faith, and whether Glick had exercised his rights \u2014 the trial court denied Glick\u2019s motion on July 31, 2001, \u201cwith one narrow exception.\u201d That narrow exception, as explained by the court, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\"><em>if it </em>is determined that Glick possessed a valid right of first refusal (which, the Court is not finding in this Order), and if, in addition, the terms of . . . [the] Agreement alone define that right, then Glick, upon receipt of the ... letter [from Chocorua], would have been the holder of a thirty day option to purchase the property described in the [P&amp;S Agreement] for the price therein stated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Following trial, the trial court issued its final order and held \u201c[t]hat an enforceable rightf] of first refusal on the ... Masonian lots was granted to Glick by Chocorua and continues to encumber the said Masonian lots.\u201d While the court agreed with Chocorua that \u201cit is entirely possible, perhaps probable, that additional terms would [have] be[en] included in\u201d the separate first refusal document contemplated by the parties, the court held that the Agreement nevertheless \u201cencompassed the rights and obligations placed on each respective party.\u201d Accordingly, the court found that the Agreement \u201crepresented] a \u2018meeting of the minds\u2019 as to the subject first refusal right[s]\u201d and that the first refusal provision in the Agreement was \u201can enforceable contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The court, however, declined \u201cto order a sale of the ... Masonian lots for any price\u201d because the P&amp;S Agreement \u201cwas cancelled and/or terminated prior to Glick exercising his right[] of first refusal.\u201d Moreover, because \u201cthe subsequent transfer of Chocorua\u2019s partnership interest in 1999 did not trigger Glick\u2019s rightQ of first refusal,\u201d the court held that Glick had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>right to force the sale of the Masonian lots. Finally, the court found that Glick failed to prove that Chocorua had acted in bad faith by entering into the partnership sale with Cabot.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">On appeal, Glick makes three principal arguments for reversal: First, he contends that, upon his receipt of notice of the P&amp;S Agreement, his right of first refusal ripened into an option that was irrevocable for the thirty-day period stated in the Agreement. Second, he argues that the trial court erred in refusing to find that Chocorua acted in bad faith. Third, he asserts that the trial court\u2019s July 31, 2001 summary judgment order, when considered in light of the findings made in the final order, compels an order of specific performance. Because we agree with Glick that, under the facts presented in this case, the Agreement gave him a thirty-day irrevocable option to purchase the Masonian lots, we need not reach all of his latter arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\n<em>I. Right of First Refusal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Glick\u2019s first argument raises an issue we have not yet had occasion to consider; that is, whether a right of first refusal, once triggered, is exercisable for the entire period of time specified by the parties, even though the third-party contract has been terminated. Glick contends that, as a matter of law, a right of first refusal <em>always </em>ripens into an irrevocable option once the holder has received notice of the burdened estate\u2019s intent to sell. In so arguing, he urges us to follow those authorities that have stated broadly that \u201c[o]nce the holder... receives notice of a third party\u2019s offer,... the holder of the option has a right to buy the property, a right that is a true option.\u201d 17 C.J.S. <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 56, at 503 (1999); <em>see, e.g., Riley v. Campeau Homes (Texas), Inc., </em>808 S.W.2d 184, 188 (Tex. App. 1991) (stating that \u201ca right of first refusal ripens into an option when the owner elects to sell\u201d); <em>Chapman v. Mutual Life Ins. of New York, </em>800 P.2d 1147, 1150 (Wyo. 1990) (\u201cWe agree with the view that when the condition precedent of the owner\u2019s intention to sell is met the right of first refusal \u2018ripens\u2019 into an option and contract law pertaining to options applies.\u201d); <em>Vorpe v. Key Island, Inc., </em>374 So. 2d 1035, 1036-37 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1979) (explaining that once the owner of property manifests the intent to sell, the \u201cright of first refusal [i]s converted into an irrevocable option to purchase\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Chocorua, in similarly absolute fashion, argues that a right of first refusal only gives the holder a right to receive notice of a proposed third-party sale and that, once such notice has been sent, \u201cthe offeree has \u2018received the bargained-for performance,\u2019 and cannot insist that the offer remain open after the third-party sale is abandoned.\u201d In support of its position, Chocorua relies primarily upon <em>Lin Broadcasting Corp. v. Metromedia, Inc., </em>542 N.E.2d 629, 630 (N.Y. 1989), which held that \u201can offer, once made to the holder of a right of first refusal, is [not] irrevocable for the period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>time set forth in the first refusal clause.\u201d <em>See also Shower v. Fisher, </em>737 P.2d 291, 293 (Wash. Ct. App. 1987) (indicating that a right of first refusal only gives the holder the power to purchase for so long as the underlying third-party contract is in existence).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\">While we recognize that authority exists in support of both parties\u2019 positions, we do not believe that adoption of a rigid rule that applies to all contracts that contain the phrase \u201cright of first refusal\u201d is sound. Generally speaking, \u201ca right of first refusal is a conditional option which is dependent upon the decision to sell the property by its owner.\u201d 17 C.J.S. <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 56, at 503. It differs materially from an option contract, <em>Polemi v. Wells, </em>759 P.2d 796, 798 (Colo. Ct. App. 1988), in that it is not an \u201coffer[] and create[s] no power of acceptance\u201d in the holder. 3 E. Holmes, Corbin on Contrcts \u00a7 11.3, at 468 (rev. ed. 1996). Rather, a right of first refusal generally \u201cempowers its holder with a preferential right to purchase property on the same terms offered by or to a bona fide purchaser.\u201d 17 C.J.S. <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 56, at 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">However, the practical reality is that the labels \u2014 such as \u201cright of first refusal\u201d \u2014 applied by contracting \u201cparties do not always mirror the economic reality of the instruments involved.\u201d Walker, <em>Rethinking Rights of First Refusal, </em>5 Stan. J.L. Bus. <em>&amp; </em>Fin. 1, n.14 (1999). As Corbin has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">Although the [r]ight that it creates may be described by divers[e] terms (\u201cFirst Right to Buy,\u201d \u201cRight of Pre-emption,\u201d . . . and so on), in no case are the legal relations [between the parties contracting for a right of first refusal] determinable from the name alone. In all cases, interpretation requires knowledge of the entire context, context of facts as well as context of words.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">3 E. Holmes, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 11.3, at 481; <em>see also Smith Trust, </em>745 N.W.2d 754, 757-58 (Mich. 2008) (holding that determination of \u201cwhether a right of first refusal is revocable once the holder of the right receives notice of a third party\u2019s offer\u201d requires interpretation of the contract language); <em>Henderson v. Nitschke, </em>470 S.W.2d 410, 411 (Tex. App. Ct. 1971) (stating that \u201c[t]he determination of the rights of the parties [under a right of first refusal provision] requires an interpretation of. . . the lease\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Moreover, it has long been our practice to focus upon the intent of the parties, as manifested in the language of the <em>entire </em>contract, in defining the parties\u2019 respective rights. <em>Cf. Swamscot Machine Co. v. Partridge, </em>25 N.H. 369, 376-79 (1852) (holding that the express, unambiguous language of the parties\u2019 agreement controls despite contrary evidence of industry custom or usage). The parties have offered no principled reason for departing from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>this settled approach simply because we are faced with language purporting to create \u201crights of first refusal.\u201d <em>Cf. Turcotte v. Griffin, </em>120 N.H. 292, 294 (1980) (upholding a trial court\u2019s use of the rules of contract interpretation when interpreting a lease which contained an option to purchase). We therefore reject both parties\u2019 implicit argument that their use of the phrase \u201cright of first refusal\u201d ends the inquiry. Instead, we agree with those authorities that have held that \u201cthe contract terms establishing a right of first refusal... control whether the right... becomes an irrevocable option once triggered or, instead, may be revoked by the owner if he in good faith changes his mind \u2014 and withdraws his offer to sell \u2014 before the right is exercised.\u201d <em>Smith Trust, </em>745 N.W.2d at 759 (Corrigan, J. concurring); <em>see also Henderson, </em>470 S.W.2d at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\">Accordingly, we must look to all of the language of the Agreement in resolving the present dispute. In so doing, we will give the language used by the parties its reasonable meaning, considering the circumstances and the context in which the agreement was negotiated, and reading the document as a whole. <em>Ryan James Realty v. Villages at Chester Condo. Assoc., </em>153 N.H. 194, 197 (2006). Absent ambiguity, however, we will determine the parties\u2019 intent from the plain meaning of the language used in the contract. <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, the interpretation of a contract is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Barclay Square Condo. Owners\u2019 Assoc. v. Grenier, </em>153 N.H. 514, 517 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">As noted above, the Agreement unambiguously required Chocorua, \u201cwithin fourteen (14) days of executing a purchase and sale agreement with a bona fide purchaser\u201d for \u201cany portion\u201d of the Masonian lots, to \u201csend to [Glick]... a copy of\u2019 said agreement. The Agreement further provided that Glick, upon receiving such notice, \u201cshall have thirty (30) days... to exercise [his] rights-of-first refusal by tendering to [Chocorua] the proposed purchase price by cashiers or certified check.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The Court of Civil Appeals of Texas addressed a similarly worded first refusal provision in <em>Henderson. </em>There, the parties had entered into a lease that granted the lessee the \u201cprior right ... to buy the leased premises\u201d according to the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">If Lessor receives from a third party an acceptable bona fide offer to buy such property, Lessor shall forthwith give Lessee written notice thereof together with a copy of such offer. Lessee or its nominee <em>shall </em>have sixty (60) days from the receipt of such notice and offer to buy such property at the terms of such offer relating to such property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-7\"><em>Henderson, </em>470 S.W.2d at 411 (quotations omitted; emphasis added). As in the case before us, the lessor subsequently entered into a written contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>to sell the leased premises; sent written notice to the lessee; and, prior to the expiration of the sixty-day period, informed the lessee that he could no longer exercise his first refusal because the third-party offer had been revoked. <em>Id. </em>When the lessee\u2019s attempts to exercise his rights were rebuffed, the lessee filed suit seeking specific performance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\">On appeal, the court rejected the lessor\u2019s assertion that the lessee\u2019s right \u201cto purchase [wa]s a mere right of refusal which cannot be called an option,\u201d and held that the \u201cdetermination of the rights of the parties requires an interpretation of\u2019 the contract. <em>Id. </em>In engaging in that undertaking, the court found it significant that the first refusal provision granted lessee a definite period of time in which to exercise its right. <em>Id. </em>at 412. The court then determined that the language of the contract dictated that once the lessor \u201cgave lessee written notice of the proposed sale to the third party... the first right of refusal matured into an option which was supported by consideration and was irrevocable by the terms of the lease for 60 days.\u201d Id.; <em>see Mobil Oil Guam, Inc. v. Tendido, </em>2004 Guam 7, \u00b6 20 (interpreting language similar to that in the present case as creating a \u201cright of first refusal which ripens into an irrevocable option to purchase\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Here, as in <em>Henderson, </em>the condition precedent triggering the right of first refusal was the occurrence of a single, isolated event; that is, Chocorua\u2019s execution of a purchase and sale agreement. Nothing in the contract indicates, as Chocorua suggests, that Glick\u2019s resultant right to purchase the property was conditioned upon the continued existence of the P&amp;S Agreement. If that had been the parties\u2019 intent, they could have crafted the condition precedent to depend upon Chocorua\u2019s desire to \u201csell, transfer or otherwise dispose of its ownership interest to a third party.\u201d <em>Cf. Lin Broadcasting Corp., </em>542 N.E.2d at 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Instead, the Agreement explicitly states that, upon receiving notice, Glick <em>\u201cshall </em>have thirty (30) days... to exercise [his] rights-of-first refusal.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We agree with the <em>Henderson </em>court that the incorporation of this time provision is significant. <em>Henderson, </em>470 S.W.2d at 411; <em>see Mobil Oil Guam, Inc., </em>2004 Guam 7 at \u00b6 29 (holding that the inclusion of a time period evidences that the right of first refusal was intended to ripen into an irrevocable option to purchase upon being triggered). In common parlance, the word \u201cshall\u201d is \u201cused to express a command,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2085 (unabridged ed. 2002); <em>see McCarthy v. Wheeler, </em>152 N.H. 643, 645 (2005), or to signify something that is required or mandatory, <em>see Dancart Corp. v. St. Albans Rubber Co., </em>124 N.H. 598, 602 (1984) (explaining that, \u201c[w]hen \u2018shall\u2019 is contained in a term requiring action by a person identified, the word commonly ... ha[s] a mandatory character\u201d). Given the mandatory nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>of this time provision, as well as the lack of any language conditioning Glick\u2019s purchasing power upon the continued existence of the P&amp;S Agreement, we hold that the Agreement granted Glick an irrevocable thirty-day option to purchase the Masonian lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"> Chocorua asserts that, even if Glick held a thirty-day option to purchase the Masonian lots, he cannot obtain specific performance because he \u201cnever tendered $375,000 to [Chocorua], as required under the first refusal provisions of the\u201d Agreement. In other words, Chocorua contends that, despite its premature repudiation of his option, Glick was required to engage in the futile act of offering payment in order to preserve his right to relief in this case. As Justice Souter explained in <em>Erin Food Services, Inc. v. Derry Motel, </em>131 N.H. 353, 362 (1988), such an argument \u201cignores ... the rule excusing formal tender to a party whose repudiation of a contract has previously indicated that tender would be a useless act.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Since the evidence indicates that the option was repudiated by Chocorua, equity does not require that Glick show a useless tender. <em>Lowell v. First Church of Christ, </em>101 N.H. 363, 366 (1958) (holding that parties\u2019 allegation that they were ready, willing and able to purchase the property subject to an option is sufficient for specific performance); <em>cf. Jesseman v. Aurelio, </em>106 N.H. 529, 534 (1965) (\u201cany lack of a written undertaking to purchase on the part of the plaintiff was supplied by the bringing of his bill in equity, alleging that he is ready, willing and able to purchase\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Accordingly, because the Agreement granted Glick a thirty-day option to purchase the property upon his receipt of notice of the P&amp;S Agreement, Chocorua breached the contract by rescinding the offer and Glick is entitled to specific performance. <em>See </em>81A C.J.S. <em>Specific Performance </em>\u00a7 45, at 215 (2004) (\u201cContractual rights of first refusal to purchase realty may be enforced by a decree of specific performance.\u201d). The remainder of Chocorua\u2019s arguments on this issue are without merit and sufficient basis in the record, and, thus, do not warrant further consideration. <em>See Vogel v. Vogel, </em>137 N.H. 321, 322 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\n<em>II. Glick\u2019s Remaining Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Glick raises several other arguments in support of his assertion that he is entitled to an order of specific performance. For instance, he asserts that the trial court erred in failing to find that Chocorua restructured its deal with Cabot as a partnership sale for the sole purpose of preventing him from exercising his first refusal. <em>See, e.g., Quigley v. Capolongo, </em>383 N.Y.S.2d 935 (App. Div. 1976) (holding that a grantor of a first refusal breached the obligation of good faith and fair dealing \u201cby entering into a contract, denominated a lease in the hope of circumventing plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>rights\u201d). In addition, he asserts that the trial court\u2019s July 31,2001 summary judgment order, when considered in light of the findings made in the final order, compels an order of specific performance. Having already determined that the Agreement gave Glick a thirty-day option to purchase the Masonian lots, and that he is therefore entitled to specific performance, we need not address these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\">However, Glick also contends that the trial court erred in failing to find that Chocorua acted in bad faith in setting the purchase price for the Masonian lots. In support of his argument, Glick points to a letter submitted at trial in which Lloyd informed Seitz that the general manager of Chocorua \u201cbelieve[d] that he can place [a] high enough price on the right of first refusal property so that Mr. Glick will not exercise acquisition.\u201d Glick argues that, as demonstrated by this letter, Chocorua inflated the price in the P&amp;S Agreement \u201cin bad faith in an effort to discourage [him] from exercising his rights of first refusal so as not to jeopardize the larger $10 [million] transaction that [Chocorua] was attempting to consummate with\u201d Cabot.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">While the trial court granted Chocorua\u2019s requested finding that \u201cGlick did not prove his allegations that [Chocurua] acted in bad faith by purportedly inflating the purchase price of the [l]ots, or overestimating the amount of land contained within the lots,\u201d in its order the court expressly declined to make findings as to both the size and value of the Masonian lots. Because these facts are inextricably tied to Glick\u2019s bad faith argument, <em>see Bank of Vermont v. Kelley, </em>No. CIV. 93-46-JD, 1994 WL 258860, at *6-7 (D.N.H. Feb. 4,1994) (refusing to grant summary judgment on issue of bad faith in case involving a loan workout where disputed material facts remained regarding whether the bank had accepted the fair market value for the property at issue); <em>see also Gleason v. Norwest Mortgage, Inc., </em>243 F.3d 130, 143 (3d Cir. 2001) (explaining how \u201callocations of price by interested parties to elements of a package [deal] may readily be manipulated to defeat contractual rights to substantially similar price terms\u201d); <em>Gyurkey v. Babler, </em>651 P.2d 928, 934 (Idaho 1982), and we are ill-suited to make such factual findings in the first instance, <em>see, e.g., Cook v. Sullivan, </em>149 N.H. 774, 780 (2003) (explaining how the trial court is in the best position to \u201cresolv[e] conflicts in the testimony, measur[e] the credibility of witnesses, and determin[e] the weight to be given evidence\u201d), we are unable to assess the trial court\u2019s rejection of Glick\u2019s bad faith argument upon this record. For similar reasons, we are also unable to resolve Glick\u2019s contention that the purchase price in the P&amp;S Agreement was premised upon an erroneous assessment of the size of the Masonian lots. <em>See Pantry Pride Enterprises, Inc. v. Stop &amp; Shop Co., </em>806 F.2d 1227, 1231 (4th Cir. 1986) (granting specific performance to the holder of a right of first refusal, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>remanding for findings as to the value of the encumbered property where performance would result in a windfall). Therefore, upon remand, the trial court shall determine whether the purchase price in the P&amp;S Agreement was inflated and, if it so finds, shall set a purchase price in accord with the fair market value of the property in November 1998, when Glick should have been permitted to exercise his right. If, however, the court finds that the price was not inflated, Glick shall be held to his contractual obligation to proffer the purchase price stated in the P&amp;S Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\n<em>III. Chocorua\u2019s Cross-appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In its cross-appeal, Chocorua argues that the trial court erred in concluding that the Agreement created an enforceable first refusal contract between the parties. Specifically, Chocorua asserts that the trial court\u2019s finding that the Agreement \u201crepresented] a \u2018meeting of the minds\u2019 as to the subject first refusal right(s),\u201d is \u201cincompatible\u201d with the court\u2019s determination \u201cthat the parties . . . intended] to execute a separate document conveying the first refusal right(s)\u201d that could have contained additional terms. Chocorua argues that, at most, the Agreement represented \u201can agreement to enter into a contract,\u201d which it contends is unenforceable in these circumstances. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">A valid, enforceable contract requires offer, acceptance, and a meeting of the minds on all essential terms. <em>Durgin v. Pillsbury Lake Water Dist., </em>153 N.H. 818, 821 (2006). A meeting of the minds is present when the evidence, viewed objectively, indicates that the parties have assented to the same terms. <em>Syncom Indus. v. Wood, </em>155 N.H. 73, 82 (2007). \u201cThe question of whether a \u2018meeting of the minds\u2019 occurred is a factual question to be determined by the trier of fact,\u201d <em>Fleet Bank-NH v. Christy\u2019s Table, </em>141 N.H. 285, 288 (1996), as is the issue of whether a valid contract was created, <em>Gulf Ins. Co. v. AMSCO, </em>153 N.H. 28, 43 (2005). Accordingly, on these issues, \u201cwe will sustain a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions unless they are lacking in evidentiary support or tainted by an error of law.\u201d <em>Syncom Indus., </em>155 N.H. at 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">In this case, after considering all of the evidence \u2014 including Chocorua\u2019s assertion that it would have requested that additional terms be incorporated into the contemplated right of first refusal contract \u2014 the trial court concluded that the Agreement \u201cencompassed the rights and obligations placed on each respective party\u201d and represented \u201ca \u2018meeting of the minds\u2019 as to the subject first refusal right(s).\u201d There is ample evidence in the record to support this conclusion. <em>See </em>17A Am. Jur. 2d <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 57 (2004) (\u201cCourts liberally find right-of-first refusal clauses to be specific enough to be enforced, even if they are missing some important terms.\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>First, the Agreement contains a description of the property affected by the rights of first refusal. Second, the Agreement contains provisions describing the nature of the right of first refusal \u2014 that is, a covenant against the Masonian lots \u2014 and the period of time in which the rights would remain in effect \u2014 that is, a period of twenty years, extendable to eighty years upon Glick\u2019s election. Third, as noted above, the Agreement also contains language describing, in detail, how the rights would be triggered and how they would be exercised. And finally, despite the fact that the parties contemplated the execution of a separate first refusal document, the Agreement explicitly states that \u201call obligations and rights under this [A]greement shall survive the delivery of the deeds contemplated in th[e] Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\"> Chocorua\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in finding that the Agreement created a first refusal contract appears to be premised upon an erroneous reading of the trial court\u2019s order. Despite Chocorua\u2019s assertions to the contrary, the trial court did not find that the Agreement failed to \u201ccontain all terms that the parties regarded as <em>material </em>to rights of first refusal.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Rather, the court merely found that \u201cthe parties did indeed intend to execute a separate document conveying the first refusal right(s)\u201d and that \u201cpossibl[y], perhaps probablfy], . . . <em>additional </em>terms would\u201d have been included in that document. (Emphasis added.) Nothing in this language suggests that the trial court believed that those additional terms were material. <em>See Lower Village Hydroelectric Assoc. v. City of Claremont, </em>147 N.H. 73, 75 (2001) (explaining that \u201c[a] written memorandum is sufficient to establish a contract if it demonstrates that the parties have manifested their intent to be bound to the <em>essential </em>terms of a more detailed forthcoming agreement\u201d (emphasis added)). To the contrary, this language, when considered in light of the court\u2019s determination that the Agreement \u201cencompassed the rights and obligations placed on each respective party,\u201d indicates that the court found the purported additional terms proffered by Chocorua to be minor details. <em>See id. </em>at 76 (explaining how a contract can exist regardless of whether the parties \u201ccontemplated further negotiations of minor details\u201d). Because we disagree with Chocorua\u2019s interpretation of the trial court\u2019s order, we cannot find that the court erred in holding that the Agreement created \u201can enforceable contract.\u201d Accordingly, we affirm the trial court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\n<em>Reversed in part; affirmed in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b293-6\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Galway and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
