(EDC), appeals, and the plaintiff, Clark &amp; Lavey Benefits Solutions, Inc. (C&amp;L), cross-appeals, from rulings of the Trial Court <em>(Groff, </em>J.). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The record discloses the following facts. C&amp;L was formed in 1997 to broker group insurance policies for companies that sponsor employee benefit plans. EDC is a not-for-profit corporation dedicated primarily to \u201capplied research in education and public health awareness.\u201d In 1997, EDC hired C&amp;L as its insurance broker. Pursuant to the parties\u2019 contract, C&amp;L was paid solely from commissions built into the premiums paid by EDC to the insurance carriers it selected with C&amp;L\u2019s help.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">In 2004, EDC\u2019s benefits manager began reviewing the commissions paid to C&amp;L, and compared the rates to the \u201cstandard\u201d brokerage commission rates paid by its health and dental carriers. He determined that because the rates paid to C&amp;L were higher than the \u201cstandard\u201d rates, he would negotiate with C&amp;L to recover the difference. Despite the parties\u2019 negotiations, and EDC\u2019s continuing use of C&amp;L\u2019s services throughout 2004, EDC terminated C&amp;L as its broker in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In April 2005, C&amp;L sued EDC and EDC counterclaimed against C&amp;L. Following trial, a jury found C&amp;L liable to EDC for breach of a fiduciary duty and for intentional misrepresentations and awarded EDC $70,000 in damages. However, the jury also found EDC liable to C&amp;L for breach of contract and negligent and intentional misrepresentations, and awarded C&amp;L $112,000 in damages. After the trial ended, EDC filed a motion seeking forfeiture of all commissions C&amp;L had earned since 1998, which the trial court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">EDC appeals, arguing that certain jury instructions were erroneous and that the trial court erred in denying its forfeiture motion. C&amp;L cross-appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for a directed verdict on EDC\u2019s claims for breach of contract and misrepresentation. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">When EDC counterclaimed, it alleged, in part, that C&amp;L had breached the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act (MCPA), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, by failing to disclose the \u201cstandard\u201d brokerage commission rates paid by the carriers it selected. According to EDC, had C&amp;L disclosed those rates, that information would have influenced EDC\u2019s decision to use C&amp;L\u2019s services. EDC contends that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on the elements of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\"> \u201cThe purpose of jury instructions is to identify issues of material fact, and to inform the jury of the appropriate standards of law by which it is to resolve them.\u201d <em>Transmedia Restaurant Co. v. Devereaux, </em>149 N.H. 454, 457 (2003) (quotation omitted). We review jury instructions in context and will not reverse unless the charge, taken in its entirety, fails to adequately explain the law applicable to the case in such a way that the jury is misled. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Relative to the MCPA claim, the trial court instructed the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">In order to recover under a claim for violation of the Consumer Protection Act, EDC must prove, one, that Clark and Lavey committed an unfair and deceptive trade practice by failing to disclose to EDC the established broker commission rates for the sale of the insurance carrier\u2019s policies; two, that disclosure of these standard commission rates may have influenced EDC not to enter into the transaction of designating Clark and Lavey as its broker for the purchase of these policies; and, three, that as a result of this conduct by Clark and Lavey EDC suffered pecuniary loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">In order to constitute an unfair and deceptive trade practice under the act, Clark and Lavey\u2019s conduct must obtain a level of rascality that would raise an eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble world of commerce or be at least within the penumbra of some established concept of unfairness or whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">According to EDC, under the MCPA, the failure to disclose, in itself, is a violation and reference to the \u201crascality\u201d standard was unnecessary and erroneous. Alternatively, EDC argues that if some reference to a subjective standard was proper, the \u201crascality\u201d standard is not the correct standard. C&amp;L counters that the issue has not been preserved for appeal, or, if it has, the instruction was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">We address first whether the argument has been preserved. \u201cA contemporaneous objection is necessary to preserve a jury instruction issue for appellate review.\u201d <em>Nilsson v. Bierman, </em>150 N.H. 393, 402 (2003) (quotation omitted). Without a contemporaneous objection, the trial court is not afforded the opportunity to correct an error it may have made. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis long-standing requirement is grounded in common sense and judicial economy, and applies equally to civil and criminal matters.\u201d <em>Devereaux, </em>149 N.H. at 457. EDC did not make, and does not contend that it made, any objection at the time the instruction was given to the jury, despite having the opportunity to do so. Instead, EDC argues that during an on-the-record conference with the trial court to discuss the instructions proposed by the trial court, it objected to the use of the \u201crascality\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">During the conference, C&amp;L raised objections to the wording of the proposed instruction, and, after some discussion, the parties agreed to work out an instruction to submit to the court. The parties, however, could not agree on an instruction and further discussed the matter with the trial court. The following discussion ensued between the trial judge and EDC\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>[EDC]: As it\u2019s been presented, Your Honor, I think the difference is whether we\u2019re going to go from the definition from the CMR [Code of Massachusetts Regulations] to the information about rascality and then the application to the facts. What I\u2019ve suggested is that we go the CMR definition and then say EDC must prove, and use the language that you\u2019ve already given us, and then say in addition you must find that this behavior reached a level of \u2014 to use the word \u2014 rascality from the thing such that would shock the conscience, and then you can find <em>that </em>\u2014 what <em>worries me is that we insert that term which EDC doesn\u2019t agree is applicable in the failure to disclose context before we\u2019ve applied the CMR regulation to the facts.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">THE COURT: I guess I\u2019ll come up with something then.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">(Emphasis added.) The issue was revisited later in the discussion during the following interaction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">THE COURT: And what \u2014 what you want is this rascality stuff down back where it belongs; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">[EDC]: Yes, Your Honor. And I was proposing as \u2014 you know, just as an alternative that you say in addition to finding the above \u2014 I think that CMR thing is a gating question, and then you also have to find something. I don\u2019t think we\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">[EDC]: \u2014 we agree that that\u2019s the appropriate language, but at least we\u2019re willing to live with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019ll write something up, and everybody will live with it, I guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">[EDC]: Yes, we will. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">EDC contends that these statements were sufficient to record its objections to the instruction, and does not point to any place in the record where any other objection was made. We do not agree that EDC raised an objection sufficient to preserve the issue for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">First, to the extent EDC could be said to have raised an objection, such objection appears to be to the order in which the portions of the instruction would be given, and not to the inclusion of the \u201crascality\u201d language. Indeed, it appears the trial court so understood the objection as evidenced by the judge attempting to clarify that EDC wanted \u201cthis rascality stuff down back where it belongs.\u201d Thus, it was the placement of the language in the instruction upon which the trial court based its decision, and not the language itself. <em>See id. </em>at 458 (trial judge ruled upon what it understood the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>objection to be, and it was clear from the record that the objection claimed on appeal was not the one upon which the trial court ruled).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Additionally, the trial court concluded by stating that it would craft an instruction to be delivered later. As such, any objections arguably raised by EDC were to the proposed instructions, which the trial court made clear were not final. EDC did not object to the instruction the trial court ultimately delivered. For these reasons, we conclude that EDC did not make an objection sufficient to preserve the matter for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">EDC contends that even if it did not preserve the issue, we may still consider it under our plain error analysis. <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. R. 16-A. C&amp;L contends, relying upon federal law, that plain error review of the jury instruction is not available because EDC made a \u201ctrue waiver\u201d by intentionally relinquishing a known right. <em>See, e.g., Chestnut v. City of Lowell, </em>805 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 2002); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733 (1993). In the plain error context, however, we have not adopted the \u201ctrue waiver\u201d analysis, and C&amp;L does not argue that we ought to do so here. Accordingly, we express no opinion on whether EDC made a \u201ctrue waiver\u201d of the plain error argument, and we will consider whether the trial court\u2019s instruction constituted plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The plain error rule allows us to consider errors not brought to the attention of the trial court. <em>Cloutier v. City of Berlin, </em>154 N.H. 13, 25 (2006). However, the rule should be used sparingly, its use limited to those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result. <em>Id. </em>\u201cFor us to find error under the rule: (1) there must be an error; (2) the error must be plain; (3) the error must affect substantial rights; and (4) the error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Here, even assuming the trial court\u2019s instruction was in error, we do not find the error plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\"> We have recently stated that in the context of our plain error analysis, \u201cplain\u201d is synonymous with \u201cclear\u201d or, equivalently, \u201cobvious.\u201d <em>State v. Lopez, </em>156 N.H. 416, 424 (2007). An error is plain if it was or should have been \u201cobvious\u201d in the sense that the governing law was clearly settled to the contrary. <em>Id. </em>\u201cGenerally, when the law is not clear at the time of trial, and remains unsettled at the time of appeal, a decision by the trial court cannot be plain error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Citing <em>Massachusetts Employers Insurance Exchange v. Propac-Mass, Inc., </em>648 N.E.2d 435, 438 (Mass. 1995), EDC contends that the trial court\u2019s instruction was plainly erroneous because the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court abandoned the use of the \u201crascality\u201d analysis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>MCPA cases in 1995. Although in <em>Propac-Mass </em>the Supreme Judicial Court stated that it found phrases such as \u201clevel of rascality\u201d to be \u201cuninstructive,\u201d <em>id., </em>it stopped short of abandoning the term. As a result, federal courts applying Massachusetts law have continued to use the \u201crascality\u201d analysis. <em>See J.E. Pierce Apothecary v. Harvard Pilgrim Health, </em>365 F. Supp. 2d 119, 143 n.13 (D. Mass. 2005); <em>see also Boyle v. Douglas Dynamics, LLC, </em>292 F. Supp. 2d 198, 218 (D. Mass. 2003). Moreover, as pointed out by C&amp;L, some Massachusetts trial courts, despite the opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court, have continued to rely upon the \u201crascality\u201d standard. <em>See, e.g., AAA Climbers, Inc. v. Above Grade Dev. Corp., </em>No. Civ. 04-483, 2007 WL 2935412, at *3 (Mass. Super. Ct. 2007); <em>Winlake II, Inc. v. Mercier, </em>No. MICV20050043C, 2006 WL 1360855, at *9 (Mass. Super. Ct. 2006). While EDC contends that such reliance is \u201cmisguided\u201d because those courts \u201cerroneously include[d] the rascality language,\u201d it suffices to demonstrate that the law in Massachusetts is not clearly settled. As the law is not clearly settled, we cannot say that including the language in the jury instruction amounted to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The parties\u2019 remaining claims on appeal relate to the contention that C&amp;L breached a fiduciary duty owed to EDC. C&amp;L argues that it did not owe a fiduciary duty to EDC, and, therefore, the trial court erred in denying its motion for a directed verdict. EDC argues that following the jury\u2019s determination that C&amp;L breached its fiduciary duty, the trial court erred in denying its motion for forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Prior to closing arguments, C&amp;L moved for a directed verdict arguing, in part, that the evidence showed the parties to have an ordinary commercial relationship. Therefore, C&amp;L contended, it did not owe EDC a fiduciary duty. The trial court denied the motion because it concluded that a reasonable jury could find that such a duty existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u201cA trial court may grant a motion for a directed verdict only if it determines, after considering the evidence and construing all inferences therefrom most favorably to the non-moving party, that no rational juror could conclude that the non-moving party is entitled to any relief.\u201d <em>Ward v. Inishmaan Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>156 N.H. 22, 24 (2007) (quotation omitted). The trial court may not weigh the evidence or judge the credibility of witnesses and should deny the motion for a directed verdict unless it can affirmatively determine that the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief on the evidence presented. <em>Emerson v. Bentwood, </em>146 N.H. 251, 253 (2001). \u2018We will uphold a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a directed verdict when the record supports the conclusion that the trial court did not commit an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Ward, </em>156 N.H. at 24 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>In this state, \u201cfiduciary relationship\u201d has been defined comprehensively, and exists wherever influence has been acquired and abused or confidence has been reposed and betrayed. <em>Brzica v. Trustees of Dartmouth College, </em>147 N.H. 443, 447 (2002). A fiduciary relationship exists between two persons when one has gained the confidence of the other and purports to act or advise with the other\u2019s interest in mind. <em>Id. </em>at 447-48. \u201cOnce a person becomes a fiduciary, the law places him in the role of a moral person and pressures him to behave in a selfless fashion while contract law does not go beyond the morals of the market place where self-interest is the norm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">C&amp;L argues that insurance brokers do not, generally, owe a fiduciary duty to their clients. More specifically, C&amp;L contends that the parties\u2019 relationship was that of an ordinary broker and client, bound by the norms of contract law, and not a fiduciary relationship requiring it to act in the interests of EDC. According to C&amp;L, there is no evidence that it performed differently than any other insurance broker or that by its actions it created a fiduciary relationship. C&amp;L argues that any representations it made were mere advertising puffery that cannot, as a matter of law, create a fiduciary relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">EDC does not argue that insurance brokers, as a general matter, owe fiduciary duties to their clients; nor does it argue that such a relationship would exist in all eases. EDC contends only that in this case, there was sufficient evidence of a fiduciary relationship that the trial court did not err in denying C&amp;L\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">We observe first that during discussions about the jury instructions prior to the close of the evidence, C&amp;L\u2019s counsel conceded that when C&amp;L advertised that it owed a \u201cfiduciary responsibility\u201d to its clients, such advertising \u201cmight create a question of fact for the jury.\u201d He further stated that \u201cthe jury would need to determine whether they\u2019re just an insurance broker or an insurance broker plus.\u201d Thus, prior to moving for a directed verdict, C&amp;L acknowledged that its advertising materials could create a question for the jury about the existence of a fiduciary relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Furthermore, while C&amp;L\u2019s advertising, in itself, might not be enough to demonstrate the existence of a fiduciary relationship, C&amp;L\u2019s president, Paul Clark, testified that he understood the use of the term \u201cfiduciary\u201d in his company\u2019s advertising materials to mean that C&amp;L would put its clients\u2019 interests first. He then testified to several instances when C&amp;L placed the welfare of EDC before its own interests. Further, EDC\u2019s former director of human resources, Christine Connors, testified that at the time C&amp;L was hired, she understood it was supposed to work for EDC\u2019s best interests, and that EDC relied upon C&amp;L to disclose everything it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>needed to know about its insurance needs. We believe this evidence and the inferences therefrom, considered most favorably to EDC, would be sufficient for a rational juror to conclude that C&amp;L had a fiduciary relationship with EDC. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s denial of C&amp;L\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was not an unsustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Finally, EDC argues that the trial court erroneously denied its post-trial motion for forfeiture. In that motion, EDC argued that since C&amp;L was determined to have breached a fiduciary duty, it was not entitled to any of the commissions it had earned from EDC\u2019s contracts since 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In its pleadings, EDC did not raise a specific claim for forfeiture of all commissions earned by C&amp;L. Further, during trial EDC maintained that the damages it sought from C&amp;L were for the difference between the commissions paid to C&amp;L, and those which would have been paid pursuant to the \u201cstandard\u201d rates. In fact, in its closing arguments to the jury, EDC argued that it was seeking only the difference between the \u201cstandard\u201d commissions and those actually paid to C&amp;L. EDC did not request an instruction on the issue of forfeiture, and did not object to the lack of such an instruction. Only after the trial had ended did EDC claim that it was entitled to recover such damages. Accordingly, C&amp;L was never put on notice that it had to defend against such a claim. In these circumstances, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying EDC\u2019s post-trial forfeiture motion. <em>See Thompson v. C&amp;C Research &amp; Dev., </em>153 N.H. 446, 451-52 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b268-7\">Broderick, C.J., and Duggan and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
