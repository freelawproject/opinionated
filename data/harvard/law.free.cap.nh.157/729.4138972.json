Both motions concerned a single issue: whether the Commission had jurisdiction to hold a hearing on a complaint alleging that the petitioner engaged in misconduct when selling his own property. <em>See </em>RSA 331-A:4,1 (2004). The trial court ruled that the Commission had jurisdiction. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The trial court\u2019s order recited the following facts. The petitioner became a licensed real estate salesperson in 1963 and a licensed real estate broker in 1965. The Commission suspended his licenses in 1987, and revoked them in 1989. Since 1989, therefore, the petitioner has had neither a real estate broker nor a salesperson license.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">In 2005, the petitioner placed \u201cFor Sale\u201d signs on property he owns in Pembroke, and at nearby locations. The signs included the name \u201cHomestead Realty,\u201d a telephone number, and an \u201cR\u201d emblem indicating that Homestead Realty is a member of the National Association of Realtors. Upon seeing the signs, Carlos and Katherine Moreira telephoned the petitioner to ask about buying the property. They asked whether he was the realtor for the property, to which he said, \u201cyes.\u201d Upon meeting them, the petitioner allegedly provided the Moreiras with a business card that identified him as a broker at Homestead Realty. The business card contained the same \u201cR\u201d emblem as the \u201cFor Sale\u201d signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">The Moreiras and the petitioner entered into a purchase and sale agreement, and the Moreiras gave him a first deposit of $1,000. The petitioner wrote \u201cNo Broker\u201d on the receipt. Two weeks later, the Moreiras gave the petitioner a second deposit, a $1,000 check made payable to Homestead Realty. The petitioner wrote a receipt on the back of a second business card, which also identified him as a broker and included the \u201cR\u201d symbol. The Moreiras subsequently paid the remainder of the down payment. Following a dispute regarding the contract\u2019s terms, the Moreiras filed a complaint with the Commission, in which they alleged that the petitioner had violated the New Hampshire Real Estate Practices Act (the Act). <em>See </em>RSA ch. 331-A (2004 &amp; Supp. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">At the hearing on the Moreiras\u2019 complaint, the petitioner moved to dismiss the proceedings for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. After denying the motion and conducting the hearing, the Commission concluded that the petitioner had violated: (1) RSA 331-A:3 (2004) and RSA 331-A:34 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>(Supp. 2007) by directly or indirectly acting as a real estate broker without a license; (2) RSA 331-A:26, II (2004) by disregarding the Commission\u2019s prior order revoking his licenses; and (3) RSA 331-A:26, XVI (2004) by misrepresenting his membership in a state or national realty organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\">The petitioner appealed to the superior court contesting the Commission\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction. The superior court upheld the Commission\u2019s decision, and this appeal followed. The sole issue for our review is whether the Commission had subject matter jurisdiction even though the petitioner owned the property at issue. <em>See </em>RSA 331-A:4,1.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">This jurisdictional issue involves interpreting the Act, which is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. See In re Juvenile </em>2001-0169, 151 N.H. 706, 707 (2005). We are the final arbiters of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Blackthorne Group v. Pines of Newmarket, </em>150 N.H. 804, 806 (2004). We first examine the language of the statute, and, where possible, ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used. <em>Id. </em>When a statute\u2019s language is plain and unambiguous, we need not look beyond it for further indication of legislative intent, and we refuse to consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to incorporate in the statute. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, we interpret statutes in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation. <em>Id. </em>By so doing, we are better able to discern the legislature\u2019s intent and to interpret statutory language in light of the policy or purpose sought to be advanced by the statutory scheme. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The Act establishes a comprehensive system for regulating real estate sales and brokerage practices. <em>Id. </em>Its purpose is to \u201cregulate the practice of real estate brokers and salespersons in order to ensure that they meet and maintain minimum standards which promote public understanding and confidence in the business of real estate brokerage.\u201d RSA 331-A:1 (2004). It was enacted to protect the public against broker fraud and incompetence. <em>Blackthome Group, </em>150 N.H. at 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">\u201cThe primary focus of the [Act] is to provide a licensing procedure, whereby all persons who act in the capacity of real estate salespeople or brokers are regulated by the strictures of the licensing law.\u201d <em>Finlay Commercial Real Estate v. Paino, </em>133 N.H. 4, 7 (1990). Towards this end, the Act sets forth the requirements for licensure, <em>see </em>RSA 331-A:10 (Supp. 2007), and prohibits \u201cany person, directly or indirectly, to act as a real estate broker or real estate salesperson without a license and otherwise complying with the provisions of this chapter,\u201d RSA 331-A:3. Acting as a real estate broker or salesperson without a license constitutes a class A misdemeanor. <em>See </em>RSA 331-A:34.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The Act defines a \u201c[b]roker\u201d as \u201cany person acting for another on commission or for other compensation ... , or any person licensed under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>this chapter who\u201d among other things \u201c[ajdvertises or holds oneself out as being engaged in the business of buying, selling, exchanging, renting or leasing real estate.\u201d RSA 331-A.-2, 111(g) (2004). A salesperson is \u201can individual who is licensed under a broker to participate in any activity described in [RSA 331-A:2, III].\u201d RSA 331-A:2, X (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\">The Commission administers the Act. <em>See </em>RSA 331-A:5 (2004). By statute, the Commission \u201cmay investigate the actions of any person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a real estate broker or real estate salesperson, regardless of whether the transaction was for the person\u2019s own account or in the capacity as broker or salesperson,\u201d RSA 331-A:28,1 (2004), and may impose discipline for any misconduct, <em>see id., </em>or seek judicial relief, <em>see </em>RSA 331-A:35, IV (2004). The Commission may also cause a criminal complaint to be filed. <em>See </em>RSA 331-A:35, I, II (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">RSA 331-A:26 (2004 &amp; Supp. 2007) describes in thirty-eight paragraphs \u201cspecific courses of conduct which in and of themselves constitute breaches or violations of the standards to which the legislature requires brokers and salespeople to be held.\u201d <em>Finlay Commercial Real Estate, </em>133 N.H. at 7. Any licensee found guilty of engaging in the conduct described in RSA 331-A:26 \u201cshall be subject to disciplinary action as provided in RSA 331-A:28.\u201d RSA 331-A:26. The conduct prohibited includes: (1) violating any provision of the Act or any order issued pursuant to the Act; and (2) misrepresenting membership in any state or national real estate association. RSA 331-A:26, II, XVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The petitioner, relying upon RSA 331-A:4,1, argues that he is exempt from the Act\u2019s provisions because he was selling his own property. RSA 331-A:4, I, provides that the provisions of the Act shall not apply to: \u201cAn owner, builder or tenant of real estate ... with respect to property owned or leased by the owner, builder, or tenant.\u201d The petitioner asserts that because he is exempt from the Act, the Commission lacked jurisdiction to conduct the hearing on the Moreiras\u2019 complaint. We agree. The plain meaning of RSA 331-A:4, I, is that a property owner with respect to property owned by him is exempt from the Act\u2019s provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\"> The State mistakenly contends that the property owner exemption does not apply here because the petitioner held himself out to be a real estate broker. There is no qualifying language in the property owner exemption. <em>See </em>RSA 331-A:4, I. It applies even when a property owner holds himself out to be a real estate broker. By contrast, the exemption for corporate consultants specifically states that it applies only when the consultant \u201cdoes not hold himself or herself out as a real estate broker.\u201d RSA 331-A:4, VIII (2004). Had the legislature intended the property owner exemption to apply only when the property owner does not hold himself out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>to be a real estate broker, it could have included similar language. We cannot, however, consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to incorporate in the statute. <em>Blackthorne Group, </em>150 N.H. at 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-3\">The State also argues that the Commission had jurisdiction over the matters before it under RSA 331-A:28,1. RSA 331-A:28, I, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-4\">The commission may investigate the actions of any person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a real estate broker or real estate salesperson, regardless of whether the transaction was for the person\u2019s own account or in the capacity as broker or salesperson. If found guilty, after a hearing, of violating this chapter, the commission may impose any one or more of the following sanctions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-5\">(a) Suspend, revoke or deny a license or the renewal of such license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\">(b) Levy a fine not to exceed $2,000 for each offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">(c) Require the person to complete a course or courses in selected areas of real estate practice relevant to the section of this chapter violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">The plain meaning of RSA 331-A:4,1, however, is that the provisions of the Act, including RSA 331-A:28,1, do not apply when a property owner is selling his own property. Even if we were to assume, without deciding, that, as the State contends, we must modify the plain language of RSA 331~A:4, I, by construing it together with RSA 331-A:28, I, the State would not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\"> When interpreting two or more statutes that deal with a similar subject matter, we construe them so that they do not contradict each other, and so that they will lead to reasonable results and effectuate the legislative purpose of the statutes. <em>Chase v. Ameriquest Mortgage Co., </em>155 N.H. 19, 22 (2007). Thus construed, we would conclude that, at best, RSA 331-A:28, I, grants the Commission the authority to investigate the actions of an alleged property owner, but that RSA 331-A:4, I, prohibits the Commission from imposing discipline if, after investigation, it confirms that the person owns the property in question. Any other construction would render RSA 331-A:4, I, superfluous. <em>See Silva v. Botsch, </em>120 N.H. 600, 602 (1980) (construing a statute to render some provisions superfluous is inconsistent with legislative intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">For all of the above reasons, therefore, we hold that the petitioner was exempt from the Act\u2019s provisions, and the Commission, thus, lacked jurisdiction to hold a hearing on the Moreiras\u2019 complaint. Should the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>legislature disagree with our interpretation of the Act, it is free to amend the Act as it sees fit. Moreover, we note that the chapter as a whole contains several internally inconsistent and confusing provisions; thus, the legislature may wish to revise it to make it clearer.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b774-6\">Broderick, C.J., and Duggan, Galway and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
