CT. R. 11; RSA 490:4 (1997), challenging an order of the Superior Court <em>(Groff, </em>J.) dismissing the indictment against the defendant, Victor Laporte. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The record supports the following facts. In May 2004, the Hillsborough County Grand Jury indicted the defendant on one count of endangering the welfare of a child. <em>See </em>RSA 639:3, III (2007). According to the trial court\u2019s order, the indictment alleged that the defendant \u201cknowingly solicited A.L____who was at the time under the age of 16 years of age, to have sexual intercourse with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that it failed to allege, in accordance with the criminal solicitation statute, that he acted \u201cwith a purpose that another engage in conduct constituting a crime.\u201d RSA 629:2,1 (2007). The trial court granted his motion, ruling that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">Since the term solicitation is not defined in RSA 639, the statute defining criminal solicitation guides us. RSA 629:21 provides that \u201ca person is guilty of criminal solicitation if, with a purpose that another engage in conduct constituting a crime, he . . . solicits or requests such other person to engage in such conduct.\u201d Therefore, under RSA 639:3, II [sic], it must be alleged and proven that the defendant acted with the required criminal intent of, \u201cwith a purpose that the other person engage in the criminal conduct.\u201d... Since the indictment failed to allege this state of mind, the indictment is defective and insufficient and must be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">The State moved for reconsideration, which the trial court denied, and now seeks a writ of certiorari here. Despite the fact that the trial court referenced RSA 639:3, II in its order, it is clear from the order that the trial court was interpreting RSA 639:3, III.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">Certiorari is an extraordinary remedy that is not granted as a matter of right, but rather at the discretion of the court. <em>Petition of State of N.H. (State v. Giovanni), </em>154 N.H. 671, 674 (2007); <em>see </em>Sup. Ct. R. 11. We exercise our power to grant the writ sparingly and only where to do otherwise would result in substantial injustice. <em>Petition of State of N.H., </em>154 N.H. at 674. Certiorari review is limited to whether the trial court acted illegally with respect to jurisdiction, authority or observance of the law, or unsustainably exercised its discretion or acted arbitrarily, unreasonably, or capriciously. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Here, we grant review because certiorari is the only avenue by which the State may seek relief from an order dismissing a case after jeopardy has attached. <em>See </em>RSA 606:10 (2001) (specifying the circumstances in which the State may appeal to the supreme court in a criminal case); <em>see also Petition of State of N.H. (State v. Johanson), </em>156 N.H. 148, 150 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The sole issue for our review is whether the trial court erroneously interpreted RSA 639:3, III. We review the trial court\u2019s interpretation of statutes <em>de novo. Petition of the State of New Hampshire (State v. Campbell), </em>152 N.H. 515, 520 (2005). This court is the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole. <em>State v. Balukas, </em>155 N.H. 377, 378 (2007). In interpreting a statute, we first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, we interpret statutes in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation. <em>Id. </em>We do not consider legislative history to construe a statute that is clear on its face. <em>Id. </em>at 378-79. Finally, we do not strictly construe criminal statutes, but rather construe them \u201caccording to the fair import of their terms and to promote justice.\u201d RSA 625:3 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">RSA 639:3 reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">I. A person is guilty of endangering the welfare of a child or incompetent if he knowingly endangers the welfare of a child under 18 years of age or of an incompetent person by purposely violating a duty of care, protection or support he owes to such child or incompetent, or by inducing such child or incompetent to engage in conduct that endangers his health or safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">III. In the prosecution of any person under this section, the solicitation by any person of a child under the age of 16 to engage in sexual activity as defined by RSA 649-A:2, III for the purpose of creating a visual representation as defined in RSA 649-A:2, IV, or to engage in sexual penetration as defined by RSA 632-A:l, V, constitutes endangering the welfare of such child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The defendant argues that RSA 639:3, III requires an indictment to allege that a defendant\u2019s solicitation be \u201cwith a purpose that another engage in conduct constituting a crime.\u201d RSA 629:2,1. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">First, the plain language of RSA 639:3, III does not incorporate the definition of criminal solicitation in RSA 629:2,1. RSA 639:3, III uses only the term \u201csolicitation,\u201d without any modification. Nor does RSA 629:2 purport to define the term \u201csolicitation\u201d; indeed, RSA 629:2, I, provides that a person is guilty of \u201ccriminal solicitation\u201d if, with the <em>mens rea, </em>he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>\u201ccommands, solicits or requests\u201d another to engage in conduct constituting a crime. The use of the term \u201csolicits\u201d as one of three alternative means of committing the <em>actus reus </em>clearly demonstrates that the terms \u201ccriminal solicitation\u201d and \u201csolicitation\u201d are not synonymous. \u201cCriminal solicitation\u201d encompasses both the <em>actus reus </em>of \u201csoliciting\u201d and the <em>mens rea </em>of having the \u201cpurpose that another engage in conduct constituting a crime.\u201d RSA 629:2, I. \u201cSolicits\u201d or \u201csolicitation,\u201d in contrast, refers solely to the <em>actus reus. </em>Accordingly, we look to the plain meaning of \u201csolicitation.\u201d <em>Balukas, </em>155 N.H. at 378. The plain meaning of solicitation is \u201cto entice\u201d or \u201cto strongly urge.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2169 (unabridged ed. 2002). Therefore, an individual is guilty of solicitation pursuant to RSA 639:3, III if he entices or strongly urges a child under the age of sixteen to engage in sexual penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Moreover, RSA 639:3, III cannot be read in isolation. <em>Balukas, </em>155 N.H. at 378. Reading RSA 639:3 as a whole demonstrates that the conduct defined in RSA 639:3, III is a subset of the conduct criminalized by RSA 639:3,1. RSA 639:3,1, states that an individual is guilty of endangering the welfare of a child \u201cif he <em>knowingly </em>endangers the welfare of a child.\u201d (Emphasis added.) RSA 639:3, III then defines certain conduct that constitutes endangering the welfare of a child. <em>See </em>RSA 639:3, III. Thus, the \u201cknowingly\u201d mental state in paragraph I applies to the conduct defined in paragraph III. Accordingly, an indictment that alleges that a defendant \u201cknowingly\u201d solicited a child under the age of sixteen to engage in sexual penetration as defined by RSA 632-A:l, V satisfies the requirements of RSA 639:3, III.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The defendant mistakenly relies upon our decision in <em>State v. Paulsen, </em>143 N.H. 447 (1999), to support his assertion that a prosecution under RSA 639:3, III requires incorporation of the definition of criminal solicitation in RSA 629:2, I. Although in <em>Paulsen </em>we referenced RSA 629:2, I, for guidance in interpreting RSA 639:3, III, we did not rely upon it to determine the elements of the crime of endangering a child. <em>Paulsen, </em>143 N.H. at 450. We looked to RSA 629:2 solely to determine whether a course of conduct could be charged in an indictment under RSA 639:3. <em>Id. </em>Thus, contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, we did not conclude in <em>Paulsen </em>that to sustain an indictment under RSA 639:3, III, the indictment must include the language governing criminal solicitation from RSA 629:2,1; rather, we concluded that prosecution under RSA 639:3, III prohibits charging a course of conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 450-51. This is different from determining whether a prosecution under RSA 639:3, III for soliciting a child under the age of sixteen to engage in sexual activity requires a purposeful mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Finally, the defendant looks to the structure of RSA 639:3, arguing that since the <em>mens rea </em>of \u201cpurposely\u201d applies to the \u201cduty of care\u201d element under paragraph I and \u201cthe visual representation\u201d element under paragraph III, we should also apply it to the \u201csolicitation\u201d element under paragraph III. <em>See </em>RSA 639:3,1, III. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">RSA 639:3, I, generally requires proof that the defendant \u201cknowingly\u201d endangered the welfare of a child. As the defendant correctly notes, the legislature prescribed the culpability of \u201cpurposely\u201d for certain elements, but not for others, in RSA 639:3. We conclude that the legislature intended the <em>mens rea </em>of \u201cknowingly\u201d to apply to all the material elements except those to which it specifically assigned the higher culpability of \u201cpurposely.\u201d <em>Cf </em>RSA 626:2,1 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In this case, the indictment alleged that the defendant \u201cknowingly\u201d solicited a child under the age of sixteen to engage in sexual penetration. We hold that alleging a <em>mens rea </em>of \u201cknowingly\u201d was proper pursuant to RSA 639:3, III and that the trial court erred by granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"Azp\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
