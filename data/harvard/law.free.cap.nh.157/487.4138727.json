We affirm in part, vacate in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The trial court found or the record supports the following. In 1895, the New Hampshire legislature created the Portsmouth Regional Hospital (hospital) as a public trust. In 1983, the trustees of the hospital decided to sell the hospital and entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) with HCA and HCA-NH. When the parties entered into the APA, HCA was a publicly traded national corporation that owned all of the common stock of HCA-NH. Upon closing, HCA-NH became the owner of the hospital\u2019s assets and operator of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The proceeds of the sale went to the creation of the Foundation, a nonprofit entity charged with, among other things, ensuring that the hospital continued to meet the healthcare needs of the community. The APA affords the Foundation a right of first refusal (ROFR) to repurchase the hospital\u2019s tangible assets under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">We note here that HCA has undergone numerous transactions since 1983 and is currently survived by a successor. For ease of reference, we adopt the defendants\u2019 use of the term \u201cHCA3\u201d to refer to the 1983 iteration of HCA and all its successors. We also note that the defendants acknowledge that HCA3 took HCA\u2019s place under the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The ROFR provision reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">5.2.11. <em>Right to Repurchase Hospital.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">(a) <em>Right of First Refusal. </em>Neither [HCA3] nor HCA-NH will directly or indirectly by merger or transfer of stock or otherwise sell, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of all or any substantial part of the assets of the Hospital (a \u201cTransfer\u201d) unless (i) [HCA3] shall have received a bona fide arm\u2019s length written offer with respect to the Transfer of such assets of the Hospital (a \u201cBona Fide Offer\u201d), and (ii) prior to the making of any such Transfer, [HCA3] shall have given written notice to the Foundation stating its desire to dispose of such assets and enclosing a copy of the Bona Fide Offer. Thereafter, the Foundation shall have an assignable option to purchase all (but not less than all) of the tangible assets specified in such notice, said option to be exercised by the giving, by the Foundation or its assignee (the \u201cPurchaser\u201d), as appropriate, within 120 days after delivery of such notice, of a counter-notice stating that the sender of such counter-notice desires to purchase all of such assets. . . . Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5.2.11(a) shall not apply to a Transfer by [HCA3] or HCA-NH to a wholly-owned subsidiary of [HCA3] (\u201cTransferee\u201d) if, from and after such Transfer, the Transferee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>shall perform and assume all obligations of [HCA3] and HCA-NH under this Agreement and prior to such Transfer shall agree to such performance and assumption of obligations in a writing satisfactory to the Seller; provided, however, that no such Transfer shall relieve [HCA3] from any of its obligations hereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-5\"><em>APA </em>\u00a7 5.2.11(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">HCA-NH continued to own and operate the hospital since the parties entered into the APA in 1983. However, numerous transactions and corporate restructurings occurred after 1983 significantly altering the corporate structure above HCA-NH. We need not recite every transaction here. Because the issues on appeal center around a 2006 leveraged buy-out (2006 LBO) and a transaction in 1999 (1999 transaction), we recite only those facts pertinent to these transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">By 1999, HCA3, now a limited liability company by merger, was held by a company called Healthtrust, Inc. \u2014 The Hospital Company (Healthtrust), which in turn was held by a company called Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation (Columbia). HCA3, in turn, owned 100% membership interest in Hospital Corp., LLC. Hospital Corp., LLC had previously been inserted, through a series of transactions, into the corporate chain between HCA3 and HCA-NH, and in 1999, it owned 100% of the common stock of HCA-NH, which continued to own the hospital\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">In the 1999 transaction, HCA3 transferred 100% of its membership interest in Hospital Corp., LLC to HCA3\u2019s parent, Healthtrust. This resulted in the removal of HCA3 from the hospital\u2019s corporate chain. HCA3 did not send the Foundation written notice of this transaction. After the 1999 transaction, Columbia was the parent corporation to Healthtrust, which held Hospital Corp., LLC, which was the parent company to HCA-NH, which owned the hospital\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Over the next two years, Columbia\u2019s name was changed twice and by 2001, it was known as HCA Inc. In 2006, HCA Inc. was the subject of the 2006 LBO, through which a group of private investors acquired all of HCA Inc.\u2019s stock. HCA Inc. did not send the Foundation written notice of this transaction. In response to inquiries from the Foundation, HCA Inc. sent a letter explaining its position that the ROFR was not triggered by the 2006 LBO.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">In October 2006, before the 2006 LBO transaction was finalized, the Foundation filed suit against HCA3 and HCA-NH seeking: (1) a declaratory judgment that the proposed 2006 LBO triggered the ROFR; (2) injunctive relief to prohibit the LBO; (3) specific performance under the terms of the ROFR; and (4) damages for a breach of the implied covenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>of good faith and fair dealing. The Foundation subsequently withdrew its motion for injunctive relief and the HCA Inc. shareholders completed the 2006 LBO.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In March 2007, both the Foundation and the defendants filed motions for summary judgment. The defendants sought summary judgment on all counts; the Foundation sought partial summary judgment on its petition for declaratory judgment \u201cthat the recent sale of the Defendants\u2019 corporate parent triggered an unambiguous contractual right of first refusal belonging to the Foundation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In April, before the hearing on the summary judgment motions, the Foundation filed an amended petition adding a claim for breach of contract for the refusal to give the Foundation \u201can opportunity to exercise its right of first refusal\u201d during the 2006 LBO. The amended petition also added claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing against the defendants for the 1999 transaction, which the Foundation asserted it had learned of \u201conly recently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In May 2007, the trial court issued an order denying the Foundation\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, resulting in the dismissal of the Foundation\u2019s challenge to the 2006 LBO. Finding the language of the ROFR unambiguous, the trial court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">[A]bsent a \u201cchange of control\u201d provision in a ROFR clause, a stock sale does not generally amount to a transfer of corporate assets that will trigger the ROFR. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">[T]he plain terms of the ROFR at issue here do not guarantee the Foundation a right-of-first-refusal triggered by a change in HCA [Ine.]\u2019s shareholders. HCA-NH is still the direct owner of the assets of Portsmouth Regional Hospital; until such time as those assets have been legally transferred to another entity, the ROFR lies dormant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">The defendants subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the Foundation\u2019s remaining claims regarding the 1999 transaction for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted. The defendants argued that the court\u2019s summary judgment order compelled dismissal of the Foundation\u2019s remaining claims. The court agreed, ruling: \u201c[The] prior order [of] the court found as a matter of law that the Foundation\u2019s ROFR is only triggered by an actual transfer of the assets[,]\u201d and \u201c[d]espite the corporate reformations ... in 1999, actual ownership of the assets of the Hospital has remained constant.\u201d The Foundation argues that the trial court erred in finding \u201cthat only a transfer of the Hospital assets from their immediate owner triggers the right of first refusal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>\n<em>II. The Right of First Refusal Provision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\u201cThe interpretation of a contract, including whether a contract term is ambiguous, is ultimately a question of law for this court to decide. Accordingly, we review a trial court\u2019s interpretation of a contract <em>de novo.\u201d Behrens v. S.P. Constr. Co., </em>153 N.H. 498, 500 (2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">When interpreting a contract, \u201cour inquiry focuses on the intent of the contracting parties at the time of the agreement.\u201d <em>R. Zoppo Co. v. City of Dover, </em>124 N.H. 666, 671 (1984).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">In the absence of ambiguity, the parties\u2019 intent will be determined from the plain meaning of the language used. The words and phrases used by the parties will be assigned their common meaning, and we will ascertain the intended purpose of the contract based upon the meaning that would be given to it by a reasonable person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-7\"><em>Greenhalgh v. Presstek, </em>152 N.H. 695, 698 (2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The Foundation argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion for partial summary judgment because: (1) the plain language of the ROFR provision demonstrates an intent to reach parent-level stock transactions; (2) the ROFR provision and the APA as a whole demonstrate an intent to bind the entire corporate structure; (3) reading the APA as a whole reflects the broad reach of the ROFR provision intended by the parties; and (4) the inclusion of \u201cchange of control\u201d language in the ROFR provision is not required for the ROFR to apply to a change in ownership of a parent company\u2019s stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">The Foundation first argues that under the plain language of the ROFR provision, stock transactions involving parents or other upstream entities of HCA3 may trigger the ROFR. We disagree. The ROFR provision states: \u201cNeither [HCA3] nor HCA-NH will ...\u201d We find this phrase to be unambiguous. It specifies only two actors that can trigger the ROFR: HCA3 and HCA-NH. This language does not demonstrate an intent that actions, such as a stock transfer, by a parent or other upstream entity of HCA3 trigger the ROFR.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">The Foundation, however, cites <em>H-B-S Partnership v. Aircoa Hospitality, </em>114 P.3d 306 (N.M. Ct. App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>113 P.3d 345 (N.M. 2005), <em>In re Asian Yard Partners, </em>Nos. 95-333-PJW, 95-334-PJW, 1995 WL 1781675 (Bankr. D. Del. Sept. 18, 1995) and <em>Continental Cablevision v. United Broadcasting, </em>873 F.2d 717 (4th Cir. 1989), and argues that these courts have \u201cconclude[d] that parent-level stock transactions trigger similar rights of first refusal\u201d where the language \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d was included in the right of first refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>In <em>H-B-S Partnership, </em>the El Dorado Partnership (EDP) was formed by Aircoa Hospitality Services, Inc. (AHS), NZ EDP, Ltd. Company (NZ) and H-B-S Partnership (HBS), for the purpose of acquiring an interest in the El Dorado Hotel. <em>H-B-S Partnership, </em>114 P.3d at 308. The partnership agreement contained the following right of first refusal (HBS ROFR):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\">[I]f at any time a Partner proposes to sell, assign, or otherwise dispose of all or any part of his interest in the Partnership, such Partner (\u201cOfferor\u201d) shall first make a written offer to sell such Partnership interest to the other Partners on the same terms and conditions on which the Offeror proposes to transfer the Partnership interest. Such offer shall state the name of the proposed transferee and all the terms and conditions of the proposed transfer, including the price to the proposed transferee ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">For purposes of this agreement, restrictions upon the sale, assignment or disposition of a Partner\u2019s interest shall extend to any direct or indirect transfer including, without limitation: (a) an involuntary transfer such as a transfer pursuant to a foreclosure sale; (b) a transfer resulting by operation of law, or as a result of any merger, consolidation or similar action; and (c) the transfer of an equity interest in a Partner which is a corporation, partnership or other entity if the transfer of the equity interest results in a change in control of such corporation, partnership or other entity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 308-09 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Subsequently, notice of a proposed sale of Richfield Holding Corporation (RHC), the great-great-grandparent of AHS (one of the partners) was sent to HBS and NZ. <em>Id. </em>at 310. Under the terms of the proposed sale, the seller offered a one hundred percent equity interest in RHC, which included all of RHC\u2019s interests in assets. <em>Id. </em>Among the assets listed was AHS\u2019s equity interest in EDP. <em>Id. </em>HBS sought to enforce the HBS ROFR against AHS and demanded that it be provided with an identical written offer. <em>Id. </em>AHS refused, denying that the HBS ROFR was triggered. <em>Id. </em>The sale of RHC went through and HBS brought suit against AHS. <em>Id. </em>at 310-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The court held that the sale of RHC \u201cconstitute^] an indirect transfer of an \u2018equity interest in a Partner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314 (emphasis omitted). The court emphasized that \u201c \u2018Transfer\u2019 is itself broadly defined by [the HBS ROFR provision] to encompass \u2018any direct or indirect transfer\u2019 of an equity interest by or in a partner \u2018without limitation[ ]\u2019 \u201d and that, therefore, \u201cthe [HBS] ROFR is triggered regardless of whether the transaction is two or even five tiers removed, so long as it results in a change of that control of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>AHS.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Recognizing \u201cthe general rule that a sale of a subsidiary by a parent corporation is not a sale of the subsidiary\u2019s assets, unless the assets are actually transferred,\u201d <em>id., </em>the court held that the HBS ROFR provision was worded broadly so as to include such indirect transfers and that while \u201c[t]he general rule will hold true in most cases,... [it] can be trumped by contract language,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">While we recognize that <em>H-B-S Partnership </em>stands for the principle that a right of first refusal can be triggered by stock transactions of entities far up the corporate chain from the parties to the right of first refusal, it stands equally for the principle that the plain language of the right of first refusal controls over general principles of law. <em>Id. </em>at 314-15; <em>see also Glick v. Chocorua Forestlands, L.P., </em>157 N.H. 240, 247-48 (2008). As recognized by the <em>H-B-S Partnership </em>court, the HBS ROFR provision was worded broadly, as evidenced by the language: \u201cwithout limitation\u201d and \u201cincluding . . . the transfer of an equity interest in a Partner ... if [such] transfer... results in a change in control.\u201d <em>H-B-S Partnership, </em>114 P.3d at 309 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The ROFR provision before us, however, is narrower than the one in <em>H-B-S Partnership. </em>While both ROFR provisions contain the term \u201cindirectly,\u201d the ROFR provision before us does not contain language such as \u201cwithout limitation\u201d and \u201cresulting] in a change in control,\u201d \u2014 language that the <em>H-B-S Partnership </em>court relied upon in its interpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 313. Accordingly, we find <em>H-B-S Partnership </em>distinguishable on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In addition, we find that <em>Asian Yard </em>and <em>Continental </em>do not support the Foundation\u2019s argument that the language \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d binds corporate entities that are not parties to a right of first refusal. These cases, while involving a right of first refusal provision and an anti-assignment clause that contained \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d language, also involved transfers <em>by a party to the agreement. Asian Yard, </em>1995 WL 1781675, at *5; <em>Continental, </em>873 F.2d at 719. The courts in these cases, therefore, never addressed whether the term \u201cindirectly\u201d bound other entities that were not parties to the agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Accordingly, we find the cases relied upon by the Foundation on this point to be unpersuasive. We rely instead upon the plain and unambiguous language of the ROFR provision, which unequivocally specifies the two actors that may trigger it, HCA3 or HCA-NH. If neither party acts, the ROFR is not triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">The Foundation next argues that the parties to the ROFR provision intended that it bind the entire corporate structure. The Foundation claims: (1) \u201cthe parties agreed to the terms \u2018directly or indirectly\u2019 and \u2018by merger or transfer of stock or otherwise,\u2019 language which has previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>been held to evidence an intent to bind the entire corporate structure\u201d; (2) the APA contains language \u201capplicable to all of the post-closing covenants, that clearly places the obligation to comply with those commitments on any member of the . . . corporate family in a position to effect compliance or noncompliance\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe parties included language that restricted [HCA3] from transferring direct or indirect ownership of the Hospital assets within its corporate structure in a way that might defeat or impair the intended operation of the ROFR.\u201d We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">The Foundation\u2019s first argument on this point is merely a reiteration of its previous argument, as noted in its brief. Therefore, we rely upon our analysis above regarding the \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The Foundation next argues that language found elsewhere in the APA establishes that actions by any member of the corporate family may trigger the ROFR. Specifically, the Foundation cites the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">5.2. <em>Covenants Surviving the Closing. </em>In addition to their other undertakings herein, each of [HCA3] and HCA-NH hereby covenants and agrees that it will comply (and, to the extent applicable, will cause .. . [the] subsidiaries of [HCA3] to comply) from and after the date hereof with the provisions set forth in this Section 5.2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">We fail to see how this language establishes that actions by any member of the corporate family may trigger the ROFR. Its primary function is to bind HCA3 and HCA-NH to the terms set forth in Section 5.2. The Foundation, however, emphasizes the parenthetical language: \u201cwill cause ... [the] subsidiaries of [HCA3] to comply.\u201d We read this unambiguous language of this provision to promise, and only \u201cto the extent applicable,\u201d that HCA3 and HCA-NH \u201cwill cause ... [the] <em>subsidiaries of [HCAS] </em>to complyG . . . with the provisions set forth in Section 5.2.\u201d (Emphasis added). This provision, therefore, only addresses subsidiaries of HCA3. It does not evince an intent to include each member of the corporate family as an actor capable of triggering the ROFR contained in Section 5.2.11(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Finally on this issue, the Foundation argues that the ROFR provision contains language which prevents the defendants from engaging in intracorporate transactions that would defeat the \u201cintended operation of the ROFR.\u201d The Foundation specifically points to a clause in the ROFR which allows \u201ca Transfer by [HCA3] or HCA-NH to a wholly-owned subsidiary of [HCA3]\u201d provided the subsidiary agrees in writing to the terms of the APA. <em>APA </em>\u00a7 5.2.11(a). This provision, however, specifically addresses only wholly-owned subsidiaries of HCA3.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Next, the Foundation argues that the APA, when read as a whole, reflects the parties\u2019 intent that the ROFR can be triggered by other actors in the hospital\u2019s corporate chain other than HCA3 and HCA-NH. It argues that \u201cthis Court has emphasized that rights of first refusal must be construed in the context of the entire agreement between the parties, and in view of both the situation of the parties at the time of contracting and the objects to be served by the contract provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The Foundation argues that HCA3 was carefully selected due to the trustees\u2019 \u201cconcern about selling the Hospital to a for-profit entity and [that the trustees] negotiated an agreement designed to provide maximum protection to the community.\u201d This does not, however, change our reading of the unambiguous terms of the ROFR provision, which specify the constrained actors, HCA3 and HCA-NH. We do not agree with the Foundation\u2019s assessment that our interpretation fails to reflect the parties\u2019 intent, given the express terms of the ROFR provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Finally, on this point, the Foundation argues that inclusion of \u201cchange of control\u201d language is not \u201crequired for [the] ROFR to apply to a change in ownership of a parent company\u2019s stock.\u201d This argument, however, misses the point. Even assuming, arguendo, that this is correct, it does not change the fact that the ROFR provision at issue is not triggered by transfers of stock by an upstream entity of HCA3. As we stated above, if neither HCA3 nor HCA-NH is the entity making the transfer, the ROFR is not triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Accordingly, we hold that, under the plain language of the ROFR provision, only the actions of HCA3 or HCA-NH can trigger the ROFR.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">\n<em>III. The 2006 Leveraged Buyout</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The trial court found that the 2006 LBO did not trigger the ROFR because \u201ca transfer of the hospital\u2019s assets simply did not occur \u2014 either directly or indirectly \u2014 during the ... LBO in 2006. HCA-NH owns the assets of Portsmouth Regional Hospital today, just as it has since 1983.\u201d Because we conclude that neither HCA3 nor HCA-NH acted, however, we need not decide whether the trial court properly found that the hospital\u2019s assets were not transferred, either directly or indirectly, during the 2006 LBO. <em>See EnergyNorth Natural Gas v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>146 N.H. 156, 165 (2001) (\u201cWe will not overrule the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment where it reached the right result, albeit on mistaken grounds.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">In the 2006 LBO, the public shareholders of HCA Inc. approved a leveraged buy-out whereby all public shares in HCA Inc. were sold to private investors. HCA Inc. is the corporate great-grandparent of HCA-NH and an entirely distinct entity from HCA3. <em>See Maryville Hotel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Assocs. <em>I, LLC v. IHC/Maryville Hotel Corp., </em>No. 4:05 CV 1498 DDN, 2006 WL 1237264, at *5 (E.D. Mo. May 5, 2006) (refusing to find \u201cthat the corporate defendant . . . acted to sell[] or transfer[] property interests because its corporate grandparent did so\u201d). Moreover, HCA Inc. itself did not act; it was HCA Inc.\u2019s shareholders who acted in the leveraged buy-out. These facts are not disputed. Thus, neither HCA3 nor HCA-NH acted in the 2006 LBO, and, as explained above, the ROFR was not triggered. <em>See White Wave, Inc. v. Dean Foods Company, </em>No. CIV.A. 01-M-1073, 2001 WL 1833980 (D.Colo. Dec. 5, 2001); <em>Maryville Hotel, </em>2006 WL 1237264, at *5-*6.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Accordingly, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment on all counts involving the 2006 LBO and the Foundation\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\n<em>TV. The 1999 Transaction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Next, we address the trial court\u2019s order dismissing the Foundation\u2019s remaining counts for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing regarding the 1999 transaction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">The standard this court applies in reviewing a motion to dismiss is whether or not the plaintiffs allegations are reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit recovery. We take as true all facts well pleaded, and construe all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\"><em>Bio Energy v. Town of Hopkinton, </em>153 N.H. 145, 151 (2005) (citation, quotations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">First, we note that the Foundation\u2019s petition alleges that \u201c[HCA3], the successor in interest to the original purchaser of the Hospital,\u201d made a transfer. Therefore, the first requirement under the ROFR provision is met, since HCA3 acted. The question before us, therefore, is whether the Foundation\u2019s petition sufficiently alleges that a \u201cTransfer\u201d occurred either \u201cdirectly or indirectly by merger or transfer of stock or otherwise\u201d that disposed of the assets of the hospital. APA \u00a7 5.2.11(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">In support of its claims for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the Foundation alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-11\">[The following] transaction[ ] involved a direct breach of the Foundation\u2019s right of first refusal. . . . [I]n 1999, [HCA3], the successor in interest to the original purchaser of the Hospital, conveyed or otherwise transferred both HCA-NH and the Hospital to its own corporate parent [Healthtrust], without providing notice to the Foundation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>35. Healthtrust was the corporate parent of [HCA3], and was not a wholly owned subsidiary of [HCA3].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">37. At no time did the Defendants notify the Foundation of the 1999 Transaction nor did they give the Foundation an opportunity to purchase the Hospital pursuant to Section 5.2.11(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">70. As set forth above, the actions of the Defendants constitute a breach of the Foundation\u2019s rights under Section 5.2.11(a) of the Agreement....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">71. As a result of Defendants\u2019] actions, the Foundation was denied the opportunity to purchase the Hospital\u2019s assets and/or pursue its available remedies under the APA. Defendants\u2019 breach has caused and continues to cause the Foundation to suffer damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">88. Defendants, without justification and in bad faith, have interfered with the Foundation\u2019s ability to exercise its rights under the Agreement by concealing and failing to provide notice of numerous transactions within the HCA corporate family between 1983 and the present, including the 1999 Transaction, and by conducting their affairs with the Foundation in a manner which indicated that these changes had not occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Accordingly, the Foundation alleged that in 1999, HCA3 \u201ctransferred both HCA-NH and the Hospital to its own corporate parent,\u201d that no notice was given and that this transfer constituted a breach of its ROFR. The Foundation argues that these allegations are reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit recovery under the ROFR provision which provides that the ROFR is triggered when either HCA3 or HCA-NH disposes of the hospital\u2019s assets \u201cindirectly by merger or transfer of stock or otherwise.\u201d The defendants argue that this provision does not apply to the 1999 transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">The trial court did not reach this issue because it granted the motion to dismiss based upon its finding that \u201cactual ownership of the assets of the Hospital has remained constant. . . . [T]he Foundation\u2019s ROFR is only triggered by an actual transfer of the assets of the Hospital [and].. . the Foundation has failed to allege facts showing an actual asset transfer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The Foundation argues that the trial court did not address the actual dispute between the parties, but instead \u201cadopted its own, narrower construction of the APA.\u201d It asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\">Prior to the Superior Court\u2019s Order on summary judgment, neither party had ever taken the position that only a conveyance of the Hospital assets could trigger the right of first refusal. Instead, the parties agreed that some stock transactions triggered the right, but disputed how far up the corporate chain the provision was intended to reach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Indeed, the defendants acknowledged in the trial court and on appeal that the language \u201cindirectly by merger or transfer of stock or otherwise\u201d has meaning and assert that a transfer of HCA-NH\u2019s stock or a merger of HCA-NH would trigger the ROFR. They argue, however, that this language was <em>only </em>meant to reach transactions at HCA-NH\u2019s level, and not meant to reach parents or other upstream entities of HCA-NH, such as when, in the 1999 transaction, HCA-NH\u2019s <em>parent (i.e., </em>Hospital Corp., LLC) was transferred by HCA3 to HCAS\u2019s parent (ie., Healthtrust).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">We agree with the parties that the phrase \u201cindirectly by merger or transfer of stock or otherwise\u201d demonstrates the contracting parties\u2019 intent to reach transactions in addition to a direct conveyance of the hospital\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The trial court correctly ruled that, generally, a right of first refusal restricting the transfer of a company\u2019s assets is not triggered by transactions such as the company\u2019s parent undergoing a merger, or all of the parent\u2019s stock being transferred to another entity. \u201cA corporate parent which owns the shares of a subsidiary does not, for that reason alone, own or have legal title to the assets of the subsidiary; and, it follows with even greater force, the parent does not own or have legal title to the subsidiaries of the subsidiary.\u201d <em>Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, </em>538 U.S. 468, 475 (2003); <em>see also </em>19 C.J.S. <em>Corporations </em>\u00a7 909, at 423 (2007) (\u201cA merger does not affect the status of the assets of a subsidiary of one of the parties to the merger, if the subsidiary\u2019s own corporate existence was not affected.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">However, where the language of the right of first refusal expressly provides that a merger or transfer of stock may constitute an indirect transfer of assets, we adhere to the express terms of the contract language. <em>Cf. Glick, </em>157 N.H. at 247 (focusing upon the \u201cintent of the parties, as manifested in the language of the entire contract\u201d to determine scope of ROFR, rather than broad principles of law (emphasis omitted)); <em>see also H-B-S Partnership, </em>114 P.3d at 315 (\u201cThe general rule will hold true in most cases, but can be trumped by contract language.\u201d). Here, the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>of the ROFR provision provides, in relevant part: \u201cNeither [HCA3] nor HCA-NH will directly or <em>indirectly by merger or transfer of stock or otherwise . . . </em>dispose of all or any substantial part of the assets of the Hospital. . ..\u201d <em>APA </em>\u00a7 5.2.11(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">We find the cases previously cited by the Foundation germane to this issue. For example, in <em>H-B-S Partnership, </em>the court ruled that under the terms of the HBS ROFR provision, the right of first refusal was triggered by the stock sale of a great-grandparent to one of the parties of the HBS ROFR provision. <em>H-B-S Partnership, </em>114 P.3d at 315. As we stated above, we do not find the ROFR provision before us to be as broad as that in <em>H-B-S Partnership </em>such that we would find the ROFR is triggered by a stock sale involving the actions of any entity other than HCA3 or HCA-NH. Where, however, either HCA3 or HCA-NH is the entity making the transfer (as is the case in the 1999 transaction), we find that <em>H-B-S Partnership </em>supports our interpretation of the phrase \u201cindirectly by merger or transfer of stock or otherwise.\u201d The <em>H-B-S Partnership </em>court held that \u201c[i]n light of the broad language of [the HBS ROFR], expressly restricting both <em>indirect and direct </em>transfers of equity interests ... we conclude that the parties bargained for a broader ROFR than parties to whom the general rule has been applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We apply the same principle here. The language of the ROFR restricts transfers occurring both \u201cdirectly or indirectly by merger or transfer of stock or otherwise,\u201d thereby demonstrating the parties\u2019 intent to reach transactions other than a direct conveyance of the hospital\u2019s assets. <em>See also Asian Yard, </em>1995 WL 1781675, at *7; <em>Continental, </em>873 F.2d at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">We find these cases to be persuasive authority that the phrase \u201cindirectly by merger or transfer of stock or otherwise\u201d in the ROFR provision demonstrates an intent to reach transactions beyond an actual conveyance of the hospital\u2019s assets. By including this phrase, HCA3, HCA-NH and the hospital trustees demonstrated their intent that \u201ca [party] could not do indirectly that which it was prohibited from doing directly.\u201d <em>Asian Yard, </em>1995 WL 1781675, at *7.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Accordingly, we hold that under the terms of the ROFR provision, so long as either HCA3 or HCA-NH is the entity acting, a transfer of the hospital\u2019s assets may occur \u201cindirectly\u201d through a merger, transfer of stock, or other similar transaction sufficient to trigger the ROFR.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The remaining question on appeal, therefore, is to whom this phrase applies. The defendants argue that the parties only intended that a \u201cmerger or transfer of stock\u201d of HCA-NH would trigger the ROFR. The Foundation counters that the phrase is not so limited and that such transactions by other members of the HCA corporate family could trigger the ROFR. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>note here that given our above analysis regarding the triggering actors of the ROFR, the Foundation\u2019s argument on this point is necessarily limited only to those actions by HCA3 and HCA-NH. Thus, the issue in dispute on appeal is whether a transfer by HCA3 of its interest in HCA-NH\u2019s parent company may trigger the ROFR.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Both parties argue that we can deem the phrase \u201cindirectly by merger or transfer of stock or otherwise\u201d unambiguous and hold in favor of their respective interpretations. We disagree with both parties. The ROFR provision does not define whose \u201cmerger or transfer of stock or otherwise\u201d triggers the ROFR and we find both parties\u2019 interpretations to be reasonable. Thus, the language is ambiguous. <em>See N.A.P.P. Realty Trust v. CC Enterprises, </em>147 N.H. 137, 139 (2001) (\u201cThe language of a contract is ambiguous if the parties to the contract could reasonably disagree as to the meaning of that language.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Where the \u201cagreement\u2019s language is ambiguous, it must be determined what the parties, under an objective standard, mutually understood the ambiguous language to mean.\u201d <em>Gen. Linen Servs. v. Franconia Inn Assocs., </em>150 N.H. 595, 597 (2004). In applying the objective standard, a court should examine the contract as a whole, the circumstances surrounding execution and the object intended by the agreement, while keeping in mind the goal of giving effect to the intention of the parties. <em>N.A.P.P. Realty Trust, </em>147 N.H. at 141. This \u201cnecessarily involves factual findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given the trial court\u2019s grant of the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on other, mistaken, grounds however, no factual findings were made by the court on this issue. Accordingly, we vacate the order granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and remand to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The parties also dispute whether Healthtrust qualifies as a \u201cwholly-owned subsidiary\u201d pursuant to Section 5.2.11(a) of the APA, thereby possibly exempting the 1999 transaction from the ROFR provision. We will address the issue, which deals with contract interpretation, as it is likely to arise on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The subsidiary exemption provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5.2.11(a) shall not apply to a Transfer by [HCA3] or HCA-NH to a wholly-owned subsidiary of [HCA3] (\u201cTransferee\u201d) if, from and after such Transfer, the Transferee shall perform and assume all obligations of [HCA3] and HCA-NH under this Agreement and prior to such Transfer shall agree to such performance and assumption of obligations in a writing satisfactory to the Seller [Portsmouth Hospital] ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>APA </em>\u00a7 5.2.11(a). Based upon the unambiguous language of this provision, Healthtrust does not qualify as a \u201cwholly-owned subsidiary of [HCA3].\u201d <em>Id. </em>At the time of the 1999 transaction, when HCA3 transferred its membership interest in Hospital Corp. to Healthtrust, Healthtrust was the <em>parent </em>of HCA3, not a wholly-owned subsidiary. Accordingly, the ROFR exemption for wholly-owned subsidiaries does not apply to the 1999 transaction because it was not \u201ca Transfer by [HCA3] or HCA-NH to a wholly-owned subsidiary of [HCA3].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Therefore, taking as true all the facts well pleaded in the Foundation\u2019s amended petition and construing all reasonable inferences in its favor, we find that the Foundation\u2019s allegations concerning the 1999 transaction are reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit recovery. Accordingly, we vacate the trial court\u2019s grant of the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; vacated in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b542-7\">Dalianis and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
