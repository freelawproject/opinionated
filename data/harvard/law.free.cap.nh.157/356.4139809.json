Bourassa. Beck argues that the trial court erred in failing to find that she was Bourassa\u2019s common law spouse pursuant to RSA 457:39 (2004). Because the probate court reasonably held that Beck and Bourassa failed to acknowledge one another as husband and wife, as is required by RSA 457:39, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\">The probate court found the following: Beck and Bourassa began a romantic relationship at some point during the mid to late 1990s. Soon thereafter, Bourassa moved into Beck\u2019s home, where he continued to reside until his untimely death in August 2006. During those years, the couple shared domestic responsibilities, worked together on Beck\u2019s family farm, and, in 2002, gave birth to a child. However, despite their lengthy cohabitation, the couple never married.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Following Bourassa\u2019s death, his most recent will was submitted for probate. That will, which was duly executed several years after the couple began cohabiting, made no provision for Beck. Instead, it provided that the entirety of Bourassa\u2019s estate was to be divided equally among his four daughters from a previous marriage. Believing that she was nevertheless entitled to a spousal share of Bourassa\u2019s estate, <em>see </em>RSA 561:1 (2007), Beck filed a petition in the probate court requesting to be declared Bourassa\u2019s common law spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u201cNew Hampshire is a jurisdiction which does not recognize the validity of common-law marriages except to the limited extent provided by RSA 457:39.\u201d <em>Joan S. v. John S., 121 </em>N.H. 96, 98 (1981) (quotation omitted); <em>see In re Buttrick, </em>134 N.H. 675, 677 (1991). Pursuant to that statute, which has been in substantially the same form since 1842, \u201c[p]ersons cohabiting and acknowledging each other as husband and wife, and generally reputed to be such, for the period of 3 years, and until the decease of one of them, shall thereafter be deemed to have been legally married.\u201d RSA 457:39. Accordingly, to be entitled to a spousal share, Beck was required to demonstrate that, for the period of three years preceding his death, she and Bourassa: (1) cohabited; (2) acknowledged each other as husband and wife; and (3) were generally reputed to be husband and wife in their community. <em>See Delisle v. Smalley, </em>96 N.H. 58, 59 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Following two days of hearings, the probate court issued its final order and ruled that Beck had presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that she and Bourassa had cohabited for the three years preceding his death. However, the court determined that Beck had failed to sustain her burden of establishing that she and Bourassa acknowledged one another as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>husband and wife, and were generally reputed as such in the community. Accordingly, the probate court refused to rule that Beck was entitled to a spousal share of Bourassa\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Beck appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in finding both that she and Bourassa did not acknowledge each other as husband and wife, and that she and Bourassa were not generally reputed to be husband and wife in their community. In addressing Beck\u2019s claim, we must accept \u201c[t]he findings of fact of the judge of probate a[s] final unless they are so plainly erroneous that such findings could not be reasonably made.\u201d RSA 567-A:4 (2007). \u201cHence we must review the record of the proceedings before the probate court to determine if the findings, as made by the probate judge, could be reasonably made, given the testimony\u201d presented at trial. <em>In re Buttrick, </em>134 N.H. at 676. When engaging in this inquiry, we are guided by the rule that \u201c[t]he trier of fact is in the best position to measure the persuasiveness and credibility of evidence and is not compelled to believe even uncontroverted evidence.\u201d <em>Restaurant Operators, Inc. v. Jenney, </em>128 N.H. 708, 711 (1986); <em>see also Cook v. Sullivan, </em>149 N.H. 774, 780 (2003) (explaining that the trial court is in the best position to \u201cresolv[e] conflicts in the testimony, measur[e] the credibility of witnesses, and determin[e] the weight to be given evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">After reviewing the record, we hold that the probate court\u2019s finding that Beck and Bourassa did not acknowledge each other as husband and wife is reasonable, based upon the evidence presented at trial. As we have previously explained, \u201c[acknowledgement of another as one\u2019s spouse [under RSA 457:39] involves declaration or avowal of the relationship.\u201d <em>Delisle, </em>96 N.H. at 59; <em>see also </em>Webster's Third New International Dictionary 151 (unabridged ed. 2002) (defining \u201cavowal\u201d as \u201can open declaration or frank acknowledgement\u201d). In other words, \u201c[t]he conduct of cohabitation assumes at death the aspect of legality or illegality, according [to whether] the declarations of the parties which accompanied that conduct have avowed or disavowed the existence of a <em>legal relationship.\u201d Delisle, </em>96 N.H. at 59-60 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Here, as the probate court noted, the majority of witnesses testified that Bourassa did not acknowledge Beck as his wife. For example, one of Bourassa\u2019s former employers, Michael Iafolla, testified that he saw Bourassa with the couple\u2019s child, asked him if he had gotten married, and Bourassa responded firmly, \u201chell, no.\u201d Bourassa\u2019s brother, Gary Bourassa, testified that Bourassa never held Beck out as his wife and, in fact, had made a point to tell him that \u201cthey were not married.\u201d Bourassa\u2019s sister, Gail Jablonski, believed that Beck was just \u201cthe woman [her] brother lived with\u201d and testified that her brother would \u201calways say anybody was crazy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>that got married.\u201d Finally, five of Bourassa\u2019s former employees, as well as one of his former business associates, similarly testified that he never held Beck out as his spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The record also supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Beck did not acknowledge Bourassa as her husband. Indeed, two of Bourassa\u2019s daughters, Dayna and Devin Bourassa, testified that Beck had sternly told them that she was not, and never would be \u201canybody\u2019s common law.\u201d Moreover, the executor of Bourassa\u2019s estate, Richard Sullivan, testified that he spoke with Beck regarding her petition to obtain a spousal share, at which time she stated that \u201cshe was never David\u2019s wife and she would never be anybody\u2019s wife.\u201d According to Sullivan, Beck went on to explain that she associated the word \u201cwife\u201d with \u201cservant\u201d and refused to \u201cbe anybody\u2019s servant. . . [or] anybody\u2019s wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Despite the couple\u2019s express disavowal of their relationship as husband and wife, Beck argues that we must reverse because the probate court \u201cerred by ignoring an entire category of evidence: the actions of [Bourassa] and [Beck], which [she contends] consistently acknowledged [her] as his wife, and he as her husband.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Although, in rare cases, the conduct of the parties could conceivably rise to the level of an avowal of \u201cthe existence of a legal relationship,\u201d <em>Delisle, </em>96 N.H. at 60, this is not such a case. To be sure, many of Beck\u2019s witnesses testified that the couple shared domestic and child care responsibilities. However, as the probate court stated in its order, Beck also \u201cidentified herself on her will ... as a single person,\u201d maintained separate bank accounts from Bourassa, and described Bourassa as her \u201csignificant other\u201d in answering interrogatories propounded in unrelated litigation. Moreover, when a newspaper article written about her family farm referenced Bourassa as her spouse, Beck testified that she \u201cspoke to [the author]... [and] told her that [Bourassa] and [she] weren\u2019t legally married.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Beyond that acknowledged in the probate court\u2019s order, the record also reveals that Beck and Bourassa held their real estate separately, titled their vehicles separately, and had separate health insurance. Further, three months prior to his death, Bourassa completed an intake form while visiting a chiropractor and, although he responded to every other question, left the box for spouse blank. In light of all of the foregoing conduct, we cannot hold that the probate court\u2019s finding that the couple did not acknowledge one another as husband and wife is \u201cso plainly erroneous ... [that it] could not be reasonably made.\u201d RSA 567-A:4; <em>see also Restaurant Operators, Inc., </em>128 N.H. at 711 (explaining that it is within the purview of the trial court to weigh the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Beck also argues that the trial court erred \u201cby relying upon <em>[Tapley v. Tapley, </em>122 N.H. 727, 730 (1982),] to deny . . . her [a] spous[al] share of [Bourassa]\u2019s [e]state.\u201d Specifically, Beck contends that <em>Tapley </em>did not arise under RSA 457:39 and, thus, the probate judge \u201cimproperly and incorrectly equated the lifetime dissolution of the Tapley\u2019s \u2018unstructured domestic relationship,\u2019 with the termination of [Bourassa]\u2019s and [Beck]\u2019s loving relationship by [Bourassa]\u2019s untimely death.\u201d Beck overstates the trial court\u2019s dependence upon <em>Tapley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">As noted by the Estate, the court\u2019s \u201creliance\u201d upon <em>Tapley </em>is limited to a single citation in the conclusion section of its order. Preceding that section are several pages of factual findings that independently support the probate court\u2019s ultimate determination that Beck failed to meet her burden. Even more to the point, the probate court cited <em>Tapley </em>with the signal <em>\u201ccf.\u201d </em>Meaning literally \u201ccompare\u201d or \u201csee, by way of comparison,\u201d THE CHICAGO MANUAL OF Style \u00a7 16.58, at 607 (Univ. of Chi. Press, 15th ed. 2003), the <em>\u201ccf.\u201d </em>signal is used to show that a \u201c[c]ited authority supports a proposition <em>different </em>from the main proposition but sufficiently <em>analogous </em>to lend support,\u201d The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation \u00a7 1.2 (Columbia Law Review Ass\u2019n <em>et al. </em>eds., 17th ed. 2000) (emphases added). For these reasons, even assuming without deciding that it was error for the court to cite <em>Tapley </em>in this context, contrary to Beck\u2019s suggestion, it is apparent that that citation did not affect the court\u2019s analysis. <em>See McIntire v. Lee, </em>149 N.H. 160, 167 (2003) (explaining that \u201c[a]n error is considered harmless if it is trivial, or formal, or merely academic, and was not prejudicial to the substantial rights of the party asserting it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Having determined that the probate court correctly ruled that Beck and Bourassa did not acknowledge each other as husband and wife, we need not address the court\u2019s further finding regarding the couple\u2019s reputation in the community. <em>See Delisle, </em>96 N.H. at 59. Because the majority of Beck\u2019s remaining arguments are either concerned with that finding, or amount to little more than a request that we reweigh the evidence, <em>see Restaurant Operators, Inc., </em>128 N.H. at 711, we decline to address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\"> Beck\u2019s counsel has made one further charge, however, the severity of which compels discussion. In his brief and at oral argument, counsel accused the probate judge of inattentiveness, bias and confusion. We have thoroughly reviewed the record and have found no evidence to support this assertion. Instead, the record reveals a judge who was attentive and engaged in the trial proceedings; on numerous occasions posed questions to the witnesses; and, at least twice, was required to remind the petitioner\u2019s counsel of the questions he had previously asked. That the probate judge was acutely aware of both the facts and law is further evidenced by her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>comprehensive, well reasoned order. While it is inherent in our appellate function to review and evaluate such claims against trial judges, when, as here, the claims are utterly baseless, they are inconsistent with the professionalism we expect from practitioners before this court. <em>See </em>NEW Hampshire Bar Association, The New Hampshire Lawyer Professionalism CREED (April 4, 2001), <em>available at </em>http://www.nhbar.org/ legallinks/nh-professionalism-creed.asp (explaining that a New Hampshire lawyer \u201cdisplays respect for clients, judges, court staff, opposing counsel and all participants in the process\u201d and \u201cunderstands differing viewpoints\u201d). Practitioners would be wise to raise such accusations in the future only when they are warranted, and not merely where they result from dissatisfaction with the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b401-6\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Galway and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
