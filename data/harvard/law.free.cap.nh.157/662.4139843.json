We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The parties divorced in 2006. Their final divorce decree incorporated the terms of their permanent stipulation, which included a parenting plan regarding their then two-year-old son. <em>See </em>RSA 461-A:4 (Supp. 2007). With respect to decision-making responsibility, paragraph A of the parenting plan stated that \u201c[b]oth parents shall share in the responsibility for making major decisions about the child,\u201d \u201c[e]ach parent shall make day-to-day decisions for the child during the time he/she is caring for the child,\u201d and \u201c[b]oth parties shall be consulted and agree on [the child\u2019s] religion.\u201d Regarding residential responsibility, paragraph B of the parenting plan provided that the respondent \u201cshall have liberal and generous parenting time with his son . . . whenever [the respondent] is not flying [as a commercial airline pilot] and is in New Hampshire.\u201d This provision also stated: \u201cThe parties acknowledge and agree that each of them [is] a kind, caring, loving and nurturing parent and that their son . . . will benefit by having active involvement by both parents, with the goal of each party\u2019s parenting time being approximately equal.\u201d Paragraph C, the provision concerning the child\u2019s legal residence for school attendance stated: \u201cThis <em>Parenting Plan </em>is for equal or approximately equal periods of residential responsibility. For school purposes only, the child\u2019s legal residence shall be with <em>[the petitioner].\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The certificate of divorce entered by the court stated that the parties had joint legal custody of their son, but that the mother had physical custody of him. Thereafter, the respondent moved to modify the certificate of divorce to reflect the fact that the parties had joint physical custody of their son. In denying the motion, the trial court interpreted the parties\u2019 parenting plan to grant the petitioner primary residential responsibility for the child. The trial court stated that it could not \u201cconstrue the language of the Parenting Plan as equal, \u201850/50\u2019 or shared residential responsibility. If that were the case, the parties should have used the terminology in paragraph B of the Parenting Plan for \u2018shared (or joint) residential responsibility,\u2019 but they did not do so.\u201d The court noted that \u201cthe Parenting Plan forms supplied by the Court and available to the public on the internet\u201d use this specific language. \u201cIf counsel wish to create their own format,\u201d the court cautioned, \u201cthey should be sure to follow the requirements for delineating the parenting rights and responsibilities.\u201d The court concluded that because paragraph B of the parties\u2019 parenting plan did not state that they had \u201cshared (or joint) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>residential responsibility,\u201d the certificate of divorce \u201ccorrectly complie[d] with the [court\u2019s] understanding of the Parenting Plan as written,\u201d and would not be revised.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">On appeal, the respondent argues that the trial court misinterpreted the parties\u2019 parenting plan and, therefore, erred when it denied his request to amend the certificate of divorce to reflect the fact that the parties shared physical custody of their son. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">In interpreting the meaning of a divorce decree, we review the decree <em>de novo. Sommers v. Sommers, </em>143 N.H. 686, 692 (1999). We consider the intent of the parties as expressed in the language of the stipulation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Under the plain meaning of their stipulation, the parties were to have \u201cequal or approximately equal\u201d residential responsibility for their son. In paragraph C, the plan states: \u201cThis <em>Parenting Plan </em>is for equal or approximately equal periods of residential responsibility.\u201d Additionally, paragraph B provided: \u201cThe parties acknowledge and agree that each of them [is] a kind, caring, loving and nurturing parent and that their son ... will benefit by having active involvement by both parents, with the goal of each party\u2019s parenting time being approximately equal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">As a matter of law, however, \u201capproximately equal\u201d residential responsibility is insufficient to confer \u201ccustodial parent\u201d status. The term \u201ccustodial parent\u201d is defined by statute. <em>See </em>RSA 461-A:20 (Supp. 2007). Pursuant to RSA 461-A:20, a \u201ccustodial parent\u201d is \u201ca parent with 50 percent or more of the residential responsibility\u201d and a \u201cnon-eustodial parent\u201d is \u201ca parent with less than 50 percent of the residential responsibility.\u201d A parent with 49 percent of the residential responsibility is \u201cnon-custodial\u201d by definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">Given the parties\u2019 choice to use the phrase \u201cequal or approximately equal\u201d to describe their residential responsibility for their son as well as their description of the respondent\u2019s frequent absences from the state for his job as a commercial airline pilot, we conclude that the trial court did not err when it declined to reform the parties\u2019 certificate of divorce and, in effect, confer \u201ccustodial parent\u201d status upon the respondent. Unless the parties had agreed that the parties would each have fifty percent of the residential responsibility for their son, pursuant to RSA 461-A:20, only one of them could be the \u201ccustodial parent.\u201d As drafted by the parties, their stipulation confers this status upon the petitioner. Accordingly, contrary to the respondent\u2019s assertions, the certificate of divorce comports with the parties\u2019 stipulation and the applicable law. Should the legislature disagree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>with our construction of RSA 461-A:20, it is, of course, free to amend it. <em>See Appeal of Malouin, </em>155 N.H. 545, 554 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b705-4\">Broderick, C.J., and Duggan, Galway and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
