The respondent, Pease Development Authority, Division of Ports and Harbors (division), cross-appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">The following facts, which were either found by the DOL hearing officer or are supported by the record and consistent with DOL\u2019s findings and rulings, are recited here for background purposes. The Pease Development Authority (authority) is a public instrumentality and \u201cbody politic and corporate of the state,\u201d RSA 12-G:3,1 (2003), created in 2001 by RSA 12-G:3 (2003) to carry out the provisions of RSA chapter 12-G (2003 &amp; Supp. 2007). RSA 12-G:43, I (Supp. 2007) established within the authority the division which, among other things, succeeded to the \u201cformer functions, duties, and responsibilities of the [New Hampshire] port authority,\u201d RSA 12-G:42 (Supp. 2007), which had been established pursuant to Laws 1957,262:1, <em>see </em>RSA 12-G:2, XIX (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>The respondents are all members of the International Longshoreman\u2019s Union, Local 1947 (ILA). Petitioner Roach, III, is also employed part-time by the division as a harbormaster. ILA has been the historic labor force for line handling at the Market Street Marine Terminal/Port of Portsmouth. Petitioner Roach, III, testified that for forty years prior to July 2006, ILA provided line handling for every ship docking at the port.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Prior to the creation of the division, its predecessor, the New Hampshire Port Authority, contracted with a stevedore company to act as terminal operator and provide stevedoring services, including line handling, at the Market Street Marine Terminal. John T. Clark Company (John T. Clark) held the contract prior to August 1998, and Bulk Loader, LLC (Bulk Loader) held the contract from that point until the contract\u2019s expiration in August 2000. Bulk Loader\u2019s contract was the last given by the State for exclusive rights to perform stevedoring services at the Market Street Marine Terminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">ILA line handlers were employed by John T. Clark and Bulk Loader during the respective times those companies held the contract to operate the terminal. The stevedore companies gave the line handlers their work orders and issued their paychecks.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">According to testimony of Geno Marconi, director of the division, after the expiration of Bulk Loader\u2019s contract with the State, Bulk Loader continued to employ line handlers until its insurance coverage was about to terminate. At that point, a representative of Bulk Loader \u201cinformed [the division] that they were not going to renew their insurance policies, and therefore, were not going to cover line handling anymore.\u201d Testimony before the hearing officer indicates that during roughly the same time period, ILA solicited William Kennedy to start a company to act as a pay agent so that ILA members could continue to work as the line-handling labor force at the Market Street Marine Terminal. Kennedy founded Portsmouth Shipping and Cargo Handling to provide line-handling labor at the Market Street Marine Terminal. At some point, Portsmouth Shipping and Cargo Handling ceased its role as pay agent and a company called Port City Stevedore and Line Handling, LLC (Port City) took over that function. It paid the ILA workers their wages, withheld taxes and issued W2 statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">On June 15, 2006, petitioners Roach, III, and Geekie participated in an investigation by the attorney general, giving, as alleged in their whistleblowers\u2019 complaint, \u201csworn, recorded testimony that [the Governor\u2019s nominee for director of the division, Geno] Marconi, was incompetent, not qualified to serve as Port Director, and had repeatedly violated [RSA chapter 354-A, the Law Against Discrimination].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>On July 14, 2006, a ship owned by Grimmel Industries, LLC arrived at the port and ILA line handlers did not perform the tie-up. Petitioner Roach, III, testified that he was told \u201cwe weren\u2019t coming in\u201d and that \u201c[t]here was another company that had taken over line handling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\">In September 2006, the petitioners filed a whistleblowers\u2019 complaint with DOL, alleging that they were employees of the division, and that they had \u201csuffered the loss of wages [in specified amounts] as punishment for the good faith participation of [petitioners] Geekie and Roach[, III] in the investigation and inquiry regarding\u201d Marconi. The petitioners alleged that the division \u201callowed Nominee Marconi to induce Grimmel Industries LLC to breach\u201d a contract that \u201crequires the employment of [petitioner] ILA linehandlers whenever Grimmel\u2019s vessels dock at the [division\u2019s] Market Street Marine Terminal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">On March 5, 2007, DOL held a hearing to determine whether: (1) the petitioners are employees of the division; (2) the petitioners have standing, where it appeared that only two of them actually reported or participated in the governmental inquiry, but the alleged retaliation affected all of them; and (3) the whistleblower claims are preempted by the National Labor Relations Act and/or the Labor Management Relations Act, and the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The DOL hearing officer found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">The [petitioners] were not employees of [the division]. They were, instead, employees of Port City Stevedore <em>&amp; </em>Line Handling, LLC and its predecessors, at all times. The [petitioners] described this use of a \u201cbuffer\u201d or \u201cpay agent\u201d as a \u201cpaper wall\u201d between the union and [the division]. Regardless of the thickness, there was a \u201cwall\u201d between the union and [the division].... At no time did [the division] \u201cemploy[ ] any person\u201d for line handling and they, therefore, are not found to be the employer of the [petitioners].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The hearing officer further found that the petitioners \u201cwho did not actually make a complaint\u201d lacked standing under the Act. Finally, the hearing officer found \u201cno clear proof of any Federal preemption at this point in the proceedings.\u201d The hearing officer dismissed the petitioners\u2019 complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">On appeal, our standard of review is governed by RSA 541:13 (2007). <em>See Appeal of Northeast Rehab. Hosp., </em>149 N.H. 83, 84 (2003); RSA275-E:4, II (1999) (DOL decisions in whistleblower cases \u201cmay be appealed pursuant to RSA 541\u201d). \u201cAccordingly, we will reverse the agency only if it made an error of law or if we are satisfied, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, that the agency\u2019s order was unjust or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Northeast Rehab., </em>149 N.H. at 84-85 (quotation omitted). \u201cThe agency\u2019s factual findings ... are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>presumed to be <em>prima </em>facie lawful and reasonable and this presumption may be overcome only by a showing that there was no evidence from which the agency could conclude as it did.\u201d <em>Appeal of Leonard, </em>147 N.H. 590, 594 (2002) (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">RSA 275-E:1, I (Supp. 2007) provides, in relevant part, that the term \u201c \u2018Employee\u2019 means and includes every person who may be permitted, required, or directed by any employer, in consideration of direct or indirect gain or profit, to engage in any employment.\u201d The term \u201cEmployer\u201d is defined by RSA 275-E:1, II (1999) to \u201cmean[ ] an individual, partnership, association, corporation, legal representative, trustee, receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, governmental entity, and any common carrier who employs any person. Employer shall include any person acting in the interest of an employer directly or indirectly.\u201d In <em>Appeal of Northeast Rehabilitation Hospital, </em>we noted that \u201cRSA 275-E:2, 1(a) clearly protects only an \u2018employee\u2019 from prohibited actions of an employer.\u201d <em>Northeast Rehab., </em>149 N.H. at 85. We therefore concluded that \u201cthe plain meaning of the term \u2018employee\u2019 as used in the Act encompasses only persons currently employed by the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The petitioners argue that DOL erred in determining that the division was not their employer as defined by RSA 275-E:l, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">as Terminal Operator it retained control over all labor required to dock and release ships, [2] because it permitted the [petitioners] and other ILA members to perform line-handling labor prior to July 14, 2006, and [3] because it \u2018indirectly\u2019 employed the [petitioners] by instructing port customers to pay wages as a separate fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">The petitioners assert that in 2001, the division began acting as the terminal operator at the Market Street Marine Terminal, \u201can economic activity that has always required the labor of line-handlers like the [petitioners].\u201d The petitioners further argue that \u201c[the division] admitted that it intentionally performed and conducted its Terminal Operator business -without employees to perform essential labor: in the words of... Port Director [Marconi]: \u2018The State of New Hampshire is the terminal operator but we sub everything out.\u2019 \u201d They contend that they \u201ccontinued to perform the necessary labor to dock and release ships at the employer\u2019s place of business, under the [the division\u2019s] observation and ultimate control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Even taking these assertions as true, they merely place the division in the position of a general contractor on a jobsite. We agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Washington Court of Appeals that \u201c[cjontrol over the jobsite does not, however, confer control over the employment of a subcontractor\u2019s workers. Appellants do not explain how an owner/contractor is to carry out a duty to refrain from retaliatory discharge of workers employed by subcontractors.\u201d <em>Awana v. Port of Seattle, </em>89 P.3d 291, 293 (Wash. Ct. App. 2004), <em>review denied, </em>108 P.3d 1228 (Wash. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\">The petitioners also appear to contend that the division exercised control over the performance of their work and the authority to fire line handlers. They note that petitioners \u201cRoach III and Geekie testified that Port Director Marconi, or his assistants, directed and controlled how the line-handlers performed their labor, and on at least one occasion Port Director Marconi exercised that power to fire one particular line-handler.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">This evidence, however, was not uncontroverted. Marconi denied that the division directs and controls performance of the line handlers\u2019 work. Rather, he testified that while either he or the division\u2019s operations manager, A1 Cummings, is often at the dock when a ship is berthing, it is in the role of property manager, \u201cmak[ing] sure that there are no activities that are conducted down there that are detrimental to the property.\u201d He further testified that \u201c[w]hen a ship is approaching the dock someone from the Port, either myself or A1 Cummings, would have a handheld radio with which we establish contact with the pilot who is guiding the vessel in.\u201d He explained: \u201c[W]e are the communications network between the pilot and the line handlers on the dock\u201d and that he or Cummings would use the radio to \u201crelay[ ] the instructions of the pilot down to the line handlers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The hearing officer found that \u201c[t]he direction asserted by the [petitioners] from [the division] was merely to pass through instructions from ships\u2019 pilots.\u201d The question whether a putative employer exercises direction and control over a putative employee is one of fact. <em>See McCarthy v. Souther, </em>83 N.H. 29, 37-38 (1927), <em>overruled on other grounds by Dane v. MacGregor, </em>94 N.H. 294 (1947) <em>and Hunter v. R.G. Watkins &amp; Son, Inc., </em>110 N.H. 243 (1970). DOL\u2019s finding on this issue is \u201cpresumed to be <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable,\u201d <em>Appeal of Leonard, </em>147 N.H. at 594, and the petitioners have not shown that \u201cthere was no evidence from which [DOL] could conclude as it did,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Similarly, Marconi denied having ever fired a line handler. \u201cAs a fact-finder, the hearing officer was at liberty to accept or reject the testimony before him as he saw fit and his conclusions are entitled to great weight.\u201d <em>Appeal of Regenesis Corp., </em>156 N.H. 445, 451 (2007). Thus, the hearing officer was free to credit Marconi\u2019s denial and reject contrary testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>The petitioners argue that they meet the definition of employees of the division because the division \u201c \u2018permitted\u2019 [them] to earn their wages at the Port of Portsmouth by issuing identity badges to each of the eight [petitioners]\u201d that allowed them to \u201center the port security gate to tie up and let go\u201d ships docking at the port. They contend that the \u201cundisputed evidence demonstrates that the [division], through its Port Director, exercised the power to \u2018permit\u2019 or exclude individual line-handlers from entering the Port of Portsmouth to earn their wages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The testimony before DOL indicated that for security reasons, only authorized persons were permitted to enter the Market Street Marine Terminal beyond the guard shack. Marconi testified that persons would be authorized to enter \u201c[i]f they have business to conduct at the Port Terminal, and that business is approved.\u201d Marconi indicated that while a driver\u2019s license was usually sufficient identification for someone having business with a tenant at the terminal, such as a scrap company or salt company, security \u201cprocedures are ramped up a little bit more\u201d when a ship is in. Accordingly, Marconi testified, the division would \u201cgenerally ask the steamship agent to provide us with a list of who may be making deliveries\u201d to the ship. Marconi stated that the division itself issued identification badges, such as those issued to the petitioners, \u201c[t]o facilitate employees of companies that did regular business at the Port Terminal ease of access in and out of the gate.\u201d We note that the division introduced applications for the identification badges from four of the petitioners (Geekie, Roach, III, Roach, IV and Hughes), signed by each of them respectively and listing Port City as their employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">We do not read the term \u201cpermitted\u201d in RSA 275-E:l, I, so broadly as to encompass the mere security clearance at issue here. The United States Supreme Court, interpreting similar language in the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 <em>et seq. </em>(2000), noted that \u201c[t]he definition \u2018suffer or permit to work\u2019 was obviously not intended to stamp all persons as employees who, without any express or implied compensation agreement, might work for their own advantage on the premises of another.\u201d <em>Walling v. Portland Terminal Co., </em>330 U.S. 148, 152 (1947). In <em>Legg v. Johnson, Simmerman &amp; Broughton, </em>576 S.E.2d 532 (W. Va. 2002), the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia reasoned that the language \u201cany person suffered or permitted to work by a person, firm or corporation,\u201d <em>Legg, </em>576 S.E.2d at 537 (quotation omitted), should not \u201cbe taken so literally as to reach an absurd result,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 538.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">For instance, the Court does not believe that the Legislature intended that one who rents an office from a landlord, and who becomes involved in a monetary dispute with the landlord, should be considered an \u201cemployee\u201d of the landlord under the Wage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Payment and Collection Act simply because the landlord suffers or permits the individual to work out of the rented office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><em>Legg, </em>576 S.E.2d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"> This court also \u201cwill not interpret statutory language in a literal manner when such a reading would lead to an absurd result.\u201d <em>Cayten v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Servs., </em>155 N.H. 647, 653 (2007). We do not believe that the legislature intended that the issuance of identification badges, in order to expedite security clearance, to persons doing regular business at the port terminal, would render such persons, be they line handlers or persons delivering fuel or provisions to the ships, employees of the division for purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The petitioners next assert that their \u201cnominal employer after 2001 was merely a pay agent,\u201d and that \u201c[tjhrough the use of \u2018pay agents\u2019, the [division] conducted the business of a Terminal Operator, thereby \u2018indirectly\u2019 acting \u2018in the interest of an employer\u2019 within the scope of\u2019 RSA 275-E:l. The division argues that \u201cas a matter of law, [it] is not a \u2018person\u2019 acting in the interest of Port City, the [petitioners\u2019] employer, nor is there any evidence of any relationship \u2014 contractual or otherwise \u2014 between Port City and the [division].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">DOL\u2019s factual findings support the division\u2019s position. The hearing officer found that the petitioners \u201cwere directed by ships\u2019 agents, not [the division]. The ships\u2019 agents were the ones who contracted with the union to perform line handling tasks, not [the division].\u201d The record supports this finding. Marconi testified that \u201call the arrangements in a port are handled by the agent for the ship.\u201d Thus, \u201c[t]he steamship agent calls various entities, the pilots, arranges piloting for the ship into the harbor; contacts U.S. Customs\u201d and also contacts the division \u201con the availability of the berth.\u201d In addition, the steamship agent secures line handling and stevedore services for the ship. Marconi testified that there are no contractual arrangements between line handling companies and the division and that shipping agents are free to hire any company that is able to provide \u201cevidence of insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">This evidence was largely confirmed by the testimony of petitioner Roach, III, who stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">Ship\u2019s agent works on behalf of the ship, the ship owner. And when the ship comes in, they see to it that any needs of the vessel are met: if they need fuel. If they need water; ship\u2019s stores.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">And it also encompasses the line handling services. That is paid for by the ship owner, and he also handles the transactions with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the terminal operator and stevedore for paying the wages and the State charges, as well, the dockage and wharfage, and so forth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-3\">The petitioners make much of evidence that Marconi, in the petitioners\u2019 words, \u201cinstructed the [the division\u2019s] potential customers to deal with\u201d ILA. Marconi testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\">We have, in the past, and even in the present, we have told people that have come to our terminal, that there is a historic labor force that has been working in the area. These are their names and phone numbers. You need to contact them and see if you could work something out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Such evidence, however, did not compel the hearing officer to conclude that the division was acting in the interest of the petitioners\u2019 employer, Port City.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The petitioners next argue that DOL erred in failing to apply the \u201ccommon law of agency to find and rule that the division, as the principal of the [petitioners\u2019] pay agent, had the equivalent of a direct employment contract with the [petitioners].\u201d The division counters that because the term \u201cemployer\u201d is defined in the Act, \u201cthe statutory definition must be applied rather than the \u2018common law.\u2019 \u201d We agree with the division. \u201cGenerally, courts interpret words and phrases that are defined in the common law according to their common-law meanings, <em>unless </em>defined by the statute in which they appear.\u201d <em>In re Diana P., </em>120 N.H. 791, 794 (1980) (emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 964 (1981), <em>overruled on other grounds by In re Craig T, </em>147 N.H. 739 (2002). We will not substitute the common law of agency for the statutory definition of \u201cemployee\u201d to extend the reach of the Act. <em>Cf. State v. Elementis Chem., </em>152 N.H. 794, 803 (2005) (declining to apply common law definition where, \u201c[b]y defining \u2018abandoned material,\u2019 the administrative rule abrogates the common law definition of \u2018abandoned\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that DOL did not err in finding that the division did not employ any of the petitioners for purposes of these whistleblower claims. We note that the hearing officer found that petitioner \u201cRoach III agreed, at the hearing, that his Whistleblower\u2019s Complaint was not related to his part time employment with [the division] as a harbormaster.\u201d As the petitioners\u2019 failure to prove their employee status disposes of their whistleblower claims, we need not address their challenge to the DOL\u2019s ruling on the standing issue. In addition, because the division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>concedes that its cross-appeal becomes moot if we affirm on the employment issue, we need not reach its cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b244-6\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
