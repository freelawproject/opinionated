We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-21\">The record supports the following facts. The parties married in 1983, when the petitioner was fifty-five and the respondent was thirty-six. At that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>time, the parties were municipal employees living in Manchester. The petitioner retired in 1991. In the spring of 2003, the respondent voluntarily left her last position because she was planning to separate from her husband and move to Florida to be near her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-3\">On August 31, 2003, the petitioner suffered a stroke, which resulted in some loss of speech and memory. In December 2003, the petitioner named the respondent as co-trustee and co-beneficiary of his trust and executed separate durable powers of attorney for healthcare, property and financial matters, which named the respondent as his agent. In preparation for this estate planning, the petitioner was examined by Dr. Phat Nguyen, who opined that he was \u201ccompetent to make his own decisions in all regards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Following the petitioner\u2019s stroke, the respondent disbursed significant cash assets. For instance, she gave her daughter the entire amount of a $136,000 settlement check that had been made payable to the petitioner and the respondent. She also gave her daughter $38,924 between October 2002 and October 2003, paying most of this sum after the petitioner had his stroke. Also, shortly after the petitioner suffered his stroke, he discovered that $75,000 that had been in a joint account had been depleted to approximately $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">In early October 2004, the petitioner left the respondent to live with his brother and sister-in-law, Edward and Carol Salesky (the Saleskys). Precipitating this separation was an altercation during which the respondent yelled at the petitioner: \u201cJohn, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do with you, I think I\u2019m going to have to put you in a nursing home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">On October 18, 2004, the petitioner filed an <em>ex parte </em>petition seeking a divorce on the ground that irreconcilable differences had caused the irremediable breakdown of the parties\u2019 marriage. The respondent objected, seeking to dismiss the petition on the ground that the petitioner was not mentally competent to bring it.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">In April 2005, the petitioner was referred for a full psychiatric evaluation based upon his counsel\u2019s concern that he was not mentally competent to proceed with the divorce. According to the report of the evaluation, the petitioner demonstrated deficits in a number of areas of neuropsychological functioning, including his ability to understand and recall information he had heard or read, and his ability to remember. The psychiatrist recommended, among other things, that the petitioner \u201creceive assistance when making major decisions regarding his living situation, medical, and legal or fiscal issues in order to protect his interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">The Saleskys filed a petition for guardianship, which the probate court granted on August 11, 2005. The probate court appointed them as co-guardians over the petitioner\u2019s person and estate. The court rejected the respondent\u2019s implied request to be appointed guardian, finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>parties\u2019 \u201cmarital status [was] in the thro[e]s of dissolution\u201d and that appointing the respondent as guardian presented \u201ca clear conflict of interest.\u201d On October 12, 2005, the superior court denied the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the petitioner\u2019s divorce petition on the ground that it was moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In November 2005, the probate court denied the petitioner\u2019s motion to remove the co-guardians, but agreed to appoint a guardian ad litem (GAL) to investigate their relationship with the petitioner. In a report filed on January 2, 2006, the GAL reported that the co-guardians were acting in what they perceived to be the petitioner\u2019s best interests, that the petitioner was comfortable with their care, and that there was nothing \u201cunusual\u201d in the relationship between the petitioner and the co-guardians. Following its receipt of the report, the probate court denied the respondent\u2019s motion for partial reconsideration of its November 2005 order, finding, in part, that her assertion that the co-guardians had exercised undue influence over the petitioner \u201clacks credible foundation.\u201d The probate court denied the respondent\u2019s later motion to reconsider this order and for a hearing on undue influence, which the respondent then appealed to this court. While the respondent\u2019s appeal of the probate court orders was pending, the divorce action was stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">In a November 2006 order, we lifted the stay of the divorce action and affirmed the probate court, holding that it had \u201csustainably exercised its discretion in denying the \u2018motion to reconsider and for hearing on undue influence,\u2019 and in deciding the motion for partial reconsideration on the basis of offers of proof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The parties\u2019 divorce action was heard over three days in June 2007. On the first day of the hearing, the court granted the petitioner\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence that the co-guardians had exercised undue influence over him. Following the hearing, the court granted the petition for divorce, ruling that the co-guardians had the authority to maintain the divorce action on the petitioner\u2019s behalf, and that irreconcilable differences between the parties had caused the irremediable breakdown of their marriage. The respondent moved for reconsideration, which the trial court denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">On appeal, the respondent first argues that the trial court erred when it ruled that the co-guardians had the authority to maintain the divorce action on the petitioner\u2019s behalf. In so ruling, the superior court interpreted the probate court\u2019s order to confer implied authority upon the co-guardians to maintain the divorce action.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">The interpretation of a court order is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. See Edwards v. RAL Auto. Group, </em>156 N.H. 700, 705 (2008). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>In construing a court order, we look to the plain meaning of the words used in the document. <em>Id. </em>We construe subsidiary clauses so as not to conflict with the primary purpose of the trial court\u2019s decree. <em>Id. </em>As a general matter, a court decree or judgment is to be construed with reference to the issues it was meant to decide. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-3\">Here, among the issues the probate court was asked to decide were whether the petitioner had the capacity to exercise the right to marry or divorce and to initiate, defend or settle lawsuits. In its final decree, the probate court specifically found the petitioner incapable of exercising those rights, among others.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Further, in the paragraph that removed those rights from the petitioner, the probate court expressly granted the co-guardians the authority to exercise those rights on his behalf. This paragraph reads: \u201cSo far as necessary for, and complementary of, exercise and fulfillment by the co-guardians over the ward\u2019s person, powers and authorities conferred, and the duties and obligations imposed upon them, the ward is found incapable of exercising the [following] right[s].\u201d This paragraph directly links the rights removed from the petitioner to the \u201cpowers and authorities conferred\u201d and \u201cduties and obligations\u201d imposed upon the co-guardians. Pursuant to this paragraph, the rights removed are those that make it possible for the co-guardians to exercise their duties and obligations\u2014 those that are \u201cnecessary for, and complementary of\u2019 the authority given to the co-guardians. Under this paragraph, therefore, the rights the probate court removed from the petitioner were the very \u201cpowers and authorities conferred, and the duties and obligations imposed\u201d upon the co-guardians. To interpret this paragraph otherwise would mean that both the petitioner <em>and </em>his guardians lacked the ability to exercise the enumerated rights. Such an interpretation would lead to absurd results.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Further, the letter of appointment addressed to the co-guardians specifically granted them \u201cthe authority to exercise all of the rights and powers set forth in RSA 464-A:26,1 and II,\u201d except for certain rights not at issue in this appeal. Among other powers and duties, RSA 464-A:26, I (2004) specifically requires a guardian to \u201cprosecute or defend actions, claims or proceedings in any jurisdiction for the protection of the estate\u2019s assets.\u201d Construing all of these documents together, we hold that they expressly conferred upon the co-guardians the authority to maintain the divorce action on the petitioner\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The respondent contends that notwithstanding the probate court\u2019s order, the co-guardians could not prosecute the divorce action because RSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>chapter 464-A (2004 &amp; Supp. 2007) did not grant them this power. In effect, she asserts that the probate court lacked the authority to confer this power upon the co-guardians.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Addressing this contention requires that we interpret the applicable provisions of RSA chapter 464-A. The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Servs. v. Marino, </em>155 N.H. 709, 713 (2007). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiters of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>We first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">RSA 464-A:25 (2004) sets forth the general powers and duties of a guardian over the person, and RSA 464-A:26 (2004) sets forth the general powers and duties of a guardian over the estate. Both statutes include a catchall provision, which states, in pertinent part: \u201cThe court may limit the powers of the guardian <em>... or impose additional duties </em>if it deems such action desirable for the best interests of the ward.\u201d RSA 464-A:25, II (emphasis added); RSA 464-A-.26, V (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The plain meaning of the catchall provisions is that the powers and duties set forth in RSA 464-A:25 and RSA 464-A:26 are <em>not </em>exclusive, but may be expanded by the probate court when deemed \u201cdesirable for the best interests of the ward.\u201d <em>See In re Lanoue, </em>147 N.H. 748, 750 (2002). These provisions expressly give the probate court the authority to impose \u201cadditional duties.\u201d Contrary to the respondent\u2019s assertion, therefore, the duties that a probate court may impose upon a guardian are not limited to those specifically enumerated in RSA 464-A:25 and RSA 464-A:26. <em>Cf. In re Morris, </em>111 N.H. 287 (1971) (even though applicable statute at time did not expressly empower probate court to authorize guardian to make gifts from ward\u2019s estate to ward\u2019s children to avoid certain taxes, court infers such authority from portion of statute that directed guardian to improve ward\u2019s estate frugally and without waste). The only limitation upon the probate court\u2019s authority to impose additional duties upon a guardian is that the duties be \u201cdesirable for the best interests of the ward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Thus, we disagree with the respondent\u2019s assertion that the probate court may not expressly grant a guardian the authority to maintain a divorce action on a ward\u2019s behalf. Under the catchall provisions, a probate court may expressly grant this authority to a guardian when it deems such action \u201cdesirable for the best interests of the ward.\u201d Given our finding that the probate court in this case expressly gave the co-guardians the power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>prosecute or defend actions, of which the divorce action is one, we need not decide whether a probate court could impliedly confer this authority upon a guardian. We, therefore, do not address the respondent\u2019s assertion that any authority to prosecute a divorce action on a ward\u2019s behalf must be expressly given.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-3\">The respondent relies upon <em>Murray by Murray v. Murray, </em>426 S.E.2d 781, 784 (S.C. 1993), to support her assertion that absent express statutory authority, a guardian may not prosecute an action on a ward\u2019s behalf. <em>Murray </em>involved a divorce between an elderly couple. <em>Murray, </em>426 S.E.2d at 782. The parties\u2019 son had been appointed conservator and guardian of the husband\u2019s estate. <em>Id. </em>No conservator or guardian had been appointed for the husband\u2019s person as the husband had not yet been adjudicated incompetent in this respect. <em>Id. </em>at 784. The son brought the divorce action on the husband\u2019s behalf. <em>Id. </em>at 782. The wife moved to dismiss, arguing that the son lacked the authority to do so. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">The appellate court ruled that the divorce action could be pursued if the husband \u201calthough mentally incompetent with respect to-the management of his estate,\u201d was deemed to be \u201ccapable of exercising reasonable judgment as to his personal decisions\u201d and was found to be \u201cable to understand the nature of the action and ... to express unequivocally the desire to dissolve the marriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 784. On the other hand, if the husband was found to be mentally incompetent both as to his property and his person, then he could not bring a divorce action either on his own behalf or through a guardian. <em>Id. </em>The court reasoned that \u201ca divorce action is so strictly personal and volitional that it cannot be maintained at the pleasure of a guardian, even if the result is to render the marriage indissoluble on behalf of the incompetent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\"><em>Murray </em>is distinguishable from the instant case. The statutory scheme at issue in <em>Murray </em>did not include a catchall provision similar to RSA 464-A:25, II and RSA 464-A:26, V. <em>See </em>S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 62-5-312 (Law. Co-op. 1987). S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 62-5-312, the statute at issue in <em>Murray, </em>allows a court to \u201cmodify\u201d the duties enumerated therein, but, unlike RSA 464-A:25, II and RSA 464-A:26, V, does not allow a court to impose additional duties upon a guardian. Moreover, unlike the instant case, the guardian initiated the divorce petition in <em>Murray, </em>while here the petitioner himself initiated the petition before he was adjudicated incompetent. <em>Murray, </em>426 S.E.2d at 782. Further, while the probate court in this case specifically found the petitioner incapable of exercising his right to divorce and expressly granted this authority to the co-guardians, the court in <em>Murray </em>had not yet even adjudicated whether the ward was incapable of exercising his right to divorce. <em>Id. </em>at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>To the extent that the respondent argues that the legislature could not reasonably have intended to grant probate courts the authority to allow a guardian to maintain a divorce on a ward\u2019s behalf as a matter of public policy, we disagree. While it is a \u201ctruism that a decision to dissolve a marriage is so personal\u201d that, generally speaking, \u201ca guardian should not be empowered to make such a choice for the incompetent,... [u]nless this course of action is available, the competent party is vested with absolute, final control over the marriage. This is not equitable.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Gannon, </em>702 P.2d 465, 467 (Wash. 1985). \u201cSuch a situation not only is inequitable, but also threatens to leave an incompetent spouse without adequate legal recourse against potential physical, emotional or financial abuse by the competent spouse.\u201d <em>Ruvalcaba by Stubblefield v. Ruvalcaba, </em>850 P.2d 674, 681 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1998). For these reasons, as a policy matter, the legislature reasonably could have vested discretion with the probate court to decide whether it was in the ward\u2019s best interests for the guardian to pursue a divorce on the ward\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\">These countervailing policy concerns are particularly evident in the instant case, where the probate court found that the respondent had withdrawn substantial funds from the petitioner\u2019s bank accounts while acting under a power of attorney and where the co-guardians were merely maintaining a divorce action that the petitioner had brought before he was adjudged incompetent. As the court in <em>In re Marriage of Burgess, </em>725 N.E.2d 1266, 1270 (Ill. 2000), explained: \u201cWhile the risk that a guardian may be acting contrary to a ward\u2019s wishes may support the rule that a guardian\u2019s power to initiate a dissolution proceeding must be specified by the legislature, this policy consideration does not justify requiring express statutory authority for a guardian to continue a ward\u2019s dissolution proceeding.\u201d Where a guardian is maintaining a divorce action that was already begun, \u201cthe ward\u2019s desire and intention to end the marriage is clear.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Burgess, </em>725 N.E.2d at 1270. The petitioner here filed his divorce petition in October 2004, ten months before he was adjudicated incompetent. In this case, therefore, \u201cthe added protection afforded by the rule requiring specific statutory authority for a guardian to represent a ward in a dissolution proceeding is not necessary.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The respondent next asserts that the trial court violated her constitutionally protected liberty interest by granting the petitioner\u2019s petition for divorce. The respondent has not cited any authority for this proposition, which we reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The respondent next contends that the trial court erred when it granted the petitioner\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence that the co-guardians had exercised undue influence over him. As the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>whether the co-guardians had exercised undue influence over the petitioner had already been litigated in the probate court, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling was not in error. The probate court\u2019s decision on this issue had collateral estoppel and/or res judicata effect. <em>See Cook v. Sullivan, </em>149 N.H. 774, 777, 778 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The respondent next argues that the evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s finding that the petitioner had the mental capacity to initiate the divorce proceedings. We will affirm the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless the evidence does not support them or they are erroneous as a matter of law. <em>In the Matter of Mannion &amp; Mannion, 155 </em>N.H. 52, 56 (2007). While the evidence was conflicting on this issue, it was for the trial court, as finder of fact, to resolve these conflicts. <em>Id. </em>Because there is evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the petitioner had the mental capacity to initiate the divorce, we uphold it. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The respondent next asserts that the evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s finding that irreconcilable differences caused the irremediable breakdown of the parties\u2019 marriage. Whether the irremediable breakdown of the marriage was caused by irreconcilable differences was a factual question for the trial court. <em>Id. </em>We will affirm the trial court\u2019s finding that irreconcilable differences caused the irremediable breakdown of the parties\u2019 marriage unless the evidence does not support it or it is legally erroneous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Here, the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s findings. A financial advisor with whom the parties consulted shortly after the petitioner\u2019s stroke testified that the respondent had talked about previously seeking a divorce. One of the co-guardians testified that the respondent told her that, two or three weeks before the petitioner had his stroke, she was planning to leave him. According to the co-guardian, the respondent told the petitioner: \u201c[Y]ou don\u2019t like me and I don\u2019t like you. And the only reason I came back [to New Hampshire from Florida] is to get rid of some of my stuff and then I\u2019m going to go live with [my daughter].\u201d The co-guardian also testified that the respondent said that \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t put it past [the petitioner] to have had a stroke just to keep her from going.\u201d She further testified that the respondent said that she was \u201csick of caring for [the petitioner].\u201d The other co-guardian confirmed that the respondent said that she was \u201csick and tired\u201d of caring for the petitioner. Additionally, the petitioner\u2019s nephew testified that before his stroke, the petitioner told him that he found the respondent \u201cimpossible to live with.\u201d He testified that, based upon his observations, the parties\u2019 marriage was \u201cvery stressful, very unloving.\u201d He further testified that, before his stroke, the petitioner was considering divorcing the respondent. For his part, the petitioner testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>that he no longer liked or loved the respondent, that he was \u201cpositive\u201d that he wanted to divorce her, and that he did not think there were circumstances under which he could get along with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\">The trial judge was in the best position to evaluate the evidence, measure its persuasiveness and assess the credibility of witnesses. <em>In the Matter of Peirano &amp; Larsen, </em>155 N.H. 738, 752 (2007). The record supports the trial court\u2019s findings, and we find no error in its decision to grant the divorce on the ground that irreconcilable differences caused the irremediable breakdown of the marriage. <em>See Mannion, </em>155 N.H. at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The respondent next contends that the trial court\u2019s property distribution was unsustainable. \u201cRSA 458:16-a, II creates a presumption that equal distribution of marital property is equitable.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Watterworth &amp; Watterworth, </em>149 N.H. 442, 453 (2003) (quotation and ellipsis omitted). Absent special circumstances, the court must make the distribution as equal as possible. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">\u201cThe statute enumerates various factors for the court to consider, such as the length of the marriage, the ability of the parties to provide for their own needs, the needs of the custodial parent, the contribution of each party during the marriage and the value of property contributed by each party.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Crowe &amp; Crowe, </em>148 N.H. 218, 221 (2002); <em>see </em>RSA 458:16-a, II (2004). Additionally, the court may consider \u201c[a]ny other factor [it] deems relevant\u201d in equitably distributing the parties\u2019 assets. RSA 458:16-a, II(o). A trial court is not precluded, however, from awarding a particular asset in its entirety to one party. <em>See Letendre, </em>149 N.H. at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">We afford trial courts broad discretion in determining matters of property distribution in fashioning a final divorce decree, and we will not overturn the trial court\u2019s decision absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>In the Matter of Hampers &amp; Hampers, </em>154 N.H. 275, 285 (2006). If the court\u2019s findings can reasonably be made on the evidence presented, they will stand. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The trial court\u2019s narrative order indicates that the court found it equitable to divide the equity in the marital home equally and to divide the remaining assets approximately equally. To the extent that the division was unequal, the trial court found that the inequality was in the respondent\u2019s favor as she received her annuity (valued at $30,000), her vehicle (valued at $7,500), the majority of the household furniture and appliances, and her pension (valued at $60,000). The petitioner, on the other hand, received his annuity (valued at $41,000), cash (valued at $3,300) and his pension (the value of which the court had no information).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>The respondent argues that the trial court erred because it did not address the parties\u2019 respective needs when deciding how best to distribute their assets. We are unable to address this argument substantively because the record submitted by the respondent is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\">As the appealing party, the respondent had the burden of providing this court with a record sufficient to decide her appeal issues. <em>See Rix v. Kinderworks Corp., </em>136 N.H. 548, 553 (1992); <em>see also </em>SUP. Ct. R. 13. Although the trial court\u2019s narrative order indicates that the trial court ruled upon 110 requests for findings of fact and rulings of law submitted by the respondent, she has not provided this court with these requests. Absent the requests for findings and rulings, we must assume that the trial court made all findings necessary to support its decision, <em>see In re Jonathan T., </em>148 N.H. 296, 304 (2002), and that, contrary to the respondent\u2019s assertions, it did consider the parties\u2019 respective needs when dividing their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The respondent further contends that the trial court erred by considering the fact that she \u201cgifted significant marital assets to her family members following the petitioner\u2019s stroke.\u201d As the applicable statute grants the trial court the authority to consider \u201c[t]he actions of either party during the marriage which contributed to the ... diminution in value of property owned by either or both ... parties,\u201d RSA 458:16-a, 11(f), as well as \u201c[a]ny other factor [it] deems relevant\u201d in equitably distributing the parties\u2019 assets, RSA 458:16-a, II(o), we hold that to consider this fact was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">To the extent that the respondent argues that the trial court\u2019s findings in its decree are somehow inconsistent, we do not share her interpretation of the decree. We decline to address the respondent\u2019s final assertion that the court erred in \u201cnot addressing disposal of the ward\u2019s marital distribution,\u201d because this argument is not sufficiently developed to warrant appellate review. <em>See ACG Credit Co. v.
