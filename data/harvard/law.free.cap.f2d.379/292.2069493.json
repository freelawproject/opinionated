The petitioners insist that there is no genuine issue of material fact whether the members of the legislative committee actually participated in the illegal raids. The thrust of the original complaint is, however, not that Pfister and the other committee members participated in the raids, but that the raids were carried out \u201cunder the direction and in behalf of [the] defendant\u201d. In other words the question is whether the committee\u2019s investigation was undertaken for a legitimate purpose or with an eye to depriving the plaintiffs of their constitutional rights, either through raids, through harassment and prosecution, or otherwise, whether by the committee\u2019s own acts or by the acts of others instigated by the Committee. The record, incorporated in Pfister\u2019s \u201copposition\u201d, clearly reveals genuine issues of material fact as to these issues. The petition for rehearing is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
