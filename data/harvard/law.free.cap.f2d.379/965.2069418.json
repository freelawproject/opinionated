The District Judge treated the motion as a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1964) and wrote a lengthy and careful opinion, based on the record in the case. The opinion held that the sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>tence under the first of the two bank robbery counts (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a)) should have been regarded as merged with the second (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d)), Prince v. United States, 352 U.S. 322, 77 5. Ct. 403, 1 L.Ed.2d 370 (1957); United States v. Machibroda, 338 F.2d 947 (C.A. 6, 1964). The District Judge thereupon vacated the sentence under the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">He also reviewed and rejected appellant\u2019s claims of deprivation of counsel, illegal search, suppression of evidence, and inadequacy of identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">On appeal to this court we affirm the District Judge\u2019s order of January 31, 1966, for the reasons set forth in his opinion and those which follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">In view of the <em>in pro per </em>nature of this appeal, this court has read the complete transcript of this trial. We are convinced that appellant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel was not abused and that in fact he received competent and effective legal representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">The masked bandit who robbed the First National Lincoln Bank of Louisville escaped with $8,906.10. Included in that sum was $2,000 of \u201cbait money\u201d as to which the bank retained a record of serial numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">The proofs showed that when appellant was arrested, he had in his possession $158, including one $20 bill with a serial number which matched the bank list; that on the afternoon of the same day the bank robbery occurred, appellant bought a secondhand Cadillac automobile, paying over $1,900 in cash therefor, among which bills were found 65 $20 bills whose serial numbers were on the bank list, and that the approximate bal-lance of the stolen money (including \u201cbait money\u201d) was found under the mattress of appellant\u2019s bed in his father\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">Over and above these facts, there was much other confirming evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">As to the search and seizure issue, the government proved permission for the search of the house by its owner, who was appellant\u2019s father. No contrary or additional facts were tendered by appellant. No motion to suppress evidence was made. No objection to the evidence was offered. Further, the evidence now objected to was clearly cumulative. On this record we doubt that its admission was such clear, prejudicial, and constitutional error as can be reached by motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1964). And if we assume error, we find beyond reasonable doubt that the error was harmless. Chapman v. State of California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967) ; Rule 52(a) Fed. R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
