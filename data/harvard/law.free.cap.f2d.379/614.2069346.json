Beto, S.D.Tex., Houston Div., No. 14,-557 \u2014 which was denied after an evi-dentiary hearing. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2244. A perusal of both records reveals that in both petitions appellant contended that he had been denied a trial transcript and the right to take a direct appeal. The former petition was denied on December 26, 1962, and this Court denied the application for a certificate of probable cause and the motion for leave to appeal in forma pauperis on April 2, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-23\">No new ground for relief has been alleged in the present petition, nor does there appear any need for another evi-dentiary hearing. The judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
