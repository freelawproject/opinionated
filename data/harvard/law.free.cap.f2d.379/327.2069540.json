We have considered the entire record and hold that the indictment did not charge a conspiracy, that there was overwhelming evidence from which the jury could conclude that Brumley had violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314, and that, contrary to Brumley\u2019s contention, the evidence presented by witnesses Willis and Van Treeve did tend to prove similar acts. The admissibility of such evidence to show knowledge or intent is beyond question. Weiss v. United States, 5 Cir. 1941, 122 F.2d 675, 682. The trial judge was particularly careful to instruct the jury on the limited admissibility of this evidence, even before it was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-22\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
