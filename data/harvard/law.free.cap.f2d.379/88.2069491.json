This appellant had been employed as a financial investigator in that Division. As the services to be rendered in various area field offices required the reassignment of financial investigators, the appellant in due course was directed to report for duty in the Detroit, Michigan, area field office. He refused to accept that assignment. At no time has he reported for work at Detroit, and instead has contended that he unlawfully had been denied the right to work in Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-25\"> We find no basis upon which we may go behind the action of the Department of Labor. Certainly, despite the appellant\u2019s insistence, it is not open to us to subject the Secretary to examination in respect of the decision he had reached. United States v. Morgan, 313 U.S. 409, 422 (1941). Since there was a rational basis for the appellant\u2019s separation from service and we are not persuaded that the appellant had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>denied procedural rights, we are bound to affirm the judgment of the District Court. Courts will be most reluctant to disturb agency action where, as here, the record discloses an adequate basis for the result reached. See, e. g., Studemeyer v. Macy, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 120, 321 F.2d 386, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 934, 84 S.Ct. 337, 11 L.Ed.2d 265, 61 S.Ct. 999, 85 L.Ed. 1429 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
