At trial, the Government established Greenwell\u2019s original reception as a prisoner at Lor-ton and his unauthorized departure. Taking the stand in his own behalf, Greenwell \u25a0 testified that he left Lorton in the company of a person whom he assumed to be a prison employee to help deliver furniture to Washington, D. C. He further testified that upon their arrival in Washington, his companion told him to do some window shopping, and that when he returned he was unable to locate this individual. His explanation for not turning himself over to the authorities was that, being a Black Muslim, he feared persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">On appeal, Greenwell\u2019s sole contention is that the Government failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The Government\u2019s evidence established a prima facie case of escape and the District Court, as the trier of fact, was not obligated to accept Greenwell\u2019s narrative, particularly in view of his failure to name or produce the \u201cmystery man\u201d whom he accompanied to Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-16\">The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b369-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
