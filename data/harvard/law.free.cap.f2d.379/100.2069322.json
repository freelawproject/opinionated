Over a period of years in furtherance of rule-making the Commission gave notice and conducted hearings which resulted in the Commission\u2019s General Order 15, 46 C.F.R. Part 533 (1966), amended on June 24, 1966 (31 Fed.Reg. 8815). It is this General Order 15 as amended which is here challenged. By this Order the Maritime Commission requires that the railroads who own or control port terminals, which handle cargo delivered and picked up by modes of transportation other than rail, shall file with the Commission all separately stated terminal rates and rules and regulations affecting rates. See section 17, Shipping Act, 1916, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 816 (1964). Specifically excluded from the requirement of the Order are rates included in the line-haul rates of railroads.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>The marine terminal facilities here involved consist of piers at which ships dock to load and discharge cargo. Space is provided on the piers for the storage of incoming and outgoing cargo. Trucks are permitted access to the piers and are charged a wharfage fee. It is clear that such facilities are subject to regulation by the Federal Maritime Commission except insofar as section 33 of the Shipping Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 832 (1964) precludes such regulation. State of California v. United States, 320 U.S. 577, 586, 64 S.Ct. 352, 88 L.Ed. 322 (1944).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Section 33 provides in pertinent part that the Shipping Act</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">\u201cshall not be construed to affect the power or jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, nor to confer upon the Federal Maritime [Commission] * * * concurrent power or jurisdiction over any matter within the power or jurisdiction of such Interstate Commerce Commission * * 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 832 (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">It is to be noted that whereas the above-quoted statute proscribes concurrent jurisdiction over the same \u201cmatter\u201d it does not preclude concurrent jurisdiction over the same \u201cpersons.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Where a person performs functions some of which are subject to regulation under the Shipping Act and others under the Interstate Commerce Act, the same person might be subject to the jurisdiction of one or the other Commissions depending upon the subject matter to be regulated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While it is manifest that section 33 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> did not contemplate overlapping regulation pertaining to the same subject matter, Congress was aware that the two areas of jurisdiction would touch, and that the respective Commissions might jointly work out the limitations of their jurisdiction in accord with the statutory mandates.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such a joint determination was held in connection with freight shipments to and from railroad piers in Boston. The Federal Maritime Commission examined the railroads' wharf practices and the Interstate Commerce Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>sion considered the absorption of wharf-age charges in line-haul rates. Interchange of Freight at Boston Terminals, 2 U.S.M.C. 671 (1942) and Interchange of Freight at Boston Piers, 253 I.C.C. 703 (1942). As this joint determination clearly indicates, there are instances in which both agencies may need the same information to discharge their separate but dovetailing responsibilities. <em>Cf. </em>Baltimore and Ohio R. Co. v. United States, 201 F.2d 795 (3 Cir.), reaff\u2019d, 208 F.2d 734 (3 Cir. 1953).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Petitioners further contend that the Federal Maritime Commission lacks the power to require the filing of the tariffs by \u201cother persons\u201d subject to the Act but that the tariff filing requirements are confined to \u201cwater carriers.\u201d We deem this argument without merit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 21 provides that the Commission \u201cmay require any common carrier by water, or other person subject to this chapter * * * to file with it * * * any periodical or special report, or any. account, record, rate or charge * * * appertaining to the business of such carrier, or other person subject to this chapter.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 820 (1964). Moreover, section 43 of the Shipping Act provides : \u201cThe Commission shall make such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 841a (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">The order here complained of followed extensive rule-making proceedings in which proposals had been submitted by numerous affected interests. The Commission had acted in furtherance of section 17 of the Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 816 (1964) under which the Commission may prescribe just and reasonable regulations and practices upon a finding that any unjust or unreasonable regulation or practice is being followed by a person subject to the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">What seems most to disturb the Petitioners is not that they are asked to supply tariff information,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but that such data are called for in advance of the effective date of the tariffs. As the Petitioners see it, the contested Order is the first step leading to Maritime Commission regulation of their rates, rules and practices pertaining to facilities over which Petitioners claim the Maritime Commission has no jurisdiction. Although the Maritime Commission insists it is only seeking information,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it points out that this information is necessary in advance to avoid the possibility of deferring corrective action until after it is required. We need not seek to penetrate all background to ascertain some vague but unspoken Commission intent. We take the Order at its face and view it in light of what the Commission represents to the court as its purpose and appraise the Order in terms of the applicable stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>utes. We may thus observe that the Interstate Commerce Act and the Shipping Act merely adumbrate the respective jurisdictions, and the integrated nature of the activities here involved requires a mutual overlapping of information so that each Commission is fully informed concerning matters reasonably related to its jurisdiction. If inquiry looking toward regulation of Petitioners\u2019 practices shall assertedly become necessary after the effective date of such tariffs, there is no reason to believe that the Maritime Commission would exceed its jurisdiction. Nor can we doubt that Petitioners will be alert to take appropriate steps should they deem ultimate possible Commission action to exceed the Commission\u2019s powers. We may observe that the past practice of holding joint hearings to consider matters of mutual concern to both the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Maritime Commission gives assurance that if action is necessary<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to remedy any ills which the statutes were designed to eliminate, the respective Commissions will carefully limit their exercise of authority to those matters committed to their respective agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"> In any event, at this point we would not be warranted in attempting to delineate the limits of such jurisdiction before any action has been taken or proposed by either Commission.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We are satisfied that the information here sought is reasonably related to the regulatory functions entrusted to the Maritime Commission and that the challenged Order is appropriately designed to achieve a permissible purpose. That the data must be furnished on or before the effective dates of tariffs as filed in no way militates against our conclusion that the Order has placed upon the Petitioners no unreasonable or unpermitted burden.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\">. In the <em>California </em>case, the State of California and the City of Oakland operated port terminal facilities in the Port of San Francisco. The Maritime Commission found that terminals along the waterfront, including those of California and Oakland, were engaged in preferential and unreasonable practices, in violation of sections 16 and 17 of the Shipping Act, in that they allowed excessive free time and made noncompensatory charges for their services. The Commission prescribed schedules of maximum free time and of minimum charges to reflect the actual cost of services.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">The Court held, <em>inter alia, </em>that California and Oakland as owners of such facilities were subject to regulation as \u201cother persons\u201d subject to the Shipping Act. The Court also upheld the Commission\u2019s power to set the minimum rates to remedy sections 16 and 17 violations although the Maritime Commission is not given express rate-making power over \u201cother persons.\u201d The opinion notes \u201c[Tjhere can be no doubt that wharf storage facilities provided at shipside for cargo which has been unloaded from water carriers are subject to regulation by the Commission.\u201d 320 U.S. at 586, 64 S.Ct. at 357.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-15\">.

The Court there pointed out that the use of the limiting language of other person \u201cin connection with a common carrier by water\u201d was to prevent a possible construction of the term \u201cother person\u201d to include <em>all </em>terminal facilities, even those used in connection with interstate or foreign commerce not by water.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b150-16\">. The Interstate Commerce Commission by letter of May 4, 1966 informed the General Counsel of the Federal Maritime Commission that the Department of Justice and the Maritime Commission \u201care authorized to represent to the Court of Appeals * * * that the ICC has considered the [proposed] rules and amendments thereto and has no objections at this time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b150-17\">. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7. 832 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b150-18\">. <em>Hearings on H.R. 14337 before the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, House of Representatives, </em>64th Cong., 1st Sess., 15-16 (1916).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\">. The Interstate Commerce Act in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(b) (3) (1964) provides that nothing in that Act shall be construed to repeal the provisions of the Shipping Act, 1916, \u201cinsofar as such Act provides for the regulation of persons included within the term \u2018other person subject to this Act\u2019 as defined in such Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">It seems clear enough that while the Petitioners are carrying on the business of furnishing terminal facilities in connection with common carriers by water and hence come within the Maritime Commission jurisdiction to that extent, their overlapping and concurrent railroad operations remain subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\">.
