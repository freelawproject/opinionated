It is conceded that the forged security in question, a cashier\u2019s cheek in the sum of $250, was bogus. The Montana bank upon which the check was drawn and the person who signed the check as maker are nonexistent. It is also conceded that the appellent introduced the check into interstate commerce. The appellant however contends that the record discloses no evidence to support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>finding by the jury that he introduced the bogus check into interstate commerce with knowledge of its bogus nature, and that proof of such guilty knowledge is the critical element of the offense for which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The appellant testified during the trial, and his account of the incident leading to his indictment and conviction may be summarized as follows: In the fall of 1964 appellant attended a \u201cturkey shoot\u201d sponsored by the Veterans of Foreign Wars organization in Bennett, Colorado. The turkey shoot was apparently an occasion for gambling in the VFW building, and appellant joined a \u201c7-11\u201d dice game, in which he engaged in side bets with different people standing around the dice table. A man known only as \u201cAnthony Capra\u201d offered the cashier\u2019s check as security for side bets with appellant. Appellant testified that he was not acquainted with Capra, had not seen him before that day, and has not seen him since. He related that Capra identified himself as \u201cAnthony Capra\u201d and gave a home address in Denver, which appellant was unable to remember precisely. Capra passed the check to appellant for examination before the betting started, and appellant noticed that the payee on the face of the check was \u201cAnthony Capra,\u201d and that the check was not then endorsed. Appellant returned the check to Capra and the game continued. Appellant further testified that after a time, appellant succeeded in winning $250 from Capra. Appellant took the check from Capra and placed it in his pocket, neglecting to notice if Capra had endorsed the check. Appellant continued in the game, making bets with other people at the table and finally losing all his cash. Appellant owed $40 to another player and thought of cashing the check won earlier from Capra, at which time appellant realized that \u201cI forgot to get the endorsement from him [Capra].\u201d Appellant looked around the room for Capra, but did not see him, and appellant could not recall if he looked for Capra in the other game rooms in the building. Appellant then approached Mr. Froman, a VFW official, and said that he wanted to cash the check. Froman responded that the check would have to be approved. Appellant also testified that Mr. Meyer, another official of the VFW, appeared at the cashier\u2019s table. Appellant testified that he told Meyer and Froman that he was not \u201cAnthony Capra,\u201d but that Mr. Meyer said an endorsement was nee-cessary, and for appellant to sign \u201cAnthony Capra\u201d and give an address. Appellant endorsed the check by signing \u201cAnthony Capra\u201d and added a Denver address, which appellant testified was his best recollection of the address Capra had given during the betting. Appellant testified that neither Meyer nor Froman asked him for any personal identification, and that Meyer remarked that a cashier\u2019s check is \u201cgood as gold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Meyer and Froman, the VFW officials who cashed the bogus cheek for appellant, appeared as Government witnesses. According to Meyer and Froman, the appellant represented himself as the payee of the check, \u201cAnthony Capra,\u201d and did or said nothing to indicate otherwise. Meyer and Froman also testified that they sought identification from the appellant, but that appellant told them the state had picked up his driver\u2019s license or that he had lost his billfold. Three defense witnesses testified that they had seen the cashier\u2019s check in the dice game before the appellant won it, and one of these witnesses testified that he had placed bets on the check himself before the appellant won it. Another of these defense witnesses testified that he accompanied the appellant to the cashier\u2019s table, and generally corroborated appellant\u2019s account of the check cashing incident. Although the record contains the testimony of other witnesses, we conclude that further discussion of the evidence is unnecessary for deciding the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">It is the appellant\u2019s argument that the record discloses a failure of proof on a critical element of the offense, i.e., that appellant knew the cashier\u2019s check was bogus when he endorsed, cashed, and introduced the check into in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>terstate commerce. Scienter, or guilty knowledge, is an element of the offense, for the statute plainly limits culpability tc interstate transportation of securities with knowledge of their bogus nature. See Barry v. United States, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 301, 287 F.2d 340; Popeko v. United States, 294 F.2d 168 (5th Cir.); Halfen v. United States, 324 F.2d 52 (10th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">When the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a conviction is questioned on appeal, the evidence with reasonable inferences therefrom will be viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution. There must, of course, be substantial evidence on each element of the offense from which the jury could find that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Williams v. United States, 368 F.2d 972 (10th Cir.); Cartwright v. United States, 335 F.2d 919 (10th Cir.); Halfen v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">We conclude that there is not substantial evidence in the record upon which the jury could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the appellant knew the cashier\u2019s check was bogus when he introduced it into interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">There is substantial evidence in the record to support a finding by the jury that the appellant falsely <em>endorsed </em>the check by representing to Meyer and Froman that he was \u201cAnthony Capra,\u201d but a false endorsement is not a criminal offense under \u00a7 2314. In Streett v. United States, 331 F.2d 151 (8th Cir.), the defendant was accused of violating \u00a7 2314 by introducing in interstate commerce bona fide travelers checks upon which he had falsely endorsed the countersignatures. After an extensive discussion of \u00a7 2314, the Eighth Circuit held that falsely endorsing is not falsely making, forging, altering, or counterfeiting the instrument, as required by the statute. See also Beatty v. United States, 357 F.2d 19 (10th Cir.), where this court, citing the Streett case, said, \u201c * * * whether defendant actually endorsed the check is of no significance in establishing the elements of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Without direct or circumstantial evidence bearing on the appellant\u2019s knowledge that the cashier\u2019s check was false, substantial evidence that he falsely endorsed the check is proof only of a fact that is equally consistent with innocence as with guilt, or that merely raises a suspicion of guilt. Halfen v. United States, supra, and cases cited therein. There is no presumption arising from possession of such a check. See also Kreuter v. United States, 376 F.2d 654 (Tenth Circuit, May 4, 1967). We find no additional evidence in the record bearing on the appellant\u2019s knowledge that the check was bogus. There was substantial evidence as noted above to establish false endorsement as a fact, but that fact alone is not substantial circumstantial evidence from which the jury could infer, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant knew the check was bogus. The record discloses a failure of proof on an essential element of the offense for which the appellant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">The appellant\u2019s conviction is vacated and the cause is remanded to the District Court with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-15\">. The language of \u00a7 2314 material to this appeal provides: \u201cWhoever, with unlawful or fraudulent intent, transports in interstate or foreign commerce any falsely made, forged, altered, or counterfeited securities or tax stamps, knowing the same to have been falsely made, forged, altered, or counterfeited; * * *</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-27\">\u201cShall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
