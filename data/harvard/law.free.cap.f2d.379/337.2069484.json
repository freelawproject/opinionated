The only issue presented by this appeal is whether the Tax Court correctly concluded that a corporation, formed by Dr. Sas-Jawor-sky and two other persons for the purpose of promoting the sale of a biography of Dr. Sas-Jaworsky, was a taxable entity. If the corporation was in fact a taxable entity, the petitioners, as individuals, are not entitled to certain deductions asserted by them and the subject matter of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\"> The Tax Court\u2019s determination that the corporation was a separate entity is factual in nature and may not be overturned upon review unless clearly erroneous. See Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Duberstein, 1960, 363 U.S. 278, 290-291, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 1199-1200, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218, 1227-1228. A careful review of the record convinces us that the evidence clearly supports the finding of the Tax Court. We accordingly affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
