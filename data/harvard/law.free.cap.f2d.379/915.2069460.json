KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">We previously vacated the conviction of David Arthur Gearey for refusing to submit for induction into the armed forces, in violation of 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a), and remanded the case to the District Court for a hearing on areas that were in need of elucidation. 368 F.2d 144 (1966). Judge Murphy, who had been the trial judge, conducted the hearing. Thereafter, he reinstated Gearey\u2019s conviction and sentence of 2 years\u2019 imprisonment. Appellant asks us, once more, to set aside his conviction, claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that the District Court failed at the hearing to follow the directions contained in our opinion. In addition, he urges that the Local Board\u2019s refusal to reclassify him as a conscientious objector was based on an erroneous view of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">The facts leading to Gearey\u2019s conviction are set forth fully in our prior opinion and we shall therefore avoid a detailed recital of the tortuous Selective Service proceedings that stretched over a 6-year period. Between October 1960, when Gearey first registered with his Local Board, and January 1965, he received student deferments, never claiming to be a conscientious objector. In mid-February 1965, appellant\u2019s Draft Board was notified by St. Francis College that Gearey was no longer enrolled as a student. When appellant failed to provide proof of attendance, the Board revoked his student deferment (2-S) and reclassified him I-A (available for military service). On April 19, an Order to Report for Induction on May 5 was mailed to appellant. But on April 23 Gearey asked that his I-A classification be reviewed and that the date of induction be postponed. The Board complied by rescheduling his induction for July.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-15\">It was not until May 24, however, that Gearey for the first time asked the Board to send him the special questionnaire for conscientious objectors (SSS Form #150). After the form was returned to the Board, Gearey was' invited to appear for an interview on July 6. Upon the conclusion of that hearing, Gearey was informed by the Board that it did not believe he was a \u201cgenuine c.o.\u201d' and, therefore, a change in his classification was not warranted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Two days later appellant appeared for induction, but refused to take the symbolic step foward when ordered to do so. He was subsequently arrested, tried by Judge Murphy, sitting without a jury, and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-17\">On his first appeal, Gearey\u2019s principal' argument was that he had been improperly denied the procedural safeguards (including the right to present his case to the Selective Service Appeal Board) contained in \u00a7 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>on the other hand, contended that the Local Board was barred from considering appellant\u2019s claim of conscientious objection by S2 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-4\">The local board may reopen and reclassify anew the classification of the registrant * * * provided * * * the classification of a registrant shall not be reopened after the local board has mailed to such registrant an Order to Report for Induction * * * unless the local board first specifically finds there has been a change in the registrant\u2019s status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">We recognized that \u00a7 1625.2 was a reasonable regulation, designed to require registrants to raise their claims for deferment as soon as they had matured, thereby avoiding a process of endless challenges. Any other construction, we believed, would work havoc upon the Selective Service System and manpower quotas could rarely be met with any reasonable degree of certainty. We therefore concluded that it was entirely just to require that claims be raised within reasonable time limits in the interest of orderly administrative proceedings. Thus, it was proper to apply \u00a7 1625.2 to registrants whose claims, though maturing <em>before </em>an Order to Report for Induction had been mailed, were not presented to the Board until <em>after </em>the receipt of that order. Such individuals, it seemed clear to us, were afforded ample opportunity to raise their claims before receiving an order to report, and had no justifiable complaint when the Board refused to reopen their classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">But, we went on to note, \u201c[t]he considerations are quite different * * * when a claim of conscientious objection, raised for the first time after receipt of an induction notice, is based on a claim <em>which had not previously matured. </em>* * * It would be improper to conclude that an individual is not a genuine conscientious objector merely because his beliefs did not ripen until after he received his notice * * 368 F.2d at 149-150. (Emphasis added; footnote omitted.) This country\u2019s long history of exempting conscientious objectors, together with the statutory rights afforded to such claimants, led us to conclude that one who raised a claim of conscientious objection promptly after it matured, had a right to have the Board consider his request for reclassification \u2014 even if the claim was not raised until after an induction notice had been sent. Applying these principles to Gearey\u2019s case, we concluded that the District Court should determine whether the Board had erroneously refused to consider appellant\u2019s claim solely because it was not raised until after he received his induction notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">Upon remand, Judge Murphy conducted a hearing at which Board Chairman Frank Barbiere, Board Secretary William Hatterschied, and Board Member Thomas Elmezzi were questioned by an Assistant United States Attorney, and then subjected to intense cross-examination by defense counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Judge, however, declined to permit Gearey to testify or to introduce in evidence a memorandum (Defendant\u2019s Exhibit A for Identification) containing his recollections of the July 6 interview with the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>Based upon the testimony elicited at this hearing, Judge Murphy concluded that when the Board interviewed Gearey on July 6, the members were ready to reclassify him as a conscientious objector, despite the induction notice, if they could be persuaded that his claim was sincere. Judge Murphy found that the Board believed that Gearey \u201cwas not then, and never had been a genuine conscientious objector,\u201d 266 F.Supp. 161 (S.D.N.Y.1967) and for this reason refused to reclassify him. The District Judge also held that the evidence adduced both at the trial and at the remand indicated that there was a rational basis for this conclusion, and, accordingly, he reinstated Gearey\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Two of appellant\u2019s claims need not detain us long. Gearey argues that the testimony of the Board members demonstrated that they rejected his claim of conscientious objection either \u201cexclusively or principally because of its lateness,\u201d and that this was contrary to the rule of law announced in our earlier decision. Our response to this is that appellant misreads the opinion in <em>Gearey I. </em>We remanded the case because we were uncertain whether the Board had refused to reopen Gearey\u2019s classification \u201con the ground that [he] had not advanced his claim before the mailing of the induction notice, even though the claim had not matured until later.\u201d 368 F.2d at 151. The District Court, therefore, was to determine whether, the Board had refused to <em>consider </em>appellant\u2019s claim simply because of the late date at which it was raised. But we explicitly noted that \u201cthe belatedness of a claim may be a factor in assessing its genuineness.\u201d Id. at 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">Our review of the record reveals overwhelming support for Judge Murphy\u2019s finding that the members of the Board did consider Gearey\u2019s claim despite the receipt by him of an induction notice, and that he would have been reclassified if his conscientious objection claim were genuine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While it appears that the belated nature of the claim did cause skepticism concerning its sincerity, we can see no impropriety in considering this element. In any event, this was but one of several factors which the Board relied upon in denying appellant\u2019s claim. See part IV, infra.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-13\">Equally without merit is Gearey\u2019s contention that the Local Board failed to follow the procedures set forth in our prior decision, since no effort was made to determine when Gearey\u2019s beliefs matured. Here too, appellant has misread our opinion. We were merely setting forth guidelines to be followed by Local Boards in the future when confronted with a post induction notice claim of conscientious objection.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-14\">[T]he Local Board must first determine when an applicant\u2019s beliefs matured. If the Board properly concludes that the claim existed before the notice was sent, the classification may not be reopened. If the Board finds, however, that the applicant\u2019s beliefs ripened only after he received his notice, and that his beliefs qualify him for classification as a conscientious objector then a change in status would have occurred \u201cresulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control,\u201d and he would be entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>be reclassified by the Local Board. 368 F.2d at 150. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">This procedure was devised in order to insure that Boards will hereafter reach the merits of a registrant\u2019s claim of conscientious objection, despite its assertion after the receipt of an induction notice, provided his beliefs had not matured before that time. But when the record reveals, as it does in the present case, that the Board members have in fact considered the registrant\u2019s claim on its merits, and have rejected it only because they believe that it is not genuine, it would be labor in vain to require the Board to determine when the claim matured. We made this clear in <em>Gearey I </em>when we instructed the District Court that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-5\">If [the Board] meant either that Gear-ey never was \u201ca genuine c.o.\u201d <em>or </em>that whatever his beliefs were on the subject, they had matured before the induction notice was sent, and if the judge is convinced of the rationality of such a view, Gearey\u2019s conviction may stand; otherwise the indictment must be dismissed. 368 F.2d at 151. (Emphasis added; footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">Gearey raises two other arguments which require further analysis. He contends that his conviction must be reversed because the Board relied on an erroneous reason in refusing to reclassify him. Appellant refers us specifically to the testimony of members Barbiere and Elmezzi who, he says, stated that Gearey did not qualify as a conscientious objector because he allegedly answered, in response to pointed queries, that he would use force to ward off an attack on his \u201cgirl\u201d or other loved ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">It is true, as appellant contends, that a registrant\u2019s belief in the use of force in self-defense is not inconsistent with a conscientious objection to participation in war in any form. See Sicurella v. United States, 348 U.S. 385, 75 S.Ct. 403, 99 L.Ed. 436 (1955); Jessen v. United States, 212 F.2d 897 (10th Cir. 1954) (footnote omitted); United States v. Hartman, 209 F.2d 366 (2d Cir. 1954); United States v. Pekarski, 207 F.2d 930 (2d Cir. 1953); Taffs v. United States, 208 F.2d 329 (8th Cir. 1953), cert. denied, 347 U.S. 928, 74 S.Ct. 532, 98 L.Ed. 1081 (1954); United States v. Parmiter, 173 F.Supp. 677, 687-689 (S.D.N.Y.1959). But in each of the cited cases the evidence was <em>uncontroverted </em>that the registrant was opposed to participation in war.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In such circumstances, reversal was proper because \u201c [a] person\u2019s willingness to use force in self-defense is not a valid objection to denial of conscientious objector status <em>where other evidence of his opposition to participation in war because of religious belief is undisputed.\u201d </em>Taffs v. United States, 208 F.2d at 331. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">In this case, by contrast, the record is clear that there is no substance to any contention that Gearey\u2019s opposition to war was \u201cundisputed.\u201d Indeed, the sincerity of his views was the very issue before the Board; and, it is clear from the testimony that many unquestionably vaild considerations led the Board members to reject the genuineness of appellant\u2019s claim. For example, they observed Gearey\u2019s demeanor at the interview and testified that he seemed to be principally concerned with \u201cfurthering his education by going to Europe and taking pictures,\u201d and not with being reclassified as a conscientious objector. The members also stated that Gearey had refused to reveal his reasons for rejecting a teaching position at Bishop Ford High School which he had previously indicated he would accept, and that between June 7 and July 6, 1965 he denied, affirmed, and again denied that he was a member of the Catholic Church. Finally, the Board members were skeptical of Gearey\u2019s claim because of the entire untidy history of vacillation disclosed by his numerous requests for deferments over the 6-year period on diverse grounds, and his failure to seek reclassification as a conscientious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>objector until post induction notice. They were bolstered in their skepticism by what they characterized as his \u201cevasive\u201d responses at the July 6 interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">It is well established that the scope of judicial review in Selective Service cases is exceedingly narrow.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-6\">\u201c[I]t is not for the courts to sit as super draft boards, substituting their judgments on the weight of the evidence for those of the designated agencies. Nor should they look for substantial evidence to support such determinations. Dickinson v. United States, 346 U.S. 389, 396 [74 S.Ct. 152, 157, 98 L.Ed. 132] (1953). The classification can be overturned only if it has \u2018no basis in fact.\u2019 Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 122 [66 S.Ct. 423, 427, 90 L.Ed. 567] (1946).\u201d Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 380-381, 75 S.Ct. 392, 395, 99 L.Ed. 428.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">The record before us supplies more than ample evidence to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that Gearey was not sincere in his belief; and in cases involving conscientious objectors, \u201cany fact which casts doubt on the veracity of the registrant is relevant.\u201d Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. at 381-382, 75 S.Ct. at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">Moreover, we see no merit to Gearey\u2019s contention that his conviction must be reversed because the Board in denying his claim <em>may </em>have relied to some extent on his answers regarding the use of force in self-defense. The decisions cited by appellant<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> are clearly inapposite; there judgments were reversed because there was a firm basis for believing that the registrant had been classified pursuant to a mistaken notion that his beliefs did not fall within the statutory standards for conscientious objection \u2014 in the various cases, the Department of Justice had incorrectly advised the Selective Service System that the registrant\u2019s beliefs did not qualify under the statute \u2014 and the reviewing court thus could not determine whether the denial of the registrant\u2019s claim was based upon a proper or an improper ground. We face no such quandary here, however, since we have no sufficient basis for believing that the Board utilized an improper standard in denying Gear-ey\u2019s claim; to the contrary we have the benefit of the testimony of the Board members revealing beyond question that valid considerations led to their rejection of Gearey\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-12\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-13\">Lastly, we consider Gearey\u2019s argument that the District Court erred by refusing to permit appellant to testify or to introduce in evidence the memorandum containing his recollections of the July 6 interview with the Board. We have already noted that this case was remanded for the limited purpose of determining whether the Board refused to consider Gearey\u2019s claim because it had been raised post Notice to Beport for Induction. We cannot see the relevance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>of Gearey\u2019s testimony to this issue. Certainly, he could not reveal the <em>mens </em>or thought processes of the Board members.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And we cannot overlook the fact that despite intense cross-examination, the members remained steadfast in their assertion that Gearey\u2019s claim was considered on its merits and that they were prepared to reclassify him if deserving, but declined to do so because they believed his claim was not sincere.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">The record reveals instead that counsel desired Gearey\u2019s testimony so that he could introduce the memorandum of the July 6 interview.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In any event, substantial portions of that document were placed before the Court during the cross-examination of the Board members. And since Gearey included the memorandum in his Appendix on this appeal, we have considered its contents as if the exhibit were in evidence. We see nothing in it, however, which would indicate that the Board members refused to give consideration to appellant\u2019s claim; rather, the document reveals that the members made a conscientious effort to determine whether Gearey\u2019s claim was genuine. And, the memorandum does not reveal that the Board had no basis upon which it could reasonably have concluded that appellant was not sincere in asserting a claim of conscientious objection. In these circumstances, we cannot say that the District Court\u2019s refusal to permit Gearey to testify at this limited hearing, or its failure to receive in evidence the memorandum, constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-16\">We have considered appellant\u2019s other claims and find them equally lacking in merit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-17\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b965-9\">. The following summary of that hearing was prepared by the Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-11\">Registrant interviewed, had decided just recently to become a c.o., said he had been thinking about it but never mentioned it. We reviewed the c.o. # 150, also reviewed letter sent by Bishop Ford High School. Registrant claims he is not working there nor that he would definitely be working there in September. Said he would like to go to Europe and take pictures since this is the vocation he wants to pursue or maybe teach when he returns. The board after reviewing the evidence submitted and registrant\u2019s claims felt be did not qualify to be a genuine c.o. All facts considered did not warrant a change in classification. He was advised to report as scheduled. Vote was 4 to O.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b965-19\">. That section provides in part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-20\">Any person claiming exemption from combatant training and service because of such conscientious objections shall, if such claim is not sustained by the local board, be entitled to an appeal to the appropriate appeal board. Upon the filing of such appeal, the appeal board shall refer any such claim to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>Department of Justice for inquiry and hearing. The Department of Justice, after appropriate inquiry, shall hold a hearing with respect to the character and good faith of the objections of the person concerned, and such person shall be notified of the time and place of such hearing. * * * If after such hearing the Department of Justice finds that his objections are not sustained, it shall recommend to the appeal board that such objections be not sustained.

James P. McGrattan, the other member of the Board who interviewed Gearey, was unable to recall appellant or the interview.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b967-7\">. Judge Murphy also ruled that Gearey\u2019s beliefs had matured before the induction notice was sent to him. Because we agree with Judge Murphy that the Board rationally concluded that Gearey was not a genuine conscientious objector, we find it unnecessary to consider this alternate holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b967-8\">.

The Supreme Court has interpreted this finality to mean that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-10\">Congress chose not to give administrative action under this Act the customary scope of judicial review which obtains under other statutes. It means that the courts are not to weigh the evidence to determine whether the classification made by the local boards was justified.

The question of jurisdiction of the local board is reached only if there is no basis in fact for the classification which it gave the registrant. United States v.

We reject, for example, appellant\u2019s argument that United States v. Vincelli, 215 F.2d 210 (2d Cir.1954), which we considered in the first <em>Gearey </em>case, stands for the principle that, upon the presentation of new information of a non-frivolous nature, the Board must reopen a registrant\u2019s classification, even if it decides to adhere to the prior classification. The cases cited by appellant, which have interpreted <em>Vincelli </em>clearly indicate that the Board must reopen only if the registrant has made out a prima facie case, based on objective facts, that he is entitled to be reclassified. See, e.g., United States v. Burlich, 257 F.Supp. 906 (S.D.N.Y.1966) (prima facie case that registrant was entitled to a hardship exemption). Gearey, however, made no such showing. Moreover, in the cases referred to by appellant, the request for reclassification was made <em>6efore </em>the registrant had been sent an induction notice, so that the Board had the power to reopen without a showing that \u201cthere has been a change in the registrant\u2019s status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-21\">We also decline to reconsider our prior holding that Gearey was not authorized to appeal, pursuant to \u00a7 6(j), from the Board\u2019s adverse determination of his sincerity. See 368 F.2d at 153.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
