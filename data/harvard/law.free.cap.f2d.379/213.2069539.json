Plaintiff was indicted for prison breach and felonious assault. He was acquitted of the armed robbery. After four days of trial on the prison breach and assault charges, at which he was represented by the same counsel who had defended him on the armed robbery charge, he withdrew his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-22\">The defendants are: State Policeman Edward F. Singer and Westmoreland County officials, District Attorney Richard E. McCormick, Sheriff Alex W. Copeland, Warden William R. Hohn, Assistant County Detective Marshall V. Brajdich,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>John Marefka, Prison Guard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By amended order dated September 24, 1965, the district court dismissed the complaint against Copeland, Marefka and McCormick, and by order dated October 7, 1965, the district court dismissed the complaint against Hohn, Brajdich and Singer.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-23\">The complaint makes broad charges that all defendants inflicted upon the plaintiff \u201ca cruel and unusual punishment for some (approximately) 120 days while plaintiff was in defendants\u2019 custody awaiting trial\u201d because he would not sign a statement that he was involved in a prison break; that he pleaded guilty because he was in fear for his life as a result of cruel and \u201cinhuman\u201d punishment; that the defendants in charge of the prison put plaintiff on bread and water for some 30 days; that defendants repeatedly beat plaintiff and forced him to sign a statement;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that defendants denied plaintiff the right to see his attorney ; that defendants had false charges placed against plaintiff. Warden Hohn is specifically charged with placing plaintiff in solitary confinement on a restricted diet.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-24\">The Civil Rights Act protects a person who under color of state law is deprived of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>and laws by making those responsible liable in damages. This court has upheld a dismissal of a complaint by a state prisoner in a Civil Rights case where the allegations were broad and conclusory, and unsupported by factual allegations. \u201cAnd allegations that the defendants arbitrarily thwarted appellant\u2019s efforts to obtain or protect his legal rights through the courts are rightly said by the trial court to be \u2018 * * \u25a0* conclusory in nature\u2019. Factual documentation supporting such a conclusion would of course present a far different situation.\u201d United States ex rel. Hoge v. Bolsinger, 3 Cir. 1962, 311 F.2d 215. And in Pugliano v. Staziak, W.D.Pa.1964, 231 F.Supp. 347, aff\u2019d 3 Cir. 1965, 345 F.2d 797, a complaint in a Civil Rights ease was dismissed for failure to allege specific facts. Accord Richardson v. Rivers, 1964, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 333, 335 F.2d 996; Birnbaum v. Trussell, 2 Cir. 1965, 347 F.2d 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The complaint is insufficient because it is broad and conclusory.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Its insufficiency lies in its failure to state facts in support of its conclusions. The charges of beatings and cruel and unusual punishment are made against the defendants generally and not against any particular defendant. It is apparent that all defendants could not have inflicted the beatings at the times and places indicated. Marefka and McCormick were named in the caption, but not in the body of the complaint. Copeland was named in the caption, but mentioned in the body only once.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The allegation that the defendants deprived plaintiff of the right to counsel is general and conclusory and indicates merely an attempt by plaintiff to dictate when and where he should be permitted to confer with his counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\"> Plaintiff claims Warden Hohn put him in solitary confinement <em>after </em>plaintiff signed the statement and after he was given a preliminary hearing on the prison breach charge. This indicates disciplinary action. No facts are alleged in support of a claim of cruel and unusual punishment. Prison officials have wide discretion in matters of prison operation and discipline. \u201cDiscipline reasonably maintained in * * * [state] prisons is not under the supervisory direction of the federal courts. Kelly v. Dowd, 140 F.2d 81 (7 Cir. 1944). There is nothing in the circumstances related to indicate any reasonable basis for interference with the state authority, even though appellant\u2019s claim is under the guise of violation of his constitutional rights.\u201d Gurczynski v. Yeager, 3 Cir. 1964, 339 F.2d 884; Cole v. Smith, 8 Cir. 1965, 344 F.2d 721; United States ex rel. Atterbury v. Ragen, 7 Cir. 1956, 237 F.2d 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">The false charges against plaintiff are attributed to all defendants. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>nature of these charges is not disclosed. This allegation is broad and conclusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The orders of the district court will be affirmed. Since the order dismissing the complaint against Hohn, Brajdich and Singer is affirmed for reasons other than those given by the district court, this court does not preclude the district court, within its discretion, from permitting the plaintiff to file an amended complaint against Hohn, Brajdich and Singer. 3 Moore, Federal Practice para. 15.08 [4] (2d ed.).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-18\">. Misspelled as Benjdich in the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-19\">. Judge Keim of Westmoreland County was also a defendant. The action against him was dismissed in a separate order from which no appeal was taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b262-27\">. The statement was not used at the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\">. Appellant prepared his own complaint, which was received in the Clerk\u2019s office on May 11, 1965. On May 18, 1965, the court appointed experienced and able counsel to represent appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\">. \u201c9. On November 21, 1963, after the defendants forced plaintiff to sign a statement, they then took plaintiff out to a hearing before Magistrate Margaret S. Bossart. At said hearing the plaintiff asker <em>Sheriff Copeland </em>if his attorney was coming to the hearing. The Sheriff then asked defendants <em>William R. Sohn </em>and <em>Edward F. Singer </em>if they contacted plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and <em>Benjdich </em>stated: \u2018No they hadn\u2019t\u2019 they said they felt plaintiff would have time to see his attorney before going to Court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b263-10\">. .\u201c6. Plaintiff was denied the right to see his attorney by the said defendants on November 18, in front of the District Attorney\u2019s office. Plaintiff wanted to speak to his attorney, Mr. James Nardell, Esq., who was outside of the district attorney\u2019s office. Plaintiff stopped and asked to speak with his attorney and was refused by Penna. State Policeman <em>Edward F. Singer, </em>who statrted pulling plaintiff by his coat, plaintiff then asked his attorney to please come over to the Jail to see him. Attorney James Nardell, Esq., then said not to do anything until he speaks to me. Plaintiff then said \u2018OK.\u2019 Then Trooper Singer started pulling while County Detective <em>Marshall V. Benj-dich, </em>was still pulling on plaintiff, the attorney hollered out to me that he would check and see what this was all about and \u2018I\u2019ll be over to see you.\u2019 Plaintiff never did see an Attorney and was refused the right to call one until he would confess.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
