BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b867-19\">This case involves a little bit of nearly everything \u2014 a little bit of oceanography, a little bit of marine biology, a little bit of the tidelands oil controversy, a little bit of international law, a little bit of latter day Marco Polo exploration. But these do not command our resolution since the little bits are here controlled by the less exciting bigger, if not big, problem of intervention. The District Court declined to permit mandatory intervention as a matter of right or to allow intervention as permissive. (As is so often true, a ruling made to avoid delay, complications, or expense turns out to have generated more of its own.\\ With the main case being stayed by 'the District Court pending this appeal, it is pretty safe to assume that the case would long have been decided on its merits (or lack of them) had intervention of either kind been allowed. And this seems especially unfortunate since it is difficult jto. be-\\ lieve intervenor would have added much to the I litigation! All of this becomes the more ironic, if not unfortunate, since the in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>tervenor<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Government sparring over why intervention ought or ought not to have been allowed, each try to persuade us the one was bound to win, the other lose on the merits which each proceeds to argue as though the parties were before or in the court. Adding to the problem, or perhaps more accurately, aiding in the solution of it, are the mid-1966 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure including specifically those relating to intervention. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">What the jousting <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is all about is the ownership in, or right to control the use, development of and building on a number of coral reefs or islands comprising Pacific Reef, Ajax Reef, Long Reef, an unnamed reef and Triumph Reef which the intervenor has \u2022 called the \u201cAtlantis Group\u201d because of the name given them by Anderson, its predecessor in interest and the supposed discoverer. Discovery in the usual sense of finding a land area, continent or island heretofore unknown could hardly fit this case. For these reefs are, and have been for years, shown on Coast and Geodetic Charts <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, more important, they are scarcely 4% miles off Elliott Key and 10 miles off the Coast off the Florida Mainland. Although the depth of water washing over them at mean low water is likely one of the factual controversies having some possible significance, it seems undisputed that frequently and periodically the bodies of these reefs become very apparent especially in rough seas when the rock or the top surface of the rock becomes plainly visible in the troughs of the seas.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">Just how or in what manner these reefs were \u201cdiscovered\u201d is so far unrevealed. Some time in 1962 William T. Anderson discovered the reefs apparently by conceiving the idea of occupying them through the construction of facilities for fishing club, marina, skin diving club, a hotel, and, perhaps as the chief lure, a gambling casino. Anderson made some sort of claim to it and with facilities unavailable to the adventurous explorers of the long past, he gave public notice of this in the United States and in England by newspaper advertisements in late 1962 and early 1963. These \u201crights\u201d were acquired by Atlantis Development Corporation, Ltd., the proposed intervenor. Reflecting the desire' manifested now by the persistent efforts to intervene to have legal rights ascertained in a peaceful fashion through established tribunals and not by self-help or the initiation of physical activities which would precipitate counter moves, physical or legal, or both, Atlantis (and predecessors) patiently sought permission from all governmental agencies, state and federal \u2014 just short of the United Nations \u2014 but to no avail. The State of Florida through the Trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> responding to a formal request stated that the property is \u201coutside the Constitutional Boundaries of the State of Florida and therefore, not within the jurisdiction of the T.I.I.F.\u201d Undaunted, Atlantis turn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>ed to the Federal Government. To these entreaties the Department of Interior on September 14, 1962, replied: \u201cThe Department of the Interior has no jurisdiction over land that is outside the territorial limits of the United States. Questions concerning such land should be taken up with the Department of State.\u201d This was soon echoed by the answer of the Department of State on November 9, 1962, through the Assistant Legal Ad-visor. \u201cThe areas in question are outside of the jurisdiction of the United States and constitute a part of the high seas. The high seas are open to all nations and no state may validly subject any part of them to its sovereignty. * * *.\u201d Subsequently, Atlantis spent approximately $50,000 for surveys and the construction of four prefabricated buildings, three of which were destroyed by a hurricane in September 1963. Thereafter upon learning that the United States Corps of Engineers was asserting that permission was needed to erect certain structures on two of the reefs, Triumph and Long Reef, Atlantis commenced its long, but unrewarding, efforts either to convince the Corps of Engineers, the United States Attorney General, or both, that the island reefs were beyond the jurisdiction of United States control or to initiate litigation which would allow a judicial, peaceful resolution. The Engineers ultimately reaffirmed the earlier decision to require permits. In December 1964 on learning that the defendants in the main case had formally sought a permit from the Engineers, Atlantis notified the Government of its claim to ownership of the islands and the threatened unauthorized actions by the defendants. This precipitated further communications with the Department of Justice with Atlantis importuning, apparently successfully, the Government to initiate the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">It was against this background that the litigation commenced. The suit is brought by the United States against the main defendants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The complaint was in two counts seeking injunctive relief. In the first the Government asserted that Triumph and Long Reefs are part of the bed of the Atlantic Ocean included in the Outer Continental Shelf subject to the jurisdiction, control and power of disposition of the United States. The action of the defendants (note 5, supra) in the erection of caissons on the reefs, the dredging of material from the seabed, and the depositing of the dredged material within the caissons without authorization was charged as constituting a trespass on government property. In the second count the Government alleged that the defendants were engaged in the erection of an artificial island or fixed structure on the Outer Continental Shelf in the vicinity of the reefs without a permit from the Secretary of the Army in violation of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1333(f) and 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 403. Denying that the complaint stated a claim, F.R.Civ.P. 12 (b), the defendants besides interposing general denial asserted that the Secretary of the Army lacks jurisdiction to require a permit for construction on the Outer Continental Shelf and that the District Court lacks jurisdiction since the reefs and the defendants\u2019 actions thereon are outside the territorial limits of the United States. As thus framed, the issues in the main case are whether (1) the District Court has jurisdiction of subject matter, (2) the defendants are engaged in acts which constitute a trespass against government property, and (3) the defendants\u2019 construction activities without a permit violate 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1333(f) and 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 403.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">Atlantis seeking intervention by proposed answer and cross-claim against the defendants admitted the jurisdiction of the District Court. It asserted that the United States has no territorial jurisdiction, dominion or ownership in or over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>the reefs and cannot therefore maintain the action for an injunction, and that conversely Atlantis has title to the property by discovery and occupation. In the cross-claim, Atlantis charged the defendants as trespassers against it. Appropriate relief was sought by the prayer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">The District Court without opinion declared in the order that intervenor \u201cdoes not have such an interest in this cause as will justify its intervention, either as a matter of right or permissively.\u201d Leave was granted to appear amicus curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">We think without a doubt that under former F.R.Civ.P. 24(a), intervention as a matter of right was not compelled under (a) (2) <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The situation did not present one in which the inter-venor \u201cis or may be bound\u201d by a decree rendered in his absence in the sense articulated most recently in <em>Sam Fox </em><footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in terms of res judicata. Although not quite so clear, we also think it did not measure up to the notions loosely reflected in a case-by-case development under which, although res judicata was technically lacking, the decree is considered \u201cbinding\u201d since in a very practical sense it would have an immediate operative effect upon the intervenor.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In none of these cases was it suggested that if the only effect of the decree in intervenor\u2019s absence would be to raise the hurdle of stare decisis, this would amount to the absentee being bound as a practical matter.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-15\">This brings us squarely to the effect of the 1966 Amendments and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>new F.R.Civ.P. 24(a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Before examing its intrinsic meaning and purpose, the question arises, of course, whether in testing action taken in June 1965, amendments effective July 1, 1966, should be invoked. The order of the Supreme Court approving the Rules affords the guide.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As we did most recently with amended F.R.Civ.P. 23 on class actions, Alvarez v. Pan American Life Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 375 F.2d 992 [No. 22761, Mar. 27, 1967], and more significant, as did the Supreme Court in <em>El Paso </em>II,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we think it appropriate that to the maximum extent possible, the amended Rules should be given retroactive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Certainly that should be true here. For here no possible intrinsic prejudice can occur. Nothing has happened in this case since the filing of the pleadings. The further action has been stayed pending determination of whether intervention should be permitted in the cas\u00e9 yet to be tried. Except for the irrelevant circumstance that this apparently puts the trial Judge in error by subsequent events for a decision which presumably was correct at the time made, there is no reason why we ought not to judge this question in the light of today\u2019s standards. Certainly that is the general aim of the Rules that they \u201cshall be construed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action.\u201d F.R.Civ.P. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-19\">In assaying the new Rule, several things stand out. The first, as the Government acknowledges, is that this amounts to a legislative repeal of the rigid <em>Sam Fox </em>(note 9, supra)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> res <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>judicata rule. But more important, the revision was a coordinated one to tie more closely together the related sit\u00faa-tions of joinder, F.R.Civ.P. 19,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and class actions, F.R.Civ.P. 23.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9a\">As the Advisory Committee\u2019s notes re-fleet, there are competing interests at work in this areq. On the one hand, there is the private suitor\u2019s interests in having his own lawsuit subject to no one else\u2019s direction or meddling. On the other hand, however, is the great public interest, especially in these explosive days of ever-increasing dockets, of having a disposition at a single time of as much of the controversy to as many of the parties as is fairly possible consistent with due process.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Apuj\">In these three Rules the Advisory Corn-mittee, unsatisfied with the former Rules which too frequently defined application in terms of rigid legal concepts such as joint, common ownership, res judicata, or the like, as well as court ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>forts in applying them, deliberately set out on a more pragmatic course.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> For the purposes of our problem, this course is reflected in the almost, if not quite, uniform language concerning a party who claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest (see the italicized portions of Rules 19(a) (2) (i), 24 and 23(b) (1) (B), notes 16, 12, and 17, supra).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">Although this is question-begging and is therefore not a real test, this approach shows that the question of whether an intervention as a matter of right exists often turns on the unstated question of whether joinder of the intervenor was called for under new Rule 19. Were this the controlling inquiry, we find ample basis here to answer it in the .affirmative. Atlantis \u2014 having formally informed the Government in detail of its claim of ownership to the very reefs in suit, that the defendants were trespassing against it, and having successfully urged the Government to institute suit against the defendants \u2014 seems clearly to occupy the position of a party who ought to have been joined as a defendant under new Rule 19(a) (2) (i) [see the italicized portion of note 16, supra].</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">This interim conclusion is, of course, a rejection of the Government\u2019s approach made for this day, case, and time only that all new Rule 24(a) was to do was to abandon the rigidity of <em>Sam Fox </em>and codify the ameliorative exceptions (see note 10, supra) to escape the unfortunate consequences of a rule expressed in terms of the party being \u201cbound,\u201d i. e., res judicata. Any such narrow approach is to. deprecate the painstaking work of the Advisory Committee especially the deliberate efforts to dovetail F.R.Civ.P. 19, 24 and 23 together with two of them being radically rewritten.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\"> When approached in this light, we think that both from the terms of new Rule 24(a) and its adoption of 19(a) (2) (i) intervention of right is called for here. Of course F.R.Civ.P. 24(a) (2) requires both the existence of an interest which may be impaired as a practical matter and an absence of adequate representation of the intervenor\u2019s interest by existing parties. There can be no difficulty here about the lack of representation. On the basis of the pleadings, see Kozak v. Wells, 8 Cir., 1960, 278 F.2d 104, 109, 84 A.L.R.2d 1400; cf. Stadin v. Union Electric Co., 8 Cir., 1962, 309 F.2d 912, 917, cert. denied, 1963, 373 U.S. 915, 83 S.Ct. 1298, 10 L.Ed.2d 415, Atlantis is without a friend in this litigation. The Government turns on the defendants and takes the same view both administratively and in its brief here toward Atlantis. The defendants, on the other hand, are claiming ownership in and the right to develop the very islands claimed by Atlantis.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-14\">Nor can there be any doubt that Atlantis \u201cclaims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The object of the suit is to assert the sovereign\u2019s exclusive dominion and control over two out of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>group of islands publicly claimed by Atlantis. This identity with the very property at stake in the main case and with the particular transaction therein involved (the right to build structures with or without permission of the Corps of Engineers) is of exceptional importance. For 24(a) (2) is in the conjunctive requiring both an interest relating to the property or transaction and the practical harm if the party is absent. This sharply reduces the area in which stare decisis may, as we later discuss, supply the element of practical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">This brings us then to the question whether these papers reflect that in the absence of Atlantis, a disposition of the main suit may as a practical matter impair or impede its ability to protect that interest \u2014 its claim to ownership and the right to control, use and develop without hindrance from the Government, the Department of Defense, or other agencies. Certain things are clear. Foremost, of course, is the plain proposition that the judgment itself as between Government and defendants cannot have any direct, immediate effect upon the rights of Atlantis, not a party to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">But <em>in </em>a very <em>real and </em>practical sense is not the trial of this lawsuit the trial of Atlantis\u2019 suit as well? Quite apart from the contest of Atlantis\u2019 claim of sovereignty vis-a-vis the Government resulting from its \u201cdiscovery\u201d and occupation of the reefers,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>~~there~are~afri'6as't two basic substantial legal questions directly at issue, but not yet resolved in any Court at any time between the Government and the defendants which are inescapably present in the claim of Atlantis against the Government. One is whether these coral reefs built up by accretion of marine biology are \u201csubmerged lands\u201d under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1331 et seq.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The second basic question is whether, assuming both from the standpoint of geographical location and their nature they constitute \u201clands,\u201d does the sovereignty of the United States extend to them with respect to any purposes not included in or done for the protection of the \u201cexploring for, developing, removing, and transporting * * * \u201d natural resources therefrom, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1333(a) (1).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Another, closely related, is whether the authority of the Secretary of the Army <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>to prevent obstruction of navigation extended by \u00a7 1333(f) to \u201cartificial islands and fixed structures,\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> includes structures other than those \u201cerected thereon for the purpose of exploring for, developing, removing, and transporting\u201d mineral resources therefrom (\u00a7 1333(a) (1), note 23, infra).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The Government would avoid all of these problems by urging us to rule as a matter of law on the face of the moving papers that the intervenors could not possibly win on the trial of the intervention and consequently intervention should be denied. In support it asserts that the claim that the reefs are beyond the jurisdiction of the United States is self-defeating, and under the plain meaning of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the facts revealed from the Coast and Geodetic Chart<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> of which we must take judicial knowledge as proof of all facts shown.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">The first is at least contingently answered by \u00a7 1333(b) which invests jurisdiction in the United States District Court of the nearest adjacent state. As to the others, it is, of course, conceivable that there will be some instances in which the total lack of merit is so evident from the face of the moving papers that denial of the right of intervention rests upon a complete lack of a substantial claim. But it hardly comports with good administration, if not due process, to determine the merits of acclaim asserted in <em>a </em>pleading seeking an adjudication through an adversary hearing by denying access to the court at all. This seems especially important when dealing with interests in the outer Continental Shelf in view of the legislative history which reflected domestically the purpose of asserting a limited \u201chorizontal jurisdiction\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> extending only to the seabed and subsoil, the limited nature of which was formally recognized by the International Conven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>tion on the Continental Shelf.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> See United States v. State of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, 1960, 363 U.S. 1, 30-31, 80 S.Ct. 961, 979, 4 L.Ed.2d 1025, 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">If in its claim against the defendants in the main suit these questions are answered favorably to the Government\u2019s position, the claim of Atlantis for all practical purposes is worthless. /That statement assumes, of course, that such holding is either approved or made by this Court after an appeal to it and thereafter it is either affirmed, or not taken for review, on certiorari. It also assumes that in the subsequent separate trial of the claim of Atlantis against the Government<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the prior decision would be followed as a matter of stare decisis. Do these assumptions have a realistic basis ? Anyone familiar with the history of the Fifth Circuit could have but a single answer to that query. This Court, unlike some of our sister Circuit Courts who occasionally follow a different course, has long tried earnestly to follow the practice in which a decision announced by one panel of the Court is followed by all others until such time as it is reversed, either outright or by intervening decisions of the Supreme Court, or by the Court itself en banc.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> That means that if the defendants in the main action do not prevail upon these basic contentions which are part and parcel of the claim of Atlantis, the only way by which Atlantis can win is to secure a rehearing en banc with a successful overruling of the prior decision or, failing in either one or both of those efforts, a reversal of the earlier decision by the Supreme Court on certiorari. With the necessarily limited number of en banc hearings in this Circuit<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and with the small percentage of cases meriting certiorari,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> it is an understatement to characterize these prospects as formidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\"> That is but a way of saying in a very graphic way that the failure to allow Atlantis an opportunity to advance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>its own theories both of law and fact in the trial (and appeal) of the pending case will if the disposition is favorable to the Government \u201cas a practical matter impair or impede [its] ability to protect [its] interest.\u201d That is, to be sure, a determination by us that in the new language of 24(a) (2) stare decisis may now \u2014 unlike the former days under 24 (a) (2) \u2014 supply that practical disadvantage which warrants intervention of right. It bears repeating,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> however, that this holding does not presage one requiring intervention of right in every conceivable circumstance where under the operation of the Circuit\u2019s stare decisis practice? the formidable nature of an en banc rehearing or the successful grant of a writ of certiorari, an earlier decision might afford a substantial obstacle. We are dealing here with a conjunction of a claim to and interest in the very property and the very transaction which is the subject of the main action. When those coincide, the Court before whom the potential parties in the second suit must come must itself take the intellectually straight forward, realistic view that the first decision will in all likelihood be the second and the third and the last one. Even the possibility that the decision might be overturned by en banc ruling or reversal on certiorari does not overcome its practical effect, not just as an obstacle, but as the forerunner of the actual outcome. In the face of that, it is \u201cas a practical matter\u201d a certainty that an absent party seeking a right to enter the fray to advance his interest against all or some of the parties as to matters upon which he is for all practical purposes shortly to be foreclosed knows the disposition in his absence will \u201cimpair or impede his ability to protect that interest, * * F.R.Civ.P. 24(a) (2).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-5\">.

There is ample diversity jurisdiction as between Atlantis and the main defendants (see notes 1 and 5, supra), and lack of consent, sovereignty immunity, or related problems may wash out by the addition of new parties who are now amenable.
