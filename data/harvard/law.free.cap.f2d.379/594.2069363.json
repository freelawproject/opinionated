In further support of the rejection the following prior art reference is relied on:</p>\n<p id=\"az6-dedup-0\">Calingaert et al. 2,535,193 Dec. 26, 1950</p>\n<p id=\"AFg_\">Following appeal to the board and the filing of the examiner\u2019s Answer, Nalco Chemical Company, assignee of the application at bar, filed a terminal disclaimer under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 253, disclaiming the terminal part of the term of any patent granted on the application which would extend beyond November 7, 1978, the expiration date of Braithwaite patent 3,007,858. Thereafter the examiner filed a Supplemental Answer stating that he had considered our decisions in In re Robeson, 331 F.2d 610, 51 CCPA 1271, and In re Kaye, 332 F.2d 816, 51 CCPA 1465, both of which were decided after the date of the examiner\u2019s original Answer,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and holding the terminal disclaimer ineffective to avoid the double patenting rejection. He said the claims here on appeal were not of the type involved in <em>Robeson </em>and <em>Kaye </em>but were mere \u201ccolorable variations\u201d of the patent claims and cited in support of his rejection In re Siu, 222 F.2d 267, 42 CCPA 864. The board sustained the examiner\u2019s position. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-17\">The inventions of the patent and the application relate to the manufacture of organic lead compounds. Braithwaite\u2019s patent 3,007,858 relates primarily to the manufacture of tetraethyl lead, the familiar \u201cEthyl\u201d antiknock compound used in motor fuels, by a new electrolytic process. Neither the disclosure nor claims of the patent, however, are limited to making tetraethyl lead. The disclosure is that the invention is a process for making \u201corgano metallic compounds.\u201d The disclosure of the \u201corgano\u201d portion or radical (R in the formula, infra) includes \u201cmethyl, ethyl, propyl, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>isopropyl, butyl and higher homologues, phenyl, benzyl, and the like.\u201d The disclosure of the metallic component (M in the formula), while primarily lead, is broadened by the statement that \u201cthe metal M in equation C can be another metal which is capable of being electrolyzed in a Grignard reagent. Examples of such other metals are calcium, zinc, cadmium, manganese, mercury, lanthanum, thallium, arsenic, bismuth, tellurium and selenium.\u201d Equation \u201cC\u201d is the basic reaction formula for the electrolytic process of the invention and is:</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"119\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" width=\"1001\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Formula \u201cD\u201d is a simultaneous reaction, the combining of the free magnesium produced with added organic halide as hereinafter explained. A Grignard reagent, as is well known, has the basic formula RMgX, the first item in the above equation \u201cC\u201d and the last item in \u201cD\u201d, wherein R is. an organic radical, Mg is the metal magnesium, and X a halogen, such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine. It will be observed that if M is lead and X is chlorine, then the first-named product M(R)4 is tetraethyl lead, which is produced along with magnesium chloride MgX2 and some metallic m\u00e1g-nesium.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Some further background of the patented process is relevant to the legal problem under discussion. Prior to Braithwaite\u2019s patented invention it appears that tetraethyl and related lead compounds, which enjoy a market of some $270,000,000 or more a year, were made by purely chemical processes. The differentiating characteristic of Braith-waite\u2019s process is that it is an electrolytic process, having certain advantages we need not discuss. The gist of it is that a Grignard reagent is placed in solution in an organic solvent containing a pair of electrodes to which current is applied. At least the anode, in the case of making organo lead compounds, is made of lead and lead or a variety of other conductors can be used for the cathode. The lead anode is referred to as a \u201csacrificial anode\u201d as it is consumed, the metal combining with organic radicals from the Grignard reagent upon electrolysis. The Mg radicals which are simultaneously freed from said reagent would normally cause problems by depositing on the cathode or bridging the electrodes and, to eliminate these problems, one aspect of the inventiori is to add to the solution another organic halide, referred to by Braithwaite as \u201cextraneous\u201d halide to distinguish it from the organic halide needed to form Grignard reagent. This added organic halide combines with the free magnesium and reconverts it to a Grignard reagent as shown in formula \u201cD\u201d, avoiding magnesium deposit on the cathode and possible bridging of the electrodes. Example : ethyl magnesium chloride, which is a Grignard reagent, is dissolved in dibutyl ether of diethylene glycol. Ethyl chloride is added to the solution and current is passed between a steel cathode and a lead anode therein. Tetraethyl lead forms in the solution from the combining of the ethyl radicals from the Grignard reagent with the lead anode. Removal of the product from the solution is by conventional techniques forming no part of the invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">Note that in the above example <em>both </em>the Grignard reagent and the extraneous organic halide are <em>ethyl </em>compounds. This exemplifies the principal difference between what is said to be the invention of the patent and the invention of the appealed application. In the patent it is stated that the invention utilizes an extraneous organic halide \u201cthe organic radical of which <em>corresponds </em>to the organic radical of the Grignard reagent being used.\u201d (Emphasis ours.) For example, the organic radical in each is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>ethyl. All of the examples of the patent disclose the same pair of ethyl compounds. In the application, as hereinafter explained, the organic radicals <em>differ.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The difficulties of this case would appear to arise from two facts: not all of the patent claims are limited to using Grignard reagent and extraneous organic compound with <em>corresponding </em>organic radicals and the specification contains certain broadening statements. To illustrate the first fact: Claims 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the patent specify a process for making <em>tetraethyl </em>lead utilizing <em>ethyl </em>magnesium chloride and extraneous <em>ethyl </em>chloride. However, claims 1, 2, 7, and 8, all the remaining claims, are more <em>generic </em>with respect to the organic radical, using the term \u201calkyl\u201d (which describes ethyl broadly) or referring to the Grignard reagent broadly without specifying what the R of RMgX is. Patent claim 1 is typical of these broader claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">1. A process for preparing <em>alkyl </em>lead compounds which comprises electrolyzing, using a lead anode, a substantially anhydrous solution of <em>a Grignard reagent </em>in a substantially inert organic solvent for said Grig-nard reagent employing an electrolyzing current effective to cause said lead anode to dissolve in said solution of said Grignard reagent in said organic solvent, adding an excess of an <em>alkyl </em>halide over that required for the formation of the Grignard reagent, and recovering from the resultant product an <em>alkyl </em>lead compound consisting of <em>alkyl </em>radicals linked directly to metallic lead. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">From reading that claim it will be evident that both the Grignard reagent and the added alkyl halide could contain different, rather than corresponding, alkyl radicals, ethyl and methyl for example. Therefore, the claims so worded would be infringed by and so would cover a process, or dominate a patent on a process, using such a pair of <em>differing </em>\u201cal-kyl\u201d compounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">The second significant fact creating difficulties in this case is that such a claim construction would find support in certain broadening statements in the patent specification. We have already quoted above the statement about how the \u201corgano\u201d portion of the organo metallic compound (Grignard reagent) may be one of several kinds. Another significant statement is this: \u201cThe halogen portion of the added organic halide does not have to be the same as the halogen portion of the Grignard reagent.\u201d This follows the statement that \u201cIn accordance with the invention\u201d the organic radicals do correspond. The passage principally relied on by the Patent Office follows a description of several different Grignard reagents which may be used, in which the organic radicals are ethyl, isoproply, butyl, amyl, and phenyl, and states that mixtures of them may be used \u201cto produce other organic lead compounds * <em>* * </em>containing the phenyl radical or both the phenyl and ethyl radicals or both phenyl and other alkyl radicals * * This is about all the patent contains with respect to forming lead compounds having different organic radicals attached to the lead atoms. . In other words, it briefly indicates the possibility.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is no specific disclosure of how to make such compounds. Four of the eight claims are of such scope as to cover the process of making them, broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">The application on appeal is a continuation-in-part and adds a great amount of detail with respect to the making of lead compounds in which different organic lead compounds are attached to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>lead. We shall now describe briefly the nature of this disclosure. Basically the same electrolytic process for making \u201corganic lead\u201d compounds is described, the metal in this case being specified to be lead in the specification and in all claims. The invention is stated to be particularly for \u201cthe manufacture of organic lead compounds containing two different hydrocarbon radicals linked directly to metallic lead.\u201d The object of the invention is stated to be \u201ca new and improved process for preparing compounds in which different organic radicals are linked to metallic lead.\u201d The opening paragraph of the description reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">In accordance with the present invention a substantially anhydrous solution of a Grignard reagent in an organic solvent for the Grignard reagent is electrolyzed, using a lead anode, and adding extraneous organic halide to the electrolyte, <em>subject to the condition that the electrolyzing action is carried out in the presence of at least two different organic radicals which react with the lead. </em>[Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">There follows extensive, detailed description and sixteen specific examples of the making of such compounds which are not to be found in the patent disclosure and which, if a patent is granted, surely would contribute considerable knowledge to the art not to be gleaned from the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The appealed claims fall into two groups. Claims 1-10 are directed to process and claims 11-17 to an electrolyte. Claims 1 and 11 exemplify them (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">1. A process for preparing organic lead compounds containing <em>different </em>organic radicals linked to the same metallic lead atom which comprises electrolyzing, using a lead anode, a substantially anhydrous solution of at least one Grignard reagent in a substantially inert solvent for said Grig-nard reagent, and adding at least one extraneous organic halide to said solution, the organic radical of at least one said organic halide being <em>different </em>from the organic radical of at least one said Grignard reagent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">11. An electrolyte for making organic lead compounds comprising a substantially anhydrous solution of at least one Grignard reagent in a substantially inert solvent for said Grig-nard reagent and at least one extraneous organic halide, and the organic radical of at least one said Grignard reagent being <em>different </em>from the organic radical of at least one said organic halide, the total concentration of extraneous organic halides being within the range of 0.1 to 1.1 moles per mole of total Grignard reagent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">All of the claims either specify different organic radicals or different alkyl radicals, or name specifically organic radicals which are different.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">It may, therefore, be accurately stated that the appealed claims are to processes of a specific nature not <em>specifically </em>claimed in the patent, albeit some of the claims therein may be sufficiently broad in scope to provide patent coverage for what is here claimed, assuming the validity of such broad claims. Naturally, the appealed claims, in general being narrower than such broad claims in the patent, are less vulnerable to attacks on their validity than the broad patent claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">The claims to electrolyte compositions are, of course, to subject matter not claimed in the patent at all, though putting the electrolytes to use would result in processes which would be covered. They are nevertheless claims of quite different commercial significance to a possible vendor of electrolyte solutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">The question before us, then, is whether, by taking out the patent, Braith-waite has estopped himself from obtaining these added and narrower claims to specific aspects of his electrolytic process for making organic lead compounds and electrolytes used therein, on the basis of a greatly amplified disclosure of something merely foreshadowed by general observations in his patent disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>The question has been narrowed by the filing of the terminal disclaimer to inquiry into whether he can have these claims in a patent which would expire at the same time as his already issued patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The above-described situation can be summarized as follows. In the application which eventuated in his patent, Braithwaite described his basic process for making tetraethyl lead by an electrolytic process, characterizing his process more broadly, however, by reference to \u201corgano metallic\u201d compounds, \u201corganic halides\u201d added to the bath, and by suggesting certain instances in which the organic radicals attached to lead might be different. In each of his five patent examples his Grignard reagent and his extraneous organic halide are both ethyl compounds and the product is tetraethyl lead. He says at least twice that according to his invention the organic radicals of the two bath ingredients \u201ccorrespond.\u201d In four of his eight claims they do correspond and are, specifically, both ethyl. In the other four claims broader language is used in that the term \u201calkyl\u201d replaces \u201cethyl,\u201d whereby the claims become broad enough to read on a process in which the organic radicals do not correspond, though no claim says they do not or that they differ. While the parent application was still pending and eight months before the patent issued, the application at bar was filed containing a full and detailed description of processes not described in the original application, not having as their objects the production of tetraethyl lead but of different lead compounds wherein, instead of four ethyl or other <em>like </em>organic radicals attached to lead, <em>unlike </em>or <em>different </em>organic radicals are attached to the lead atoms, giving products such as those described as resulting from the new specific examples. In Example I a methyl Grignard reagent is used with extraneous tertiary butyl chloride and it is stated that \u201cThe lead product containing both methyl and tertiary butyl radicals linked directly to metallic lead is recovered by removal of the solvent.\u201d In Example IX is the statement, \u201cThe product is a mixture of organic lead compounds, including tetraethyl lead, tetramethyl lead, triethylmethyl lead, diethyldimethyl lead and trimethylethyl lead.\u201d Example XII says \u201cThe product is a mixture of organic lead compounds containing methyl, ethyl and tertiary butyl radicals linked to metallic lead.\u201d At the conclusion of the examples is a summary of the various ways of carrying out this invention \u201ceither by employing two or more organic halides with a single Grignard reagent or by employing two or more organic halides with a mixed Grignard reagent or by employing a single organic halide with a mixed Grignard reagent.\u201d It concludes, \u201cIn any case, products are obtained containing at least two different organic radicals linked to metallic lead.\u201d This invention, whether claimed as process o\u00ed-as electrolyte, is not described in the original application with the fullness contemplated by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. It is only hinted at in the broadening statements above referred to which would seem to have had the disclosure of the present application in mind as a future possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The rejection before us was thus stated by the examiner in his original Answer, to which he adhered and with which the board agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">It is the examiner\u2019s contention that the present claims do not define a separate and independent invention over the claims of the patent to Braithwaite. Claim 1 of the patent calls for electrolyzing an electrolyte comprising a Grignard reagent and an alkyl halide. As evident from the last paragraph of col. 4 et seq. (Rule 75(d)) the \u201cGrignard reagent\u201d and \u201calkyl halide\u201d of the patented claims may be mixed to produce a mixed organic lead compound. The mixed Grignard reagent and the corresponding organic halides would provide at least one different organic radical in the electrolyte.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">The examiner further contends that it would be within the skill of the art <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>to apply the teaching of Calingaert et al. to an electrolytic process as apparent from the patented claims. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">* X -X X * X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">Claims 11-18 [17] embrace the electrolytes that may be used in the process. While the argument above is directed to such claims, it is considered that the proportions of components or reactants claimed are not critical but merely preferred amounts. In any event it is within the skill of the art to determine optimum or operable proportions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Calingaert et al. disclose purely chemical (non-electrolytic) processes for making alkyl lead compounds including such as tetraethyl lead wherein all alkyl radicals attached to the lead are the same and compounds in which they are different. Little more need be said about it considering the use made of this reference by the Patent Office and the view we take of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The rejection is on the ground of \u201cdouble patenting,\u201d the Braithwaite patent is not prior art and Calingaert is. We regard this as an obviousness-type <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> double patenting situation, that is, the rejection is on the ground that the difference between what is claimed here and what is claimed in the patent to Braithwaite is only such a difference or modification as would be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the prior art. Appellant contests the Patent Office position on obviousness on the ground that electrolytic process behavior cannot be predicated on the basis of purely chemical reactions, citing Ex parte Wilson, 71 USPQ 276 (1946) in which the board said, with respect to a process for electroplating copper,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">It is not determinable before-hand in these electrolytic processes what may result from combining different reagents or active materials. The action may be regarded as more obscure than simple or pure chemical reactions, due to the presence of electrolytic effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">While this may be so, the starting point here is Braithwaite\u2019s patented process for making tetraethyl lead in which there are two \u201calkyl\u201d radical sources in his electrolytic bath, the Grignard and the extraneous reagents. Knowing that when they are both ethyl compounds they produce tetraethyl lead, we do not think we have sufficient factual basis for holding there was error in the examiner\u2019s view that Calingaert et al. would make it obvious that use as one of the alkyl compounds of a methyl compound, for example, would reasonably be expected to produce mixed organic radicals attached to the lead. We therefore proceed on the basis that the appealed claims are to processes and electrolytes not differing from what is claimed in the patent in an unobvious manner. In the absence of a terminal disclaimer, this would lead to an affirmance. In re Simmons, 312 F.2d 821, 50 CCPA 990. But, unlike <em>Simmons, </em>a terminal disclaimer was filed in this case, which brings us to a consideration of its effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">We dealt thoughtfully with this situation in <em>Robeson </em>and <em>Kaye, </em>supra. The examiner and the board refused to apply those cases on the ground it would amount to an \u201cextension\u201d of their holdings due to factual differences. The examiner felt the claims here differ only \u201ccolorably\u201d from the patent claims, with which we disagree; and the board relied on the fact that here the patent claims are \u201cgeneric\u201d and \u201cembrace\u201d what is here claimed, whereas in <em>Robeson </em>and <em>Kaye </em>the claims were mutually exclusive. We do not see what difference this makes. It is said by the solicitor that due to this generic aspect the claims of the patent and the application \u201coverlap.\u201d We do not see what difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>that makes either.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When a terminal disclaimer causes two patents to expire together, a situation is created which is tantamount for all practical purposes to having all the claims in one patent. It is common for a single patent to contain overlapping \u2014 i. e. generic and specific \u2014 claims. We have previously indicated that generic and specific claims, though by definition they \u201coverlap,\u201d may be considered as \u201cdistinct\u201d in the double patenting context. In re Sarett, 327 F.2d 1005, 51 CCPA 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Double patenting is a basis of rejection grounded in public policy and primarily intended to prevent prolongation of monopoly. The present case is an example. With the aid of a sketchy forecast in the patent specification of things to come, Braithwaite was able to obtain claims which cover what he is now claiming in this application. Assuming validity of the broad patent claims, he has been enjoying patent protection which would be continued beyond the expiration of his patent, by allowance of the appealed claims, on subject matter which does not differ from the subject matter of that patent in an unobvious, that is to say \u201cpatentable\u201d way. But by his terminal disclaimer he has foreclosed the possibility of such an extension of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Looking at the other side of the picture, it appears to us to have been to the advantage of the public \u2014 rather than to himself \u2014 that Braithwaite has followed the course above described. By taking out his patent and filing continuation-in-part applications (there is another in appeal No. 7801 decided concurrently), he accelerated the disclosure contained in his patent and hastened the date of expiration of his protection as therein afforded. By his terminal disclaimer he has hastened as well termination of protection from any claims he may get as a result of this appeal. Furthermore, he has added considerable disclosure of technology, over what is m his patent, by the additional matter contained in the continuation-in-part applications and supporting the claims presented therein. Assuming dominating claims in his patent, all he is getting from this application \u2014 and for only the remainder of the same term \u2014 are additional, more specific claims which would serve as a second line of defense if the dominating claims should prove to be vulnerable. To affirm in this case would principally serve to deprive the public of the knowledge contained in the added disclosures. We can perceive no sound reason for deciding this obviousness-type double patenting case differently from <em>Robeson </em>or <em>Kaye.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">The Patent Office has relied on In re Siu, supra. We have reexamined it and consider it distinguishable for reasons explained in <em>Robeson. </em>There is more than one invention involved here. The single mechanical fiber-producing process involved in <em>Siu </em>did not become a different process by merely naming the specific material, glass, operated on. Chemical processes involving different reagents and producing different products are different processes constituting <em>different </em>inventions even if they are not patentably distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-15\">WORLEY, C.

Appellants do not challenge the legality of that board. For the reasons expressed in my dissenting opinion in In re Wiechert, 370 F.2d 927, 54 CCPA 957, it is my view that the decision of such a board is a legal nullity. However, I accept here the majority\u2019s view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>on this issue in the <em>Wiechert </em>case, that is, the legality of the board is not an issue here. I therefore participate in the merits of this appeal and in so doing, agree with the conclusion of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Turning to the merits of this appeal, a few additional observations further support the conclusion reached by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The \u201claw\u201d of \u201cdouble patenting\u201d is indeed confusing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One factor frequently overlooked, present in <em>all </em>\u201cdouble patenting\u201d cases involving the <em>same </em>inventor, is that as between the subject matter in the claims sought to be patented and those teachings which are \u201cprior art\u201d under the 1952 Patent Act, the subject matter is useful, novel and <em>unobvious </em>in view of that \u201cprior art.\u201d In other words, the inventor has made a \u201cpatentable invention\u201d under the conditions specified in sections 102 and 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The term \u201cdouble patenting\u201d is not mentioned in the 1952 Patent Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is a judicially created doctrine which acts to deny applicants patents. Its very existence would appear to be contrary to statements in previous opinions of this court, as stated in In re Murray, 268 F.2d 226, 46 CCPA 905, for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">* * * an applicant is entitled to a patent unless one of the prohibitory provisions of the statutes, now the Patent Act of 1952, Title 35 U.S.C., applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">See also In re Ratti, 270 F.2d 810, 46 CCPA 976; In re Cavallito, 282 F.2d 363, 48 CCPA 720; and In re Gustafson, 331 F.2d 905, 51 CCPA 1358.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">To date this court has not discarded \u201cdouble patenting\u201d as a ground of rejection (as we did \u201caggregation\u201d in In re Gustafson, supra). Instead, our efforts have attempted to harmonize the various \u201cprinciples\u201d of the \u201claw\u201d of \u201cdouble patenting\u201d with the mandatory provision of the Patent Act that \u201cA person <em>shall </em>be entitled to a patent unless\u201d a stated ground of rejection applies. Thus we have held that section 101 contains the prohibition that an applicant is only entitled to <em>\u201ca </em>patent\u201d for <em>an </em>invention. Here I refer to the \u201csame invention\u201d type of \u201cdouble patenting\u201d: See In re Robeson, 331 F.2d 610, 51 CCPA 1271. By so proceeding we have endeavored to accommodate the various \u201ctypes\u201d of \u201cdouble patenting\u201d <em>situations </em>that have appeared before us <em>and </em>give effect to the provisions of the Patent Act. See In re Bowers, 359 F.2d 886, 53 CCPA 1590; In re Robeson, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-14\">While we have been able to identify the \u201csame invention\u201d type \u201cdouble patenting\u201d with a statutory provision, such is not the case with \u201cobviousness\u201d type \u201cdouble patenting.\u201d It stands as a judicially created doctrine and certainly not bottomed on section 103. See In re Zickendraht, 319 F.2d 225, 229, 50 CCPA 1529, concurring opinion, Rich, J. The patent is simply not \u201cprior art\u201d under the terms of section 103. <em>If </em>section 103 were applicable then obviously there would be no need for this type of \u201cdouble patenting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-15\">It seems to me that \u201cobviousness\u201d type \u201cdouble patenting\u201d rests upon a judicially recognized policy that an inventor may not claim subject matter that is obvious from that previously claimed <em>because </em>of the possibility of an \u201cextension of the monopoly\u201d (patent protection) concerning the previously claimed subject matter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under section 154, the inventor is entitled only to exclude others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>from making, using, or selling the invention throughout the United States for the term of seventeen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Recognizing that the doctrine of \u201cdouble patenting\u201d is judicially created and, further, that objections based on \u201cdouble patenting\u201d may be \u201cunavoidable,\u201d In re Robeson, supra, it seems to me that the \u201cobviousness\u201d type should be applied to the ends of preventing any \u201cextension of monopoly\u201d <em>and </em>doing justice to applicants. The substantive principles of sections 101 and 154, of course, may not be compromised. The remedial provisions of sections 121 and 253, however, do not represent a compromise. Thus whether \u201cobviousness\u201d type \u201cdouble patenting\u201d does in fact exist becomes nothing more than a needless mental exercise in cases where, as here, there can be no \u201cextension of monopoly\u201d because of the remedial provisions of the Patent .Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Accordingly, our present view is that a terminal disclaimer will not overcome a rejection based on the objection that the applicant seeks to claim the \u201csame invention\u201d \u2014 here meaning same subject matter- \u2014 and it will overcome a rejection based on the objection that the applicant seeks to claim a \u201cdifferent invention\u201d \u2014 here meaning \u201cdifferent subject matter\u201d \u2014 which is \u201cobvious\u201d in view of the earlier claimed subject matter either considered <em>alone </em>or in <em>combination </em>with \u201cprior art.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">It may indeed be confusing to some to learn that a terminal disclaimer removes any objection to the \u201cobviousness\u201d of the invention in \u201cdouble patenting\u201d situations but will not remove an objection to \u201cobviousness\u201d under section 103. Cf. Hays v. Brenner, 123 U.S.App.D.C. 96, 357 F.2d 287 (1966). Commissioner Brenner has stated, in an address delivered to the Patent Professional Staff of the Patent Office on March 30, 1966 (825 O.G. 825):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-12\">* * * if the examiner is satisfied that the claimed invention is clearly obvious in view of the teachings of the prior art, to a person having ordinary skill in the pertinent art, then a patent should not be granted even if affidavits, terminal disclaimers, and the like are presented by the applicant, <em>since such papers cannot change what is obvious so it may become unobvious and therefore a patentable invention. </em>[Emphasis added.] 825 O.G. at 827.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-14\">Referring only to the Commissioner\u2019s comments as to terminal disclaimers, a case of \u201cobviousness\u201d type \u201cdouble patenting\u201d <em>is based on teachings which cannot be considered under section 108. </em>See In re Bowers, 359 F.2d 891, fn. 7. That which \u2022 is \u201cobvious\u201d in a \u201cdouble patenting\u201d sense may <em>not </em>be obvious under the terms of section 103 simply because <em>less </em>information is available under section 103 when the patent is <em>not </em>a proper reference and may not be considered.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-15\">The plain fact here is that the patent relied on for the rejection is <em>not </em>\u201cprior art\u201d under the Patent Act and resort to section 103 is prohibited under the present view of the law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus the claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>invention is <em>not obvious </em>in view of the \u201cprior art,\u201d section 103. It seems to me that to refuse to give effect to a terminal disclaimer to overcome a \u201cdouble patenting\u201d rejection based on \u201cobviousness\u201d is <em>contrary </em>to the 1952 Patent Act. Congress has provided for terminal disclaimers and we must act accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">In the present case the Patent Office argues that the \u201cdouble patenting\u201d situation before us involves \u201coverlapping\u201d claims and the terminal disclaimer fails to \u201covercome the double patenting rejection.\u201d I fail to see, and the Patent Office has not explained, how this alleged fact somehow operates to prevent the consequences inuring from the filing of a terminal disclaimer, section 253. Clearly the terminal disclaimer eliminates the basis for the objection, i. e., \u201cextension of monopoly.\u201d As appellant here claims different subject matter than is claimed in his prior patent there can be no objection based on section 101. In re Walles, supra. Because of the terminal disclaimer, there can be no \u201cextension of monopoly.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The Patent Office has failed to state a single reason why the terminal disclaimer is ineffective other than that the claims \u201coverlap.\u201d While In re Siu, 222 F.2d 267, 42 CCPA 864, is relied on by the Patent Office as authority for this position, I find nothing in that decision <em>or </em>opinion which is contrary to the result reached here. Moreover <em>Siu </em>is not a viable precedent in the \u201claw\u201d of \u201cdouble patenting\u201d as in my view the subject matter relied on in the Ladisch patent was \u201cprior art\u201d under sections 102(e), 103, and 120. A review of the record in that case shows that there were <em>different inventors </em>(Ladisch and Siu) and <em>no common assignee </em>(the U. S. Government had a royalty free license in both cases) when Siu\u2019s application was rejected by the examiner.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The examiner made no \u201cdouble patenting\u201d rejection. Instead, he relied on Siu\u2019s admission that he <em>derived </em>the process from Ladisch and <em>subsequently </em>applied it to molten glass. In the examiner\u2019s view, Ladisch\u2019s teachings were \u201cprior art\u201d as to Siu.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See In re LoPresti, 333 F.2d 932, 52 CCPA 755. The first reference to \u201cdouble patenting\u201d by the Patent Office was in the board\u2019s opinion. The opinion of this court expressly points out \u201cthe Ladisch patent, which issued on an earlier filed application [sic], may be <em>properly cited as a </em>reference<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> against appellant\u2019s instant application,\u201d 222 F.2d at 270, 42 CCPA at 868. [Emphasis added.] In short, I do not be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>lieve either that a \u201cdouble patenting\u201d rejection was made or could have been made in <em>Siu </em>(no common assignee); or that this court there affirmed a \u201cdouble patenting\u201d rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The problem in <em>Siu </em>appears to stem from appellant\u2019s reliance on a terminal disclaimer. Appellant argued before the Office that the following \u201cnovel issue\u201d should be decided, <em>after </em>the board appeared to reject the claims on the basis of \u201cdouble patenting\u201d:<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">* * * whether a patent [Ladisch] under <em>common </em>ownership,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which was <em>copending </em>with a pending application filed for a different species [glass] in the name of a <em>different member </em>[Siu] of the same research team [Ladisch &amp; Siu] and containing claims overlapping with the patent [dominated by, within the scope of the patent claims], can be <em>removed as a reference </em>against the pending application <em>by means of a timely disclaimer </em>in the pending application, under the last provision of section 253 of the Patent Act of 1952, of that terminal portion of the term of the patent to be granted on the still pending application which would extend beyond the expiration date of the patent already granted; i. e., where the grant of patent on the application for the second species would NOT <em>extend the monopoly </em>conferred on the common owner by the generic claims of the patent already issued * * *. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Before this court Siu argued there was no \u201cdouble patenting\u201d rejection. Apparently he also wondered whether the recently enacted provision as to terminal disclaimer could be used to <em>remove prior art subject matter </em>thus circumventing sections 102(e), 103 and 120. With this background information, the statement that Ladisch was <em>properly cited as a reference, </em>In re LoPresti, in the opinion in <em>Siu </em>takes on its true importance. What was said in <em>Bowers, </em>supra, that a terminal disclaimer cannot remove subject matter in the prior art, was decided some 11 years earlier in <em>Siu. </em>Furthermore, the examiner correctly applied section 102(e) in <em>not </em>relying on Ladisch\u2019s description of <em>Siu\u2019s </em>invention. See In re Land, supra. Remarks in the <em>Siu </em>opinion as to the effect of a terminal disclaimer should be considered in relation to the only issue properly before the court, arising under sections 102(e), 103, and 120. Any statements in <em>Siu </em>relating to \u201cdouble patenting\u201d and terminal disclaimers inconsistent with <em>Kaye </em>and <em>Robeson </em>have long been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">The issue presented by Siu, quoted supra, and his arguments were recently presented in In re Fong, PA 7786, decided concurrently herewith. The problems faced by common assignees arising from the fact that groups rather than individuals often make inventions are for Congress. See In re Fong.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-14\">I therefore would reverse the decision of the Patent Office for the reason that its rejection is not based on a statutory ground of rejection <em>and </em>its action is contrary to section 253. See In re Robeson, 331 F.2d at 614, 615, fns. 4 and 10, 51 CCPA at 1274, 1276. Manifestly, when sections 101 and 103 are satisfied, a judicially created doctrine should not be permitted to operate to negate the remedial provisions of section 253.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-10\">.

Separate individual applications were then filed, each of which identified and described the other\u2019s invention and presented claims only to their respective contributions. See In re Land, 368 F.2d 872 supra fn. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b652-14\">. Sections 102(e), 103 and 120. The order of the respective applications is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b652-15\">1. 4-26-49, No. 89,776 (L &amp; S jointly)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-16\">2. 8-15-49, No. 110,371 (L)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-17\">3. 8-15-49, No. 110,372 (L).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-18\">4. 8-16-49, No. 110,663 (S) (\u201cParent\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-19\">5. 10-19-49, No. 122,343 (L)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-20\">6. 8-21-50, No. 180,686 (S) (CIP of 4, application on appeal)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-21\">7. 10-23-50, No. 191,672 (L) (CIP of 1, 2, 3, and 5, Ladisch patent).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-23\">See discussion supra fn. 6, and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b653-9\">. See infra fn. 12. The apparent confusion of the board probably stems from its erroneous impression that the examiner rejected Siu\u2019s <em>claims </em>over the subject matter <em>claimed </em>in Ladisch. See In re Ornitz, supra, especially appellant\u2019s arguments therein. Compare the arguments of appellants in <em>Hays </em>with those made in <em>Siu.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b653-10\">. Apparently Siu was willing to assume, for purposes of argument, that the royalty-free license in the government was tantamount to \u201ccommon ownership.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b653-16\">. It seems to me that the examiner, when he believes that an \u201cobviousness\u201d type situation is present, should inform the applicant that the claims will not be allowed in the absence of a terminal disclaimer because to do so would result in an extension of patent protection contrary to section 154.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
