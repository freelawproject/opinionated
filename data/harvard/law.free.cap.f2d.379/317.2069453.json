The subcontractor performed these operations on the demand of the government inspector, who refused to approve the original work.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-16\"> We have studied the language of the statute, the legislative history of its 1959 amendment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Particularly in view of the liberal construction which must be given the Miller Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we are convinced that the \u201clast labor or materials\u201d language is broad enough to include work performed upon the demand of the government to correct defects in the work as originally completed. There is no contention that this work was a sham to extend the period of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-17\">We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-10\">. See 1959 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1995-2000. The primary purpose of the 1959 amendment was to relieve the Comptroller General of the administrative burden of fixing a \u201cdate of final settlement\u201d. The Comptroller General, however, in his letter to Congress proposing the amendment noted that a subsidiary purpose of the amendment was to extend the Act\u2019s protection to persons correcting defects after the final settlement of the contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-12\">\u201cIt sometimes happens, also, that a supplier will be called upon to furnish labor or materials after \u2018final settlement,\u2019 or even after the limitation has run, in connection with the correction of deficiencies after substantial completion and acceptance of the contract work and \u2018final settlement\u2019 (based upon withholding the value of the deficiencies). Under the proposed amendment, such suppliers will not have lost most or all of the protection intended by the Miller Act but will receive full protection for 1 year after furnishing labor or material.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b366-19\">.
