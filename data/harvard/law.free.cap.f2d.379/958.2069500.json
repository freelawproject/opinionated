L. Smith, and to cease and desist from coer-cively interrogating employees concerning their union activities and from threatening employees with reprisal for union activity or support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-22\">Until recently, none of Winn-Dixie\u2019s grocery supermarket employees (some 18,000 of them) had ever been represented by a labor union.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Company\u2019s opposition to union organization is a matter of record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board and the Examiner found that the Company was always \u201cconstantly on the alert to detect signs of union activity by its employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-23\">As early as autumn 1962, and again in June 1964, management personnel called Smith to the office to question him. A company vice-president was found to have said to him, \u201cWhat the hell is this I hear about you signing up drivers?\u201d Later a delivery superintendent accused Smith of being \u201cdissatified\u201d with his job and of signing up drivers. Upon Smith\u2019s denial (found to have been true at the time made), the superintendent remarked, \u201c[i]t was just grapevine stuff,\u201d and said to forget about it. Thereafter, Smith <em>did </em>sign up about twenty of the eighty-nine drivers. His union activity lasted about six weeks. On August 14, 1964, he was discharged and told by the superintendent that the time had come for his departure. The Company urges that violation of various rules and general unsatisfactory attitude caused the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-24\">Although the Trial Examiner noted that the Company\u2019s opposition to unionization of its employees is \u201cunconcealed,\u201d he found that Smith was \u201cspontaneously\u201d discharged by the superintendent because of what he termed a trivial and petty episode involving Smith\u2019s failure to remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>a few banana blankets from his truck. The Trial Examiner concluded that since a spate of prior reprimands were all issued before the union campaign began they could not be connected with Smith\u2019s union activities and served to justify the \u201cspontaneous\u201d discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">The Board accepted the subsidiary factual findings of the Trial Examiner, but rejected this reasoning, noting that Smith was a ten-year employee with a record of no formal reprimands until a few months before the election. The Board concluded that the most reasonable inference to be drawn from the record as a whole was that Smith was unlawfully discharged because of his union activities and that the reasons asserted by respondent were fictitious. The Board was influenced to reject the Examiner\u2019s inference by the latter\u2019s finding that the Company had attempted to bolster the discharge with fictitious reasons and had put into Smith\u2019s file written reprimand slips which had never been shown him. A careful analysis of the evidence is contained in the Board\u2019s decision and order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">During the organization campaign, in early August 1964, assistant delivery superintendent Miller queried driver William Green about the Union. When Green denied he had been contacted by anyone about the Union, Miller observed, \u201cI don\u2019t guess they will knowing the way that you feel about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">Against the background of this Company\u2019s hostility to unionization, we think the inquiries made to Green by Miller cross the line from permissible inquiry to coercive interrogation forbidden by the Act. See Daniel Construction Co. v. NLRB, 341 F.2d 805, 812 (4th Cir. 1965); NLRB v. Overnite Transportation Co., 308 F.2d 279, 281 (4th Cir. 1962); NLRB v. Lester Brothers, Inc., 301 F.2d 62, 65-66 (4th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">The Company urges that the Board deviated from established principles of law in rejecting the Trial Examiner\u2019s finding that Smith was discharged for valid reasons unconnected-with his union activities or sentiments. We think not. \u201cThe fact that the Trial Examiner may have reached a different conclusion on some of the questions involved, while a matter for our consideration along with other matters in the record, does not mean that the findings of the Board on these questions are not to be upheld if supported by substantial evidence on the whole record.\u201d NLRB v. Thomason Plywood Corp., 222 F.2d 364, 365 (4th Cir. 1955). The Supreme Court has specifically rejected the contention that the findings of an examiner of an administrative agency \u201cbased on demeanor of a witness are not to be overruled by a Board without a \u2018very substantial preponderance in the testimony * * *.\u2019 \u201d FCC v. Allentown Broadcasting Corp., 349 U.S. 358, 364, 75 S.Ct. 855, 859, 99 L.Ed. 1147 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\"> In Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 492, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951), the Supreme Court said, with reference to the relationship between the Labor Board and its Trial Examiners: \u201cThe responsibility for decision thus placed on the Board is wholly inconsistent with the notion that it has power to reverse an examiner\u2019s findings only when they are \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019.\u201d Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not apply to the review by administrative agencies of the findings of examiners.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">Enforcement ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-18\">.
