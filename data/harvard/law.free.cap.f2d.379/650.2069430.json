The Phalen Park State Bank of St. Paul, Minnesota, instituted the action joining as defendants Phillip Kitzer, Sr. and Phillip Kitzer, Jr., citizens of the State of Illinois, and Homer A. Bonhiver, receiver for American Allied Insurance Company, a citizen of the State of Minnesota, and Allied Realty of St. Paul, Inc., also a citizen of Minnesota. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2361, nationwide service of process is authorized and service was made on the Illinois citizens pursuant thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>The action concerns conflicting claims between two groups of claimants of diverse citizenship to ownership of 100 shares of the capital stock of the bank.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the commencement of the action on October 25, 1965, the two certificates were in the possession of the Kitzers and were not deposited into the registry of the court by the bank. The bank alleged in its complaint that it was a mere stakeholder claiming no interest in the ownership of the stock, but because of conflicting claims as to the ownership of stock it was subjected to a multiplicity of suits. Contemporaneously with the filing of the complaint the bank filed a surety bond in the amount of $2,000.-00. approved by the court. The Kitzers pursuant to a court order deposited the certificates endorsed in blank into the registry of the court. The trial court held that jurisdictional requirements were satisfied; that the Kitzers owned no beneficial right, title or interest in the stock; that the certificates be delivered to the bank and that the bank transfer the shares on its records and issue new certificates to the owners of the stock. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Appellants bring this appeal and contend, as they did below, that the bank\u2019s action should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter under provisions of \u00a7 1335. Appellants contend that where there are rival claimants to a specific property it is a prerequisite to jurisdiction under the interpleader statute that a plaintiff deposit the property into the registry of the court. Appellants urge the bank did not and could not meet this requirement and therefore the court was without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">The requirement that the stakeholder deposit money or property or the giving of a bond in lieu thereof is a condition precedent to obtaining interpleader jurisdiction. 3 Moore, Federal Practice \u00a7 22.10 at 3077-86 (2d ed. 1966) ; Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., 9 Cir. 1939, 99 F.2d 651, aff\u2019d 308 U.S. 66, 72, 60 S.Ct. 44, 84 L.Ed. 85. Where property alone is involved the courts have liberally construed the interpleader statute <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to allow the deposit of only the specific property in plaintiff\u2019s possession with the condition that the property deposited be of the value of $500.00 or more in compliance with the statute. See Austin v. Texas-Ohio Gas Co., 5 Cir., 218 F.2d 739, 744-745. However, many situations may exist where it becomes impracticable for a stakeholder to deposit the specific res in controversy into the registry of the court. Cf. Edner v. Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co., 3 Cir., 138 F.2d 327. It is because of this that the Interpleader Act was amended to allow the use of a surety bond. The Senate Judiciary Report specifically reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-14\">\u201cThe amended bill allows the stakeholder, as an alternative to a deposit, to file a surety bond approved by the court. Although the disputed subject matter will ordinarily be deposited in court, situations sometimes arise where the rigid requirement of a deposit would prevent just relief.\u201d Sen. Rep.No. 558, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>The act itself reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-4\">\u201c * * * action of interpleader or in the nature of interpleader filed by any * * * corporation * * having * * * custody or possession * * * property of the value of $500 or more, or having issued a * * * certificate<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> * * * or other instrument of value * * * of $500 or more, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">\u201c(1) Two or more adverse claimants, of diverse citizenship * * * are claiming or may claim to be entitled to such * * * property or to any one or more of the benefits arising by virtue of any * * * certificate <em>* </em>* * and if (2)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-10\">(2) the plaintiff has deposited such money or property or has paid the amount of or the loan or other value of such instrument or the amount due under such obligation into the registry of the court, there to abide the judgment of the court, <em>or </em>has given bond payable to the clerk of the court in such amount and with such surety as the court or judge may deem proper, conditioned upon the compliance by the plaintiff with the future order or judgment of the court with respect to the subject matter of the controversy.\u201d (Emphasis ours) Tit. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1335.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">If the bank is not a stakeholder of \u201cproperty\u201d under the Act it does not qualify to utilize the interpleader action to resolve the present controversy by the deposit of a bond in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">The determination of what \u201cproperty\u201d is to be deposited under Tit. 28 \u00a7 1335 depends upon the person who invokes interpleader and what he asserts to be the subject matter of the controversy. Here the complaint alleges the dispute is over the \u201cownership\u201d of the stock of the corporation. It might be argued that since the certificate of stock is in the possession of the appellant in Illinois, the Bank cannot qualify as a stakeholder to bring an interpleader suit. But such an assumption misreads the nature of the controversy. As was stated in First Nat. Bank of Jersey City v. Fleming, D.N.J., 10 F.R.D. 159 at 160, \u201c[t]he <em>property </em>here in litigation is not the certificate of stock but the <em>shares of stock </em>of which the certificate is merely evidence.\u201d This statement does not eliminate the deposit of a stock certificate as being sufficient for jurisdictional purposes under similar circumstances. See Wertheimer v. Bank of Nova Scotia, S.D.N.Y., 140 F.Supp. 950. However, at the same time where the corporation has \u201ccustody or possession\u201d of the shares of stock as distinguished from the certificate, it should not eliminate the corporation as a stakeholder under the act. Even though the certificate of stock is treated as property for some purposes it still has no intrinsic value itself separate from the share of stock it represents. See 18 C.J.S. Corporations \u00a7 258, p. 723; 11 Fletcher, Cycl., Corporations, \u00a7\u00a7 5092, 5096, 5097.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-15\">As the Supreme Court said in Pacific Nat. Bank v. Eaton, 141 U.S. 227 at 234, 11 S.Ct. 984 at 985, 35 L.Ed. 702:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-16\">\u201cA Certificate is authentic evidence of title to stock; but it is not the stock itself, nor is it necessary to the existence of the stock. It certifies to a fact which exists independently of itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-17\">Such a dichotomy is not strange to the law. Even in Minnesota after the passage of the Uniform Stock Transfer Act, e. g., Minn.Stat.Annot. c. 302, <em>the shares of stock </em>of the corporation as distinguished from the certificates were subject to garnishment at the situs of the corporation. In Wackerbarth v. Weisman, 207 Minn. 507, 292 N.W. 214, the Minnesota Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-18\">\u201cIt has been aptly stated that \u2018a certificate of stock in a corporation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>not the stock itself. It is the mere evidence of the holder\u2019s ownership of the stock and of his rights as a stockholder to the extent specified therein, just as a promissory note is merely the evidence of the debt * * *.\u2019 11 Fletcher, Cyc.Corp. (Perm.ed.) \u00a7 5092, p. 55. Accord Galbraith v. McDonald, 123 Minn. 208, 143 N.W. 353, L.R.A.1915A, 420, Ann.Cas. 1915A, 464. Recently we have affirmed this proposition in Marin v. Olson, 181 Minn. 327, 232 N.W. 523, wherein it was said: \u2018Such a certificate is only evidence of title to stock.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">\u201cLogically, from the foregoing, it seems that the following proposition is a necessary conclusion: \u2018For the purpose of * * * garnishment the stock is generally regarded as being in the possession of the corporation in which the shares are held although the certificates are in the possession of the stockholder * * *. And it is also generally held that the levy must be upon the shares of stock, and cannot be made by seizing the stock certificates, since they are not the stock itself, but are merely evidences of it.\u2019 11 Fletcher, Cyc.Corp. (Perm.ed.) \u00a7 5109, p. 128, and cases cited.\u201d 292 N. W. at 216.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">And such a distinction is not to be confused with the actual capital and property of the corporation itself. 11 Fletcher, Cycl., Corporations \u00a7 5100.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">Discussion of the corporate shares as \u201cproperty\u201d becomes even more significant when one considers Tit. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1655.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Corporate shares of stock as distinguished from the certificate, have long been considered \u201cproperty\u201d by the Supreme Court of the United States for jurisdictional purposes in an action to clear title of stock under \u00a7 1655.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">In Jellenik v. Huron Copper Mining Co., 177 U.S. 1, at 13, 20 S.Ct. 559, at 563, 44 L.Ed. 647, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-14\">\u201c * * * Whether the stock is in Michigan so as to authorize that state to subject it to taxation as against individual shareholders domiciled in another state is a question not presented in this case, and we express no opinion upon it. But we are of opinion that it is within Michigan for the purposes of a suit brought there against the company \u2014 such shareholders being made parties to the suit \u2014to determine whether the stock is rightfully held by them. The certificates are only evidence of the ownership of the shares, and the interest represented by the shares is held by the company for the benefit of the true owner. As the habitation or domicil of the company is and must be in the state that created it, <em>the property represented by its certificates of stock may be deemed to be held by the company within the state whose creature it is, </em>whenever it is sought by suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>to determine who is its real owner. * * * \u201d (Emphasis ours).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">This was approved by this court in Thompson v. Terminal Shares, 8 Cir., 89 F.2d 652. See also 3 Moore, Federal Practice \u00a7 22.04(2). Cf. Standard Oil Co. v. New Jersey, 341 U.S. 428, 71 S.Ct. 822, 95 L.Ed. 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">And such an interpretation has been made notwithstanding the existence of the Uniform Stock Transfer Act in the state. See discussion in McQuillen v. Nat\u2019l Cash Register Co., 13 F.Supp. 53, aff\u2019d on rehearing 27 F.Supp. 639, aff\u2019d 4 Cir., 112 F.2d 877. Cf. Standard Oil Co. v. New Jersey, 341 U.S. 428 at 437-441, 71 S.Ct. 822, n. 15 (escheat statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Under the interpleader statute \u201cin personam\u201d jurisdiction is attained while under \u00a7 1655 the action is \u201cin rem.\u201d But this distinction does not affect the true definitive nature of corporate shares of stock as fungible property. It should be more favorable for the present dispute to be decided under \u00a7 1335 rather than \u00a7 1655. The corporation and appellants are parties to the interpleader action, whereas under \u00a7 1655 the receiver could theoretically proceed only against the \u201cres\u201d itself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">All the elements of statutory interpleader exist in the present case. The corporation is a stakeholder within the plain language of the statute, and, under the approval of the district court, has properly deposited a bond to secure its performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-6\">. The receiver of the American Allied Insurance Co. and Allied Realty, Inc. claim the certificates were issued to the Kitzers to qualify them as bank directors under Minn.Stat.Ann. 48 \u00a7 48.06 (Supp.1966). The Kitzers later resigned from the Board of Directors and Bonhiver, as receiver, and Allied Realty now claim to be the beneficial owners of the 100 shares of stock on the theory that the purported transfers to the Kitzers were made without consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b699-8\">. As Professor Moore states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">\u201cBecause of its undoubted utility, in-terpleader provisions have been held in countless federal decisions to be remedial and thus properly to be liberally construed so as best to effectuate their purposes.\u201d 3 Moore, Federal Practice, \u00a7 22.02 at 3005.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-17\">See also State Farm Casualty Co. v. Tashire, 386 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1199, 18 L.Ed.2d 270 where the Supreme Court in speaking of statutory interpleader says it represents \u201c * * * the legislative purpose <em>broadly </em>to remedy the problems posed by multiple claimants to a single fund, * * * \u201d decided April 10, 1967.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b700-13\">.

Although the disputed subject matter will ordinarily be deposited in court, situations sometimes arise where the rigid requirement of a deposit would prevent just relief. For example, it is obvious that a deposit is impracticable when one claimant to the benefits of life insurance demands one disposition (or option) under the policy and the other claimant demands a very different disposition (or option).\u201d S.Rep.No. 558, at 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Austin v. Texas-Ohio Gas Co., 218 F.2d 739 (5th Cir. 1955), which also involved a dispute as to ownership of certain shares of stock, demonstrates to my satisfaction that the filing of a bond does not satisfy the mandate of the statute where specific property is in the possession of the stakeholder. That case clearly holds a stakeholder must deposit the specific property in his possession into the registry of the court in order to obtain jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In <em>Austin, </em>ownership of a block of 95,-000 shares of stock issued by the Texas-Ohio Gas Company was in controversy. Simultaneously with the filing of its complaint plaintiff tendered into court 23,700 shares of the stock involved, having only this amount in its possession. The jurisdiction of the court was challenged on the ground that plaintiff had not deposited into the registry of the court <em>all </em>of the property in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">The Fifth Circuit carefully analyzed the provisions of Section 1335 in sustaining the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Its reasoning, apropos here, is expressed in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-12\">\u201c * * * [T]his case can be viewed as an action in the nature of inter-pleader concerning <em>these </em>23,700 shares, in which it is alleged that each of the defendants has some claim. It seems the only natural construction, in fact, of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1335(a) (2) that <em>this is the \u2018property\u2019 which it is necessary to deposit in court, in a case such as this involving specific property and not simply a claim for money. </em>* * * When claims for a sum of money only are involved, payment of the entire sum (or giving of a bond) is a condition precedent to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>But when claims for specific property are involved, the statute imposes the condition of depositing only the specific property in plaintiff\u2019s possession, and the further condition that such property he of the value of $500 or more.\u201d </em>218 F.2d at 744-45. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">Our case of Douglas-Guardian Warehouse Corporation v. Ramey Seed Co., 271 F.2d 24, 26-27 (8th Cir. 1959), relied upon <em>Austin </em>in holding that the tender of specific property into the registry of the court satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-14\">Professor Moore, in discussing Section 1335, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-15\">\u201cThe provision for payment into the registry of the court has been included in each of the interpleader acts since 1917; the provision for the substitution of a bond was introduced into the 1936 Act in order to afford interpleader relief in cases otherwise proper but for the impracticability of a money deposit. Just such a case as visualized by the draftsmen soon arose in Edner v. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\">\u201cA distinction with regard to the amount of deposit has been made between interpleader actions in which the disputed stake is money and those actions in which the stake is personal property. Perhaps the leading case is Austin v. Texas-Ohio Gas Co. There, the claimants asserted interests in 95,-000 shares of the corporate stakeholder\u2019s stock, many of which shares had been disposed of in a manner which the stakeholder alleged was improper thereby exposing it to various forms of harassment. The stakeholder tendered into court only 23,700 shares of the disputed stock, these being the only shares of the 95,000 which it still had in its possession. The court upheld this partial deposit, as sufficient to meet the jurisdictional requirements of Section 1335, <em>carefully parsing the language of that section to elicit a distinction between the deposit requirement in res cases and in cases of ordinary money debts.\u201d </em>[The quotation from <em>Austin, </em>218 F.2d at 744-46, is omitted]. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao0\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">\u201cThe court\u2019s analysis is sound, and has the support of more recent cases.\u201d 3 Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 2210, at 3078, 3083-84 (2d ed. 1966).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ad1\">On the authority of the foregoing cases I am impelled to conclude that the alternative provision for the giving of a bond in the 1936 amendment was designed for situations where the stakeholder is in possession of a fund or other benefits arising from a note, bond, certificate, policy of insurance or other instrument of the value of $500 or more and is under an obligation to pay money to one of the adverse claimants, or where the rigid requirement of a deposit would prevent just relief. Cf. Edner v. Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co., 138 F.2d 327 (3rd Cir. 1943). I do not believe Congress intended to relax the requirement of a deposit of specific property as a prerequisite to jurisdiction where the stakeholder has possession of the specific property and such a deposit is feasible. Neither the bank in its complaint nor the contesting parties in their claims have asserted the existence of any unusual circumstances which would warrant the court in accepting the bond in lieu of a deposit of shares of stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">To me the effect of the majority opinion is to obviate the requirement of a deposit of the specific res in the stakeholder\u2019s possession, so long as a bond is given in lieu thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">I would reverse and remand with directions to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-9\">. Contrary to the majority\u2019s intimation Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., 99 F.2d 651 (9th Cir. 1939), aff\u2019d, 308 U.S. 66, 72, 60 S.Ct. 44 (1939), does not hold that either the deposit of money or property, <em>or the giving of a bond in lieu thereof, </em>satisfies the condition precedent to obtaining interpleader jurisdiction. In <em>Treinies </em>the provision for filing a bond was not in issue and was not discussed by either the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court. As in our case the certificates representing the shares of stock were in the possession of one of the claimants and were later deposited into court during the pendency of the action. Jurisdiction, however, was predicated on the fact that accrued dividends, amounting to more than $500, were deposited into court at the time the Sunshine Mining Co. filed its complaint. That corporation did not tender or deposit into court the \u201cshares of stock\u201d in its possession. The Supreme Court upheld jurisdiction on the basis that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-18\">\u201cThere is a real controversy between the adverse claimants.
