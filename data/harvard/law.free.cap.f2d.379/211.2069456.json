We agree with Judge Rosling that this claim must be denied a wage priority under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Embassy Restaurant, Inc., 359 U.S. 29, 79 S.Ct. 554, 3 L.Ed.2d 601 (1959), and we affirm his order.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The Annuity Plan of the Electrical Industry, as amended to July 1, 1964, requires each employer of workers represented by Local Union No. 3 to contribute $4.00 for each day\u2019s wages paid to each such worker. Each worker for whom such contributions are made becomes a Participant in the Plan, and he or his designated beneficiary is entitled to receive monthly payments of specified amounts, until the sums credited to his account are exhausted, upon his death, retirement from the industry at age sixty or over, permanent disability after working more than ten years for a contributing employer, or ceasing to be a Participant for any other reason. In addition, the beneficiary of a deceased Participant is entitled to death benefits out of the income of the Plan, if available, the amount varying with the length of his continuous participation in the Plan. The benefits payable under the Plan are expressly made nonassignable, and immune from attachment, garnishment, or other process. The trustees are authorized to invest and reinvest the funds of the Plan \u201cin their sole discretion,\u201d and are made liable only for losses \u201cdue to their wilful misconduct or fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\"> Like the welfare fund contributions which the Supreme Court denied a wage priority in United States v. Embassy Restaurant, Inc., supra, contributions to the Annuity Plan \u201care not \u2018due to workmen,\u2019 nor have they the customary attributes of wages.\u201d 359 U.S. at 33, 79 S.Ct. at 557. The contributions in <em>Embassy Restaurant </em>were \u201cflat sums of $8 per month for each workman * * * without relation to his hours, wages or productivity.\u201d 359 U.S. at 32, 79 S.Ct. at 556. Contributions to the Annuity Plan are likewise at a flat rate of $4.00 for each day\u2019s wages. Moreover, as in <em>Embassy Restaurant, </em>the contributions are payable directly to the trustees of the Annuity Plan, who are vested with exclusive management of its funds; so far as the record shows, \u201c[a] workman cannot even compel payment by a defaulting employer.\u201d 359 U.S. at 32, 79 S.Ct. at 556; cf. Local 140 Security Fund v. Hack, 242 F.2d 375 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 833, 78 S.Ct. 51, 2 L.Ed.2d 45 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">The Court also observed in <em>Embassy Restaurant </em>that the Congressional purpose in enacting the wage priority was \u201cto provide the workman a \u2018protective cushion\u2019 against the economic displacement caused by his employer\u2019s bankruptcy,\u201d and that the welfare fund contributions, which were applied to life insurance, sick benefits, and hospital and surgical plans,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-11\">\u201coffer no support to the workman in periods of financial distress. Furthermore, if the claims of the trustees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>are to be treated on a par with wages, in a case where the employer\u2019s assets are insufficient to pay all in the second priority, the workman will have to share with the welfare plan, thus reducing his own recovery.\u201d 359 U.S. at 33-34, 79 S.Ct. at 557.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The Joint Industry Board argues that the Annuity Plan does offer support to its Participants in periods of financial distress, because a worker who permanently ceased to be employed in the electrical industry ceases to be a Participant and is entitled to fixed monthly benefits. However, all indications are that relatively few workers whose employer becomes bankrupt will permanently leave the electrical industry. Moreover, the monthly benefits paid to a worker withdrawing from the electrical industry are fixed at $50.00 or (for workers leaving after January 1, 1965) $60.00 a month. Thus allowing a wage priority to Annuity Plan contributions might well reduce the amount of unpaid wages a worker could realize from bankruptcy, and would not increase the amount of benefits immediately payable under the Plan unless his account with the Plan was empty. The Annuity Plan therefore does not afford a meaningful \u201cprotective cushion\u201d against the economic dislocation caused by an employer\u2019s bankruptcy, and cannot be accorded a wage priority under <em>Embassy Restaurant.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">It has been forcefully argued that contributions to funds like the Annuity Plan should receive a wage priority in bankruptcy. See e. g., United States v. Embassy Restaurant, Inc., 359 U.S. 29, 35, 79 S.Ct. 554 (1959) (Black, J., dissenting) ; Note, Union Retirement and Welfare Plans: Employer Contributions as \u201cWages\u201d Under Section 64a(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, 66 Yale L.J. 449, 460-461 (1957). But in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Embassy Restaurant, </em>such an argument must be made to Congress, not to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\">. The Joint Industry Board also relies on Sulmeyer v. Southern California Pipe Trades Trust Fund, 301 F.2d 768 (9 Cir. 1962), which granted a wage priority to contributions to a Vacation and Holiday Benefit Fund. But that decision is clearly distinguishable in any event, as it rested on the facts that vacation pay had already been held entitled to a wage priority, see, e. g., United States v. Munro-Van Helms Co., Inc., 243 F.2d 10 (5 Cir. 1957), that taxes were withheld from employees on contributions to the Fund, and that the Fund established a separate savings account for each employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
