In 1965 it constructed a 152-unit apartment complex valued at $1,000,000, named Chateau DeVille Apartments, in Little Rock, Arkansas. It holds the apartment complex for rental purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">The cost of labor and materials exceeded $350,000 for each project. The materials, including equipment and supplies, were purchased from sources both within and without the states where the projects were located. Part of the work was handled by subcontractors. Some of its employees were covered by other provisions of the Act and are not involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">It was the contention of Appellant that the words \u201cgross volume from the business\u201d in Section 3(s) (4) of the Act mean gross volume of sales, income or payments received from the construction business and do not comprehend a situation where a construction contractor builds a structure for himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">The District Judge adopted findings of fact and conclusions of law and held that the Act embraced any enterprise engaged in the construction business, whether constructing for itself or for others, so long as the annual gross value received from its business was not less than $350,000. The District Judge further held that in determining whether the enterprise has an annual gross volume from its business of not less than $350,-000, any gain of capital assets derived from its construction activities must be counted to the extent of their fair market value, irrespective of whether the assets were in the form of money or its equivalent in property. We agree with this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">It would seem to us anomalous for Congress to cover employees of construction contractors who build for others, and not cover employees of contractors who build for themselves, particularly since about 23% of all contractors build for themselves. In either instance, the employees performed the same kind of work. There is no valid reason to discriminate between the two types of employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-17\">The underlying concern of the Act is the impact of the particular activity upon interstate commerce. From this perspective the ultimate disposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>of the construction has little relevance. The important consideration is whether the activity which went into the actual building process is likely to have an effect on the flow of men, money, and materials across state lines. In this case Congress has exercised the legislative judgment that any activity which creates a business volume of $350,000 or more is likely to have a substantial impact on the channels of the national economic system. The fact that the contractor does not sell the building after its completion does not mean that in constructing it for his own purposes he did not set in motion substantial interstate commercial activities or avail himself of the facilities of other interstate enterprises. Indeed, the facts of this case, involving activities in a number of states, illustrate the soundness of congressional judgment that construction of this magnitude generates an important tributary to the stream of commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The legislative history of Section 3(s) (4) indicates that the Senate deliberately refrained from using the word \u201csales\u201d in the Amendment. 2 U.S.Code Congressional &amp; Administrative News, 1961, p. 1651.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Appellant argued that if Congress intended to include employees of construction contractors who build for themselves, apt language could have been used to express the intent, such as, \u201cIf the annual value of construction by such enterprise is not less than $350,000,\u201d and that the use of the words \u201cannual gross volume from the business\u201d is an awkward way to describe the level of business activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\"> An examination of the many cases dealing with statutory construction reveals that legislatures do not always use apt words to express their intent. The Court will look to the legislative 'purpose of the Act and follow that purpose even though a literal reading of the language used would suggest a different conclusion. Perry v. Commerce Loan Co., 383 U.S. 392, 399, 400, 86 S.Ct. 852, 15 L.Ed.2d 827 (1966); United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019n, 310 U.S. 534, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1940). Here a literal reading of the Act does not suggest that we adopt Appellant\u2019s construction. The words \u201cannual gross volume from the business\u201d convey a broad meaning and should not be narrowly construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">In adopting a liberal construction of the Act, the Supreme Court in Mitchell v. Lublin, McGaughy &amp; Associates, 358 U.S. 207, 211, 79 S.Ct. 260, 264, 3 L. Ed.2d 243, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">\u201cHowever, within the tests of coverage fashioned by Congress, the Act has been construed liberally to apply to the furthest reaches consistent with congressional direction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">See also Mitchell v. C. W. Vollmer &amp; Co., 349 U.S. 427, 429, 75 S.Ct. 860, 99 L.Ed. 1196 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\"><em>We </em>conclude that the congressional purpose was to include in the coverage of the Act employees of construction contractors who build for themselves as well as those who build for others.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9i\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-19\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b248-6\">. The Act was again amended in 1966 to dispense with the \u201cannual gross volume\u201d test and now all employees of any such enterprise which has at least some employees engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, are covered (80 Stat. 832). The test now reads \u201cannual gross volume of sales made or business done\u201d. The Senate report indicates that the words \u201cbusiness done\u201d were used to make \u201cthe intent abundantly plain for the future and remove any possible reason for misapprehension.\u201d Senate Report No. 1487, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 7, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1966, p. 3009.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
