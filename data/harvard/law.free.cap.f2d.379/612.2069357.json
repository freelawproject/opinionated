The District Court\u2019s determination that the petitioner was denied, by refusal of a transcript, the equal protection of the laws by the State court is not contested on this appeal; further, the State is not contending that petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>er\u2019s convictions should not receive a full appellate review in the Florida courts. The sole issue now presented concerns the method by which that review is to be obtained. The State contends that under Florida\u2019s Criminal Procedure Rule No. One, F.S.A. ch. 924 Appendix, the habeas petitioner, after having been thwarted on appeal, may, upon proper application, obtain a direct review of criminal convictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">While ordinarily, the procedure to be followed in securing appellate review of state court criminal convictions is and should be left to the states, here the District Judge has expressly, after thorough examination of the applicable Florida appellate processes, exercised his discretionary authority in ordering alternative methods of review whereby petitioner may be made whole. In consideration of the facts in this particular case and as specifically authorized by Title 28, \u00a7 2106, United States Code, we feel that such action on the part of the District Judge was \u201cjust under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-13\">.
