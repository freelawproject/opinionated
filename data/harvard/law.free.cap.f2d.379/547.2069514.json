Liability was conceded during the trial, and the main issue on appeal is whether the trial judge committed reversible error by excluding certain evidence offered by the appellants to negate the appellee\u2019s claim that, as a result of the accident, he developed pains in his head and neck, which during the next three years extended to his left arm and shoulder, accompanied by swelling and a reduced sensory perception in his left hand. The appellee\u2019s medical experts testified that, the shock of the collision had produced what is known as a nerve root irritation in the appellee\u2019s neck, which progressively worsened and the prolonged existence of which affected his left arm. The ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>pellants argue, however, that because the appellee sought nothing more than conservative medical treatment, i. e., heat and exercise, for this condition until April of 1964, he did not in fact develop the condition until then \u2014 long after the collision \u2014 and that therefore it was not proximately caused by the accident. They assert further that what the ap-pellee was actually suffering from in April, 1964, and thereafter was a \u201cconversion reaction\u201d, a psychiatric term meaning the \u201ctransformation of an emotion into physical manifestations,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> stemming from the appellee\u2019s anxieties about his year and a half separation from his wife and children and his frustrated desire to marry his secretary with whom he had meanwhile been living.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The only evidence to support this theory offered by the appellants was the report of a neurological examination of the appellee, made at the Presbyterian Hospital in New York City, in which the examining physician had diagnosed appellee\u2019s symptoms as \u201cprobably conversion reaction\u201d and the cross-examination of one of appellee\u2019s medical witnesses, Dr. Kaplan, who conceded that a diagnosis that appellee\u2019s neck pains represented a conversion might be justified. But Dr. Kaplan pointed out that the report did not state to what the diagnosis related and he stressed that, while it could apply to the neck pains it could only be a partial diagnosis because it would not be sufficient to \u201cexplain the total clinical picture.\u201d Because the trial judge refused to admit into evidence the portions of the psychiatric report which stated that the appellee had been living with his secretary and intended to marry her, as \u201cthey would be too prejudicial and they don\u2019t really help you much,\u201d the appellants claim they were prevented from demonstrating that appellee\u2019s symptoms were the result of such difficulties, even though the court admitted the rest of the report and the appellants were free to put in evidence of his separation from his family and other emotional problems, but they did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">It is always within the competence of the trial judge to exclude evidence, otherwise admissible, when he is convinced that it will create a danger of prejudice which outweighs its probative value. Reynolds v. Pegler, 223 F.2d 429, 435 (2 Cir. 1955). An appellate court will reverse such a determination only for abuse of discretion. Great American Insurance Company v. Horab, 309 F.2d 262, 265 (8 Cir. 1962) ; Utah State Farm Bureau Federation v. National Farmers Union Service Corp., 198 F.2d 20, 24, 33 A.L.R.2d 1186 (10 Cir. 1952); Uniform Rules of Evidence, Rule 45(b); ALI, Model Code of Evidence, Rule 303(1) (b) (1942); McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 152 at pp. 319-320 (1954). We find no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">With regard to the appellants\u2019 claim that the judge committed error by permitting the case to be presented to the jury on the theory that, even if appellee\u2019s symptoms were the result of a conversion reaction, they could still be eausually related to the collision, it is without merit because the record shows that there was sufficient evidence <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>from which the jury could make a determination on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-5\">. Stedman, Medical Dictionary 352 (20th ed. 1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b596-6\">. In addition to Dr. Kaplan\u2019s testimony concerning conversion reaction, Dr. Leass testified that when he examined the ap-pellee on April 4, 1964 he found \u201c * * * not only (lid he have this constant pain [from irritation and damage to the spinal nerve], but lie was developing emotional problems which, because of this pain and symptoms were making him increasingly nervous and more emotionally involved.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
