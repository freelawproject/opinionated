Hancock, the prisoner, contends that he was unlawfully convicted of a felony theft in that the corporeal personal property he was accused of taking did not have a value in excess of $50, as required by Texas law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-25\">Hancock, an employee of Texas Instruments Automatic Computer Corporation, photocopied fifty-nine computer programs belonging to his employer. He attempted to sell these to Texaco, one of T. I.\u2019s clients, for five million dollars. At the state trial and in the court below, Hancock, noting that no original documents were removed from the employer\u2019s premises, argued that at most he stole $35 worth of paper. He contended .that the information contained in the computer programs constitutes trade secrets, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>not corporeal property worth in excess of $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Article 1418 of the Vernon\u2019s Ann.Texas Penal Code defines property, for purposes of theft sections, as including \u201call writings of every description, provided such property possesses any ascertainable value\u201d. The Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas held: \u201c [The] computer programs as alleged and the evidence in support thereof show that such property is included and comes within the meaning of the provisions of the statute defining the offense of theft. * * * [The] programs as alleged had a market value in excess of fifty dollars each.\u201d Hancock v. State, Tex.Ct.Cr.App. 1966, 402 S.W.2d 906. \u201cIt is our duty, of course, to accept this state judicial construction of the ordinance [statute].\u201d Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 1965, 382 U.S. 87, 91, 86 S.Ct. 211, 214, 15 L.Ed.2d 176. \u201cAbsent the infringement of federal constitutional rights, we are bound by the interpretation made by the [state] court of the criminal statutes of that State.\u201d Olson v. Tahash, 8 Cir., 1965, 344 F.2d 139. We cannot say that the law, as authoritatively construed by the Texas courts, is so unreasonable or arbitrary as to be violative of due process. See, for example, United States v. Seagraves, 3 Cir. 1959, 265 F.2d 876 holding that certain geophysical maps were \u201cgoods, wares, merchandise\u201d of the value of $5000 or more within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">This case is not one in which there was no evidence of the accused having committed the charged offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In light of the Texas courts\u2019 authoritative construction of pertinent Texas law, there was ample evidence that Hancock committed the offense for which he was indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">We have considered all of the appellant\u2019s other contentions. They are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-10\">. Thompson v. City of Louisville, 1960, 362 U.S. 199, 80 S.Ct. 624, 4 L.Ed.2d 654. See also Cox v.
