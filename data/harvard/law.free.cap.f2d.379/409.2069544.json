The district judge, after holding a pre-trial conference, but without there having been a trial, entered an order dismissing the plaintiff Kathryn S. Wright\u2019s claim with prejudice. Subsequently, the court reopened the case and granted leave to Mrs. Wright to \u201cproceed to take * * * further evidence.\u201d Her motion (pointing out there had been no trial) to present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>such evidence to a jury was overruled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, the court reinstated its former judgment, filing a written opinion and judgment again dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Since the district court considered the depositions of both plaintiff and defendant, referring to them as having been \u201cintroduced into evidence\u201d, and since the judgment and opinion contained what appear to be detailed \u201cfindings of fact,\u201d we think it probable that the district judge was proceeding under the misapprehension that trial by jury had been waived and that the parties had agreed that he was to determine the ease on the merits by reference to the conflicting depositions and affidavits. Yet, we are unable to find in the record any such waiver or agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">It seems unlikely that the district judge was treating the case as one for summary judgment because (1) he does not characterize the facts he recites as being undisputed, and (2) the defendant insurance company never made a motion for summary judgment, nor for that matter, any other motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Aside from procedural perplexity, it is plain from an examination of the district court opinion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the court thought that Mrs. Wright could not recover \u2014 on any possible hypothesis. We express our contrary viewpoint for his guidance on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The principal question purportedly adjudicated below is whether or not a \u201cconditional receipt\u201d issued upon payment of the initial premium for a life insurance policy may result in temporary policy coverage. We think this cannot be determined without there first being had a jury determination of the material facts. There is at least one genuine issue: whether the deceased truck driver Wright was medically \u201cinsurable\u201d at the time of application.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">It is uncontroverted that Pilot Life Insurance agent Walter Turner sold truck driver Clinton Wright on a plan of life insurance under which Wright\u2019s employer would make monthly salary deductions to pay the premiums due the Company. Wright signed an application for insurance with Pilot, <em>paid </em>his first monthly premium, and was issued a \u201cConditional Receipt\u201d which was detached from the application and signed by Turner. The application was for life insurance in the amount of $10,000.00 with a provision for double indemnity in the event of accidental death.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">The \u201cConditional Receipt\u201d provided on its face that Pilot had received from Wright $23.80 \u201cas settlement\u201d for the first monthly premium on the policy. It recited that if the application were \u201cdeclined by the Company, no policy of insurance will be issued * * *. If the application is approved, without restrictions, as applied for, the insurance will be in effect <em>from the date of this application </em>in accordance with its terms and conditions * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-15\">The reverse side of the \u201cConditional Receipt\u201d is to be completed by those who, unlike Wright, do <em>not </em>make settlement for the initial premium with their application. It informs the applicant, who may subscribe to the statement, that \u201c[ajlthough the agent has explained to me how I may make settlement under this application, <em>thereby placing it im</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number><em>mediately in full force and effect </em>* * * provided I am insurable, it is not my desire to take advantage of this opportunity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The front of the application itself includes a printed statement, subscribed in the appropriate place by Wright, which includes, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cI understand and agree * *\u25a0 * that <em>unless </em>I shall have made settlement for the first premium at the time this application is signed and have conditional receipt in my possession, there shall not be any contract of insurance until the policy shall have been issued and delivered to me and the first premium paid thereon * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Within the period covered by the first monthly premium, Wright was killed in a tractor trailer accident in Fairfield, Connecticut. At the time of his death, Wright\u2019s application for insurance had neither been approved nor declined by Pilot. The plaintiff in this action, Wright\u2019s widow and beneficiary under the policy, contends that Wright was insured on the day of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">What is the effect of the delivery of the conditional receipt to Wright upon payment of his initial premium? There is a substantial difference of opinion among the various jurisdictions. See generally, e. g., Annot., 2 A.L.R.2d 943 (1948); Life Insurance Receipts: The Mystery of the Non-Binding Binder, 63 Yale L.J. 523 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">On the assumption that North Carolina law applies, two leading North Carolina cases are argued to us by counsel for <em>both </em>parties on this appeal, Cheek v. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 215 N.C. 36, 1 S.E.2d 115 (1939), and Gardner v. North State Mut. Life Ins. Co., 163 N.C. 367, 79 S.E. 806, 48 L.R.A.,N.S., 714 (1913). In <em>Gardner </em>the North Carolina Supreme Court quoted with approval a leading insurance text to the effect that a conditional receipt is a \u201c \u2018preliminary contract of insurance, intended to give temporary protection pending investigation of the risk by the insurer.\u2019 \u201d 163 N.C. at 371, 79 S.E. at 808. The receipt \u201cprotects the applicant for insurance against the contingency of sickness intervening its date and the delivery of the policy, if <em>the application is accepted.\u201d </em>Id. (Emphasis added.) The court specifically did <em>not </em>decide whether the company may avoid liability by \u201cunreasonably\u201d refusing approval in the event of intervening illness or death. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">In Cheek v. Pilot Ins. Co., the insurance agent, solicited the father of an infant on the day of his birth. A policy application was completed and sent to the home office, and the initial premium was paid. A \u201cbinding\u201d receipt issued by the agent was conditioned upon approval by the home office, and provided that \u201cif the person proposed for insurance is, on the date of this receipt, alive and in good health, the person proposed is insured from the date of the receipt * * Upon reviewing the application, the company requested its agent to determine the actual weight of the infant, but the infant died before the agent\u2019s investigation could be completed or policy issued. The court noted that the potential insured was not <em>in fact </em>insurable since his weight was \u201cunder the minimum considered by the company necessary to make an infant insurable.\u201d 215 N.C. at 38, 1 S.E.2d at 116. Therefore, there was, in the court\u2019s terms, no \u201carbitrary or unreasonable\u201d rejection or withholding of approval. The North Carolina Supreme Court, as it had done in Gardner v. North State Mut. Life Ins. Co., expressly did \u201cnot decide that where a binding slip has been delivered to the applicant the company, in the event of the death or illness of the applicant occurring subsequently, but before acceptance of the application, may arbitrarily or unreasonably reject or withhold its approval * * * and thereby avoid its liability, under the clause in the binding slip requiring the approval of the home office.\u201d 215 N.C. at 38, 1 S.E.2d at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">Plainly these decisions are not sufficiently in point to be controlling. But what is said strongly suggests that before an insurance company may decline to issue a policy (having accepted a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>mium), it must have a good reason for doing so \u2014 other than a wish to avoid payment. Otherwise, \u201cthe binding receipt is misleading * * as the North Carolina Supreme Court said some twenty-eight years ago in sharp criticism of the same insurance company. See Cheek v. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 215 N.C. 36, 1 S.E.2d 115, 116-117 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The very most that can be said in Pilot\u2019s favor in respect to the wording of the receipt is that it is ambiguous. The back side of the receipt which was given Wright informed him that the agent has explained how he may make settlement under the application, \u201cthereby placing it immediately in full force and effect * * * provided I am insurable * * Wright made immediate settlement and was reasonably entitled to assume that he was covered \u2014-if he was \u201cinsurable\u201d by Pilot\u2019s health standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Ambiguities in contracts of insurance are to be construed against the company. This is the well settled rule in North Carolina as elsewhere. E. g., Allstate Ins. Co. v. Shelby Mut. Ins. Co., 269 N.C. 341, 345, 152 S.E.2d 436, 440 (1967); Williams v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 269 N.C. 235, 237, 152 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The district court apparently believed completion of a medical examination an \u201cabsolute condition precedent to the completion of the application [by Wright].\u201d See Wright v. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 254 F.Supp. 1018, at 1020 (W.D.Va.1966). We think not. In Prudential Ins. Co. v. Lamme, No. 5185, 425 P.2d 346 (Nev. Sup.Ct. March 31, 1967), the Nevada Supreme Court persuasively rejected the contention that a physical examination was a condition precedent to coverage. In doing so, it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">\u201c[A]n insurance policy is not an ordinary contract. It is a complex instrument, unilaterally prepared, and seldom understood by the assured. The same is equally true of the conditional receipt. The parties are not similarly situated. The company and its representatives are expert in the field; the applicant is not. A court should not be unaware of this reality and subordinate its significance to strict legal doctrine. * * * Nor should a court be obliged to, overlook the obvious advantage to the company in obtaining payment of the premium when the application is made. It is a device to avoid the possibility that the applicant will change his mind and revoke his application, or deal with a rival company. * * * A conditional receipt tends to encourage deception. We do not mean to imply affirmative misconduct by the soliciting insurance agent. We suggest only that if nothing is said about the complicated and legalistic phrasing of the receipt, and the agent accepts an application for insurance together with the first premium payment, the applicant has reason to believe that he is insured. Otherwise he is deceived.\u201d Prudential Ins. Co. v. Lamme, No. 5185, 425 P.2d 346 (Nev.Sup.Ct. March 31, 1967) (citations omitted); see also Allen v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 44 N.J. 294, 299-307, 208 A.2d 638, 641-645 (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">In another recent decision, Terrell v. Life Ins. Co., 269 N.C. 259, 152 S.E.2d 196 (1967), the North Carolina Supreme Court approved the submission to the jury of the issue of \u201cinsurability,\u201d i. e., health condition, under the standards of the insurance company, where the policy under which recovery was sought required that the insured be \u201cinsurable according to company rules and standards for such policy.\u201d We think the plaintiff here is entitled to no less. On remand, the parties will be accorded trial by jury of any genuine issues of fact that may arise \u2014 and specifically, the issue of insurability of Clinton Wright on the date of the issuance of the conditional receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-14\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\">. This case was removed by defendant Pilot Life from the jurisdiction of the state court. Counsel stipulate that litigants in the state courts of Virginia are entitled to trial by jury without any necessity of expressly demanding it. Thus, the right was not dependent upon demand in the federal court. Fed.R.Civ.P. 81(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b458-9\">. Counsel for Pilot Life in the hearing before us points to no such agreement or waiver \u2014 oral or written. Counsel for Wright insists there was none. Certainly there was no stipulation complying with Fed.R.Civ.P. 39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b458-17\">. Defendant\u2019s Answer, of course, contained a prayer for relief that the action be dismissed at the cost of plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b458-18\">. See Wright v. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 254 F.Supp. 1018 (W.D.Va.1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
