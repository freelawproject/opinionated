Further, there is ample evidence to support the findings that the discharges of employees Davis, Bowen, Crook, Kight, Pararo, Hood, King, Stafford and Thompkins were motivated by antiunion purposes and were thus in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (1), (3). The evidence is also sufficient to support the finding that \u00a7 8(a) (5) and (1), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (1), (5), were violated by respondent\u2019s refusal to hear a grievance and to bargain in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-24\">The order of the Board is thus due to be, and it will be</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-25\">Enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
