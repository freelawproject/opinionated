BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AqnZ\">This is a simple case. Simple in outline and simple in available choices. As so much today, this is more of the <em>Sieracki-Ryan-Yaka-Jackson</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>wake. The question is briefly put: under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 901 et seq., is a general contractor a \u201cthird person\u201d who may be sued by the injured employee of a subcontractor? Stated differently, does the general contractor have an employer\u2019s immunity which the Act expressly affords even though by judicial construction it is now something less positive than the words suggest? The District Court held the general contractor, a third person, had the employer\u2019s immunity and was therefore not a third person subject to being sued. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">As the decision went off on the pleadings and on motion for summary judgment raising the same thing, only a brief recital is necessary. The General Contractor <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>made a contract with the Shipowner to prepare for and load a cargo of bulk grain on the SS DOROTHY BOY-LAN. The General Contractor in turn contracted with the Subcontractor <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to du a major part of the work. The Employee, employed by the Subcontractor, was injured when he fell into the hold through a false deck on which he was working. The false deck on which he was working and the feeder wall which he was constructing were made up of plywood sheets which had been furnished to the Subcontractor by the General Contractor pursuant to its contract with the Shipowner. The Employee brought two actions. One, on the civil side based on diversity, was against the Shipowner who in today\u2019s fashion, soon lashed out against the General Contractor and Subcontractor by impleader.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ove Skou v. Hebert, 5 Cir., 1966, 365 F.2d 341, 1966 AMC 2223. The second was the instant libel in Admiralty against the General Contractor as to whom no diversity existed. The Court below, as we do here, read the libel as adequately charging the General Contractor with independent acts constituting negligence, unseaworthiness, or both, especially in the failure to supply proper plywood flooring.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-16\">Ours is solely a task of statutory construction. But that is a beguiling oversimplification. For from statutory language which in two groups is substantially similar, there are not less than four choices <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> made by the State Courts who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>find, or claim to find, some policy factor now giving, now denying, literal application to literal terms.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Starting, and for that matter ending, with the statute as we must, there is no doubt at all about the right of the injured employee to bring the suit. The Act expressly accords this right and prescribes elaborate machinery for settlement, apportionment of recovery, and the like.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This right against the third party is extended to the employer if a self-insurer, or to his insurance carrier if insured.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The problem arises out of the interplay of the provisions of the Act prescribing liability for compensation and the exclusiveness of the employer\u2019s liability. The employer is liable for compensation not only for his own direct employees but the employees of subcontractors where payment of compensation is not secured.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At the same time the liability of the employer for the payment of compensation \u201cto the employee\u201d or his successors is exclusive and supposedly in place of all other liability.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The theory behind granting the general contractor the employer\u2019s immunity is that, liable under certain circumstances to the injured employee of the subcontractor, he has for all practical purposes an employer\u2019s liability for compensation. Indeed, under some statutes imposing a conditional liability to employees of subcontractors, some treat the general contractor as a \u201cstatutory employer.\u201d 2 Larson, Workmen's Compensation, \u00a7\u00a7 72.30, 72.31 (1952). This being so, it is argued, since the general contractor has this potential compensation liability, it is not equitable for him also to bear the risk (and premium cost) for unlimited general liability damages to the same employee. The two main lines of decision \u2014 (1) general contractor may be sued, (2) the general contractor may not be sued \u2014 arise out of compensation statutes which, in turn, follow two principal divisions. In the first are those statutes which require the general employer or general contractor to see that any and all independent contractors or subcontractors carry compensation insurance or suffer statutory liability for compensation to the employees of the subcontractors. In the second category are those which directly impose liability on the general employer or the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>contractor, as the case may be, for injuries to the employees of any independent contractors or subcontractors. Since we are neither seeking nor impressed for this purpose by headcount or any weight of authority, numerical or otherwise, nothing is to be gained in a close examination of either of the lines or the individual cases. Under the first type of statute, the state case law generally denies to the general contractor the employer\u2019s immunity and permits third party suit against him. Under statutes of the second kind imposing a direct liability, the cases with a good deal of good sense regard the general contractor as a vicarious employer and extend the employer\u2019s immunity to him.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Additionally, some have suggested that since the purpose of statutes imposing a secondary liability of some character upon the general employer or general contractor for injuries to employees of subcontractors is to encourage employers in the subordinate levels to secure the necessary insurance, the rule which permits recovery against the general contractor where the subcontractor has obtained insurance, but which would be prohibited where the subcontractor obtained none, collides directly with the statutory policy. See 2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 72.31 at p. 176 (1952). This approach carries little conviction under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. Congress did not leave it to hierarchical inducement to assure that every employer subject to the Act becomes bound by, and qualified under, the Act. By express definition the Act covers every \u201c * * * employer any of whose employees are employed in maritime employment, in whole or in part, * * \u00a7 902(4). This includes the subcontractor.// Every employer is made liable for and required to secure the payment of compensation to his employees. \u00a7 904 (note 9, supra). To secure, as \u00a7 904 requires, payment of compensation, the employer must either obtain and keep in force approved insurance coverage or qualify as a self insurer under applicable regulations. \u00a7 932. Payment of compensation benefits, \u00a7 914, furnishing medical services, \u00a7 907, and making reports, \u00a7 930, are automatically required of the employer under severe sanctions. \u00a7\u00a7 918, 930. See Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Donovan, 5 Cir., 1960, 274 F.2d 794, 1960 AMC 1311, rehearing denied, 279 F.2d 75; cf. Employers Liab. Assur. Corp. v. Donovan, 5 Cir., 1960, 279 F.2d 76, cert. denied, 364 U.S. 884, 81 S.Ct. 165, 5 L.Ed.2d 105. And finally to cap it all, an employer failing to secure payment of compensation is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to fine and imprisonment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u00a7 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">This analysis and the structure of \u00a7\u00a7 904, 905 (notes 9, 10, supra) add up to show that the provision imposing on the general contractor compensation liability to an employee of a subcontractor is a secondary, protective one. The subcontractor not only is compelled, as we have just shown, to qualify under the Act, but his failure to do so does not reduce his liability to his injured employee. To the contrary, the employee under \u00a7 905 has a fielder\u2019s choice. He has the right to a <em>pre-Yaka </em>suit for damages with no risk from defenses of fellow servant, assumed risk or contributory negligence. Or, if he wishes to eliminate all risks, he can demand payment of compensation under the terms of the Act. About the only time then that the injured worker has to pursue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>the general contractor under \u00a7 904 is when the subcontractor has failed to secure payment of compensation with an approved insurance carrier, \u00a7 932, and the subcontractor is financially unable to respond for compensation benefits. The purpose of \u00a7 904 is to effectually assure payment of benefits. The general contractor has a secondary, guaranty-like liability. The Act does not make the general contractor the \u201cemployer.\u201d It is only the \u201cemployer\u201d who can get under the immunity umbrella of \u00a7 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">And certainly at this late date a holding narrowing, withdrawing, or restricting the rights of an injured ambiguous-amphibious worker would be stemming the strong judicial tide. Thus <em>Sieracki\u2019s </em>cautious statement that the Act \u201chad no purpose or effect to alter the [worker\u2019s] rights as against any but his employer alone,\u201d 328 U.S. 85, 102, 66 S.Ct. 872, 881, 90 L.Ed. 1099, 1110, has now been overtaken by <em>Yaka\u2019s </em>unlimited in rem employer liability for unseaworthiness followed most recently by <em>Jackson </em>for in personam liability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And the action of Congress, surely aware of the dynamic developments in this field of law,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> flow in the same direction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">We therefore reach the same conclusion as the only two earlier cases did. Thomas v. George Hyman Constr. Co., D.C.D.C.1959, 173 F.Supp. 381, and Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Goode Constr. Co., E.D.Va.1951, 97 F.Supp. 316 (each under the District of Columbia statute which incorporates the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act). We leave open, however, as unnecessary to this decision the question of what ought to be done if the general contractor, or general employer, is actually required to pay compensation benefits to the injured employee of the subcontractor under \u00a7 904.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-9\">.

We are told by the General Contractor\u2019s brief that the Subcontractor acceded to the Shipowner\u2019s demand and took over the defense of this case whereupon the impleader against the General Contractor and the Subcontractor was dismissed on the Shipowner\u2019s motion. Whether this came from the Subcontractor reading the <em>Ryan </em>writing on the wall or for other reasons, we do not know, nor so far as we are able to discern is it of any significance. It does show, of course, that subrogation of the employer-carrier to the injured employee\u2019s third party claim is illusory as the pursuer soon becomes the pursued frequently with few or no defenses, and the prospect of liability unlimited in amount.
