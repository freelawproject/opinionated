Yocum filed his hill in chancery in this case, alleging, in substance, that in the spring of 1875 complainant resided in Grand Eidge, in the county of LaSalle, in this State, and was then intending to remove with his family to the State of Missouri or Kansas; that John Yocum, father of complainant, knowing of such intention, and being then the owner in fee of the south-west quarter of section 22, town 32, range 3, east of the third principal meridian, in LaSalle county, and being also the owner in fee of the south half of the north-west quarter of section 15, town 32, range 3, east, in said county, and not wishing his son to move west, as intended, agreed with him that if complainant would move on said eighty-acre tract of land, and occupy and farm the same, and render to John Yocum, yearly, one-half of the grain raised thereon, so long as he (John Yocum) might live, and would improve the premises in such manner as to complainant might seem best, and would let a certain cattle transaction between them go into the land,\u2014being a claim of complainant against John Yocum for about $700, growing out of dealings in cattle between them,\u2014that he (John Yocum) would pay all taxes on the eighty-acre tract so long as he lived, and that upon his death said eighty-acre tract should be the absolute property of complainant. The bill further alleged that complainant, in pursuance of and in reliance upon the agreement, moved with his family on the land, farmed and improved it, and gave his father one-half the grain raised thereon, down to the time of his death, (March 19, 1882,) with the exception of one year, (1877,) when he lived with his father, at the latter\u2019s request. The other surviving child was made defendant, and the prayer of the bill was for a conveyance. The answer put in issue the making of the alleged agreement, and the performance thereof, and set up the Statute of Frauds. Upon hearing, on proofs taken, the circuit court decreed in accordance with the prayer of the bill, and the defendant appealed.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-6\" pgmap=\"143\">Messrs.

There is direct evidence of the agreement, as alleged in the bill, in the testimony of the witness Gordon that he was present and heard the making of the agreement between the parties. There is the corroborative testimony of as many as six other witnesses, of declarations made by John Yocum, very strongly confirmatory of the existence of a contract that complainant was to have the land. These statements were all made to the different witnesses on different occasions, and in some cases they were repeated to the witnesses at several different times, and many of them were made under circumstances entitling them to more weight than should attach to ordinary loose declarations.</p> <p id=\"b145-6\" pgmap=\"145\">There is some impeachment of the witness Gordon, and there are some circumstances attending his testimony which are urged as affecting its credibility, and it is insisted the witness is not worthy of belief, and there are circumstances in the ease which are commented upon as adverse to the idea that there was the agreement alleged. Without going more into particulars, we will say that after a careful consideration of all that is urged in depreciation of the testimony on the part of the complainant, and giving it due weight, the conviction remains upon our minds, from the evidence, that there existed, here, an agreement between the father and son, that if the latter would stay here, and go upon and live on this place, and improve it, it should be his after his father\u2019s death. The proof shows that in the same spring, after the making of the contract, complainant moved on the land, and ever since, until his father\u2019s death, did occupy, cultivate and make improvements upon it, with the exception of one year, when he lived with his father, at the latter\u2019s request. We think the agreement has been established here with the clearness and satisfaction which is required in the case of a parol contract respecting land, and that the acts of part performance shown are sufficient to take the case out of the operation of the Statute of Frauds, under former decisions of this court.
