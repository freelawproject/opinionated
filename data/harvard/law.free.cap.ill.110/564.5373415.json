Pasty\u2014to hill to foreclose mortgage. The holder of a bond and mortgage, claiming to own the same by a gift of the mortgagee, though he may have pledged the same to secure a loan, is a proper party in a bill by another, claiming adversely, to foreclose the mortgage, and if not made a party to the bill, will not be concluded by the decree of foreclosure, and his assignee may maintain a bill to impeach the decree on the ground that the party so foreclosing the mortgage did not own the bond and mortgage, and had no equitable title to the same.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-12\" pgmap=\"564\">f</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-13\" pgmap=\"564\">2.

One not made a party is not required to adopt such a course, but may file a bill to impeach the decree and establish his rights.

On October 10, 1868, Fellows executed and delivered to John Heermans, since deceased, an instrument in the words and figures following, to-wit:</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-9\" pgmap=\"566(31) 567(376) 568(34)\">\u201cWhereas, I, Joseph Fellows, of Corning, in the county of Steuben, and State of New York, from infirmities and advanced age, deem it expedient to convey to my nephew, John Heermans, of Corning, aforesaid, my real and personal estates in the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois and West Virginia, as trustee, for the purposes hereinafter stated: Now, therefore, I, the said Joseph Fellows, in consideration of the premises, and also of one dollar to me paid by the said John Heermans, the receipt whereof is acknowledged, have sold, and by these presents do grant, release and convey, unto the said John Heermans, his heirs and assigns forever, all my real and personal estates in the several States aforesaid, to have and to hold the same, unto the said John Heermans, his heirs and assigns forever: Provided, always, that the said John Heermans shall sell the said granted lands, by retail, for the best prices that can be got for the same, and convey them in fee simple to purchasers, with covenants of warranty, binding my heirs to warrant and defend the titles to the lands so to be sold and conveyed; and until such lands shall be sold as aforesaid, he shall rent such of them as can be rented, for the best prices that can be got. He shall collect all debts owing to me, and execute deeds, as aforesaid, for all lands now under contract of sale, on payment of the debts owing on them, respectively.

Heermans accepted the trust, and took possession of all the books and papers belonging to the estate, as he testified. The Wynkoop bond and mortgage belonged to the estate, but Heermans admitted that he did not, after the execution of the two instruments above referred to,\u201d see the Wynkoop bond and mortgage.</summary><summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-9\" pgmap=\"568\">On December 28, 1868, Fellows executed an instrument in writing revoking all the powers conferred on said Heermans, and declaring that he revoked both of the aforesaid instruments of writing, and withdrew the same. A copy of this instrument of revocation was served upon Heermans shortly after its date. About this time Fellows took possession of his office, and the books and papers relating to the trust estate, and in 1869 employed Joseph F. Hill, Jr., his grandnephew, as his clerk.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-10\" pgmap=\"568(93) 569(18)\">On January 28, 1869, Fellows filed his bill in the Supreme Court, in Steuben county, New York, asking that the' instruments of October, 1868, be declared a mere power of attorney, revocable by the plaintiff, and that the same be set aside and annulled. The Supreme Court, on a hearing, dismissed this bill, holding that the instruments of October 10 and 15 were valid, etc. Fellows appealed from the decree to the general term of that court, and on January 17, 1870, a receiver was appointed, and an injunction against Heermans was continued. The receiver entered upon his duties January 21, 1870, and employed Hill as his clerk.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-4\" pgmap=\"569\">July 9, 1870, Fellows executed and delivered to Joseph F. Hill, Jr., an assignment of the Wynkoop bond and mortgage, which assignment was, July 25, 1870, duly recorded in Lake county, in this State. This was a gift to Hill. On June 28, 1871, and on July 1, 1871, Fellows entered into an agreement with Heermans, and executed an instrument setting aside the former revocation, and abandoned his appeal. On April 29, 1873, Joseph Fellows died.</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-5\" pgmap=\"569\">On March 5, 1872, Joseph F. Hill, Jr., executed and delivered to his father, Joseph F. Hill, Sr., an assignment of the Wynkoop bond and mortgage, which was recorded in Lake county on March 15, 1872. This was done by Hill, Jr., for his father\u2019s accommodation, and to enable him to borrow some money of George F. Lee. March 22, 1872, Hill, Sr., executed to George F. Lee an assignment of the same bond and mortgage, which was recorded March 25, and a loan made by Lee to Hill, Jr.</summary><summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-6\" pgmap=\"569(165) 570(67)\">August 30, 1872, Lee filed his bill of foreclosure of the bond and mortgage in the circuit court of Lake county, against Wynkoop and his wife, John Heermans, and others. Lee died February 10, 1874, leaving him surviving Mary H. Lee, his widow, and an only child, and on the 18th of August, 1875, Mrs. Lee, as administratrix of her husband\u2019s estate, assigned the bond and mortgage back to Hill, Jr., which assignment was duly acknowledged and recorded. Wynkoop died shortly after the filing of Lee\u2019s bill, having devised the land to his widow, she being also his executrix. Heermans had the Lee suit dismissed for want of prosecution, and on January 26, 1876, filed his bill in the circuit court of Lake county, against Phebe Wynkoop, the unknown heirs of George F. Lee, deceased, the unknown owners, etc., which bill set forth that Heermans \u201chas no knowledge of the whereabouts of said bond and mortgage, or whether or not they are in existence; that he has not seen them since they were taken from his possession by the said Joseph F. Hill, Jr. and Joseph F. Hill.\u201d Heermans, in his answer to Lee\u2019s bill, said: \u201cThe complainant, (Lee) in seeking to foreclose the same, is, in fact, acting as the agent and tool of the said Joseph F. Hill, Jr., or the said Joseph F. Hill, or both of them.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-6\" pgmap=\"570\">At the March term, 1876, of the Lake circuit court, the bill filed by Heermans was taken for confessed by all the defendants, and a decree was entered that Heermans was the absolute owner of the Wynkoop bond and mortgage, and that the assignments of the same from Fellows to Hill, Jr., and from Hill, Jr., to Hill, Sr., and from the latter to Lee, were wholly void, and that there was then due and unpaid to Heermans, upon said bond and mortgage, the sum of $23,-123.69, and that said mortgaged premises be sold, etc. On June 19, 1876, the master in chancery sold all of the mortgaged premises to Harry C. Heermans, the son of John Heermans, for the sum of $22,741.67, except one tract sold to one Huddles, which was sold for $995. On September 26, 1(877, the master made his deed to Harry C. Heermans for the land bought by him. Subsequently to that, and at various times, Harry G. Heermans conveyed various parcels of the land to various persons made parties defendant to this suit, none of whom the bill alleges are innocent parties, and none of whom have paid up the alleged consideration.</summary><summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-7\" pgmap=\"570\">March 14, 1882, the death of John Heermans was suggested, and Harry C.

No money was paid at the master\u2019s sale by either Heermans, and it was conceded that Harry C. bid for his father, John Heermans. On January 28, 1878, Joseph F.

But in answer to this position it is urged that Hill was made a party by the language, \u201cunknown owners and others.\u201d The seventh section of the Chancery act provides : \u201cIn all suits in chancery, and suits to obtain title to lands, in any of the courts in this State, if there be persons interested in the same whose names are unknown, it shall be lawful to make such persons parties to such suits or proceedings by the name and description of unknown owners, or unknown heirs or devisees of any deceased person who may have been interested in the subject matter of the suit previous to his or her death; but in all such cases an affidavit shall be filed by the party desiring to make any unknown person a party,\u201d etc. This provision must be fairly and reasonably complied with, and not evaded. A complainant knowing the parties in interest, and adopting the mode authorized by this provision, to prevent their obtaining notice of the proceeding would be guilty of a fraud on the law, and on claimants or parties in interest, by being thus described. The law will never permit its process to be used for fraudulent purposes, and when such an attempt is made, the courts will relieve against such a fraud. The purpose of the statute is to give notice and afford an opportunity to all persons claiming an interest, to appear and be heard in defence of their claims before being deprived of them. The statute can not be perverted so as to avoid instead of giving notice to defendants. Heermans, in his answer to the bill in the Lee foreclosure suit, alleged that Joseph F. Hill, Jr., claimed to be the owner of the mortgage, and was using Lee merely to obtain a foreclosure for his own benefit, and in his testimony in this case he admitted that Hill claimed to own the mortgage by assignment from Fellows. He must have known, however, that Hill claimed to be assignee of the debt, as they were both nephews of Fellows, and both had transacted business for him. Heermans then evaded making Hill a party to his foreclosure suit, and fraudulently perverted the statute to avoid making Hill a party to his bill, and Hill can not be bound by the decree.</p> <p id=\"b573-6\" pgmap=\"573(88) 574(15)\">Heermans claims that inasmuch as the property of Fellows was all in the hands of the receiver, he had no power to assign the bond and mortgage, and the attempt to do so conferred no title on Hill, and hence appellant has no title. The receiver settled with the court, and was discharged, and we infer he made no report to the court that this claim ever came into his hands, nor does it appear that Heermans ever claimed or demanded them of the receiver; and inasmuch as Fellows never recalled the gift after the receiver was discharged, he ratified the gift.</p> <p id=\"b574-6\" pgmap=\"574\">But it is urged that appellant\u2019s sole remedy was to come in after he purchased the bond and mortgage, and within the three years allowed by the statute, and petition to have the decree opened, and to be permitted to answer and defend. Hill, his assignor, not being a party to that decree, was not required to adopt that course. It is claimed that decree did not become final until the expiration of three years after it was rendered, and that until that time a bill of review could not be maintained. It has been held that under that provision-of the Chancery act a defendant has five years after that period has expired, to prosecute error. (Sale v. Fike, 54 Ill. 292.) The same rule was announced in Lyons v. Robbins, 46 Ill. 276; and in the cases of Southern Bank of St. Louis v. Humphrey, 47 Ill. 221, and Martin v. Gilmer, 72 id. 193, it was held not to protect purchasers under it, because it was not final. But the statute calls such a decree final, and in the sense that it settles the rights of the parties and concludes complainant by its findings, it is final. It is so for all purposes, except it may, on a proper showing, be opened by a defendant who was not served with process. There can be no question that a writ of error will lie to such \u00e1 decree at any time after it is enrolled, and a bill of review may be filed at any time when a writ of error will lie. This provision of the statute was intended to give an additional remedy, and not to take away or limit those, already in existence. Had such been the purpose, some language would have been employed to express the intention, but we find none from which such an inference can be drawn. But outside of this, appellant or his assignor was not a party to that decree. The statute provides the parties not served, alone shall have the privilege of opening the decree, so that in any event, under the facts in this case, appellant may-maintain his bill.</p> <p id=\"b575-5\" pgmap=\"575\">Having disposed of these preliminary questions, we shall proceed to consider the merits of the case. All persons in the profession must know that the title to chattels or choses in action does not pass by sale or gift, as to creditors or purchasers, unless accompanied by possession, either actual or constructive,\u2014and in this case there is not sufficient evidence to show that Fellows ever delivered or Heermans ever acquired possession of these instruments, under the deed of the 10th of October. He, in his testimony, does not say that there was actual or symbolical delivery, or that he had any control over them, or even saw them. He supposed, but does not know, that they were among Fellows\u2019 papers, to which he had access. From the evidence in the case we are strongly impressed with the belief that no such delivery was made as was necessary to pass title to Heermans. The presumption from the fact that Fellows had possession when he assigned them to Hill, is, that he never parted with them. Fellows occupied the office in which his papers were kept, and in which Heermans and the receiver transacted the business. It was in a room of \"his house, and he must have had access to all his papers after as before the execution of the deed of the 10th of October, 1868. Heermans does not say there was any change after that time. We are therefore of opinion that such a delivery is not shown as passed the title. If Heermans was claiming as a purchaser, it might be that such strict proof of a delivery would not be required; but he claims as a volunteer,\u2014and not only so, but he must claim for Fellows\u2019 estate, although in his bill and decree he claims in his own right. It is true that Hill took also as a volunteer, but appellant did not, as he paid value, and Fellows had assured him that he had the power to revoke the deeds of the 10th and 15th of October, and had the power to dispose of his property.</p> <p id=\"b575-6\" pgmap=\"575(19) 576(381) 577(55)\">It is, however, urged, that appellant exchanged property for this claim worth not exceeding $3000, but the other side asserts it was worth $17,000. In any event, Hill acknowledged in the assignment that he had received value, and it is admitted there was a consideration paid for the assignment. Did Hill acquire title by the assignment ? The instruments were payable to Fellows, they were at the time in his possession, and under the deed of the 10th of October, even if Heermans ever obtained possession he held the title for the use and benefit of Fellows; but if Heermans never acquired possession, then Fellows had the unquestioned right to transfer them, as he did, and Hill thereby became fully invested with the equitable title which he transferred to appellant, and he is authorized to enforce it against Heermans and the representatives of Fellows. Hill, by the assignment, took the title, and in equity he always held the title until his assignment to appellant. It is true it was pledged as security for the money borrowed of Lee, but in equity the title was in Hill, and he was a necessary party to foreclose his title. Heermans held all of Fellows\u2019 property of which he acquired possession, with power to sell, collect and reduce it to money, and pay it to Fellows, retaining expenses and commissions. In equity, Fellows was the only beneficiary, and had the absolute right to receive the money, and when received, to dispose of it as he might choose. On this right and power there was not the slightest restriction. It, in equity, was- his property, and held by Heermans solely for his use, from the time he executed the deed of the 10th of October, until' the time of his death, unless sold or otherwise disposed of, so as to pass the title. This being true, we are unable to perceive any valid reason why he could not sell and pass his equitable title to this bond and mortgage. By doing so no one\u2019s rights were invaded, or impaired, or wronged. Had this money been collected and paid to Fellows, no one could contend that he could not have given it- to Hill, and if so, he could surely anticipate its collection, and give the instruments that evidenced and secured the indebtedness. We are aware of no law that prohibits a person not under disability from selling his property, choses in action, or equitable rights. Heermans was clothed with a mere naked power, coupled with no interest. We have no hesitation in saying that the equitable title to these instruments passed to Hill, and appellant has succeeded to all his rights.</p> <p id=\"b577-5\" pgmap=\"577\">In reference to the decisions of the courts of New York and other States, we only need to say that although they grew out of this deed of October 10, 1868, the questions we have discussed were not involved, nor do they decide anything repugnant to the views here expressed.</p> <p id=\"b577-6\" pgmap=\"577\">For the reasons above given, the decree of the court below is reversed, and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b577-7\" pgmap=\"577\">Decree reversed.</p> <p id=\"b577-8\" pgmap=\"577\">Mr. Justice Craig, dissenting.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
