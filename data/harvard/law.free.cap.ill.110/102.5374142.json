Appeal\u2014reviewing controverted questions of fact\u2014effect of affirmance by Appellate Court. Where a judgment of the trial court, in an action of assumpsit upon a policy of life insurance, for the defendant, is affirmed by the Appellate Court, this will settle all controverted questions of fact against the plaintiff, and this court, on appeal, can not assume that any agent of the defendant was authorized either to waive a forfeiture already accrued, or to make a renewal contract of insurance.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b102-10\" pgmap=\"102\">2. Insurance\u2014waiver of forfeiture\u2014renewal of policy. A waiver of a right presupposes knowledge of the right waived, and is not to be inferred from a merely negligent act, or one done under a misapprehension of the real condition of the rights of the parties at the time; and a renewal contract of insurance necessarily requires the continued existence of that which is insured.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b102-11\" pgmap=\"102\">3. Same\u2014life insurance\u2014payment of premium after death of the assured. A person whose life was insured, on demand refused to pay the second annual premium, and died in about ten days after default in payment. Two days after the death, a subordinate agent of the company, and friend of the assured, being ignorant of his death, paid the premium, taking the insurance company\u2019s receipt renewing the policy. On learning of the death of the assured, the friend returned the receipt to the company, and it returned the money paid by him: Held, that the payment by such friend, which was made, and received by the company, in ignorance of the fact of the death of the assured, could then amount to nothing, and that the party to whom the policy was payable acquired no rights thereby.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-12\" pgmap=\"102\">Appeal from the Appellate Court for the First District;\u2014 heard in that court on writ of error to the Circuit Court of Cook county; the Hon.

The second premium was due November 30, 1881. At the time this premium was due, the company sent an agent to the assured, with a renewal receipt, to make demand for payment of the premium. This agent made the demand, and Miller refused to pay, and the receipt was returned to the company. Miller died on the 10th of December, 1881. On the 12th of December, 1881, one Farnham, a subordinate agent of the company and friend of Miller, being ignorant of the death of Miller, paid a part of the last installment to the company, and had the balance charged against his account on the books of the company, and took from the company the following receipt:</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-4\" pgmap=\"104\">\u201c Union Central Life Insurance Co., Cincinnati, Ohio:</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\" pgmap=\"104\">\u201cReceived $56.24, renewing- policy 21,386, of GeorgeH.

It is also agreed that the statements in application, and for the revival of said policy, are true.

The cause was tried by the court, without the intervention of a jury, and the judgment was for the defendant. On error to the Appellate Court for the First District this judgment was affirmed. This appeal is prosecuted to reverse that judgment.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-11\" pgmap=\"104\">Mr. Thomas Morrison, and Mr. John L.

(Edgerton v. Weaver et al. 105 Ill. 43.) We are not, therefore, authorized to assume, here, either that there was a payment of the last installment of premium due at the date of the death of the assured, or a waiver of the forfeiture resulting from the failure to make that payment. We can not, as against the conclusions of fact settled by the judgment of affirmance of the Appellate Court, assume that any agent of the appellant was authorized either to waive a forfeiture already accrued, or to make a renewal contract of insurance. A waiver presupposes knowledge of the right waived, and is not to be inferred from a purely negligent act, or one done under a misapprehension of the real condition of the rights of the parties at the time; and a renewal contract of insurance necessarily requires the continued existence of that which is insured. The payment by Farnham, which was made by him and received by the company in ignorance of the fact that Miller was then dead, could, then, amount to nothing, and appellant acquired no rights thereby.</p> <p id=\"b107-6\" pgmap=\"107\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b107-7\" pgmap=\"107\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
