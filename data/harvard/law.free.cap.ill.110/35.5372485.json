Mortgage\u2014whether a deed absolute, or a mortgage. The owner of city real estate, after making default of interest on a loan secured by trust deed on the same, turned over the possession of such property to his creditor, who, from that time, received the rents on the same; and after the advertisement of the premises for sale by the trustee, it was agreed that the creditor should bid in the same, and hold it in trust for the debtor until an accounting could be had, when, if the debtor was still owing the creditor anything, a new loan was to be made upon the property. The property was so purchased by the creditor, who shortly afterward caused a judgment by confession to be entered against the debtor for an alleged deficiency between the sum due on the loan and the amount of the bid, upon which an execution was issued, and levied upon other property of the debtor, which was also sold, and bought by such creditor: Held, that the trustee\u2019s deed to the creditor was in equity a mortgage, and that the debtor had the right to redeem.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Av\" pgmap=\"36\">2. Agency\u2014extent of agent\u2019s authority\u2014of facts from which it may be inferred. A debtor applied to an agent of his creditor for an extension of the time of payment or a renewal of the loan, the creditor being a non-resident corporation, and the agent a resident of the State, acting generally for the creditor as to loans in this State. At the first interview the agent stated to the debtor that he would communicate with the home office in regard to the proposition made, and afterward such agent, in another interview, said he was ready to enter into the arrangement that was thereupon made: Held, that from these facts the debtor might properly infer that the agent received the principal\u2019s sanction for entering into the arrangement he made, and that the debtor was justified in his reliance upon the agent\u2019s authority to make it.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b36-8\" pgmap=\"36\">3. Interest\u2014the rate not changed by a change in form of the security. A mere change in the form of the security for a debt for money loaned will not operate to change the rate of interest to be paid from that reserved in the original contract. As, where the creditor bids off the property at a sale under a deed of trust which secures the debt, and agrees with the debtor to hold the title under the trustee\u2019s deed as a security until an accounting can be had as to rents received by the creditor and a new loan is made, which is not done, on a bill for an accounting and for redemption from the trust deed and the trustee\u2019s deed, the decree should require the complainant to pay the stipulated rate of interest provided for in the notes, up to the time of the redemption; and it is error to require the payment of six per cent only from the date of the trustee\u2019s deed, when a higher rate had been reserved in the original contract.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b36-9\" pgmap=\"36\">4.

The bill further alleges that in violation of said agreement, the defendant, on the 22d day of July, 1879, caused to be entered against complainant, in the Superior Court of Cook county, a judgment by confession, for a pretended deficiency between the amount due on the loans and the amount of the bids at such sales, and upon execution issued, bought in certain other property than that described in said trust deeds, for the sum of $254, for which was issued a certificate of purchase. The circuit court, on hearing, decreed in favor of the complainant, and the defendant appealed.</p> <p id=\"b39-6\" pgmap=\"39\">The proof quite satisfactorily establishes that previous to the trustee\u2019s sales there was made such an arrangement, substantially, as that alleged in the bill, and showing the existence of such a state of facts that defendant, under the sales that were made, must be taken to hold the property purchased but as security for the payment of the sums of money mentioned in the trust deeds. There is really no attempt at denial, by the evidence, that the alleged arrangement which was testified to by complainant and his attorney, or at least some arrangement to the effect that the property was to be bid in by the company, and be held but as security for their mortgage debt, was in fact made with Mr. Warfield, the defendant\u2019s agent at Chicago for the collection of moneys loaned in this State, but it is denied that the agent had authority to make such an arrangement. The agent appears to have been acting under a written agreement between him and the company, as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b39-7\" pgmap=\"39(22) 40(64)\">\u201cThe party of the first part (Warfield) hereby agrees with the party of the second part (the defendant) to act as its agent at Chicago, for the collection of moneys loaned by it in the State of Illinois aforesaid, and have the general management of the affairs of said company in relation to its loans and securities therefor, according to such written instructions as shall be from time to time given to him by the said party of the second part, or its executive officers.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b40-7\" pgmap=\"40\">It is said that under this agency the arrangement agreed upon could have been made only under written instructions to make it, and none such are here shown. It does not appear that this written agreement was ever brought to the knowledge of the complainant or his attorney. Mr. Warfield himself testifies' that he had general instructions to renew loans by making new papers at six per cent interest, provided the parties would pay one-twentieth of the principal sum every six months until the whole indebtedness was paid. It was testified to that at the first interview with Warfield upon the subject, he stated that he would communicate with the home office in regard to the proposition made, and that afterward, at a subsequent interview, he said he was ready to make the arrangement, and he did enter into the arrangement. We think, from all this, the complainant might very properly infer that Warfield had received the company\u2019s sanction for entering into the arrangement which he made, and that complainant was justified in his reliance upon the agent\u2019s authority to make it.</p> <p id=\"b40-8\" pgmap=\"40(114) 41(295)\">The court below found \u201cthat said trustee\u2019s deeds of Levi D. Boone (the trustee) to the defendant are, in equity, mortgages, and that the complainant, by reason of the premises, has a right to redeem under the said two original trust deeds, and the deeds of said Levi D. Boone to the defendant, computing the interest as provided for in said trust deeds until they were merged into the deeds of Levi D. Boone to the defendant, and from that time at a legal rate of interest. \u201d We are satisfied with the correctness of the decree in respect of the right of redemption, but think the decree incorrect in the particular of allowing, in the computation of interest, only the legal rate of interest from the time of the making of the trustee\u2019s deeds to defendant. We are of opinion the stipulated rate of interest named in the trust deeds, and the notes they were given to secure, should have been computed'uninterruptedly. There was no merger of the trust deeds and the notes they were given to secure in the trustee\u2019s deeds, which Boone, the trustee, executed to the defendant, so as to stop the running of the stipulated rate of interest. There was a mere change in the form of the security, and the property still remained in defendant\u2019s hands as a security for the indebtedness secured by the trust deeds, and the complainant had but the right of redemption upon the payment of such indebtedness according to its tenor and effect. The reduction of interest from the stipulated to the legal rate/ could only be justified as in the enforcement of the specific performance of a contract to re-loan the money at that rate. But the claim or proceeding of complainant is not at all of that nature. The written declaration of complainant in the matter filed and recorded in the recorder\u2019s office of Cook county is, that the trustee\u2019s deed made to the defendant, although absolute in form, is but a mortgage to secure their mortgage debt, which the trust deeds were given to secure. The object of the bill is to redeem, it offering to pay whatever may be found to be due upon an accounting. The right of redemption is the claim which is made and asserted, and the condition of its allowance should be upon the payment of the mortgage debt in accordance with \"its terms.</p> <p id=\"b41-5\" pgmap=\"41\">For the error indicated in respect of the computation of interest the decree will be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b41-6\" pgmap=\"41\">Decree reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
