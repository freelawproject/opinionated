As a general rule, in equity the proofs and allegations of the bill must correspond, and a party will not be entitled to relief, although the evidence may establish a clear case in his favor, unless there are averments in the bill to support the case made.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b290-17\" pgmap=\"290\">2. Parol evidence\u2014to show mistake in a written instrument. Parol evidence is admissible on a bill in equity to reform a written contract on the ground of mistake, to establish the fact of there being a mistake; and such cases, like cases of fraud, form an exception to the general rule, which excludes parol evidence to vary written contracts.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b290-18\" pgmap=\"290\">3. Mistake\u2014of the quantum of evidence. A deed or other instrument of writing should not be reformed for mistake unless the evidence of it is clear and positive. The mistake must be clearly made out by satisfactory proofs.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b290-19\" pgmap=\"290\">4. Grant of right to mine and remove coal\u2014of rights incident thereto \u2014relief in chancery without special prayer. A deed giving the grantee the right to mine, excavate and remove coal under a. certain tract of land, carries witi it, as an incident, the right to go upon the land and dig for coal, or to sink a coal shaft. And it is not necessary that a bill to reform a deed conveying such right to mine coal, for a mistake in the description of the land, should contain a special prayer for a decree authorizing the grantee to go upon the land. The deed, when corrected, confers this right of itself.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-20\" pgmap=\"290\">Writ of Error to the Circuit Court of Marion county; the Hon.

The defendant is a remote grantee of the plaintiff, hence it can enforce its equity and have the mistake corrected. 1 Story\u2019s Eq. sec. 165; Mills et al. v. Lockwood, 42 Ill. 111; Wilson v.

The deed conveyed the exclusive right to mine and excavate for coal, and to remove the same under and beneath the east half of the north-west quarter of section 17, township 2, north of range 1, east of the third principal meridian, in Marion county, and it is alleged in the bill that it was the intention to convey the east half of the north-east quarter of section 17; that the scrivener by mistake inserted in the deed, \u201ceast half of the north-west quarter of section 17, \u201d when the grantor and grantee intended to insert in the deed, \u201ceast half of the north-east quarter of section 17. \u201d The defendant put in an answer to the bill, and the court, on the hearing, found that all the material allegations of the bill were sustained by the evidence, and rendered a decree as prayed for in the bill, to reverse which the defendant sued out this writ of error.</p> <p id=\"b292-6\" pgmap=\"292(116) 293(135)\">It is first contended that the decree is erroneous because the allegations and proofs do not agree. In proceedings in equity, as a general rule, the proofs and the allegations of the bill must correspond, and a party will not be entitled to relief, although the evidence may establish a clear case in his favor, unless there are averments in the bill to support the case made. (Morgan v. Smith, 11 Ill. 194.) But upon an examination of the allegations of the bill, and the evidence introduced in support of those allegations, we find no substantial variance upon any material averment. A mistake in the description of the land embraced in the deed is alleged, and that is established by evidence. It does not militate against the decree that the mistake was established in part by parol evidence. Upon this point, Story, see. 156, says: \u201cWe must therefore treat the cases in which equity affords relief, and allows parol evidence to vary and reform written contracts and instruments upon the ground of accident and mistake, as properly forming, like cases of fraud, exceptions to the general rule, which excludes parol evidence, and as standing in the same policy as the rule itself.\u201d A deed or other instrument of writing should not be reformed unless the evidence of mistake is clear and positive,\u2014or as said by Story, sec. 157: \u201cBelief will be granted in cases of written instruments only where there is a plain mistake, clearly made out by satisfactory proofs.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b293-5\" pgmap=\"293\">But it is said that the court erred in decreeing more relief than the allegations of the bill and prayer asked, in this, that the decree authorizes complainant to enter upon defendant\u2019s land and sink a coal shaft. The right to mine coal on the land was conveyed by the deed, and the right to go upon the land and dig for coal passed as an incident to the conveyance. We do not think it was necessary for complainant\u2019s bill to contain a special prayer for a decree authorizing him to go upon the land. That followed as a matter of course. When the mistake was corrected the deed conferred the right to go upon the land and mine the coal, as specified in the deed. But even if it was necessary for the complainant to pray for relief of this character, the prayer -for general relief was all that was required.</p> <p id=\"b293-6\" pgmap=\"293\">In conclusion, we think the evidence fully sustains the decree, and we perceive no substantial error in the record. The decree of the circuit court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b293-7\" pgmap=\"293\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
