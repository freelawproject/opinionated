In\n   <em>\n    Goldman v. Critter Control of New Jersey\n   </em>\n   , A-1392-16 (\n   <em>\n    Critter Control\n   </em>\n   ), plaintiff Stuart Goldman appeals from the September 6, 2016 order that dismissed with prejudice the complaint he filed against defendants Critter Control of New Jersey, Kewin, Inc. d/b/a Critter Control of New Jersey, Robert McDonough and Evan Windholz (Critter Control defendants). In this complaint, plaintiff sought civil penalties under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (PCAA), N.J.S.A. 4:22-11.1 to -60. Plaintiff also\n   appeals from the November 4, 2016 order\n   that denied reconsideration and his motion to amend the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Goldman v. Carlstrom, Hill, and Simplicity Farms\n   </em>\n   , A-3906-16 (\n   <em>\n    Simplicity Farms\n   </em>\n   ), plaintiff appeals from the April 19, 2017 order that dismissed his complaint with prejudice against defendants Madison Carlstrom, Matthew Hill and Simplicity Farms (Simplicity Farm defendants) and denied his motion to file a second amended complaint. We consolidate these appeals because plaintiff sought statutory penalties under N.J.S.A. 4:22-26 in both complaints based on allegations of animal cruelty against defendants and both complaints were dismissed for lack of standing. The factual allegations are based on plaintiff's complaints. We affirm the orders for reasons that follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff is the former chief humane law enforcement officer for the Monmouth County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Monmouth SPCA). He also is a trustee for two non-profit animal welfare organizations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Critter Control\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff alleged that in May 2015, he learned from a resident of Matawan that Critter Control defendants trapped a female adult raccoon and removed it from the roof of a house. Although Critter Control defendants claimed the raccoon was not lactating, a few days later baby raccoons were discovered in the gutters of the same house. Plaintiff alleged the baby raccoons had gone without sustenance for a week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff filed a complaint \"by way of ... qui tam\" against Critter Control defendants, seeking \"damages and civil penalties\" for violations of N.J.S.A. 4:22-26 for \"animal cruelty, animal abuse, negligence, recklessness, [and] negligent infliction of emotional distress.\" He alleged that Critter Control defendants violated N.J.S.A. 4:22-26(a)(4) by failing, \"as the owner or a person otherwise charged with the care of a living animal or creature, to provide the living animal or creature with necessary care, or otherwise cause or procure such an act to be done.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A person who violates that statute \"[s]hall forfeit and pay a sum\" according to a schedule set forth in the statute,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   to be sued for and recovered, with costs, in a civil action\n   <em>\n    by any person in the name of the New Jersey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals\n   </em>\n   or a county society for the prevention of cruelty to animals, as appropriate, or, in the name of the municipality if brought by a certified animal control officer or animal cruelty investigator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [ N.J.S.A. 4:22-26 (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Penalties for a violation of N.J.S.A. 4:22-26(a)(4) range from $500 to $2000. Plaintiff's complaint demanded compensatory and consequential damages, statutory civil penalties, punitive damages and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Critter Control defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, asserting that plaintiff lacked standing. On September 6, 2016, the trial court granted their motion and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The statute was \"plain and unambiguous,\" according to the trial court's rider to its order, providing that \"only select organizations, not individuals, may pursue a civil remedy under the statute.\" Because plaintiff brought the complaint \"in his individual name, not in the name of the [New Jersey] SPCA, a county society for the prevention of animals, or Monmouth County,\" plaintiff lacked standing to proceed with the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff's reconsideration motion, captioned as \"Stuart Goldman in the name of the Monmouth [SPCA],\" also asked to amend the complaint to show that he was\n   filing it in the name of the Monmouth SPCA. He certified that the Monmouth SPCA had no objection to his lawsuit. The motions were denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Simplicity Farms\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff's April 2016 complaint alleged that Simplicity Farm defendants violated N.J.S.A. 4:22-26(a)(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and N.J.S.A. 4:22-26(a)(4) by mistreating horses. The complaint alleged\n   improper medical treatment of the horses, beatings, lack of food, and lack of medical attention, resulting in the death of a colt. Plaintiff disagreed with the Monmouth SPCA's decision not to pursue criminal or civil charges against Simplicity Farm defendants. Plaintiff's complaint purported to be a qui tam action that sought compensatory damages, statutory civil penalties, punitive damages and attorney's fees. On January 9, 2017, defendants' unopposed motion to dismiss was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff asked for reconsideration and to amend the complaint's caption as \"Stuart Goldman in the name of the Monmouth County [SPCA].\" Although the trial judge vacated the January 9, 2017 dismissal in order to consider plaintiff's opposition, she nonetheless granted defendants' motion to dismiss on April 19, 2017, for lack of standing and denied as futile plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court concluded that the Legislature intended to have \"uniform rules and regulations\" for the enforcement of animal cruelty laws. If the complaint were allowed to proceed, the effect would \"eviscerat[e] all of the sections of the statute ... regarding the appointment, training, [and] supervision of agents who have been determined [to] have the ability to engage in that function.\" The judge rejected plaintiff's contention that a private individual had authority under N.J.S.A. 4:22-26 to investigate or prosecute allegations of animal cruelty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal in\n   <em>\n    Critter Control\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff alleges he had standing to sue in the name of the Monmouth SPCA as a qui tam action and that the court erred by not granting his motion for reconsideration to allow him to amend the complaint with the proper caption. Also, he claims the court erred by not granting relief under Rule 4:50-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Simplicity Farms\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff contends his complaint should not have been dismissed because the statute authorizes \"any person in the name of\" the SPCA to file a civil action. His proposed second amended complaint was not \"futile\" because it was a qui tam action. We find no merit in these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"Standing is a threshold requirement for justiciability.\"\n   <em>\n    Watkins v.

He did not claim to own, control or have any financial interest in any of the animals involved in these cases. Plaintiff filed the complaints in his name and not in the name of the New Jersey SPCA or Monmouth SPCA. The complaint in\n   <em>\n    Critter Control\n   </em>\n   was dismissed because plaintiff did not have standing as an individual to sue those defendants.

It appointed agents \"for enforcing all laws and ordinances enacted for the protection of animals and for the investigation of alleged acts of cruelty to animals within the State.\" N.J.S.A. 4:22-11.4(e). All \"humane law enforcement officers\" were trained \"in accordance with mandatory uniform standards, guidelines, and procedures for the operation of all county societies.\" N.J.S.A. 4:22-11.8(b). Both the New Jersey SPCA and county societies could sue and be sued in court.

N.J.S.A. 4:22-17 sets forth acts that are unlawful and the range of permissible fines and/or terms of imprisonment. N.J.S.A. 4:22-26 sets forth acts that constitute animal cruelty and civil penalties for violations. N.J.S.A. 4:22-26 provides that the civil penalties can be \"sued for and recovered ... by any person in the name of the New Jersey [SPCA].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The penalties for violations of N.J.S.A. 4:22-26\"shall be enforced and collected in a summary manner under the 'Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999,' [ N.J.S.A. 2A:58-10 ].\" N.J.S.A. 4:22-32.

He notes the \"any person\" language was maintained despite the legislation's recent amendments. This language by itself does not signal authority for qui tam litigation in light of the legislation's other provisions. We will therefore look to other extrinsic sources to aid our interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Early versions of the statute give some support to plaintiff's cause. In 1868, the legislation allowed \"one-half of the fines and forfeitures collected through the instrumentality of the society, its members or agents\" to accrue to the \"benefit of said society\" for its purposes.\n   <em>\n    L.\n   </em>\n   1868,\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   335, \u00a7 5.

One-half was to be paid \"to the informer,\n   complainant or prosecutor\" and the other half was paid to the local SPCA if in existence or to the State SPCA, if not.\n   <em>\n    L.\n   </em>\n   1880,\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   157, \u00a7 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    N.J.

Even if\n   <em>\n    Russ\n   </em>\n   provided some insight on the issue before us, the Court apparently did not take note of a 1908 amendment that changed the payment structure in Section 15. As of April 10, 1908, \"[n]o part of any fine, penalty or money imposed or collected for any offense in violation of any act for the prevention of cruelty to animals shall be paid by any court to the complainant, informer or prosecutor, but all such fines, penalties or moneys shall be paid\" to the county SPCA where the offense occurred.\n   <em>\n    L.\n   </em>\n   1908,\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   148, \u00a7 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After 1908, no fines, penalties or moneys collected were shared with any entity other than the various SPCA organizations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 4:22-55. Because the Court in\n   <em>\n    Russ\n   </em>\n   held that qui tam actions involved a sharing of moneys recovered, the 1908 amendment undercut\n   <em>\n    Russ\n   </em>\n   's construction of the statute as authorizing qui tam lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The penalties for violations of N.J.S.A. 4:22-26 are to be \"enforced and collected in a summary manner\" under the Penalty Enforcement Law (PEL), N.J.S.A. 2A:58-10. That has been the case at least since 1953 when the PCAA was amended to reflect the PEL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    L.\n   </em>\n   1953,\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   5, \u00a7 69. The PEL authorizes \"an\n   administrative agency of the State\" that has been awarded a \"fixed amount of money as a civil penalty,\" following the opportunity for a hearing under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), N.J.S.A. 52:14B-1 to -15, to record the final order as a judgment. If a statute or ordinance authorized a civil penalty, the PEL authorizes a summary action in the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Judgments for civil penalties are to be paid to the State Treasurer unless the statute provides another disposition. \"An action under the [PEL] ... is civil in nature.\"\n   <em>\n    Game v.
