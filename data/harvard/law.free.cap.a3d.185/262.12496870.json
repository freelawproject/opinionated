Defendant asserted his first PCR counsel was ineffective for not claiming trial counsel was ineffective regarding a potential witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We hold that defendant's second petition was untimely under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:22-12(a)(2)'s time limits. Those limits cannot be relaxed by invoking\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:1-2 or\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:22-12(a)(1), because the Supreme Court in 2009 and 2010 amended\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:3-4,\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:22-4(b), and\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:22-12 to preclude enlargement or relaxation. Those amendments apply to defendant, who had no vested right to file a petition fourteen years out of time. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 20, 1999, Shavonne Young, defendant's sixteen-year-old girlfriend and the mother of their two children, died after being shot six times. Three days earlier, Young had reported to police that \"[defendant] raped me.\" Defendant confessed that \"he shot Miss Shavonne Young,\" identified the firearm he used, and signed a written confession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant's second PCR petition is based on facts set forth fourteen years earlier in a May 15, 2001 pretrial hearing. About a month before trial, defendant's trial attorneys Donna Scocozza and Anita Treasurer obtained a written statement from Malika Williams, the girlfriend of defendant's brother. In her statement, Williams claimed that she, defendant, and his brother drove to Young's apartment, that the brother showed them the gun, and that she and defendant waited in the car while his brother went into Young's apartment and shot her. Defendant's trial attorneys provided Williams's statement to the prosecutor in discovery. About a week later, Scocozza told the prosecutor that, in a phone call between Scocozza and Williams, Williams said her written statement was untrue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant's trial attorneys subpoenaed Williams to testify, and moved to enforce the subpoena. The State moved to disqualify Scocozza because she might have to testify about Williams's oral recantation. The trial judge denied the motions on May 15, 2001. During trial, Williams appeared, acknowledged she had been subpoenaed, and was instructed to return on the day\n   the defense case began. However, she failed to do so.\n   Defendant testified at trial, and retracted his confession. He testified he, his brother, and Williams drove to Young's apartment, and he and Williams waited in the car while his brother took a gun, went into the apartment and shot Young.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The jury convicted defendant of: first-degree purposeful and knowing murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a)(1) and (2) ; first-degree felony murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a)(3) ; second-degree burglary, N.J.S.A. 2C:18-2 ; third-degree terroristic threats, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-3 ; third-degree unlawful possession of a handgun, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-5(b) ; and second-degree possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-4(a). The trial court imposed a term of life imprisonment with a thirty-year period of parole ineligibility. At sentencing, defendant said: \"I did commit this crime and I'm sorry for what happened and ... Williams was available and requested to come, but my lawyer refused to call her[.]\" On direct appeal, defendant claimed trial counsel was ineffective.

In his pro se brief, he again claimed his trial counsel was ineffective. First PCR counsel was appointed, and filed a brief alleging eleven ways trial counsel was ineffective, including by failing to call Williams as a trial witness. The PCR judge, who also presided over the trial, denied defendant's petition on April 27, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 7, 2007, defendant filed a pro se motion for reconsideration, arguing first PCR counsel was ineffective in handling the claim regarding Williams.
