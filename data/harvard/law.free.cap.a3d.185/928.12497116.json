The Re-adoption governs the disability retirement application process for various State public retirement systems. In challenging amended N.J.A.C. 17:1-6.4, N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.5, and N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.10, the New Jersey Education Association (NJEA) argues\n   the Division exceeded its statutory authority and acted arbitrarily. The NJEA urges us to invalidate the challenged regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Understanding that administrative regulations are entitled to a presumption of validity and reasonableness, and giving the Division wide latitude to achieve its legislatively assigned tasks, we hold that most of the challenged regulations comport with the terms and objectives of the governing statutes. That is, the Division mainly acted consistently with the enabling statutes, which it reasonably interpreted. Yet, there are a few instances where that is not the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   So we uphold N.J.A.C. 17:1-6.4 (the separation from service rule);\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.10(a)(1) (part of the documentation amendment); N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.10(e) (the certification amendment); N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.10(f) (the one retirement application amendment); N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.10(j) (the notification amendment); and N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.5(c) and (c)(1) (part of the subsequent independent medical examination (IME) amendment). But we invalidate N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.5(c)(2) through (c)(4)-which require applicants to pay for subsequent IMEs-and N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.10(a)(2)-which requires applicants to pay for addenda to IMEs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In general, the primary practical effect of our holding-as to the separation of service rule-maintains the longstanding principle that eligibility for disability retirement benefits requires members to make a prima facie showing that they cannot work due to a disability. To that end, voluntary or involuntary termination of employment, for non-disability reasons, generally deems a member ineligible for disability benefits. Such a holding comports with the existing overall framework of the enabling, eligibility, and rehabilitation statutes, and policies applicable to the various State\n   public retirement systems. To hold otherwise would require us to re-write the text of multiple statutes, which has never been the role of the judiciary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A familiar standard of review guides our holding and analysis. \"Administrative regulations are entitled to a presumption of validity and reasonableness.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 11:3-29\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899790\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/410/6/#p24\">\n    410 N.J.

The Re-adoption deals with the Division's administration\n   of these State retirement systems, and the challenged regulations generally address disability retirement eligibility and related applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Disability retirement applicants generally apply for ordinary or accidental disability retirement benefits. There are multiple statutes that permit these benefits. For example, N.J.S.A. 43:16A-6 to -7 (PFRS); N.J.S.A. 43:15A-42 to -46 (PERS); N.J.S.A. 18A:66-39 to -42 (TPAF); N.J.S.A. 53:5A-9 to -10 (SPRS); N.J.S.A. 43:16-2 (CPFPF) ; N.J.S.A. 43:6A-12 (JRS) ; and N.J.S.A. 43:7-12 (POPF). The question is whether the challenged regulations- N.J.A.C. 17:1-6.4, N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.5, and N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.10 -are inconsistent with the legislative intent expressed in the various enabling statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The enabling statutes, in their entirety, are N.J.S.A. 43:16A-1 to -68 (PFRS); N.J.S.A. 43:15A-1 to -161 (PERS); N.J.S.A. 18A:66-1 to -93 (TPAF); N.J.S.A. 53:5A-1 to -47 (SPRS); N.J.S.A. 43:16-1 to -21 (CPFPF); N.J.S.A. 43:6A-1 to -47 (JRS); and N.J.S.A. 43:7-7 to -27 (POPF)-all of which we have considered in great depth. For purposes of our plain text analysis, the pertinent language of each statute is nearly identical or substantially similar: \"Upon retirement for [ordinary, accidental, or special]\n   <em>\n    disability\n   </em>\n   , a member shall receive\" the applicable retirement allowance.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , N.J.S.A. 43:16A-6(2), -6.1(b), -7(2) (PFRS) (emphasis added); N.J.S.A. 18A:66-41, -42 (TPAF) (emphasis added); N.J.S.A. 53:5A-9(b) (SPRS) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We begin by addressing whether N.J.A.C. 17:1-6.4 -the separation from service rule-is consistent with the legislative intent expressed in the statutes governing the State retirement systems. This new rule generally requires disability retirement applicants to prove that their asserted disability is \"the reason the member left employment.\" N.J.A.C. 17:1-6.4(a). The rule also bars members\n   from applying for a disability retirement if they voluntarily or involuntarily terminate service for any of the following reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   1. Removal for cause or total forfeiture of public service;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   2. Settlement agreements reached due to pending administrative or criminal charges, unless the underlying charges relate to the disability;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   3. Loss of licensure or certification required for the performance of the member's specific job duties;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   4.

It noted that, \"[i]f their service ends on the basis of other grounds, some members decide to apply for a disability retirement, in order to try to receive the highest retirement benefits available under their former membership.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322275\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/222/175/#p184\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   According to the Division, the separation from service rule \"is intended to prevent members from applying for a disability retirement benefit when their service has voluntarily or involuntarily terminated for reasons unrelated to a disability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322275\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/222/175/#p184\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It explained that such former members\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   do not qualify for disability retirement benefits, as they were not totally and permanently disabled from performing\n   their job duties when their service ended; their public service ended for a reason completely unrelated to a physical or mental disability that keeps them from continuing to perform their job duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The purpose of the separation from service rule, according to the Division, \"is to prevent individuals from applying for disability retirement benefits who are ineligible and do not qualify.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322275\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/222/175/#p184\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The NJEA argues that under the statutory framework governing the State-administered retirement systems, \"members are not disqualified from disability retirement if they are separated from\n   service for reasons other than their disability.\" According to the NJEA, members who suffer a qualifying disability must receive disability retirement benefits, even if their separation from public service is for a reason unrelated to the disability, such as termination for cause. It contends that the separation from service rule adds a requirement for receiving disability retirement benefits that is not present in the enabling statutes. In essence, it argues that the inquiry should end with the recognition that the statutes' eligibility provisions do not expressly require that retirement disability applicants leave service because of the disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   It is true that the plain text of the enabling statutes does not explicitly say that a disability retirement applicant must have left public service due to a disability. But still, the statutes governing the retirement systems make clear that, although a person eligible for benefits is entitled to a liberal interpretation of a pension statute, \"eligibility [itself] is not to be liberally permitted.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Dep't of Treasury, Div. of Pensions &amp; Benefits\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3827328\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/390/209/#p213\">\n    390 N.J.

It is obvious to us that there is no such explicit text in the enabling statutes because it is common sense that disability retirees leave their jobs due to a purported disability. After all, the employee seeks\n   <em>\n    disability\n   </em>\n   retirement benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Applying our standard of review-by considering the entire enabling legislation and statutory policies-we conclude that the premise of NJEA's contention (that membership is the sole qualification for receiving disability retirement benefits) is incorrect for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   First, various eligibility statutes presume that an applicant is employed when filing a disability retirement application. In general, an eligibility statute provides applicable guidelines for determining whether an applicant qualifies for benefits. To that end, there are numerous references to a disability applicant's current employer or employment duty.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , N.J.S.A. 18A:66-39(b) (TPAF statute allowing the employer to apply for disability retirement on behalf of the employee); N.J.S.A. 18A:66-39(c) (TPAF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   statute requiring employer certification as part of application); N.J.S.A. 18A:66-2(e) (TPAF statute defining \"[e]mployer\" in the present tense as \"the State, the board of education or any educational institution or agency of or within the State by which a teacher\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   paid\" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 43:16A-7(1) (providing that, for a PFRS member to receive accidental disability retirement benefits, the member must prove incapacity for \"the performance of his [or her] usual duty and of any other available duty in the department which\n   <em>\n    his [or her] employer is willing to assign to him [or her]\n   </em>\n   '' (emphasis added) ); N.J.S.A. 43:16A-1(6) (PFRS statute defining \"[e]mployer\" in the present tense as \"the State of New Jersey, the county, municipality or political subdivision thereof which\n   <em>\n    pays\n   </em>\n   the particular\n   policeman or fireman\" (emphasis added) ). The eligibility statutes also require a finding that the applicant is \"incapacitated for the performance of duty.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , N.J.S.A. 18A:66-39(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   True, the TPAF and PERS statutes allow membership to continue for two years following the final pension contribution. N.J.S.A. 18A:66-7(a) (TPAF) (stating generally that membership shall cease if the member \"discontinue[s] his [or her] service for more than two consecutive years\"); N.J.S.A. 43:15A-7(e) (PERS) (indicating that \"[m]embership of any person in the retirement system shall cease if he [or she] shall discontinue his [or her] service for more than two consecutive years\"). But even if one is technically a member, a terminated former employee removed for cause has no employer from which to receive assignments, or duty to perform during that two-year period. Thus, the references in the eligibility statutes-to a current employer and a current duty-render it unlikely that the Legislature intended membership to be the sole qualification for disability retirement benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Second, rehabilitation statutes entitle a disability retiree whose disability has abated to return to active service.\n   <em>\n    Klumb v.

For example, the civil service statutes declare that, \"[i]t is the public policy of this State to provide public officials with appropriate appointment, supervisory and other personnel authority to execute properly their constitutional and statutory responsibilities.\" N.J.S.A. 11A:1-2(b). And \"[i]t is the public policy of this State to encourage and reward meritorious performance by employees in the public service and to retain and separate employees on the basis of the adequacy of their performance.\" N.J.S.A. 11A:1-2(c).

Members who leave public service for reasons unrelated to a disability are not entitled to disability retirement benefits in the first instance. Nothing is being taken away, and the automatic forfeiture statutes do not and cannot override the rehabilitation statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As to the validity of N.J.A.C. 17:1-6.4(b)(5) (dealing with a \"[j]ob abolishment or [RIF]\"), we make the following observations and modification. A member whose position may be the subject of a RIF is eligible for retirement disability benefits before the effective date of the abolishment of that position, so long as the member is unable to work due to the purported disability. If the member suffers from, or discovers, a disabling injury while looking for new work-in anticipation of the abolishment-then the member would likewise be entitled to apply for such benefits. But unlike in\n   <em>\n    New Jersey Education Ass'n v. Board of Trustees of T.P.A.F.\n   </em>\n   , No. A-3158-15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202979397\">\n    2017 WL 2979397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. Div. July 13, 2017) (slip op. at 8) -where we\n   remarked that the NJEA had not demonstrated how the existing legislation could render a TPAF member (who was terminated for a non-disability reason) otherwise eligible for a disability retirement-the NJEA has partially made such a showing as it relates to the abolishment of a tenured teaching position due to a RIF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For example, a teacher who loses a job due to a RIF remains on a reemployment list and, based on seniority, is entitled to reemployment when a vacancy occurs, if still qualified for the position. N.J.S.A. 18A:28-12. A similar provision exists for PFRS. N.J.S.A. 43:16A-3(5) ;\n   <em>\n    Cologna v. Bd. of Trs. of P.F.R.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3728355\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/430/362/#p365\">\n    430 N.J.

Such a teacher, however, may suffer or discover a disability after the abolishment of the position pending employment reinstatement. Although the abolishment of the position temporarily alters the employer-employee relationship, the teacher would arguably have an \"employment duty\"-based on seniority pending recall-from which to return. Consequently, pursuant to N.J.A.C. 17:1-6.4(b)(5), that teacher, who suffers from a disability pending recall, might be unable to return to the recalled work duty due to the disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   A plain reading of N.J.A.C. 17:1-6.4(b)(5)-under this rare fact pattern-would be inconsistent with the purpose of the separation of service rule and the overall framework of the enabling, eligibility,\n   and rehabilitation statutes, and policies applicable to the State public retirement systems. Nevertheless, we choose to modify Section (b)(5) rather than completely invalidate it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Applying Section (b)(5) to teachers whose jobs have been abolished due to a RIF and who have not suffered a disability pending reinstatement is consistent with the enabling statutes and related legislative directives. Such an application of Section (b)(5) also accords with our conclusion in\n   <em>\n    New Jersey Education Ass'n\n   </em>\n   , slip op. at 8, that a TPAF member is ineligible for disability retirement when that member's employment has been terminated for a non-disability reason. Therefore, invalidation of Section (b)(5) is unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   But modification of Section (b)(5) is appropriate for those public employees whose positions have been abolished due to a RIF, and who have suffered a disability pending reinstatement to a recalled job. Teachers, and other public retirement system members in this unique position, should be allowed to apply for and, if otherwise eligible, receive disability retirement benefits. That is so because such members would have an \"employment duty\" from which to return (even though the employer-employee relationship has been temporarily altered pending reinstatement), and the purported disability would arguably prevent the member from resuming the job duties in the recalled position. Consequently, Section (b)(5) is modified accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We now turn to N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.5 -the so-called subsequent IME amendment-which governs the Division's treatment of disability retirement applications after filing. The Re-adoption added subsections (c)(1) through (c)(4). On this point, we partially agree with the NJEA that the Division's action was unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In general, if the Medical Review Board (MRB) decides that it requires additional information regarding a disability retirement application, the Disability Review Section (DRS) will schedule an initial IME, provided at no cost to the applicant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.5(c)(1). If the applicant \"fails to attend and fails to cancel the\n   initial IME scheduled by the [DRS], the applicant will be required to pay for any subsequent medical examinations arranged by the [DRS].\" N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.5(c)(2). \"Failure to provide payment for the rescheduled IME within [ninety] days of the missed appointment date will result in the dismissal of the disability retirement case.\" N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.5(c)(3). The applicant \"will be responsible to pay the IME's contractual rate for any subsequent IME required when additional medical documentation is submitted after the initial medical examination.\" N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.5(c)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The NJEA argues that the governing statutes do not authorize the Division to require applicants to pay for IMEs or to cancel applications for failure to pay for an IME. The NJEA also argues that the subsequent IME amendment's lack of a good cause exception and failure to specify the method for calculating IME contractual rates render the regulation capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Although the governing statutes generally allow the MRB to order IMEs to supplement information provided by an applicant in certain circumstances, they are silent regarding which party must pay for the IMEs.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , N.J.S.A. 43:16A-8 (PFRS) ; N.J.S.A. 43:15A-42, -43 (PERS); N.J.S.A. 18A:66-39 (TPAF) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   N.J.A.C. 17:2-6.26 (PERS regulation explaining that an IME will be required only when medical documentation accompanying the application is insufficient). The Division argues that this silence authorizes the subsequent IME amendment because, unlike in other contexts-\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Unemployment Compensation Law, N.J.S.A. 43:21-15(b) -the Legislature did not specifically prohibit charging applicants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   To be sure, the Unemployment Compensation Law, prevents the Department of Labor and Workforce Development from imposing any fees upon unemployment compensation applicants. According to the Division, because the Legislature could have specified that disability retirement applicants shall not be charged any fees, as it did in the unemployment compensation context, its\n   failure to do so within the pension statutes authorizes the Division to shift IME costs onto applicants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   But, the Unemployment Compensation Law, unlike the pension statutes, does not contemplate an implementing agency ordering an applicant to attend a costly IME as a condition to an application. N.J.S.A. 43:21-1 to -24.30. Indeed, an applicant's medical condition is irrelevant to unemployment compensation benefits. The pension statutes' silence, standing alone, is therefore not evidence that the Legislature authorized the Division to shift IME costs onto applicants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Any interpretation of the legislative silence regarding the cost of IMEs (purportedly $900 for physical IME and $1025 for a psychiatric IME) that places potentially prohibitive financial burdens upon applicants is unreasonable, and is certainly not a liberal construction in favor of the beneficiaries, as precedent requires.\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

The amendment does not forbid the consideration of a pre-existing condition as part of the ultimate determination whether to approve or deny the application. Nor does it condition the grant of an accidental disability benefit upon the information contained in the applicant's certification. The certification amendment is merely informational. It provides a mechanism by which the retirement system may determine\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   a pre-existing disability is\n   <em>\n    involved\n   </em>\n   in the case. At the very least, that information is relevant to the resolution of a disability retirement application pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Critically, the certification amendment does not preclude the grant of a benefit to an applicant who certifies the existence of a pre-existing condition. It merely allows the agency to confirm if a pre-existing condition is present, but it does not predetermine any result. Certainly, if a retirement system denies an individual\n   application in the future by breaching the\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   standard, applicants may appeal that denial in the normal course.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The NJEA also challenges N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.10(f)-the one retirement application amendment-which sets forth that an applicant who has filed any type of disability retirement application cannot file a separate application for any other type of retirement while the prior application is pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The NJEA argues that the one retirement application amendment frustrates the purpose and intent of the pension system. According to the NJEA, applicants suffer a hardship because they are \"forced to discontinue service\" when applying for a disability retirement benefit. An applicant thus earns no income while awaiting the resolution of the application. The NJEA argues that an applicant \"clearly entitled to a service retirement\" should collect the service retirement allowance while the disability retirement application is pending, with retroactive \"adjustments made after the disability application is determined.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The one retirement application amendment is consistent with legislative intent. Membership in several of the retirement systems automatically ceases \"upon retirement,\" N.J.S.A. 18A:66-7(d) (TPAF),\n   N.J.S.A. 53:5A-7 (SPRS), N.J.S.A. 43:6A-5 (JRS), or when the member becomes a \"beneficiary,\" N.J.S.A. 43:16A-3(3) (PFRS). If an applicant receives a service retirement allowance\n   while the disability retirement application is pending, the applicant may no longer be a \"member\" of the retirement system because he or she has \"retired\" and is now a \"beneficiary.\" If no longer a member, an applicant is not encompassed by the disability retirement statutes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , N.J.S.A. 18A:66-39(b) (TPAF statute providing that \"a member\" shall be retired for ordinary disability if otherwise eligible).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As noted by the Division, the disability retirement statutes refer to \"the application\" or \"the written application\" in the singular.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , N.J.S.A. 18A:66-39 (TPAF) ; N.J.S.A. 43:16A-6(1) (PFRS) ; N.J.S.A. 43:15A-43 (PERS). And the NJEA concedes that under the statutes, members can only receive one retirement benefit at a time. The NJEA does not cite any statutory provision that conflicts with the one application rule. Although the pension statutes are to be liberally construed,\n   <em>\n    Uricoli v.

At oral argument, the NJEA withdrew its appeal of the notification amendment; however, for completion's sake, we briefly address the NJEA's arguments contained in its merits brief, and the validity of N.J.A.C. 17:1-7.10(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Generally, the NJEA argued that the notification amendment conflicts with law because the disability retirement statutes only require proof of incapacity in the general area of ordinary employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Skulski v.

The NJEA contended \"[a]pplicants are not required to show that they are completely unemployable.\" According to the NJEA, the notification amendment arbitrarily fails to account for pension statutes that do not require proof that an applicant is generally unemployable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The notification-of-reemployment provision of the notification amendment advances the legislative directives contained in statutes that govern the treatment of beneficiaries post-retirement. The TPAF and PERS statutes require the Division to reduce pension awards if the beneficiary is \"engaged in an occupation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 18A:66-40(a) (TPAF) ; N.J.S.A. 43:15A-44(a) (PERS).

The NJEA claimed that this provision conflicts with law\n   because beneficiaries need not be generally unemployable to receive disability benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   But the Division's awareness when a disability retirement beneficiary is able to return to employment may further its enforcement of the rehabilitation statutes. For example, the TPAF statute provides that the retirement system may designate a physician to perform a medical examination for beneficiaries under the age of sixty, for a period of five years following retirement. N.J.S.A. 18A:66-40(a). If the report reveals that the beneficiary \"is able to perform\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   his [or her] former duty or other\n   <em>\n    comparable duty\n   </em>\n   which his [or her] former employer is willing to assign to him [or her],\" the beneficiary must report for duty.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=343%20A.2d%20721\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The PERS statute contains identical language. N.J.S.A. 43:15A-44(a). Similarly, the PFRS statute allows the system to order medical examinations of disability retirees under the age of fifty-five within five years following retirement to determine if the disability retirement beneficiary \"is able to perform either his [or her] former duty or\n   <em>\n    any other available duty\n   </em>\n   in the department.\" N.J.S.A. 43:16A-8(2) (emphasis added). Beyond specifying age limits (under sixty for TPAF and PERS; under fifty-five for PFRS) and time frames (within five years of retirement), the Legislature granted the Division discretion to decide the circumstances in which it will order a medical examination of a disability retiree to determine if he or she is fit for employment in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   capacity with the former employer. The Division may use the information provided by disability retirees to aid its decision whether to order a post-retirement medical examination, if the other statutory conditions (the age and time frame limitations) are satisfied. Therefore, the requirement for disability retirees to provide the information in the notification amendment is not arbitrary and is consistent with the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The NJEA also argued that this aspect of the amendment improperly asks beneficiaries to render a medical opinion. Yet the notification amendment does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   ask the beneficiary to render a\n   medical opinion, but rather asks the beneficiary to update the Division if he or she believes that he or she is able to work due to the condition's improvement. The notification does not permit the Division to rely upon the beneficiary's notification as medical evidence, or to deny or adjust allowances based upon the beneficiary's notification. Rather, as discussed previously, the Division may merely wish to use that information to order a subsequent medical examination in accordance with the rehabilitation statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The NJEA claimed the Division may rely upon the notifications to reopen and reconsider prior awards, which it suggests would be improper. The NJEA expressed concern that the Division may rely on the information provided by a retiree to determine that the retiree is rehabilitated, or to order medical examinations not in accordance with the statutory limitations. As we have previously indicated, the pension statutes specifically permit the Division to\n   adjust disability retirement benefits if a beneficiary obtains post-retirement employment. N.J.S.A. 43:15A-44(b) (PERS) ; N.J.S.A. 18A:66-40(b) (TPAF). And the NJEA's initial concerns about what the Division may or may not do in the future are not relevant to the final agency action challenged here: the Division's promulgation of the notification amendment. Raising concerns about a rule's possible application in future cases is not the same as challenging the rule's validity. Therefore, the NJEA did not satisfy its burden of demonstrating that the notification amendment is arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 11:3-29\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899790\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/410/6/#p24\">\n    410 N.J.

That the Division could have chosen other means, more in accord with the NJEA's preferences, does not invalidate\n   the amended rule. Additionally, the observation that retirees \"have no expertise in pension matters\" is misguided. No such expertise is required to know if one is working or not, or to have a belief regarding whether one is able to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and modified in part.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    We uphold this rule but slightly modify N.J.A.C. 17:1-6.4(b)(5) (pertaining to \"[j]ob abolishment or reduction in force [ (RIF) ]\").
