On appeal, the defendant argues that the prosecutor's closing argument improperly commented on the defendant's failure to testify, thereby violating his Fifth Amendment constitutional rights. Additionally, the defendant contends that the trial justice erred in admitting the defendant's photograph into evidence and also by denying his motion for new trial. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The complaining witness, Alicia,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified at trial. She recalled that, on August 18, 2012, after a night of drinking with friends, she woke up next to one of her sister's friends, Marizan. The previous day, Alicia and her sister, Lauren, had gone to a South County beach for a few hours. While there, they consumed Hennessy liquor;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, when the beach closed, they went to Lauren's ex-boyfriend's house in Providence and continued drinking there with a group of Lauren's friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Around 8:00 p.m., Alicia, Lauren, defendant, and another friend drove to a clothing store in the Olneyville section of Providence. After shopping, the group went to a liquor store and also picked up some food before returning to the house to join the others. The group of six friends continued drinking well into the night, and Alicia testified that she had planned to sleep at the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The party eventually moved from the living room to a bedroom. At some point after 11:00 p.m. but before 3:00 a.m., the group purchased alcohol from a bootlegger.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After smoking marijuana and continuing to drink alcohol, Alicia testified that she vomited and later \"passed out\" on the bed in the bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When Alicia woke up around 7:00 a.m., she testified that she was not wearing pants or underwear, and she recalled that she also felt a wet substance on her leg.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   She saw defendant at the corner of the bed and subsequently began \"flipping out\" on\n   him. Alicia stated that defendant told her she was \"bugging\" and nothing happened between them-he said that the substance on her leg was urine. Alicia said that defendant told her she had removed her clothing after urinating on herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Alicia went to the living room, where her sister and a couple of friends were sitting. Lauren assisted in finding Alicia's clothes. Alicia-who had been a professional boxer-testified that, before she put her clothes back on, she attempted to attack defendant, but was stopped by the friend who lived there. Alicia remembered leaving the house with her sister, who drove her to Women &amp; Infants Hospital in Providence, where a sexual-assault examination was conducted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At trial, Lauren also testified. She recalled that, a little after 3:00 a.m., she and a few of the friends present that evening had played the prank on Alicia and defendant while they were sleeping, and one person had recorded it on Lauren's cell phone. In the video, three individuals are visible: Lauren, Alicia-who appeared to be passed out-and a third person, whom Lauren identified as defendant. Lauren recalled that, after the video was taken, defendant got out of bed and went to the bathroom to wash his face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Lauren testified that, when defendant returned to the bedroom, she and two of her friends went back to the living room. Lauren recalled that, after about ten to fifteen minutes, one of her friends attempted to open the bedroom door, but it was locked. When the friend finally found the key to the room, Lauren remembered, she went into the bedroom and found Alicia without her pants on and still asleep. Lauren testified that she observed defendant wearing only boxer shorts, although he had \"regular\" shorts on earlier in the night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Lauren stated that, even though she was concerned at that point, she left the room and stayed in the living room until around 6:00 a.m., when she left the house to go to a restaurant with her friends for something to eat. After about thirty minutes to an hour at the restaurant, she returned to the apartment and woke Alicia. At this point, Lauren testified, Alicia started attacking Marizan, and Lauren heard Marizan tell Alicia that she had urinated in a cup and that \"nothing happened.\" Soon after, Marizan left, and Lauren and Alicia went to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Amy Corrado was the nurse in the emergency room at Women &amp; Infants Hospital in Providence that day. Corrado testified that she performed a sexual-assault exam on Alicia. She recalled that Alicia had told her that she had showered but was wearing the same clothes she had been wearing the night before. Corrado used swabs to take samples from Alicia's body. She did not find any injuries on her body. Corrado notified the police on Alicia's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At trial, Detective Joseph Villella testified that he responded to a house in Providence to investigate a suspected sexual assault. Detective Villella collected the bedding from the scene for testing at the Rhode Island Department of Health. Detective William Corrigan also testified regarding his involvement in the case and recalled taking formal statements from both Alicia and Lauren on August 21, 2012. When she gave her statement at the police station, Alicia also identified defendant from a \"mug shot\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   shown to her. A few months later, on October 12, 2012, Det.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Corrigan received Marizan's consent to take a buccal swab of his mouth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   However, Det. Corrigan did not obtain an arrest warrant until January 2013, and Marizan was not arrested until August 2013. Moreover, Det. Corrigan testified that he had not taken witness statements from three men who were at the house during the evening of the alleged assault because Alicia warned him that the men were defendant's friends and would not cooperate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At trial, Cara Lupino, the supervisor of the Rhode Island Department of Health Forensic DNA Laboratory, also testified for the state. She explained that the only swab from the sexual-assault examination performed on Alicia at the hospital that tested positive for seminal fluid was the vaginal swab. However, Lupino noted that the seminal fluid did not contain any sperm cells. She also testified that the department received the bedding from the Providence police, and the laboratory tested what was determined to be a bloodstain on a bed sheet for DNA; she concluded that the blood came from a male donor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In addition, Lupino testified that the laboratory used reference samples from the buccal swab of Marizan and from Alicia's sexual-assault examination. Lupino explained that, in December 2012, the DNA test done on the vaginal swab did not reveal whether the small amount of seminal fluid on the swab was consistent with defendant's DNA profile. Subsequently, however, the laboratory acquired the capability to perform Y-STR testing, which Lupino considered an effective method for this case due to the lack of sperm in the seminal fluid sample and the overwhelming amount of female cells on the vaginal swab. After the testing was conducted, Lupino testified, the results showed that the Y-STR DNA profile from the vaginal swab was consistent with Marizan's Y-STR DNA profile.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   During closing arguments, defendant moved for a mistrial, arguing that one of the prosecutor's comments violated his Fifth Amendment right to not testify. The trial justice reserved decision on the motion for a mistrial. After the trial justice gave general instructions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the jury deliberated, returning with a guilty verdict. Immediately following the verdict, the trial justice denied defendant's motion for a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The defendant then moved for a new trial. The trial justice denied the motion and sentenced defendant to forty years, with twenty-five years to serve and fifteen years suspended with probation. He was also required to register as a sex offender and obtain counseling. The defendant timely appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Given the various issues raised on appeal, we outline the standard of review for each issue in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, when this Court reviews a trial justice's ruling on a motion for a mistrial, we afford the decision \"great weight\" and reverse only \"if it was clearly wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defendant challenged the trial justice's acceptance of Alicia's testimony because of her purported motive to lie. At trial, Alicia testified that she had broken up with her boyfriend before the night in question. Based on that testimony, defendant contended that Alicia may have fabricated her testimony to appease her boyfriend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The trial justice, in finding Alicia credible, adequately acknowledged the entirety of her statements, including her purported motive to lie.

Still, in finding Alicia to be a credible witness, the trial justice relied on the fact that her testimony was corroborated by Lauren's statements, the video of the prank that showed Alicia to be unconscious, and the DNA evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial justice also pointed out that Lauren's testimony regarding the baking soda prank and the timeline of finding the door locked while her sister and defendant were in the room was echoed by the video of the prank that evidenced Alicia's apparent unconsciousness while still fully clothed. The trial justice found \"the most damaging\" evidence to be Lauren's testimony that she later found her sister unconscious without pants or underwear and the defendant wearing only boxer shorts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The defendant appears to quarrel most with Lauren's testimony that she found her sister partially dressed in the bedroom\n   shortly after the baking soda prank, but did nothing about it until nearly three hours later, after she came back from breakfast. While defendant's view of Lauren's testimony may have merit, his disagreement with the trial justice's \"credibility determinations is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial justice took note of the fact that Lauren was candid about her alcohol use that night, which was brought out on cross-examination. Moreover, he acknowledged that the police investigation \"was less than desirable or less than comprehensive\" with respect to the witnesses who were interviewed. Nevertheless, we are satisfied that the trial justice's finding that Lauren's testimony was credible was not a clear error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Finally, the defendant maintains that the trial justice misconstrued the DNA evidence-which was the only evidence of sexual penetration\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   -as a \"match\" to defendant, while defendant contends that the DNA testing that was conducted indicated that the DNA could have belonged to other individuals in defendant's paternal line. This, defendant argues, means that the trial justice overlooked the fact that the seminal fluid could have been from another sexual partner of Alicia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   While we admire the zealous advocacy efforts demonstrated in defendant's brief regarding the issue, we find no need to delve into the specifics of the science behind the DNA testing conducted in the present case.

In his bench decision on the motion for new trial, the trial justice discussed Lupino's testimony regarding the Y-STR DNA testing, commenting that \"[o]ne might say the most damning evidence of all\" was her testimony that defendant's DNA sample matched the swab taken from Alicia at the hospital. The trial justice did not clearly err in accepting the expert testimony that the DNA obtained from the sexual-assault examination belonged to defendant. The fact that he referred to the DNA evidence as a \"match\" rather than \"consistent\" with Marizan's DNA might be imprecise, but such a paraphrasing of witness testimony does not rise to the level of \"overlooking or misconceiving evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

It should be recalled that both Alicia and Lauren had testified at length during the trial, whereas defendant did not testify at all. Given this context, the inference that a reasonable juror could draw from the prosecutor's comment (\"[a]nd not from him\") was that defendant had defaulted on some duty to prove his innocence by testifying. Such an inference (which, I repeat, would have been a reasonable one) would have clashed with defendant's constitutionally guaranteed right not to testify. Viewed in this perspective, a jury composed of ordinarily intelligent lay persons could reasonably understand the prosecutor's comment to be \"a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

After defense counsel objected to the prosecutor's comment and the jury exited the courtroom, the prosecutor explained to the trial justice that her remark had not been meant to allude to the fact of defendant's having chosen not to testify, but rather was just a comment on the shifting nature of the defense's theory of the case-\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , the evolution from a denial that defendant and Alicia had had any sexual encounter to a later acknowledgment that there had been an encounter but an assertion that it was consensual. The prosecutor further explained to the trial justice that the comment at issue was intended by her to be a reference to what (according to Alicia) defendant had said to Alicia\n   <em>\n    on the morning of August 18, 2012\n   </em>\n   , when she accused him of having sexually assaulted her. In his response to that accusation, defendant (again according to Alicia) never said that there had been consensual sex between them, but rather he simply told Alicia that she was \"bugging\" and that \"[n]othing happened.\" The prosecutor represented\n   that her comment was not directed at defendant's choice not to testify. Notably, however, the jury never heard the explanation of the prosecutor concerning her ambiguous\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   but potentially constitutionally improper comment. Rather, after the trial justice heard counsel's explanation and reserved his decision on defendant's motion for a mistrial, the jurors re-entered the courtroom, and the prosecutor simply continued her closing argument. No curative instruction was given by the trial justice before that argument resumed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Accordingly, because I believe that the quoted phrases from the prosecutor's closing argument could rationally be understood by a jury to constitute an impermissible comment on defendant's decision not to testify, it is my opinion that it was incumbent upon the trial justice to provide an\n   <em>\n    immediate\n   </em>\n   and adequate curative instruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is my understanding that our case law requires that the problematic nature of such comment can be cured only by the issuance of an\n   <em>\n    immediate\n   </em>\n   curative instruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3124145\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ri/113/77/#p81\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"If such error is to be cured, it is essential that a cautionary instruction be given immediately in order that the seed planted by the remark will not be given time to germinate.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Here, the record reveals that\n   <em>\n    thirty-two transcript pages\n   </em>\n   separate the prosecutor's improper comment from the portion of the trial justice's general jury instructions which addressed the presumption of innocence and defendant's constitutionally guaranteed right not to testify. Thus, while it is difficult to determine from the record precisely how much time elapsed between the making of the comment at issue and the trial justice's instruction about defendant's right not to testify, it is clear that a substantial amount of time did elapse for there to be thirty-two transcript pages between the prosecutor's comment and the relevant jury instruction. This significant time gap leads me to conclude that the relevant portion of the general jury instructions was not sufficiently \"immediate\" to cure the constitutional violation in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sherman\n   </em>\n   , 113 R.I. at 81-82,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3124145\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ri/113/77/#p81\">\n    317 A.2d at 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The prosecutor's comment could very well have been understood by the jurors as a reference to defendant's decision not to testify, and I believe that the trial justice, by waiting until after the prosecutor finished her closing argument to give an instruction, may very well have\n   allowed a constitutionally erroneous seed about defendant's decision not to testify to germinate in the minds of one or more jurors. The admonitory language in\n   <em>\n    Sherman\n   </em>\n   bears repeating: \"If such error is to be cured, it is\n   <em>\n    essential\n   </em>\n   that a cautionary instruction be given\n   <em>\n    immediately\n   </em>\n   in order that the seed planted by the remark will not be given time to germinate.\"\n   <em>\n    Sherman\n   </em>\n   , 113 R.I. at 81-82,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3124145\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ri/113/77/#p81\">\n    317 A.2d at 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   I do not question the good faith of the prosecutor, and her explanation as to what she intended when making the comment at issue is certainly plausible. However, I am nonetheless of the opinion that the jury might reasonably have understood the prosecutor's comment to be a comment on the defendant's constitutionally guaranteed right not to testify; and I am of the further opinion that the trial justice's general jury instructions were insufficient to cure that constitutional violation because they were not given immediately after the comment was made. As such, I believe that the judgment of the Superior Court should be vacated and the case remanded for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Accordingly, I respectfully but unblinkingly dissent from the majority's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    It should go without saying that the fact that the prosecutor had to rebut one reading of her comment and represent that a different meaning was intended indicates that the comment was ambiguous and necessitated, at the very least, an immediate curative instruction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    I consider the following lapidary sentences from Chief Judge Aldrich's opinion in the case of\n    <em>\n     Desmond v.
