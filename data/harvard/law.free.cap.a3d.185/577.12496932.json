Plaintiff Kirk Wool is an inmate in the custody of the Vermont Department of Corrections (DOC). He appeals the dismissal of his claim that DOC and its Commissioner violated a statutory obligation to negotiate and award a contract to provide telephone services to inmates in state correctional facilities in a manner that provides for the lowest reasonable cost to inmates. We affirm the trial court's dismissal of plaintiff's claim for money damages, but reverse the dismissal of plaintiff's claim for mandamus relief and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. In June 2016, plaintiff filed a complaint against defendants in the civil division. He alleged that for the past several years, DOC had violated 28 V.S.A. \u00a7 802a(d) and Vermont law by failing to use a competitive process to obtain telephone services for inmates. Instead, he alleged, DOC had purchased telephone services from the only company from which it sought a bid. Plaintiff alleged that under \"Vermont law,\" such \"sole source\" contracts may only be used in \"extraordinary circumstances,\" which did not exist here. According to plaintiff, the company with which DOC contracted charged approximately $8.00 per hour for a telephone call, while competing firms offered rates closer to $3.00 per hour. He argued that DOC had not negotiated and awarded the contract in a manner that provided for the lowest reasonable costs to inmates, as required by \u00a7 802a(d), which states that \"[a]ny contract to provide telephone services to inmates in state correctional facilities shall be negotiated and awarded in a manner that provides for the lowest reasonable cost to inmates, to their families, and to others communicating with inmates.\" Plaintiff sought damages equivalent to the difference between the current rates and the lower rates he alleged would be offered by other contractors for calls he had placed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff's claim. Defendants argued that plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the contract because he was not an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract. They further argued that plaintiff's claim for damages was barred by sovereign immunity because it was based upon defendants' performance of a discretionary function and did not have a private analog. Plaintiff opposed the motion to dismiss, arguing that \u00a7 802a(d) limited DOC's discretion. He also filed a claim for a writ of mandamus, asserting that DOC had a nondiscretionary duty to provide telephone services at the lowest reasonable costs to inmates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. The trial court ruled that plaintiff's damages claim was barred by the State's sovereign immunity. It held that plaintiff's claim for relief in the nature of mandamus also failed because plaintiff did not seek enforcement of a purely ministerial act. The court therefore dismissed plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5. On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in dismissing his claims for damages and mandamus relief. Although his brief is not a model of clarity, we understand his argument to be that DOC had a nondiscretionary duty to negotiate and award the telephone services contract in a manner that led to the lowest reasonable costs for inmates, specifically by using a competitive bidding process to select the contractor, and that DOC violated this duty. He seeks damages and an order compelling DOC to reopen the bidding process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6.

Damages Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. We first consider whether the trial court properly dismissed plaintiff's damages claim. We conclude that plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the State waived its sovereign immunity such that he may obtain money damages for the alleged violation of \u00a7 802a(d), and affirm the trial court's ruling on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8.

The statute at issue here, 28 V.S.A. \u00a7 802a, does not provide for an aggrieved party to obtain money damages in such an action. It therefore does not provide an avenue for plaintiff to obtain the relief he seeks.

In this case, the trial court found that there was no private analog that would permit plaintiff's damages claim under \u00a7 5601(a). Plaintiff does not challenge this determination on appeal. Instead, he focuses solely on challenging the court's holding that the discretionary function exception set forth in \u00a7 5601(e)(1) also barred his claim. Plaintiff's brief is \"wholly inadequate\" on the issue of availability of damages \"because it omits discussion of an essential element of [his] claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Mellin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1525541\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/173/202/#p218\">\n    173 Vt. at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1525541\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/173/202/#p218\">\n    790 A.2d at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even if plaintiff were correct that his damages claim is not barred by the discretionary function exception, he has failed to show that a private analog exists, as is required to state a claim for relief under 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 5601(a). We therefore decline to disturb the trial court's ruling that plaintiff's claim for damages was barred by sovereign immunity.

Here, plaintiff alleges that DOC failed to use a competitive bidding process in contracting for telephone services, and thus failed to obtain the lowest reasonable costs for inmates as required by 28 V.S.A. \u00a7 802a(d), which provides that \"[a]ny contract to provide telephone services to inmates in state correctional facilities shall be negotiated and awarded in a manner that provides for the lowest reasonable cost to inmates, to their families, and to others communicating with inmates.\" The court found that \u00a7 802a(d) did not purport to control the manner in which DOC negotiated telephone services contracts for inmates, and therefore did not impose a ministerial duty that plaintiff could enforce through mandamus. The court did not address plaintiff's allegation that DOC violated \"Vermont law\" by failing to use a competitive bidding process to contract for telephone services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15. However, as plaintiff alleged, DOC\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   required by Vermont law-albeit not specifically and exclusively by the statute he identified in his complaint-to use a competitive bidding process in contracting for telephone services for inmates. Section 122 of Title 28 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   For the purpose of securing programming and services for offenders, the Department of Corrections shall publicly advertise or invite three or more bids. The contract for any such programming and services shall be awarded to one of the three lowest responsible bidders, conforming to specification, with consideration being given to the time required for provision of services, the purpose for which it is required, competency and responsibility of bidder, and his or her ability to render satisfactory services; but the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary of Human Services shall have the right to reject any and all bids and to invite other bids.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   28 V.S.A. \u00a7 122. Section 122 imposes a nondiscretionary duty upon DOC to solicit three or more bids whenever it seeks to contract for services for offenders, and to award the contract to one of the three lowest responsible bidders unless those bids are rejected. We find no indication that this provision, which was enacted in 2011, is somehow inapplicable to contracts for telephone services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although DOC ultimately has discretion to determine the terms of the contract and which bidders are \"responsible,\" it is expressly obligated by \u00a7 122 to use a competitive bidding process in entering any contract for programming or services for inmates.
