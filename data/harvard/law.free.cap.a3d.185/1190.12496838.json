The sole issue before this Court is whether Claimant is ineligible for UC benefits under Section 402(h) of the UC Law\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Law).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Claimant worked for HPM as a safety consultant from August 15, 2016 through October 28, 2016. HPM hired Claimant because he already possessed the skills and certifications necessary to perform a job for a client in Minnesota. Claimant's previous employers paid for his certifications; he did not pay for any himself. HPM set Claimant's pay rate and did not deduct taxes therefrom. At the job site, Claimant was supervised by a site safety manager who dictated Claimant's work hours and daily activities. The site manager required Claimant to participate in daily safety meetings, the morning flex/stretch program, badge in and out at the work site, complete daily safety reports, and submit a weekly timecard. Claimant has always worked as an employee and does not hold himself out as being in business for himself. Claimant separated from HPM on October 28, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 20, 2016, Claimant applied for UC benefits. On January 4, 2017, the Scranton UC Service Center determined that Claimant was eligible for UC benefits as he was not disqualified under Section 402(h) of the Law. HPM appealed and a Referee hearing was held on February 3, 2017. On February 7, 2017, the Referee reversed the UC Service Center's determination. Claimant appealed to the UCBR. On April 25, 2017, the UCBR reversed the Referee's decision and granted Claimant UC benefits. HPM appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   HPM argues that Claimant is not eligible for UC benefits under Section 402(h) of the Law because he was not an employee of HPM,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   but rather, he was self-employed as an independent contractor. Specifically, HPM contends that because: (1) the language of the agreement between HPM and Claimant specified that Claimant was an independent contractor; (2) Claimant was issued an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099, as opposed to an IRS Form W-2; (3) Claimant paid for and provided his own certifications and qualifications; (4) Claimant established his hourly work rate;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (5) HPM did not train or supervise Claimant; and, (6) Claimant was free to accept or decline assignments, Claimant was self-employed during the duration of his agreement with HPM. HPM relies exclusively on\n   <em>\n    Krum v.

First, the\n   <em>\n    Krum\n   </em>\n   Court clarified that \"the [UCBR] expressly stated that it did not consider [S]ection 402(h) [of the Law] as its basis for denying benefits. Instead, the issue in [that] case [wa]s whether [the claimant] was an employee of [the agency.]\"\n   <em>\n    Krum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924516\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/689/330/\">\n    689 A.2d at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the instant case, the UCBR espoused the opposite: \"While the [UCBR] concludes that [C]laimant was not self-employed, the [UCBR] does not hold that [C]laimant was an employee of HPM.\" UCBR Dec. at 2. Second, the\n   <em>\n    Krum\n   </em>\n   Court expressly opined: \"We have disposed of [the claimant's] arguments in some detail and may summarize that, simply put, [the agency] is a referral agency and those it refers are not its employees under the referral arrangement.\"\n   <em>\n    Krum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924516\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/689/330/\">\n    689 A.2d at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Section 402(h) [of the Law] does not define the term 'self-employment'; however, Section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(2)(B) of the Law defines 'employment', in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Services performed by an individual for wages shall be deemed to be employment subject to this act, unless and until it is shown to the satisfaction of the department that-(a) such individual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of such services both under [his] contract of service and in fact; and (b) as to such services such individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   43 P.S. \u00a7 753(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(2)(B).

Indeed, the UCBR's only reference to the contract is in finding of fact number two, wherein, the UCBR stated: \"HPM hired [C]laimant on contract because he already possessed the skills and certifications necessary to perform the job for a client in Minnesota.\" UCBR Dec. at 1. This finding\n   does not support a legal conclusion as to whether Claimant was self-employed or an employee.

These factors reveal that HPM and/or its client, did in fact control and direct Claimant's work performance. First, Claimant was paid a \"fixed rate of remuneration[,]\" HPM and/or its client \"supplie[d] the tools necessary to carry out the services[,]\" and Claimant was expected to attend daily safety meetings. Dissenting Op. at 1200 (quoting\n   <em>\n    C E Credits OnLine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8384685\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/946/1162/#p1168\">\n    946 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1168 ). HPM had the burden to prove that Claimant was free from control or direction over his work performance, and HPM did not meet its burden. Accordingly, the first prong of Section 402(h) of the Law was not met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   However, it is not clear from the record whether Claimant's on-site supervisor Brad Hoke (Hoke) was an HPM employee. Claimant testified that he did not know who paid Hoke,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 57, and HPM's witness declared that although Hoke was not an HPM employee, HPM contracted with Hoke to service that client.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 59. Therefore, since it was not established under whose direction and control Claimant was subject, the identity of Claimant's employer remains undetermined. Accordingly, as stated by the UCBR, the issue of whether HPM was Claimant's employer was not resolved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UCBR Dec. at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Further, according to the record, Claimant declined two additional jobs HPM offered him after the Minnesota client's job was completed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 54. If HPM is determined to be Claimant's employer, HPM is to be given the opportunity to argue that Claimant is ineligible for UC benefits pursuant to Section 402(b) of the Law, 43 P.S. \u00a7 802(b), because he did not have a necessitous and compelling reason to decline those jobs. HPM did not have the opportunity to argue Claimant's ineligibility for benefits under Section 402(b) of the Law or any other applicable provision because the \"Notice of Telephone Hearing\" specified that the only issue before the Referee was \"[w]hether [C]laimant was engaged in self-employment.\" R.R. at 31. Accordingly, this Court remands the matter to the UCBR for additional fact-finding to determine whether HPM is liable for UC benefits as Claimant's employer and, if so, whether Claimant is ineligible for benefits under Section 402(b) of the Law and/or any other disqualifying Sections of the Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For all of the above reasons, the UCBR's order finding that Claimant was not self-employed is affirmed, the UCBR's order granting Claimant UC benefits is reversed, and the matter is remanded for additional fact-finding in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   AND NOW, this 13\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of April, 2018, the Unemployment Compensation (UC) Board of Review's (UCBR) April 25, 2017 order finding Terry J.

In rejecting the Referee's holding that Terry J. Jerin, Jr. (Claimant) was an independent contractor under Section 402(h) of the Unemployment Compensation Law (Law), 43 P.S. \u00a7 802(h),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (Board) capriciously disregarded key evidence introduced at the Referee's hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Determining whether Claimant was an employee of HPM Consulting (HPM) or self-employed as an independent contractor requires consideration of all the evidence. Accordingly, I would vacate the Board's order in its entirety and remand for further findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Section 402(h) of the Law provides that an employee shall be ineligible for compensation for any week \"[i]n which he is engaged in self-employment[.]\" 43 P.S. \u00a7 802(h). The Law does not define the term \"self-employment\"; however, Section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(2)(B) of the Law defines the term \"employment,\" in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Services performed by an individual for wages shall be deemed to be employment subject to this act, unless and until it is shown to the satisfaction of the department that-(a) such individual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of such services both under his contract of service and in fact; and (b) as to such services such individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   43 P.S. \u00a7 753(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(2)(B). In sum, the statutory presumption that an individual earning\n   wages for services performed is an employee may be overcome by a showing that: (a) the individual was free from control and direction in the performance of his work; and (b) in the performance of his services, the individual was customarily engaged in an independently established business or occupation.\n   <em>\n    Beacon Flag Car Company, Inc.

Cmwlth. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In this case, the first prong,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the issue of control, involves a determination of whether HPM, or the client, AZCO, Inc., had the right to control Claimant's work and the manner in which he performed it.\n   <em>\n    Krum v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924516\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/689/330/\">\n    689 A.2d 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1997). In reviewing the question of control, courts consider many factors, such as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   whether there is a fixed rate of remuneration; whether taxes are withheld from the claimant's pay; whether the [putative] employer supplies the tools necessary to carry out the services; whether the [putative] employer provides on-the-job training; and whether the [putative] employer holds regular meetings that the [individual is] expected to attend.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    C E Credits OnLine v.

Cmwlth. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   It is unclear from the record whether any person controlled the manner in which Claimant performed his services as a \"Traffic site manager\" at the job site in Minnesota. Certified Record (C.R.), Item No. 2, at 1; Reproduced Record at 10 (R.R. ___). This includes both HPM and AZCO, Inc. In his employee questionnaire, Claimant stated that he was not supervised \"regularly or closely.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8190197\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/961/261/#p264\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In his testimony, Claimant stated that Brad Hoke was the site manager, and he was not sure \"who pays Mr. Hoke's salary.\" Notes of Testimony, 2/3/2017, at 8 (N.T. ___); R.R. 57. Claimant testified that Hoke determined where on the job site he was to do the work of a traffic site manager. Claimant also described an incident where Hoke yelled at him for leaving the job site to get a raincoat for another worker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Referee found that the relationship between HPM and Claimant was that of an independent contractor. In reversing, the Board focused upon Claimant's testimony about Hoke. The questions are two-fold. First, it is unclear that Hoke's directives were anything more than a quality control directive that is imposed on any independent contractor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C E Credits OnLine,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8384685\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/946/1162/#p1168\">\n    946 A.2d at 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, it is not clear whether Hoke was issuing directives on behalf of HPM or AZCO, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   More problematic is the Board's determination that Claimant was eligible for benefits under Section 402(h) because the Board did not address evidence critical to that determination. In reversing the Referee's decision to deny benefits under Section 402(h), the Board explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Based on [C]laimant's credible testimony,\n   <em>\n    none of which HPM disputed\n   </em>\n   , the Board concludes that [C]laimant was not self-employed. [C]laimant was directly and closely supervised on the job site and, therefore was not free from direction and control. Further, [C]laimant does not hold himself out as being in business for himself and has always worked as an employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Board Adjudication at 2 (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board's statement that HPM did not dispute Claimant's testimony is simply incorrect. HPM offered considerable evidence on that point, but the Board capriciously disregarded it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   First and foremost, HPM offered copies of two contracts it executed with Claimant, and they were admitted into the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first contract concerned Claimant's engagement by HPM to provide safety consulting services to AZCO at a jobsite in Iowa for five months beginning February 8, 2016. The second contract related to the AZCO project at issue in this case, which commenced in Minnesota on August 15, 2016, and lasted approximately three months. Both contracts contained the following relevant provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   The jobsite [client] will dictate the hours needed on site and will be adjusted depending upon the needs at the site. Your hours worked should be submitted via fax to [HPM] every Monday morning[;]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   You will furnish your own steel toe boots and proper clothing. AZCO Inc. will provide you with the rest of the necessary PPE [Personal Protective Equipment] at the job site[;]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   You understand and agree that you are working as a 1099 contractor through HPM and are solely responsible for any personal federal and state tax obligations. HPM is not responsible for and is not withholding monies for tax liabilities on your behalf and you will receive an IRS Form 1099 from HPM at the end of the calendar year. It is understood by both parties that no vacation, holidays, sick time, health insurance, profit sharing, unemployment benefits, etc. will be part of this contract[;]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   You shall perform this contract as an independent contractor and not an employee\n   of HPM. Nothing in this contract shall be construed to be inconsistent with your independent contractor status .... It is understood that HPM does not use your services exclusively. It is further understood that you are free to contract for similar services to be performed for other contractors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   C.R., Item No. 8, at 3, 11; R.R. 37, 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   A written agreement that describes the claimant as an independent contractor, although not dispositive, is critical to the independent contractor analysis.\n   <em>\n    Stage Road Poultry Catchers v. Department of Labor and Industry, Office of Unemployment Compensation, Tax Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7273844\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/34/876/#p889\">\n    34 A.3d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 889 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2011). The above contract terms are certainly relevant to deciding whether Claimant was an independent contractor or an employee of HPM. By not addressing the contract language, the Board capriciously disregarded relevant evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   HPM also produced an email from Claimant to HPM's vice president regarding the Iowa assignment that stated: \"I reviewed the contract and am aware that the position is independent contractor.\" C.R., Item No. 8 at 13; R.R. 47. This email contradicts Claimant's \"credible\" testimony that he was never a \"1099 employee.\" N.T. 7; R.R. 56. The Board erred by capriciously disregarding this evidence, which was relevant to Claimant's employment status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, the Board did not consider Claimant's own questionnaire, which contains statements that contradict his testimony that he was an HPM employee. For example, on his questionnaire, Claimant stated that (1) he was at risk of sustaining a profit or loss; (2) his work was not supervised regularly or closely; (3) he was paid as a 1099 employee; (4) he signed a contract stating he was an independent contractor; (5) he was able to \"perform these identical services, or other services, for others independently\"; (6) his \"present working arrangement permit[ted him] to work for several individuals at the same time\"; and (7) the \"site superintendent, the owner\" is responsible for hiring and firing. C.R., Item No. 2; R.R. 10-11. The Board should have considered Claimant's responses in assessing his credibility and deciding the Section 402(h) issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For these reasons, I would vacate the Board's adjudication that Claimant is not self-employed and remand for the Board to consider and address all of the evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Act of December 5, 1936, Second Ex.Sess., P.L.

Further, the Dissent claims \"HPM specifically cites two pieces of evidence\n    <strong>\n     the\n    </strong>\n    [\n    <strong>\n     UCBR\n    </strong>\n    ]\n    <strong>\n     did not address\n    </strong>\n    : the agreement between Claimant and HPM that explicitly states he was an independent contractor and 'correspondence' he sent to HPM acknowledging both his independent contractor and 1099 status.\" Dissenting Op. at 1199 n.2 (emphasis added). However, HPM never asserted that anything was \"not addressed\", but rather HPM contended that the independent contractor agreement and the fact that Claimant was a 1099 employee support the first prong of\n    <em>\n     Krum.\n    </em>\n    Both of these factors were testified to by Claimant. Finally, the Dissent states: \"HPM identified the [UCBR]'s error as\n    <strong>\n     the disregard of critical evidence\n    </strong>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , the written contract[,]\" Dissenting Op. at 1199 n.2 (emphasis added), but HPM never made that argument nor anywhere in its brief used any of the above bolded words as the Dissent claims. Notably, the Dissent does not cite to HPM's brief with respect to those words.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The Dissent asserts that the contracts were entered into evidence as Exhibit 10 at the beginning of the Referee hearing. However, the exhibits are not attached to the Hearing Transcript and the contracts and the email are included with documents labeled \"Employer Documents for Telephone Hearing.\" R.R. at 35. Further, Exhibit 10 was referred to as \"letters sent from the attorney or Claimant.\" R.R. at 52. Moreover, the contracts and the email were never specifically identified or testified from at the hearing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The Dissent maintains that \"[t]he 46 pages of relevant documents faxed by the moving party to the Referee as 'employer exhibits to be included' in the record were ignored by the [UCBR]. R.R. 36. This is yet another reason to remand for a review of the complete record.\" Dissenting Op. at 1201 n.5. However, the fact that 46 pages of documents\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    have been admitted, does not translate to a remand to consider said documents. The Referee is not an adversary for HPM and is not required to comb through and comment on documents that were not testified to or argued about before him. As HPM's Counsel did not refer to the documents, the UCBR was not required to address them.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    The Dissent opined:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n    First, it is unclear that [Claimant's on-site supervisor Brad] Hoke's directives were anything more than the quality control directive that is imposed on any independent contractor.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     C E Credits Online\n    </em>\n    [\n    <em>\n     v.

HPM's amended petition for review states that the Board erred by failing to consider a litany of evidence, including Claimant's written agreement with HPM. In its brief, HPM argues, generally, that the Board erred in ruling that Claimant is not ineligible for benefits under Section 402(h) of the Law.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , HPM Brief at 6 (Statement of Question Involved), 9 (Summary of Argument), and 10-11 (Argument). In the argument section of its brief, HPM specifically cites two pieces of evidence the Board did not address: the agreement between Claimant and HPM that explicitly states he was an independent contractor and \"correspondence\" he sent to HPM acknowledging both his independent contractor and 1099 status.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 13.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    HPM identified the Board's error as the disregard of critical evidence,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , the written contract.
