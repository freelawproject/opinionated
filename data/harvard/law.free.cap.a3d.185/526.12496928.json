In the case under review, Ashner Alexis (Alexis or defendant) appeals from a judgment of conviction for murder (count 1); conspiracy to commit murder (count 2); and discharging a weapon while committing a crime of violence (count 3). He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms of imprisonment on counts 1 and 3, and ten years to serve on count 2, also to be served consecutively. He seeks to have his convictions reversed and the case remanded for a new trial, on the grounds that the trial justice abused his discretion in denying Alexis's motions to pass and in overruling Alexis's objections to photographic evidence, and because the trial justice erred in denying Alexis's motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In January 2014, Seydina Limamou Ndoye contacted Alain Bedame about purchasing a weapon for self-protection. Bedame arranged a meeting with Johnathan and James Gomez so that Ndoye could purchase a gun from them. At the meeting, Ndoye gave Johnathan and James $240 for the purchase of a Glock handgun, which the Gomez brothers represented they would procure from their uncle. Bedame also allowed Johnathan to borrow his cell phone so Johnathan could contact his uncle. The Gomez brothers then left, cell phone and $240 in hand, never to return. After fifteen-to-twenty minutes passed, Ndoye and Bedame picked up some friends and drove to the Gomez residence on Colfax Street in Providence. Ebony Gomez, Johnathan and James's sister, told the group that her brothers were not at home. Ndoye told Ebony that he \"wanted his stuff back.\" Ndoye and Bedame eventually located and confronted Johnathan, whom Bedame described as \"shaking\" and appearing as though he \"was about to cry.\" Johnathan told Ndoye and Bedame that his uncle had robbed him of the cash and cell phone at gunpoint, but Johnathan promised that he would reimburse Ndoye and replace Bedame's cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Later, Ndoye showed Bedame a photograph posted on James Gomez's Facebook page, which, Ndoye believed, depicted James holding Bedame's cell phone. This initiated an exchange of hostile Facebook messages between Bedame and James Gomez. Thereafter, Alexis, having heard that Ndoye had been robbed by the Gomez brothers, contacted Ndoye on Facebook and told Ndoye that the Gomez brothers had also stolen scrap metal from Alexis's yard. Ndoye asked Alexis for a firearm; and, on February 4, 2014, Bedame, Alexis, and Ndoye drove to Woonsocket to \"get the gun\" from Alexis's friend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When they arrived at the home of Alexis's friend, Anthony Moore,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   they encountered twenty to twenty-five people having a party. Ndoye observed as Alexis informed Moore that he wanted the gun\n   because he had been robbed. Alexis told Moore that he would return the gun. Moore then directed Robert Winston to fetch a weapon. Winston and Bedame left the house to obtain the gun. Shortly thereafter, they returned and Winston placed a shotgun wrapped in a Cape Verdean flag and bullets with small pellets inside on the kitchen table. According to Ndoye, Moore picked up the weapon and handed it to Alexis, who tucked it into his waistband, causing him to walk with a pronounced limp. According to Ndoye, Alexis said that he would shoot \"whoever comes to the door\" at the Gomezes' home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Winston, Ndoye, Bedame, and Alexis left Moore's house and headed to Providence. According to Ndoye, they first stopped at the house of Alexis's girlfriend so that Alexis could change into dark clothes. Bedame then drove to the Gomezes' home and parked a short distance away. Alexis took a pair of work gloves and wore one glove himself, giving the other to Winston. Alexis then put on a mask, removed the gun from the trunk of Bedame's car, \"stuff[ed] the gun inside his waistband,\" and approached the Gomez house with Winston. Alexis instructed Winston to knock on the Gomezes' window. When Winston complied, a shadow appeared behind the closed blinds, and Alexis fired the shotgun, shattering the window. Bedame and Ndoye heard the gunshot blast and then Alexis and Winston ran back to the car. According to Ndoye, once Alexis and Winston were inside the vehicle, Alexis was laughing \"hysterically\" and exclaimed excitedly, \"I got him\" and \"I pulled the trigger.\" Bedame recalled Alexis stating that he \"fe[lt] like shooting somebody else.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At this point, they left Bedame's vehicle in Providence, picked up Ndoye's car, and proceeded to Woonsocket to return the gun to Moore. En route, Bedame received a Facebook message from James Gomez that stated, \"They're coming for you, bro.\" Hours later, Winston received a phone call from Moore, informing him that the wrong person had been shot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In fact, the shadowy figure behind the blinds at the Gomezes's home was Ebony's boyfriend, seventeen-year-old George Holland, Jr. Miguel Gomez, the father of Johnathan, James, and Ebony, was watching television in a bedroom with his girlfriend on the evening of February 4, 2014, when he heard a loud bang, followed by a flash of light and the sound of his children screaming that Holland had been shot. Mr. Gomez ran into the living room and saw Holland, lying on the floor amid shell casings and glass, as Ebony held a sweater to his abdomen. Holland was transported to Rhode Island Hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly after ten o'clock that evening as a result of nine individual shotgun pellet strikes to his right abdominal area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the police investigation, James Gomez showed Providence Police Detective Kenneth Court the Facebook postings made by Bedame. Detective Court then spoke with Bedame, which conversation led him to contact Ndoye. Both Bedame and Ndoye made statements implicating themselves, as well as Moore, Winston, and Alexis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 28, 2014, Alexis was indicted along with Moore, Bedame, and Ndoye.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alexis was charged with the murder of Holland (count 1); conspiracy to commit murder (count 2); and discharging a weapon while committing a crime of violence\n   (count 3). A jury trial commenced on November 6, 2014. On November 17, 2014, Alexis was found guilty on all three counts. On January 8, 2015, the trial justice denied Alexis's motion for a new trial, and on February 12, 2015, he sentenced Alexis to two life sentences and ten years to serve, with each term to be served consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Issues on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Alexis argues that the trial justice abused his discretion in denying his motions to pass the case because an emotional outburst by a witness and Ndoye's reference during his testimony to a \"mug shot\" photograph of Alexis were extraordinarily prejudicial and because the instructions given were not sufficient to cure the prejudice. Alexis further contends that the trial justice abused his discretion in overruling his objection to the admission of a \"gang\" photograph. Alexis also argues that the cumulative effect doctrine should apply in this case. Lastly, Alexis argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial, arguing that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Alexis requests that his conviction be reversed, and that the case be remanded for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Motions to Pass and Motions for Mistrial\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"It is well settled that 'a trial justice's decision on a motion to pass the case is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not disturb the ruling on such a motion absent an abuse of discretion.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, he contends that the cautionary instruction given by the trial justice was insufficient to cure the prejudicial effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    i\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mr. Gomez was the first witness for the state. While on the witness stand, the prosecutor showed him a photograph of Holland and asked him if he knew the\n   identity of the young man in the photograph. Mr. Gomez started crying and stated, \"Yeah. It's George. He was like a son. He came all the time to the house.\" Defense counsel made a motion for a mistrial and the trial justice immediately called a recess. In the absence of the jury, defense counsel argued that Mr. Gomez's testimony did not provide any information that pertained to an essential element of any of the offenses and was not necessary to the state's case. Defense counsel further argued that the extremely emotional nature of the testimony prejudiced the jury against Alexis and that the testimony \"irreparably tainted [the] jury and prejudiced the jury against\" Alexis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although the trial justice acknowledged the emotional nature of Mr. Gomez's response, he denied the motion for a mistrial. The trial justice explained that \"[s]urrounding his crying his responses were rather conversational, not fraught with emotion.\" The trial justice continued, \"I'm not at all of a mind to believe that the witness's very short, although clear degree of upsetness, is something that is going to interfere with this jury's assigned work.\" He stated, \"although the gentleman became upset, his degree of upset will not inflame the passions of jurors so as to prevent their calm and dispassionate examination of the evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At the request of defense counsel, the trial justice gave a cautionary instruction when the jury returned to the courtroom. In giving the cautionary instruction, the trial justice stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"All right. Folks, thank you for giving us a few minutes to take up some matters outside your presence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"Mr. Gomez, obviously, as you know, became upset when he was speaking about the death of George Holland. Cases such as these, obviously, will engender some emotion. Sometimes even spectators-it [h]asn't happened yet, but sometimes even spectators in the courtroom become unglued, if I can use the vernacular. In those instances, we take a recess and let things calm down.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"And I simply want to remind you, as I said before the trial started, that there would be instances, for example, during the medical examiner's testimony or during photographic evidence, that would not be particularly pleasant, and I didn't want you to be distracted from your assigned responsibility simply because of things that you heard on the stand or pictures that you saw.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"I also reminded you at the beginning that-if I didn't, I certainly will emphasize it now, and probably later, and I think the lawyers referred to it during their comments to you-sympathy plays no part in the course of your deliberations. Obviously, Mr. Gomez was upset to the extent that he may have engendered some sympathy from you. Understand that notwithstanding his sad feelings over the loss of the young man, that cannot be permitted to affect your judgment as you go forward in this case and as you deliberate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"In other words, you must not permit these kinds of events, be they photographic pieces of evidence of an autopsy, or testimony from someone who is near and dear to the deceased, or things like that, you can't permit those things to inflame your passions so as to prevent your calm and dispassionate examination of the evidence and acceptance of the law that I will provide to you at the end of the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"Can all of you do that?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The trial justice then questioned the jury, \"Are there any of you at all who have been so affected by Mr. Gomez's short interlude of sadness and crying on the\n   stand that they cannot go forward? Anybody feel that way? Everybody okay?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Alexis argues that the cautionary instruction was insufficient to cure the prejudice because the trial justice \"did not direct the jurors to disregard the prejudicial emotional outburst, and he did not emphasize that this behavior did not relate to the guilt or innocence of Mr. Alexis.\" Alexis further argues that the trial justice \"failed to direct the jurors to not consider this emotional outburst, or to put the outburst out of their minds.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We afford the trial justice a great deal of discretion in determining whether or not a witness's emotional reaction inordinately inflamed the passions of the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800775\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/419/#p423\">\n    139 A.3d at 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Though the trial justice agreed that the photograph was not necessary to the state's case, he denied the motion to pass.

Later at trial, defense counsel objected to the admission of the photograph as a full exhibit, arguing that the photograph was unduly prejudicial because the individuals were making hand gestures or signs that appeared to be gang-related. Defense counsel also argued that the photograph was irrelevant because it was uncontested that Alexis was at Moore's party. The state argued that the photograph was relevant as it bore directly on the credibility of the witnesses, and that it was not unduly prejudicial because the word \"gang\" had not been used throughout the trial. The trial justice overruled the objection, finding the photograph to be \"relevant for purposes of showing the concert of action, concert of activity, corroboration of testimony[,]\" and \"credibility * * * of witnesses who have testified.\" The trial justice also found that the evidence was not unduly prejudicial because there was no evidentiary basis to support an inference of gang activity. The trial\n   justice also gave a cautionary instruction to the jury, which provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \"That picture that portrays some young men, ladies and gentlemen, you've heard some testimony about them, a group of some sort, and I simply want to caution you that simply because a person may be a member of or affiliated with a group is in no way to be considered as evidence that the person is somehow necessarily disposed to commit a crime or crimes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Alexis argues before this Court that the photograph was \"enormously prejudicial to Mr. Alexis because all of the young men in that photograph looked like a bunch of thugs who should be locked up forever * * *.\" Alexis asserts that \"[n]obody was contesting that Mr. Alexis, Mr. Winston or Mr. Moore were at that party and this was not an issue at trial.\" Alexis also argues that the trial justice's cautionary instruction was insufficient to cure the prejudice of the photograph because \"the photographs [were] obviously gang pictures and extremely prejudicial to Mr. Alexis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Based on the record, this photograph appears highly probative of defendant's guilt because it was taken the evening of Holland's death; shows Alexis with two individuals who, according to the state's theory of the case, were involved in the murder of Holland; and was taken at the location where the murder weapon was said to have been procured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8398971\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/947/873/#p883\">\n    947 A.2d at 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is only when evidence is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial that a trial justice must exclude it.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We agree with the trial justice here that there is no evidentiary basis to support an inference of gang activity based on the photograph alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, even if this photograph may have raised a question in the minds of the jurors regarding Alexis's affiliation with a gang, the trial justice's cautionary instruction sufficiently directed the jury not to infer criminal activity on the part of Alexis based on his affiliation with the individuals in the photograph. Therefore, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting the photograph.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    Cumulative Effect Doctrine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Alexis also argues that \"the cumulative effect of all of the errors and abuses of discretion in this case resulted in the denial * * * of a fundamentally fair trial.\" Because we have concluded that none of the rulings complained of constituted an abuse of discretion, this claim is without merit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Alexis asserts that the evidence against him was based entirely on the credibility of the state's witnesses and avers that these witnesses were not credible because they had been \"bought and paid for\" by the state, had time to confer with one another, \"gave self-serving testimony, lied, contradicted each other and themselves, and tried to deflect responsibility from themselves to [Alexis] * * *.\" Specifically, Alexis argues that Ndoye's testimony was incredible because\n   he \"deleted all of his Facebook conversations before he went to talk with the Providence Police * * *.\" Alexis also maintains that Bedame's testimony was not credible because he lied \"about not being mad at the Gomez brothers\" when \"his Facebook records indicated he was furious and wanted the Gomez brothers dead.\" Finally, Alexis avers that Winston's testimony was incredible because he \"lied to the police about nearly everything * * *.\" Moreover, Alexis argues that he had no motive to become involved in a confrontation that was strictly between the Gomez brothers, Ndoye, and Bedame. Alexis theorizes that Ndoye and Bedame lied on the stand \"because they were afraid of Johnathan Gomez * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \"On a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, 'the trial justice places himself or herself in the role of a thirteenth juror and then exercises his or her independent judgment as to the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.
