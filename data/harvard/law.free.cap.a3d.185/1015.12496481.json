Byrd's motion to suppress. The Commonwealth claims the trial court erred in finding that: (1) certain jail visitation recordings were made in violation of the Pennsylvania Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act (\"the Wiretap Act\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the two-party consent exception did not apply; and (2) the warrantless search of Byrd's vehicle was not within the parameters of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's newly recognized vehicle exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a thorough review of the submissions by the parties, the certified record, and relevant law, we reverse the court's suppression of the jail visitation recordings and certain evidence (the 20 bags of heroin, lockbox, vest, and cell phone) seized from Byrd's vehicle, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The trial court set forth the factual history as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   The uncontradicted evidence presented at the suppression hearing established that on February 23, 2015 at approximately 6:00 p.m., Officer Ross Weimer of the McKeesport Police Department was dispatched to 807 Leech Street for a call of a female receiving threatening calls with a suspect parked outside the residence in a grey F-150 truck. When Officer Weimer arrived at the residence, he noted a grey F-150 truck parked a few houses away. Upon entering the residence, he spoke to Ms. Velez, who told him that a man known to her as \"Reek\" had threatened to kill her, had a gun and was parked outside her house. Ms. Velez pointed out the grey truck previously referenced. Officer Weimer approached the truck, which initially drove directly at him but did stop on command. The driver, later identified as [Byrd], initially opened the window 2-\n   3 inches and eventually opened it all the way. Officer Weimer detected a strong odor of marijuana through the open window. Officer Weimer described [Byrd] as acting in a nervous manner with shaking hands and rapid breathing and called for back-up. When Officer Krejdovsky arrived, Officer Weimer asked [Byrd] to exit the vehicle and although he eventually opened the door, [Byrd] refused to get out. Officer Weimer pulled him out of the truck and a struggle ensued during which Officer Krejdovsky slipped on some ice and fell down a small hill. [Byrd] continued to struggle with Office[r] Weimer and was eventually able to break free after shedding his coat and shirt. [Byrd] ran and Officer Weimer chased him and attempted to use his taser, but he missed [Byrd]. [Byrd] eventually slipped on some ice near Officer Weimer's police vehicle and suffered a seizure while on the ground. Medics were called to attend to [Byrd]. Officer Krejdovsky testified that he observed a gun magazine under a piece of cloth on the front seat of the truck and he lifted the cloth to discover a .40 caliber handgun.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Also introduced into evidence was a stipulation that 20 stamp bags of heroin were found in an unlocked lockbox on the passenger seat of the vehicle, a bulletproof vest was found in the back seat of the vehicle and two (2) cell phones and a scale were also found in the vehicle (their location was not specified). Also stipulated to was that upon his arrest, 44 individually wrapped bags of marijuana, 10 individually wrapped bags of powder cocaine, four (4) bags of crack cocaine and $205.00 were found in [Byrd]'s pockets. The Commonwealth did not present any evidence regarding how the search of the truck was effectuated, but rather argued that it was appropriate due to the automobile exception to the search warrant requirement or, alternately, a search incident to arrest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Trial Court Opinion, 1/12/2017, at 3-4 (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Byrd was charged with persons not to possess firearms, carrying a firearm without a license, three counts of possession with intent to deliver, and three counts of possession of controlled substance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Byrd filed a motion to suppress on February 10, 2016, in which he alleged the stop and subsequent search was unreasonable, illegal, and violated his constitutional rights. He filed an amended suppression motion on May 18, 2016, requesting the court exclude further evidence related to the search of his person. Subsequently, the Commonwealth notified Byrd of its intent to present certain evidence against him that was obtained as a result of recording his conversations with visitors at the Allegheny County Jail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Byrd filed a second amended motion to suppress on October 11, 2016, arguing these jail recordings violated his constitutional rights and the Wiretap Act. A hearing was held on October 31, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   That same day, the court\n   entered two orders: (1) granting Byrd's suppression motion as to the 20 bags of heroin, lockbox, vests, and two cell phones that were found in the vehicle, but denying his request as to remaining evidence seized from the vehicle; and (2) granting Byrd's motion to suppress all recordings of his jail visits. The Commonwealth filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied November 29, 2016. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its first issue, the Commonwealth contends the trial court erred in rejecting its argument that Byrd's jail visit recordings \"were permitted under the two-party consent exception to the Wiretap Act, finding the Commonwealth failed to prove that [Byrd] heard the recording warning which was played each time an inmate used the phone system to talk to a visitor.\" Commonwealth's Brief at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Our standard of review of a trial court's order granting a defendant/appellee's motion to suppress evidence is well established:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   When the Commonwealth appeals from a suppression order, we follow a clearly defined standard of review and consider only the evidence from the defendant's witnesses together with the evidence of the prosecution that, when read in the context of the entire record, remains uncontradicted.

Moreover, Ms. Heaps testified that she knew she was being recorded and [Byrd]'s behavior and statements demonstrated that he believed that they were being recorded as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Commonwealth's Brief at 20-21. The Commonwealth concludes \"the intercepts were lawful\" under the mutual consent exception to the Wiretap Act.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In suppressing the recordings, the court found the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The evidence presented at the suppression hearing established that inmate visits at the Allegheny County Jail are conducted over a closed-circuit system using telephone receivers. A visitor arriving at the Allegheny County Jail is taken to a visitor room with windowed cubicles, chairs and a telephone receiver. The inmate is escorted to a room on the other side of the visitor window with a telephone receiver below the window. There are no cubicles or walls on the inmate side. The inmate picks up the receiver, enters his or her jail telephone ID number and then the visitor picks up his or her receiver. Before the parties are connected, a recording stating that the visit \"may be monitored or recorded\" is played. There is nothing in the inmate handbook which indicates that the visits are recorded and there was no testimony regarding whether [Byrd] heard the recording before each visit. Ms. Heaps testified that she heard the recording indicating that the conversation \"may be monitored or recorded\" at each visit, but received no written documentation indicating that the conversations would be monitored or recorded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   In support of its arguments, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Ms. Heaps, who testified that she heard a recorded statement stating that the conversation \"may be monitored or recorded\" prior to the connection of each visit call. Even though Ms. Heaps was never informed of the policy in writing or gave her consent in writing, the Commonwealth presumes that by beginning to speak after the recorded statement, she signified her consent. This Court accepts the Commonwealth's presumption for purposes of this analysis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Nevertheless, the Commonwealth has failed to present any evidence indicating that [Byrd] heard the recording. It is not outside the realm of possibility that [Byrd] did not have the receiver to his ear when the recording played, and therefore may not have heard it. The Commonwealth conceded that [Byrd] was not provided with a written statement or agreement regarding consent to be recorded, and similarly conceded that there was no such provision in the inmate handbook.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   At the conclusion of the suppression hearing, this Court made the following findings:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   THE COURT: But there is no direct evidence of what Mr. Byrd may have known.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [THE COMMONWEALTH]: Well, Mr. [Samuel] Pastor testified that both parties hear this on every visitation. And he's got to have the phone up to his ear when he's punching in-\n   he picks up the phone and he punches in his ID number and it says the call is being processed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: Well, but he doesn't have to have the phone to his ear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: Actually the inmates in the Allegheny County Jail are told, as I heard on the recording that you played, may be subject to recording. May be monitored or recorded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [THE COMMONWEALTH]: I said it's almost identical. What the federal-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE COURT: There's a big difference between \"is\" and \"may be\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE COURT: The court finds that you have not proven the consent of Mr. Byrd in this case. Relying on the Fant decision, the jail visit conversations will be suppressed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (S.H.T., pp. 33, 36, 38).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   By failing to establish that [Byrd] was aware of the recording and consented to it, the Commonwealth has not satisfied the requirements on two-party consent exception to the Wiretap Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Trial Court Opinion, 1/12/2017, at 8, 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We are constrained to disagree for several reasons. First, we conclude the factual findings made by the trial court are belied by the record. We reiterate that, as the trial court noted: (1) before an inmate and visitor can converse with one another, a recording stating that the visit \"may be monitored or recorded\" is played;\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) Heaps acknowledged at the suppression hearing that during every one of her visits with Byrd at the jail, she heard a prerecorded messaged that those visits would be recorded or monitored, and still decided to speak with him.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   N.T., 10/31/2016, at 22, 27.

The officers were told that [Byrd] had a gun in his possession. They did what they were supposed to. They went out and investigated. They smelled marijuana. [Byrd] was nervous, uncooperative, tried to run, and the officers acted. According to [Byrd]'s constitutional right [sic], the gun was found in plain view.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   When [Byrd] was searched, the 44 bags of marijuana, the ten bags of cocaine, the four bags of crack and two something else were on his person and are not suppressed. However, the 20 bags in the lockbox, the vest and the two phones, the suppression is granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   N.T., 10/31/2016, at 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In its Rule 1925(a) opinion, the court further explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [A]s this Court noted in its findings at the conclusion of the hearing, the police had been summoned for a call of an individual threatening a woman and in possession of a gun. When Officer Weimer attempt to speak to [Byrd], he acted strangely and then attempted to run away. A gun was found in plain view on the driver's seat. The information given to the police (that [Byrd] had made threats against a woman and had a gun) was sufficient to support the actions taken by the police in removing the [Byrd] from the vehicle (and then finding the gun in plain view), but they did not give rise to any probable cause that would justify their warrantless search of the vehicle. The police did not receive information that [Byrd] was in possession of or selling drugs or conducting any drug activity from his vehicle. The Commonwealth's argument is, essentially, that [Byrd] is a bad guy and that is enough probable cause to justify the search of the vehicle. The officers did not see any drug paraphernalia in plain view and though Officer Weimer detected an odor of marijuana, there was a large amount of marijuana found on [Byrd]'s person when he was eventually subdued. The officers did not observe [Byrd] buying, selling or otherwise transferring drugs to another person. The officers did not observe [Byrd] weighing or packaging drugs for sale. The officers did not see [Byrd] exchanging money with anyone. The officers did not observe [Byrd] engaged in any behavior typically noted in a drug transaction. The totality of the circumstances supported a finding of probable cause for the crimes of terroristic threats and possession of a firearm only, not that drugs were being held and/or sold from the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Trial Court Opinion, 1/12/2017, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Commonwealth counters the court's findings with the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Here, Velez advised Officer Weimer that [Byrd] had threatened to kill her, was parked outside her house and had a gun. Officer Weimer confronted [Byrd], he opened the window and the officer\n   detected a strong odor of marijuana through the open window. [Byrd] was acting nervously, his hands shaking. When asked to exit the vehicle, [Byrd] refused to get out, a struggle ensued and [he] fled, ultimately being apprehended by the police. Officer Krejdovsky observed a gun magazine under a piece of cloth on the front seat of the truck and he lifted the cloth to discover a .40 caliber handgun. Contrary to the conclusion of the [trial] court, the police had probable cause to believe that [Byrd] was in possession of drugs and guns, and therefore, had sufficient information to support the warrantless search of the vehicle pursuant to\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gary, supra.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   In finding\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   inapposite to the instant case, the suppression court focused on the fact that, while the police had been summoned for a call of a woman threatened by a man with a gun, they had not received any information that regarding [Byrd] selling drugs. Further, while acknowledging that the police smelled the odor of marijuana, the court found that the fact that they found marijuana on his person obviated the need for any further research. Similarly, because the police found a gun in plain view, the court concluded that the police could not make any further search of the vehicle. Overlooked by the court is the fact that these facts support the finding and confirmation of probable cause, rather than negate it. The [trial] court was of the opinion that once the officers found evidence that supported the initiation of their search, they were required to stop and get a warrant. The vehicle exception adopted in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   supports the opposite.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Commonwealth's Brief at 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Again, we are compelled to disagree with the trial court's conclusion. The court's analysis is misplaced as it heavily focuses on the drug aspect of the search, highlighting the following: (1) that the police did not receive information that Byrd was in possession of or selling drugs or conducting any drug activity from his vehicle; (2) the officers did not see any drug paraphernalia in plain view; and (3) Officer Weimer should have stopped his search when he found a large amount of marijuana found on Byrd's person. The police did not have to stop searching once they observed the gun on the front seat as the totality of the circumstances warranted further investigation. Byrd's initial acts established probable cause for the crimes of terroristic threats and possession of a firearm and permitted the officers to continue searching the vehicle for other contraband (i.e., ammunition, knives, other weapons) related to these crimes even though they seized one gun and removed Byrd from the vehicle.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See Gary, supra.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, the police did seize a bulletproof vest from the back seat of Byrd's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Moreover, the officers were permitted to search the unlocked lockbox on the passenger seat of Byrd's vehicle\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wyoming v.
