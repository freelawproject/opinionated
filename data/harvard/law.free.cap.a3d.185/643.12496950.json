Mollo, appeals from the judgment of strict foreclosure rendered by the trial court in favor of the plaintiff, Nationstar Mortgage, LLC. The defendant sets forth five claims that may be\n   distilled as follows: (1) the judgment of strict foreclosure was improper because the court lacked authority to render summary judgment as to liability on the note and mortgage, and (2) the trial\n   court erroneously determined that his special defenses and counterclaim were legally insufficient and/or failed to establish any genuine issue of material fact. Specifically, the defendant's first claim is that procedurally, the court lacked authority to grant summary judgment because the plaintiff failed to file any motion or memorandum of law attacking the legal sufficiency of his special defenses or counterclaim and failed to submit any competent evidence to establish that there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the issues raised in them. With respect to the second claim, the defendant argues that the court's decision granting summary judgment as to liability in favor of the plaintiff was clearly erroneous in that he presented uncontroverted evidence that demonstrated that genuine issues of material fact exist with respect to his special defenses of unclean hands, fraudulent inducement and equitable estoppel, and his counterclaim under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. In addition, the defendant claims that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that any defect in pleading his unclean hands defense and the CUTPA counterclaim could not be cured by repleading. We agree with the defendant that the court lacked authority to grant the motion for summary judgment as to liability because the plaintiff failed to file any motion or memorandum of law attacking the legal sufficiency of the special defenses and failed to submit any competent evidence to establish that there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the issues raised in them. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment rendered by the trial court on the plaintiff's complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of our conclusion that the court\n   did not render a final judgment with respect to the defendant's counterclaim, we dismiss the portion of the appeal challenging the purported judgment on the counterclaim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   See General Statutes \u00a7 52-263 ; Practice Book \u00a7 61-4 ;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"682753\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/191/27/#p30\">\n    191 Conn. 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 30,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=463%20A.2d%20566\">\n    463 A.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our analysis. On June 26, 2007, the defendant executed a promissory note, entitled \"Adjustable Rate Note,\" in favor of First National Bank of Arizona (FNB Arizona) in the original principal amount of $261,000. To secure his obligations under the note, the defendant granted a mortgage to Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., as nominee for FNB Arizona in his real property known as 109 Lyon Road in Burlington. The mortgage was assigned by an assignment of mortgage to the plaintiff on February 15, 2013. This assignment of the mortgage was recorded on March 11, 2013,\n   in Volume 321 at page 656 of the town of Burlington land records. The plaintiff claims that, on or about October 1, 2012, the defendant defaulted on his payment obligations under the note. On April 22, 2013, the plaintiff initiated the present action to foreclose its mortgage and alleged that it was the owner of the note and mortgage executed by the defendant on June 26, 2007, in\n   favor of FNB Arizona.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant filed a disclosure of defense on May 8, 2014, and a motion to strike on July 16, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response to the motion to strike, on February 6, 2015, the plaintiff filed a request for leave to file an amended complaint and an amended complaint, to which the defendant did not object. See Practice Book \u00a7 10-60 (a) (3). On March 25, 2015, prior to the defendant's filing an answer to the amended complaint, the plaintiff filed its first motion for summary judgment, to which the defendant did not respond. On December 16, 2015, the plaintiff filed a second motion for summary judgment. On December 21, 2015, the defendant filed a request for an extension of time in which to respond to this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the operative motion for summary judgment and memorandum of law in support thereof, the plaintiff alleged that there were no genuine issues as to any material fact set forth in the\n   <em>\n    complaint\n   </em>\n   , as it is the current holder of the note and mortgage and the defendant is in default under the terms of the note and mortgage. Attached to the plaintiff's motion was the following documentation, which purported to set forth a prima facie case for foreclosure against the defendant:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   copies of the note, the mortgage and its adjustable rate rider, the assignment of the mortgage to the plaintiff, and an affidavit from Tina Marie Braune, a document execution specialist employed by the plaintiff who averred that the defendant remains in default of the terms and obligations of the mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 14, 2016, the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment appeared on the short calendar for argument. Three days prior to this short calendar, on March 11, 2016, the defendant filed an answer, special defenses and counterclaim and at the same time, an objection to the motion for summary judgment. The objection was untimely, as Practice Book (2016) \u00a7 17-45 then required that \"[a]ny adverse party shall at least five days before the date the motion is to be considered on the short calendar file opposing affidavits and other available documentary evidence. Affidavits, and other documentary proof not already a part of the file, shall be filed and served as are pleadings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his answer, the defendant denied that the plaintiff was entitled to any relief and further denied that the plaintiff could satisfy its burden of proving that it was entitled to the equitable remedy of foreclosure. He also brought a counterclaim that alleged violations of CUTPA as a result of the use of a \"bait and switch teaser note and option [adjustable rate mortgage] negative amortization loan designed to fail,\" a fraudulent assignment of the mortgage, \"part of an ongoing fraudulent scheme of the plaintiff to 'robo-sign' mortgage loan documents,\" and illegal attempts by the plaintiff to\n   exclude the defendant from possession of the premises by use of force. He claimed an entitlement to a set off against any debt that is claimed to be due by the plaintiff in the amount of any damages arising from his CUTPA counterclaim. In addition, the defendant pleaded three special defenses: unclean hands, fraudulent inducement and equitable estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In objecting to the motion for summary judgment, the defendant filed a comprehensive \"memorandum of law in support of objection to motion for summary judgment\" in which he argued that his special defenses and counterclaim were legally sufficient and that there remained genuine issues of material fact with respect to his claims. Attached to his memorandum, and relevant to this appeal, are the defendant's own affidavit attesting to misleading and fraudulent misrepresentations on the part of FNB Arizona at the time he signed the note and mortgage, a truth-in-lending disclosure statement that the defendant alleges failed to disclose the alternative payment schedules provided in the adjustable rate mortgage,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the detailed affidavit of a purported expert, Randall Huinker, who opined that \"[t]he facts and circumstances regarding this loan indicate that it meets the criteria for predatory lending outlined in an [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency] Advisory Letter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When the short calendar hearing concerning the motion for summary judgment commenced, counsel for the defendant was not present. Counsel for the plaintiff objected to the court entertaining the defendant's objection to summary judgment because his written objection\n   was not timely filed and he only had been able to glance at it before he left his office to come to court. In the alternative, the plaintiff argued that if the court were to consider the defendant's objection, the plaintiff should be allowed sufficient time to amend its motion for summary judgment accordingly. The court, despite noting that the terms of the mortgage were \"ridiculous\" and \"harsh,\" and further indicating it did not know whether the mortgage, alleged by the defendant to be predatory in nature, was illegal as a matter of law, overruled the objection and granted the motion for summary judgment as to liability only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Later that day, while counsel for the plaintiff was still present, counsel for the defendant arrived and the court indicated that it would rehear argument. After\n   hearing further argument, mostly from the defendant, the court again overruled the defendant's objection and permitted its decision granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff to stand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court made only passing references to the defendant's special defenses and at no time during the hearing did it make any reference to the defendant's counterclaim. The court indicated\n   that it did not \"see anything wrong in the making of this note except that [the defendant] made a bad bargain.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 6, 2016, the court,\n   <em>\n    Abrams, J.\n   </em>\n   , granted the plaintiff's motion for judgment of foreclosure and rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We now address the defendant's claim that the court lacked authority to grant summary judgment\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   in light of the fact that, in its motion, the plaintiff did not argue that the defendant's special defenses were legally insufficient and/or argue that no genuine issues of material fact existed with respect to the special defenses,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   such\n   that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we set forth our standard of review and other relevant legal principles. Practice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment \"shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" As an appellate court, \"[w]e must decide whether the trial court erred in determining that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.... In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.... The test is whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts.... A material fact is a fact which will make a difference in the result of the case.... [I]ssue-finding, rather than issue-determination, is the key to the procedure.... [T]he trial court does not sit as the trier of fact when ruling on a motion for summary judgment....

As a result, the defendant argues, the plaintiff failed to meet its initial burden of submitting competent evidence to establish that there is not a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the issues raised in his special defenses, and further, failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that each of his special defenses does not state a legally cognizable defense that cannot be cured by repleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The plaintiff's motion for summary judgment addressed only the issues raised in its foreclosure complaint. Counsel for the plaintiff understood that the plaintiff needed to file a pleading in response to the defendant's objection if the court was going to entertain it, such as an amendment to its motion for summary judgment or other pleading to address the merits or legal sufficiency of the defendant's newly-posed special defenses. In the absence of counsel for the defendant, however, when the court appeared disinclined to continue the matter\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and indicated it preferred to consider the motion and the defendant's untimely objection to it, the plaintiff acquiesced and made no further effort\n   to make the court aware of the risk of proceeding in the face of such procedural irregularity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the present case, the court lacked authority to render summary judgment as\n   to liability in favor of the plaintiff with respect to the factual or legal viability of the defendant's special defenses because the issues relating to the special defenses remained outside the scope of the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff's motion had been filed before the defendant filed his answer, special defenses and counterclaim and therefore, it did not address the factual or legal issues raised therein. The only ground the plaintiff had raised in favor of summary judgment was limited to the facts alleged in its foreclosure complaint. As our Supreme Court has explained: \"[T]he court's function is generally limited to adjudicating the issues\n   <em>\n    raised by the parties\n   </em>\n   on the proof they have presented and applying appropriate procedural sanctions on motion of a party....

Second, a party may move for summary judgment and request the trial court to render judgment in its favor if there is no genuine issue of fact and the moving party is entitled\n   to judgment as a matter of law. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 17-44 [and] 17-49. In both instances, the rules of practice require a party to file a written motion to trigger the trial court's determination of a dispositive question of law. The rules of practice do not provide the trial court with authority to determine dispositive questions of law in the absence of such a motion.\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Vertex, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Waterbury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3666377\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/278/557/#p564\">\n    278 Conn. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 564-65,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=898%20A.2d%20178\">\n    898 A.2d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Keating\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Conn.%20App.%20854\">\n    156 Conn.

We will not countenance a summary judgment procedure that only requires a party in its written pleading to address some, but not all, of the issues whose resolution is necessary to resolve a particular claim. Such a practice is a disservice to all parties and the court. When a rule of practice requires a written motion, a memorandum of law and supporting documentation, it is because the issue to be decided is of considerable importance. In the case of summary judgment, which results in a swift, concise end to often complex litigation without benefit of a full trial, the parties and the court need to be as well informed as possible on the applicable law and facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the present case, as a result of the defendant's last minute filing, the plaintiff understandably had not yet raised any grounds for summary judgment related to the defendant's special defenses. Its memorandum of law in support of summary judgment and the documentation appended to it shed no light on their validity, as no argument or even a scintilla of evidence had been presented refuting the factual allegations raised by the defendant's objection and supporting documentation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"A court may not grant summary judgment sua sponte....

The only way for the plaintiff to properly have invoked the court's authority to render a summary judgment as to liability in light of the special defenses raised by the defendant was to proceed in the manner it first suggested to the court: to mark off the argument on the motion for summary judgment to enable it to file a new pleading addressing the special defenses with an accompanying brief and/or competent evidence sufficient to establish their legal insufficiency or that no genuine issue of material fact exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude, on the basis of the facts of this case, that the court acted in excess of its authority when it raised and considered, sua sponte, grounds for summary judgment not raised or briefed by the plaintiff. Moreover, as set forth previously, the trial court did not render judgment with respect to the defendant's counterclaim and this court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over that portion of his appeal. See footnote 2 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The portion of the appeal in which the defendant challenges the court's granting of the motion for summary judgment as to his counterclaim is dismissed; the judgment of strict foreclosure is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Because our resolution of the defendant's first claim is dispositive, we do not reach the merits of his other claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Both parties on appeal argue whether the court erred in rendering summary judgment on the defendant's counterclaim. Our review of the record, however, reveals that no judgment was entered on the defendant's counterclaim. Accordingly, we only address the propriety of the court's granting summary judgment as to liability on the complaint and special defenses. We note that if the court had rendered summary judgment on the counterclaim, we would conclude it lacked authority to do so as no motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim had been filed by either party.

Although the defendant, in his counterclaim, alleged that the assignment of the mortgage to the plaintiff was fraudulent, during the hearing on the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and his objection thereto, at the suggestion of the court, he agreed to narrow his objection to defenses involving the making, validity and enforcement of the note and mortgage.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    In his disclosure of defense, the defendant indicated that defenses would be made, \"on the basis of the plaintiff's lack of standing and the lender being involved in equity skimming and predatory lending.\" The defendant also reserved the right to present additional defenses should such defenses be discovered at a future date. Subsequent to the plaintiff's filing of its amended complaint in February 2015, at no time prior to the filing of the defendant's answer, special defenses and counterclaim on March 11, 2016, did the plaintiff move for default against the defendant for failure to plead in response to its amended complaint. See Practice Book \u00a7 17-32.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Under the current rule of practice, the moving party shall not claim a motion for summary judgment to the short calendar fewer than forty-five days after the filing of the motion and the adverse party has forty-five days to file and serve a response.

Before this court, the plaintiff asserts that this disclosure statement is unrelated to the note and mortgage at issue in the present case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The court never issued a written memorandum of decision further articulating its reasons for granting summary judgment and neither party has provided us with a signed transcript of the court's oral decision, upon which they both rely, as required by Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 (a). The defendant did not file a motion pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 (b) providing notice that the court had not filed a signed transcript of its oral decision. Nor did the defendant take any additional steps to obtain a decision in compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 (a). In some cases in which the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 (a) have not been followed, this court has declined to review the claims raised on appeal due to the lack of an adequate record. Our review of the dispositive issue in the present appeal is plenary. Moreover, despite the absence of a signed transcript of the court's oral decision or a written memorandum of decision, our ability to review the claims raised on appeal is not hampered because we are able to readily identify a sufficiently detailed and concise statement of the court's findings in the transcript of the proceedings.

Viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, his affidavit raised several areas in which factual determinations may control the outcome. \"[S]ummary judgment procedure is particularly inappropriate where the inferences which the parties seek to have drawn deal with questions of motive, intent and subjective feelings and reactions....
