That rule generally precludes judicial review of prison grievance decisions unless the matter involves a constitutional right not limited by the Department of Corrections (\"DOC\").

DOC rejected the grievance upon the ground that Benchoff, in fact, had received four prescription medications. Throughout the administrative appeals process, DOC upheld its initial response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Benchoff filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petition for review in the Commonwealth Court's original jurisdiction, seeking a writ of mandamus on the basis that he was entitled to a hearing to remedy the allegedly improper deductions from his inmate account. Benchoff asserted that, because the inmate grievance procedure did not meet the minimum standards established by the Administrative Agency Law, DOC violated his right to due process. DOC filed preliminary objections arguing that, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Bronson\n   </em>\n   , the Commonwealth Court lacked original jurisdiction because Benchoff's claim did not involve a constitutional right that was not lawfully limited by DOC's regulations. DOC further asserted that medical copay grievances are not appealable to the Commonwealth Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Commonwealth Court sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed Benchoff's petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benchoff v.

Slip Op. at 2. Although the Commonwealth Court correctly held that original jurisdiction did not lie because DOC directives limited the underlying right at issue, it is difficult to square the Commonwealth Court's characterization of Benchoff's claim with the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court focused upon what it perceived to be a claim to free medical services, whereas the right at issue is a property interest in an inmate's money. However, Benchoff did not request free medical services, nor did he dispute the charges to his inmate account for the prescriptions that he received. Rather, Benchoff alleged a violation of due process only with respect to deductions for two medications that he claimed never to have received. Brief for Benchoff at 11-12. It is well-settled that a prisoner has a constitutional property interest in his inmate account, and that \"inmates are entitled to due process with respect to any deprivation of this money.\"\n   <em>\n    Buck v.

Nevertheless, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Bronson\n   </em>\n   , original jurisdiction does not lie in the Commonwealth Court unless an inmate can identify a right not limited by DOC. As the court aptly noted, DOC medical services regulations limit Benchoff's constitutionally protected property\n   interest in his inmate account. Thus, I am constrained to agree with the Commonwealth Court's determination that, under\n   <em>\n    Bronson\n   </em>\n   , it lacked original jurisdiction over Benchoff's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This result is troubling. This case echoes the concerns that I expressed in my dissenting statement in\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

A grievance process that does not preserve some access to a court of record, however strictly circumscribed, not only is constitutionally inadequate, but also undermines traditional notions of fairness and justice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, \"the regulation promulgated by [DOC] enabling the internal grievance system specifically permits inmates to pursue any remedies available to them in state or federal forums.\"\n   <em>\n    McCray v.

Thus, it is the explicit preservation of access to the courts in the regulation that \"perhaps rescues this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Bronson\n   </em>\n   from resting upon what otherwise may be questionable constitutional footing.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12349842,12349797\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/200/\">\n    177 A.3d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wecht, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, despite this explicit reservation of a right of access to a state or federal court, neither our statutory nor decisional law provide a clear path to the vindication of that right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Bronson\n   </em>\n   Court provided no guidance as to how and when an inmate may pursue available remedies in state and federal court.\n   <em>\n    Bronson\n   </em>\n   does not address how a prisoner can argue a meritorious claim where, as here, the Commonwealth Court mischaracterized the nature of the claim, failed to consider Section 93.9, and concluded that it lacked jurisdiction. In fact,\n   <em>\n    Bronson\n   </em>\n   does not refer to Section 93.9's grievance procedure at all. Therefore, inmates must overcome two potentially insurmountable barriers in order to access the Commonwealth Court. An inmate first must state a constitutional claim. Next, even if an inmate establishes a protected interest, he must demonstrate that DOC does not limit that interest as a consequence of incarceration. As a practical matter, it is difficult to conceive of any personal or property interest that is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   limited by DOC. Indeed, DOC has promulgated rules relating to nearly every facet of a prisoner's life, from property (DC-ADM 815) and collection of inmate debts (DC-ADM 005) to cable television (DC-ADM 002) and telephone calls (DC-ADM 818). Thus, in the absence of guidance as to the interplay between the regulatory framework of the inmate grievance process and its holding, the\n   <em>\n    Bronson\n   </em>\n   Court essentially gave the Commonwealth Court license to close its doors to virtually any incarcerated citizen seeking redress for a grievance involving constitutionally protected interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition to my practical concerns with\n   <em>\n    Bronson\n   </em>\n   , I also am not convinced that our holding is consistent with the statutory law of this Commonwealth. The plain language of the statute that provides for the Commonwealth Court's original jurisdiction states, in relevant part, that \"[t]he Commonwealth Court shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions or proceedings... [a]gainst the Commonwealth government, including any officer thereof.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 761(a)(1). Critically, Section 761 does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   state that the Commonwealth Court shall have original jurisdiction\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   where \"an inmate can identify a personal or property interest ... not limited by [DOC] regulations and which has been affected by a final decision of the department.\"\n   <em>\n    Bronson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11789820,765967\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/721/357/\">\n    721 A.2d at 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In an opinion barely spanning three pages, the\n   <em>\n    Bronson\n   </em>\n   Court considered,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , whether the Commonwealth Court has original jurisdiction over inmate appeals from decisions of the Central Office Review Committee (CORC).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Inmate Purcell Bronson sought appellate review of the CORC's decision denying him reimbursement for confiscated civilian clothing.

The system will provide for review and resolution of inmate grievances at the most decentralized level possible. It will also provide for review of the initial decision making and for possible appeal to the Central Office of the Department. An inmate will not be disciplined for the good faith use of the grievance systems. However, an inmate who submits a grievance for review which is false, frivolous or malicious may be subject to appropriate disciplinary procedures. A frivolous grievance is one in which the allegations or the relief sought lack any arguable basis in fact as set forth in DC-ADM 804-Inmate Grievance System, which is disseminated to inmates.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    (b) Inmates may also pursue available remedies in State and Federal court.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2093.9\">\n     37 Pa.

The courts of common pleas' original jurisdiction statute states, in relevant part, as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n    <em>\n     Except where exclusive original jurisdiction of an action or proceeding is by statute ... vested in another court of this Commonwealth\n    </em>\n    , the courts of common pleas shall have unlimited original jurisdiction of all actions and proceedings, including all actions and proceedings heretofore cognizable by law or usage in the courts of common pleas.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 931(a) (emphasis added). However, the plain language of the Commonwealth Court's original jurisdiction statute belies that assumption.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 761 (stating that the Commonwealth Court has original jurisdiction of all civil claims against the Commonwealth government and providing that, subject to exceptions not applicable here, \"[t]he jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court ... shall be\n    <em>\n     exclusive\n    </em>\n    \") (emphasis added) ). A simple hypothetical illustrates the problem arising from this conflict between the statutes. Suppose an inmate files his claim in a court of common pleas because he knows that, under\n    <em>\n     Bronson\n    </em>\n    , the Commonwealth Court lacks original jurisdiction over his constitutional claim. When the inmate's claim arrives upon the desk of a judge in the court of common pleas, the judge notes that DOC is the defendant in the case. Because the Commonwealth Court has exclusive jurisdiction of actions against DOC, the court of common pleas transfers the case to the Commonwealth Court, which then dismisses the inmate's claim pursuant to\n    <em>\n     Bronson\n    </em>\n    . The inmate essentially is faced with a \"heads I win, tails you lose\" scenario in which he is expelled from both state courts for lack of original jurisdiction. Thus, as a practical matter, the courts of this Commonwealth routinely may, indeed\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n    , close their doors to inmates, regardless of how egregious the infringements upon their constitutional rights may be, provided that they do not fall within the narrow\n    <em>\n     Bronson\n    </em>\n    exception.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The Commonwealth Court lacks original jurisdiction to hear the following civil actions:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    (i) actions or proceedings in the nature of applications for a writ of habeas corpus or post-conviction relief not ancillary to proceedings within the appellate jurisdiction of the court;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n    (ii) eminent domain proceedings;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n    (iii) actions or proceedings conducted pursuant to Chapter 85 (relating to matters affecting government units);\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n    (iv) actions or proceedings conducted pursuant to the act of May 20, 1937 (P.L. 728, No. 193), referred to as the Board of Claims Act; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n    (v) actions or proceedings in the nature of trespass as to which the Commonwealth government formerly enjoyed sovereign or other immunity and actions or proceedings in the nature of assumpsit relating to such actions or proceedings in the nature of trespass.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 761(a)(1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    A Chief Grievance Officer now performs all of the functions previously performed by the CORC, such as conducting the final review of an inmate's grievance appeal.
