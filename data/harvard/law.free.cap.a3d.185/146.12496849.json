Rina Calvo was injured in a car accident while driving from her home to a mandatory work training on a Saturday-normally her day off. We consider whether the Circuit Court for Montgomery County should have granted summary judgment in judicial review proceedings of an order of the Workers' Compensation Commission (\"Commission\"). In so doing, we shed light on a complicated and factually-intensive exception\n   to the going and coming rule: the special mission or errand doctrine.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-10\">\n<strong>\n    FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-11\">\n   Calvo has been employed by Montgomery County (\"County\") as a bus driver for approximately 20 years. Her regular work schedule is Monday through Friday, and she is based at the Silver Spring Depot. On May 6, 2015, Calvo received a letter\n   notifying her that she was scheduled to attend an \"important mandatory training\" set for Saturday, May 16, 2015, at the Gaithersburg Depot. The notice stated that Calvo was not required to be in uniform to attend the \"customer service class,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that the training was set to run from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The County required all employees to attend this training annually. En route to the training, Calvo was rear-ended by another car while waiting at a traffic light.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-12\">\n   Calvo filed a claim with the Commission, seeking compensation for injuries sustained in the rear-end collision. At the Commission hearing on October 30, 2015, Calvo testified about her injury, as well as the mandatory nature of the training. She believed that if she missed the training she would probably get suspended or be prevented from going back to work \"full duty.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before the Commission, the parties argued the applicability of the special mission exception. The Commission awarded compensation after finding that Calvo \"sustained an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment ....\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-13\">\n   The County sought judicial review of the Commission's Order in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, and requested a jury trial. Shortly thereafter, the County filed a\n   motion for summary judgment on grounds that the \"going and coming rule\" prohibited recovery-because accidental injuries sustained while going to or coming from work do not ordinarily arise out of and in the course of employment, and none of the exceptions to the rule applied. Calvo opposed the Motion, maintaining that compensation was proper under the special mission exception, or because she was a traveling employee. After a hearing, the Court granted the County's motion.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court concluded that as a matter of law, Calvo's accident fell within the going and coming rule, and that Calvo was not a traveling employee. The Court considered that Calvo was not compensated for her travel, it was an \"annual, regular training\" that was \"part and parcel of her job,\" and it was not \"out of the ordinary.\" It found that the training was \"bus driver stuff,\" which involved \"go[ing] over the rules of the road,\" and that the change in location, work on a day off, and the difference in distance did not bring Calvo's case within the special mission exception.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-15\">\n   In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court's grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    Calvo v.

The intermediate appellate court considered more than the fact that the employee's trip was on a day that \"was not a normally scheduled work day.\" It also weighed the regularity of her making weekend trips to the hospital, the unusualness of being contacted during off-hours as well as the frequency and circumstances under which she made weekend trips to the hospital.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4433338\" index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/109/543/#p555\">\n    109 Md.

The relationship between Ms. Calvo's journey and the service to be performed is illustrated by the hypothetical in\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   : \"if a janitor [who] walks five blocks to spend two hours working at a church in the evening, it would be difficult to conclude that the journey is a significant part of the total service.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4433338\" index=\"322\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/109/543/#p555\">\n    109 Md.

The New Jersey intermediate appellate court recognized that although the employer directed the officer to obtain the clearance prior to returning to full-time duty, the employer \"did not dictate, nor did it have any control over the course of petitioner's travel, or manner by which he was transported to [the doctor's] office.\"\n   <em>\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\"607956\" index=\"327\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/279/114/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n</em>\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\"607956\" index=\"327\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/279/114/\">\n    at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There, the intermediate appellate court noted that the employee who usually ran the accounting report was not available, thus, making Barnes's trip necessary.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4433338\" index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/109/543/#p555\">\n    109 Md.

The Court of Special Appeals properly focused on the nature of the journey as one that was unexpected, unusual, and urgent, and, therefore, correctly determined that the journey was a special mission on behalf of her employer.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-129\">\n   In the instant case, the Majority Opinion disregards any consideration of urgency, or lack thereof, in its analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 342-44, 185 A.3d at 162-63. By doing so, the Majority Opinion gives short shrift to the import of this factor in the\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   analysis. Significantly, the Court of Special Appeals, in\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   , observed, \"the fact that Barnes was called on a Saturday and instructed to report to the Hospital indicates that the task was ... obviously urgent ... because the employee who usually did the work was not available.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4433338\" index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/109/543/#p555\">\n    109 Md.

In Ms. Calvo's case, there was no evidence of an emergency situation, much less evidence that the training was an urgent matter. The instant case stands in strong contrast to the\n   <em>\n    Reisinger-Siehler Co.\n   </em>\n   case, as well, because \"the employee rushed to a store at which he was employed after hearing a report of a possible break-in.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4433338\" index=\"336\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/109/543/#p555\">\n    109 Md.

In this way, Ms. Calvo's journey differs from the employees' journeys in both\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Reisinger-Siehler Co.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Calvo's journey, however, is on similar footing as the officer's journey in\n   <em>\n    Carberry.\n   </em>\n   The Superior Court of New Jersey in that case observed that the officer endured \"no such 'enhanced exposure to hazard\" on his journey and concluded that \"the inconvenience in making the trip to [the doctor's] office was not 'sufficiently substantial to be viewed as an integral part of the service itself.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"607956\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/279/114/\">\n    652 A.2d at 236-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Larson\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 16.11 at 4-204).\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-130\">\n   Although I agree with the intermediate appellate court that \"an emergency is not always needed for there to be a special mission[,]\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Dir. of Fin. for City of Baltimore v.

Thus, I depart from the Majority's wholesale exclusion of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   consideration of urgency in its analysis of the facts before us. The urgency factor, or lack thereof, is relevant and informs the analysis of an employee's journey as much as the other factors. It is undisputed that Ms. Calvo was given 10 days of advance notice of the date scheduled for training. Moreover, when Ms. Calvo was not able to attend the first training, she attended a training session held later that same year.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-131\">\n   As the Majority Opinion explains, and I agree, where \"the facts have been ascertained and agreed upon by the parties, or are undisputed and there is no dispute as to the inferences to be drawn from the facts, the question becomes one of law and may be decided by the Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Harrison v.
