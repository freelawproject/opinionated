Their sales contracts incorporated arbitration provisions which were enforced by motion in both cases. Because the record establishes the sales contracts, even if fully and mutually formed, were rescinded, and because plaintiffs' claims seem to mostly if not entirely relate to defendants' performance of the parties' agreements to rescind, which did not contain arbitration provisions, we reverse the orders dismissing these actions and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Soon after the filing of these two actions-\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v. Mall Chevrolet\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Goffe v. Foulke Management Corporation\n   </em>\n   -defendants moved to dismiss based on their contention that plaintiffs were contractually required to arbitrate the pleaded claims. The factual circumstances that we consider in reviewing the orders granting those motions appear in the complaints and the certifications filed in opposition to those motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the two cases present numerous similarities, we briefly discuss separately what occurred in each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In opposing the motion to dismiss in her case, Sasha Robinson recounted her dealings with Mall Chevrolet. She asserted that on Saturday, November 5, 2016, she telephoned Mall Chevrolet to inquire about a vehicle; she was then told that if she made a purchase she would have two days to return the vehicle if she changed her mind. Robinson visited the showroom later that day and decided to purchase a 2016 Malibu. In consideration, Robinson agreed to pay $25,620 at the rate of $546 per month; as further consideration, she conveyed to Mall Chevrolet a vehicle she allegedly jointly owned with her mother, Tijuana Johnson. Robinson was also told that Johnson would be required to co-sign in order to complete the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the same time, Robinson signed several documents for the purchase of the Malibu. One was a Motor Vehicle Retail Order Agreement (MVRO), which set forth the purchase price and information about the trade-in\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; the MVRO identified both Robinson\n   and Johnson as the purchasers and declared that the contract \"shall not become binding until accepted by dealer or his authorized representative.\" According to Robinson, the dealer's representative had not signed the contract documents by the time she left the showroom with the\n   new vehicle. The MVRO also contained Robinson's \"acknowledge[ment]\" that she\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   RECEIVED, READ, UNDERST[OO]D AND ... SIGNED THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH APPLIES TO THIS TRANSACTION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Robinson signed the MVRO directly below this language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The arbitration provision directed in bold print that Robinson\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   READ THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IT LIMITS CERTAIN OF YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The arbitration provision declared that both parties \"have an absolute right to demand that any dispute be submitted to an arbitrator in accordance with this agreement\" and that \"[i]f either ... file[d] a lawsuit, counterclaim, or other action in a court, the other party has the absolute right to demand arbitration following the filing of such action.\" The document also expressed that both parties\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   are giving up the right to continue a lawsuit, counterclaim, or other action in court, including the right to a jury trial, in the event the other party exercises the right to demand arbitration pursuant to this agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition, the document included a waiver of the right to trial by jury: \"You and we expressly waive all right to pursue any legal action to seek damages or any other remedies in a court of law, including the right to a jury trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   These provisions purported to encompass \"all claims and disputes\" between the parties and listed the covered disputes as including: any claims or disputes relating to the \"purchase of any goods or services\" from the seller; any \"negotiations\" between the parties; any claims relating to \"this transaction\"; all claims based on state and federal statutes, including CFA claims; \"any claim or dispute based on an allegation of fraud or misrepresentation, including fraud in the inducement of this or any other agreement\"; and any breach of contract claim. It asserted that claims \"arising\n   out of, in connection with, or relating to ... whether the claim or dispute must be arbitrated,\" and claims regarding \"the validity of this arbitration agreement,\" are to be submitted to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Robinson signed but, according to her opposing certification, she was not given a copy of these documents. She paid a $1000 security deposit by debit card, turned over the traded-in vehicle, and left with the new Malibu. She was advised to return with her mother so she too could sign the sales contract; that never occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Instead, on the following Monday, Robinson returned with Johnson and advised she was returning the Malibu because the cost was too exorbitant. Mall Chevrolet's representatives told Robinson she could not return the Malibu, that the representation about being able to rescind the deal within two days was a mistake, and that Robinson was bound by the documents she signed. Robinson claims Mall Chevrolet's representatives then attempted various coercive tactics to close the deal, including retaining the $1000 security deposit and the traded-in vehicle; they also offered to lower the monthly charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mall Chevrolet eventually agreed to return the trade-in but initially refused to return the deposit, relenting only after Robinson and Johnson filed this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Like Robinson, Goffe also opposed a defense motion to compel arbitration by recounting the events that inspired her lawsuit. On October 7, 2016, she arrived at Cherry Hill Mitsubishi in response to an\n   internet advertisement for a 2013 Buick Verano, listed for $15,800. She discussed the matter with a sales representative, defendant Antonio Salisbury, who advised that financing-calling for $390 monthly payments and a $1000 down payment-was approved. Goffe was instructed to make a $250 payment that day, with the remainder due fourteen days later. The transaction also required a trade in of Goffe's vehicle.\n   Goffe signed several documents, including an MVRO and arbitration provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The documents are identical to those signed by Robinson that we quoted above. Goffe signed the documents in the same places as Robinson, thereby signaling that she read and understood the documents and, also, that she actually received copies. Like Robinson, Goffe's opposing certification asserts that she was not given copies of any documents she signed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Goffe paid $250, canceled the insurance on her trade-in, and purchased insurance for the Buick. The dealership provided a temporary registration and Goffe drove the Buick off the lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Goffe returned to the dealership two weeks later with the remainder of the down payment. Salisbury then informed her that financing had not been approved and she could only retain the Buick if she agreed to make a $3000 down payment and commit to monthly payments of $400 instead of $390. Goffe refused and canceled the deal; the dealership returned the traded-in vehicle but did not immediately return Goffe's initial $250 down payment. She was only reimbursed after commencing this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In similar oral decisions citing little more than \"the policy in favor of arbitration,\" both motion judges determined the claims were arbitrable. They both entered orders of dismissal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs appeal and pose for our consideration essentially the same arguments: the sales contracts were contingent on events that never occurred and, therefore, should no longer bind the\n   parties; the sales contracts and their incorporated arbitration provisions are unconscionable and unenforceable because the process of extracting those agreements was barred by N.J.S.A. 56:8-2.22, which requires that copies of contracts be provided to consumers at the time of execution; and the orders should be reversed because of critical fact issues that should have been resolved in the manner suggested by\n   <em>\n    Guidotti v.

So, courts do not offend the federal policy favoring arbitration when applying state contract principles to determine whether interactions at the formative stage ripened into an enforceable contract or, if so, whether the parties later agreed to rescind their contract and, with it, its\n   incorporated arbitration provision.

Mall Chevrolet has consistently phrased both in the trial court and here-as if to concede their discussions with Robinson and the executed documents never ripened into a binding contract-that Robinson's disputes arise from her \"\n   <em>\n    attempt\n   </em>\n   [ ] to purchase a vehicle\" (emphasis added). In addition, although disputed, Robinson asserted that Mall Chevrolet required Johnson's participation as a co-signor-and it is undisputed that Johnson never signed. To be sure, Robinson gave Mall Chevrolet a cash deposit and her vehicle-which Robinson claims she jointly owned with her mother-and drove off with the Malibu, but the contract documents acknowledged that the act of taking possession of the new vehicle was \"subject to\" a number of terms, including approval of the financing aspects of the contract. If financing was not approved, the documents memorialized that Robinson retained the right to continue to possess the vehicle only if she paid the purchase price or obtained her own financing; absent that, Robinson was required to \"surrender the vehicle.\" In short, even if Johnson's involvement in the transaction was not necessary or material-as defendant contends but Robinson disputes-Robinson retained the right to rescind the contract if financing was not approved. Because there were factual disputes about the need for Johnson's signature and because the contract appears to have made enforceability of the sales contract conditioned upon financing approval or some other agreement about payment that never occurred, arbitration could not be compelled absent factual findings that would favor Mall Chevrolet on those questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   So, unless we're going to let the tail wag the dog, if the parties never reached an enforceable sales contract, they could not be said to have agreed to arbitrate any disputes arising from that incomplete contractual relationship.

That CFA provision makes it \"an unlawful practice\" for a party to a sales contract to request a consumer's signature on a document \"as evidence or acknowledgement of the sales transaction\" \"unless\" that party \"shall at the same time provide the consumer with a full and accurate copy of the document so presented for signature.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"409729\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/348/243/#p249\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Both Robinson and Goffe asserted in opposition to defendants' motions to compel arbitration that-despite what the contract documents actually state or purport to acknowledge-they were not given copies of the documents they signed.

To have an enforceable contract with an included enforceable arbitration provision, a seller-like defendants here-must provide to a consumer the contract documents they signed. Whether that did or didn't occur here is a question of disputed fact; those disputes in both cases must be resolved by the trial judges before arbitration may be enforced.

Here, we sense the possibility that plaintiffs may have pleaded causes of action that would include arbitrable claims if the preliminary factual questions we have recognized are resolved in defendants' favor-in that they arise from the sales contract or the negotiations leading to the formation of those sales contracts-as well as claims that are not arbitrable, such as claims relating to defendants' performance of the agreements to rescind, i.e., after agreeing to rescind they nevertheless withheld some part of the consideration plaintiffs originally provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The complaints filed by Robinson and Goffe are similar in that they both allege all the operative facts-from the time they made contact with defendants until they were refused or delayed in receiving the consideration they previously provided-and then they both set forth the same six causes of action,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   n.1, above, which each incorporate all the facts alleged at the outset. The trouble with that approach is that it inhibits the court's separation-if warranted-of claims that are arbitrable from those that are not. To the extent some of these claims are based on discussions or representations made during the contract-formation stage, they may very well be arbitrable. But, if there are claims included within plaintiffs' complaints that are based on defendants' conduct subsequent to the formation of the agreements to rescind, they are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Recently, in a similar circumstance, we recognized a trial court's authority to compel the filing of amended pleadings for the purpose of better ascertaining those claims that are arbitrable and those that are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    Greenbriar Oceanaire Cmty.

She signed nothing and had no dealings with Mall Chevrolet. Because she did not agree to arbitrate, the\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   judge erred in compelling her to arbitrate. Mall Chevrolet does not appear to argue to the contrary; indeed, in its merits brief, Mall Chevrolet expressed its \"agree[ment]\" that Johnson \"did not sign the contract documents and was not a party to the contract including the arbitration agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Mall Chevrolet argues, however, that-arbitrable or not-Johnson has no cognizable action, phrasing that contention in standing terms. Mall Chevrolet claims that the judge should have dismissed Johnson's claims on their merits. Although the judge dismissed the complaint, he did so only in the sense that the arbitration provision precluded Johnson's pursuit of her claims\n   in court; the judge did not express any view as to whether Johnson failed to assert a cognizable cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In considering this standing argument as it applies to Johnson's CFA claim,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   we start with an understanding that standing to sue under the CFA is viewed \"broadly in order to accomplish [the CFA's] remedial purpose, namely, to root out consumer fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Lemelledo\n   </em>\n   , 150 N.J. at 264,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"505156,505191\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/696/546/\">\n    696 A.2d 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, she asserts she was a co-owner of the vehicle Robinson traded in and that defendant's delay in returning that vehicle-once the parties agreed to rescind the sales contract-harmed her as well as Robinson. The value of that brief detention\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   has not been shown, but the offering of such evidence at this stage would be premature. In our view, when faced with an immediate motion to compel arbitration, Johnson could not have been expected to offer evidence of the loss incurred when Mall Chevrolet delayed returning the vehicle. We are satisfied that, at this stage, it was enough to avoid dismissal for Johnson to allege that Mall Chevrolet wrongfully delayed returning the vehicle once Robinson and Mall Chevrolet agreed to rescind the sales contract. Although the alleged delay\n   in returning the vehicle may not have had a great value, it was not nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The existing factual record casts serious doubt as to whether Johnson suffered any other ascertainable loss. She alludes to Mall Chevrolet's delay in returning the cash deposit, but that deposit was made by Robinson-as Johnson appears to concede by referring to it as \"my daughter's deposit.\" But we need not draw any firm conclusion on this point. At this stage, in resolving the issues raised in the cross-appeal-that Johnson lacked standing and that her complaint should have been dismissed on its merits-it is enough to say that she has alleged an ascertainable loss without our need to determine whether all claimed ascertainable losses are legally sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For these reasons, the order compelling Johnson to arbitrate her claims cannot stand and the argument raised in Mall Chevrolet's cross-appeal that there are other reasons to dismiss Johnson's complaint are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   VII\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In summary, we reverse the dismissal orders in both matters and remand for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   We also affirm the order denying Mall Chevrolet's motion to dismiss Johnson's complaint in the\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   matter on the other grounds asserted by Mall Chevrolet in its cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For the reasons we have expressed, the trial courts need to make certain factual determinations before they would be empowered to compel arbitration of any aspect of these actions. When the dust settles, and if the judges determine there are both arbitrable and non-arbitrable claims to be adjudicated, they should determine the order in which the arbitrable and nonarbitrable claims should proceed or whether they should proceed simultaneously.\n   <em>\n    Greenbriar Oceanaire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12300606\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/452/340/#p345\">\n    452 N.J.
