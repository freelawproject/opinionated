The plea judge's reliance on the theft consolidation statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:20-2(a), to accept defendant's\n   factual basis for a different form of theft was misplaced as that statute applies only in trial settings-not to plea proceedings.

Is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [Defendant:] Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Defense Counsel:] Okay.

You used the money for any other purposes other than what these folks had given you the money for. Is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [Defendant:] Some, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [Defense Counsel:] Okay.

In conclusion, the Court emphasized \"the adversary system cannot be permitted to deteriorate into a mere game in which defendant brazenly manifests his contempt for the system by openly admitting his guilt of an offense and then seeking exoneration on the basis of some arcane notion of pleading.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 394,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=466%20A.2d%2078\">\n    466 A.2d 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In addition to the analysis set forth in\n   <em>\n    Talley\n   </em>\n   , the commentary to the Model Penal Code illustrates instances where the consolidation statute is appropriate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Examples come readily to mind where an unwary prosecutor might stumble in distinguishing larceny, false pretenses, extortion, and embezzlement. An offender who is prosecuted for fraud might escape by proving that the victim did not believe the representations made to him but was merely frightened by them. Similarly, one who gives a bad check as a down payment on an automobile which is thereupon delivered to him on conditional sale may defeat criminal prosecution for obtaining by false pretenses by arguing that the vendor reserved title and that the vendee\n   could therefore\n   only be guilty of larceny, the offense against possession. The intricacies of distinguishing between stealing and receiving stolen goods and of the proper procedure for presenting these alternative views of the defendant's involvement may also lead to needless reversals of convictions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Model Penal Code\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 223.1 cmt. 2(b) at 134 (Am.

The mention of \"the proper procedure for presenting these alternative views of the defendant's involvement\" references trial procedures and has no application in a plea setting,\n   <em>\n    ibid\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ; so too, a defendant can \"openly admit[ ] his guilt of an offense and then seek[ ] exoneration on the basis of some arcane notion of pleading\" only at a trial.\n   <em>\n    Talley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1347568\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/94/385/#p390\">\n    94 N.J. at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=466%20A.2d%2078\">\n    466 A.2d 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . During a plea, a defendant should not be permitted to manipulate the process by admitting one type of theft of which he is not accused and then defending against another type with which he is charged-the very danger N.J.S.A. 2C:20-2(a) was designed to guard against. That risk is present only in the \"adversary system\"-trials-of which the\n   <em>\n    Talley\n   </em>\n   Court spoke.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1347568\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/94/385/#p390\">\n    94 N.J. at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=466%20A.2d%2078\">\n    466 A.2d 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
