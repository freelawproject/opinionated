Robinson appeals from an order dismissing two PCRA petitions as untimely. Appellant alleges that he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing with respect to the petition filed June 19, 2015, since the PCRA court analyzed the underlying merits of his substantive claim. While we agree that the PCRA court erred, we affirm\n   on the basis that Appellant failed to establish due diligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We previously set forth the facts underlying Appellant's conviction in our order denying his third petition for PCRA relief, which we repeat herein.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 25, 1982, Appellant and a cohort were in the process of breaking into a car for the purpose of stealing it when they were confronted by the car's owner, the victim. Appellant shot the victim four times and escaped with his cohort in another stolen vehicle; the victim died. Approximately one week later, Appellant was questioned about the crime, and he ultimately was charged with murder, robbery, criminal conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime. On July 1, 1983, Appellant pled guilty to second degree murder and criminal conspiracy. He received a life sentence for the murder conviction and a concurrent sentence of ten-to-twenty years confinement for conspiracy. Appellant asserted on direct appeal that his trial counsel was ineffective and that his guilty plea was involuntary. We affirmed the judgment of sentence on March 1, 1985.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

While that petition was pending, Appellant filed another petition, docketed June 19, 2015. The petition contained numerous allegations concerning drug use by his plea counsel, Richard Michaelson, Esquire. The petition alleged that \"At the time of trial/guilty plea ... my counsel suffered from the effects of cocaine abuse. He was ingesting, [c]ocaine, and because of counsel's [c]ocaine addiction, 'his mind was befog[ged], disordered by paranoid thoughts and the belief that he was in control when he was not.' \"\n   <em>\n    Pro se\n   </em>\n   PCRA petition, 6/19/15, at 4. The petition alleged that this drug use \"impaired his ability to represent [me] in a Constitutionally sufficient manner.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The petition included sworn affidavits prepared by Appellant and Bruce Quarles, a fellow prisoner, which related the following. Mr. Quarles overheard Appellant complaining about trial counsel. Mr. Quarles informed Appellant that he knew of trial counsel and supplied documentation regarding Attorney Michaelson's purchase of cocaine in the Caribbean Islands during May of 1982, around the time of Appellant's plea. Additionally, Mr. Quarles stated that he knew Attorney Michaelson had been convicted of drug offenses in federal court, and told Appellant \"he would bring the transcripts and newspaper articles to the law library and I could make photo copies of the newspaper articles and the transcripts. This is how I obtained the after [d]iscovered [e]vidence on April 28, 2015.\"\n   <em>\n    Pro se\n   </em>\n   PCRA petition, 6/19/15, at 4-A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appended to the petition were three additional exhibits: a newspaper article dated May 29, 1982, stating that Attorney Michaelson was fired from his job as an Assistant District Attorney in Philadelphia due to an FBI informant alleging Attorney\n   Michaelson had purchased cocaine; a transcript of trial counsel's plea to possession of drugs in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on April 29, 1994; and, a newspaper story reporting the 1994 conviction. The plea transcript indicates that in 1991 through June 1992, Attorney Michaelson regularly purchased cocaine from a dealer. During the plea hearing, Attorney Michaelson stated that he had been using cocaine since approximately 1979. According to Appellant, his receipt of this statement marked the first time he was aware that trial counsel was using cocaine at a time period relevant to his case, prompting him to file the untimely PCRA petition at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The PCRA court dismissed the petition on the basis it was untimely, and explained its ruling in its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [Appellant]'s claim does not constitute after-discovered evidence, and his argument is not convincing. Trial counsel represented [Appellant] in 1983. Counsel pled guilty to drug trafficking offenses that occurred between 1991 and 1992. [Appellant] cannot reasonably claim that trial counsel's subsequent legal problems impacted his decision to plead guilty a decade earlier. Aside from allegations contained in an article, [Appellant] has not provided any evidence to suggest that counsel's representation as it related to [Appellant]'s specific case was improper. [Appellant] has failed to demonstrate that any of the exceptions to the limitations of the PCRA apply to his case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   PCRA Court Opinion, 11/16/15, at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, a panel of this Court unanimously determined that Appellant was not entitled to relief on his petition seeking to raise a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Miller\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   claim. The panel split with respect to the other petition. The majority determined that the PCRA court improperly considered the merits of Appellant's underlying claim in dismissing the PCRA petition, and, as a result, held that a remand for an evidentiary hearing was required to determine whether Appellant properly pled the \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(ii) exception. The dissent, written by this author, agreed that the PCRA court applied the wrong inquiry by assessing the merits of the claim in determining the timeliness of the petition, but would have affirmed on the alternative basis that Appellant failed to establish his due diligence. Additionally, the dissenting memorandum opined that the petition did not set forth any facts that could ever entitle him to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Commonwealth filed for reargument, asserting that a remand would result in a needless expenditure of time and expense in this and similar cases. We granted\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   review and appointed counsel to represent Appellant's interests. The parties submitted substituted briefs and the matter is ready for our review. Appellant raises the following issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Should the PCRA court have held an evidentiary hearing on Appellant's claim regarding trial counsel's drug offenses for purposes of determining whether Appellant met the timeliness exception for newly discovered facts?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Appellant's brief at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Our standard of review examines \"whether the PCRA court's determination is supported by the evidence of record and free of legal error.

These exceptions are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (i) the failure to raise the claim previously was the result of interference by government officials with the presentation of the claim in violation of the Constitution or laws of this Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (ii) the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (iii) the right asserted is a constitutional right that was recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States or the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania after the time period provided in this section and has been held by that court to apply retroactively.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, any petition seeking to invoke one of these three exceptions \"shall be filed within 60 days of the date the claim could have been presented.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The instant petition was filed on June 19, 2015, over thirty years after Appellant's judgment of sentence became final and therefore patently untimely under the PCRA. Appellant avers that he satisfied the exception set forth at \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(ii) because he first became aware of trial counsel's 1994 plea on October 20, 2014, and thereafter immediately sought to obtain the transcripts from federal court. He alleges that he received those materials on April 28, 2015, giving him sixty days to file for relief pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(2). Since the June 19, 2015 petition was within sixty days of when he received the plea transcript, Appellant avers that the petition is timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   There are two additional points germane to our review. Our Supreme Court has made plain that the analysis of whether a PCRA petitioner has satisfied the \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(ii) time-bar exception is analytically distinct from the merits of any substantive claim seeking relief. As stated in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

[T]he plain language of subsection (b)(1)(ii) does not require the petitioner to allege and prove a claim of \"after-discovered evidence.\" Rather, it simply requires petitioner to allege and prove that there were \"facts\" that were \"unknown\" to him and that he exercised \"due diligence.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3250218,8353109,8353173,3250807\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/930/1264/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3250218,8353109,8353173,3250807\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/930/1264/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3250218,8353109,8353173,3250807\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/930/1264/\">\n    at 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   With respect to the exercise of due diligence, Appellant's own petition acknowledges that newspaper coverage from 1982 mentioned counsel's drug use. Therefore, a\n   question naturally arises as to whether he acted with due diligence in ascertaining the newly-discovered facts of the 1994 plea as relied upon by Appellant. In response, Appellant relies on\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Burton\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278381\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/638/687/\">\n    638 Pa. 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278374,12324648,12278377,12324683,12278381,12324668\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/158/618/\">\n    158 A.3d 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), issued after our original panel decision.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Burton\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   held that, for purposes of \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(ii)'s requirement that the facts be unknown, materials in the public record are not presumptively known to an incarcerated\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petitioner. Appellant also emphasizes that any available facts speaking to counsel's drug usage in general is irrelevant, as the proper question is \"when did Appellant learn that Mr. Michaelson [was] using cocaine at a time period\n   <strong>\n    relevant to Appellant's case\n   </strong>\n   [?]\" Appellant's brief at 14 (emphasis in original). Appellant argues that his failure to discover the 1994 plea transcript does not preclude a finding of due diligence in light of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Burton\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , as he first learned of the plea from Mr. Quarles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Taken together, Appellant maintains the following. First, pursuant to\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the PCRA court erred by considering the merits of the underlying substantive claim,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   by determining counsel's subsequent drug problems could not be used to attack his plea a decade earlier. Next, under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Burton\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , he cannot be deemed presumptively aware of Attorney Michaelson's plea to federal charges, which became a matter of public record sometime in 1994.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant contends that the PCRA court's error requires an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of establishing the applicability of the newly-discovered fact exception to the PCRA's time bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As previously quoted, the PCRA court determined that Appellant's claim \"does not constitute after-discovered evidence, and his argument is not convincing.\" PCRA Court Opinion, 11/18/15, at 4. The Commonwealth agrees with Appellant's conclusion that the PCRA court conducted a merits analysis of the underlying claim, which is improper under prevailing law. We likewise agree, but find that the PCRA court correctly dismissed the petition because Appellant failed to establish his due diligence. We affirm on this alternative ground.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Cox\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280382\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/636/603/\">\n    636 Pa. 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6768280,12280382\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/146/221/\">\n    146 A.3d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 229-30 (2016) (while PCRA court erred in applying newly-discovered fact inquiry, order affirmed as Cox failed to act with due diligence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   At this juncture, we briefly address the distinction between a PCRA petition and the claims contained within a jurisdictionally proper petition. Our analysis begins there because the connection between the facts discovered by Appellant regarding counsel's drug use and the underlying claim is, as we shall explain, relevant to the due diligence inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , our Supreme Court stated that the subsection (b)(1)(ii) exception merely requires the PCRA petitioner \"to allege and prove that there were 'facts' that were 'unknown' to him and that he exercised 'due diligence.' \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1270. The fact at issue in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Benne\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     t\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     t\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   was PCRA counsel's failure to file a brief on appeal from an order denying a timely PCRA petition. Bennett then filed an untimely PCRA petition seeking reinstatement of his PCRA appellate rights, invoking \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(ii).\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   determined that \"[Bennett]'s allegations bring his claim within the ambit of subsection (b)(1)(ii) ... he must also prove that the facts were 'unknown' to him and that he could not uncover them with the exercise of 'due diligence.' \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1274. The Court noted that prior precedents frequently, but mistakenly, described\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(ii) as the after-discovered evidence exception to the one-year time bar, even though \"the plain language of subsection (b)(1)(ii) does not require the petitioner to allege and prove a claim of 'after-discovered evidence.' \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1270 (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The tendency to erroneously label \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(ii) as the after-discovered evidence exception is largely explained by the fact that PCRA petitioners presenting newly-discovered facts as justification for an untimely PCRA often, but not always, seek to raise a claim that those facts constitute evidence that would have changed the outcome at trial. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(2)(vi) (\"The unavailability at the time of trial of exculpatory evidence that has subsequently become available and would have changed the outcome of the trial if it had been introduced.\"). As our Supreme Court explained in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Cox\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , that labeling error\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   is not novel, especially in the context of cases in which the petitioner invokes both of these provisions in his or her quest for relief. This is not always the case, as the section 9545(b)(1)(ii) timeliness exception is not only invoked in connection with claims of after-discovered evidence as contemplated by section 9543(a)(2)(vi) ;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , claims based on exculpatory evidence that would result in a different verdict. For instance, petitioners have utilized the section 9545(b)(1)(ii) timeliness exception in an attempt to raise claims of the constructive denial of counsel, violations of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Batson v.

Because PCRA counsel for Appellant alleged during the first PCRA proceeding that trial counsel had a substance abuse problem and had been suspended from practicing law, there was some basis upon which to suspect that further investigation of trial counsel may have uncovered relevant information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5654690,8430602,8430557,5653127\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/895/520/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5654690,8430602,8430557,5653127\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/895/520/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5654690,8430602,8430557,5653127\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/895/520/\">\n    at 524-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Baer, J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   That analysis applies to the instant case.

Arguably, it is consistent with that principle to simply accept that the newly-discovered facts are true in order to winnow out claims that could not possibly lead to relief. The admonishment against a merits analysis of the underlying claim seems designed to prevent a preemptive finding that the newly-discovered facts are either not worthy of belief or would not, on balance, undermine the reliability of the verdict even if true. On the other hand, accepting these newly-discovered facts as true gives every benefit of the doubt to the petitioner. Nevertheless, our Supreme Court has not sanctioned this approach to an analysis of the newly-discovered facts, and we therefore decide this case on the basis of due diligence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
