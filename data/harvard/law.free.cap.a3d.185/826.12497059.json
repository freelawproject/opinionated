His injury required surgery, and he was unable to work for approximately two months. At the time of the injury, Mr. Stine was a university student studying nursing and had approximately two years left before he would earn his degree. He was also a part-time EMT for a private ambulance company, Lifestar, during the school year (when the injury occurred) and worked full-time during the summer. He filed a claim with the Maryland Workers' Compensation Commission (\"Commission\") for lost wages. The Commission held a hearing and found that Mr. Stine's average weekly wage is $64.65, the average of the wages he earned in the fourteen weeks preceding his injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mr. Stine appealed the Commission's determination of his average weekly wage to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and requested a jury trial. On the day of trial, the court granted the County's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to exclude the testimony of Mr. Stine's vocational expert and the County's\n   motion to strike the jury, then remanded the case to the Commission. We affirm the circuit court's decision to exclude the testimony of the vocational expert but reverse its decision to grant the County's motion to strike the jury and remand the case to the circuit court for additional proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Stine's injury occurred on March 26, 2016, and the hearing before the Commission took place on July 27, 2016. Mr. Stine testified, and both counsel presented arguments. Mr. Stine's counsel confirmed that the only issue before the Commission was the amount of Mr. Stine's average weekly wage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   There was very little in dispute factually. The parties agreed that the amount ultimately ordered by the Commission,\n   $64.65, reflected the average amount Mr. Stine had earned from his job at Lifestar during the fourteen weeks preceding his injury, when he had been working part-time during the school year. In addition to the paystubs for the fourteen weeks preceding the accident, Mr. Stine had submitted three additional paystubs for full-time work during the summer of 2015. He also testified as to his hourly wage, and several raises he had received, since the time of the accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Mr. Stine did not argue that his summer earnings should factor into the calculation of his average weekly wage, the Commission inquired about them during the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Stine argued primarily that MD. CODE ANN. , Labor &amp; Empl. (\"LE\") \u00a7 9-602(a)(3) gave the Commission discretion to set Mr. Stine's average weekly wage higher than $64.65, the fourteen-week average.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The County argued that\n   LE \u00a7 9-602(a) does not apply to his situation, and that LE \u00a7 9-602(g) applies instead. The Commission apparently adopted the fourteen-week average-it issued an order stating, without explanation, that \"the claimant's average weekly wage is $64.65.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Stine filed a petition for judicial review in the circuit court and prayed a jury trial. In the meantime, Mr. Stine retained a vocational expert to support his argument that under LE \u00a7 9-602(a)(3), his average weekly wage should be based on what he likely would earn after finishing nursing school, working full-time as an EMT or nurse. Before trial, the County made an oral motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to strike the testimony of Mr. Stine's vocational expert on the ground that LE \u00a7 9-602(a)(3) does not apply. The County also orally moved to strike the jury demand on the ground that the appropriate method for determining the average weekly wage is a legal question, and is therefore not suitable for jury review. Mr. Stine responded that LE \u00a7 9-602(a)(3) does apply and that his expert's testimony was admissible. And he argued as well that the average of his wages over the fifty-two weeks preceding his injury should have been used to calculate his average weekly wage, not just the fourteen weeks, and that that question should be submitted to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court granted both of the County's motions. The court ruled that LE \u00a7 9-602(a)(3) did not apply, that \u00a7 9-602(g) applied instead, and that the vocational expert's testimony would be irrelevant. The court went on to find that Code of Maryland Regulations (\"COMAR\") 14.09.03.06 required the Commission to compute the average weekly wage from Mr. Stine's average wage over the fourteen-week period preceding the injury, leaving no issue of fact for the jury to decide. In the alternative, the circuit court held that even if COMAR 14.09.03.06 did not compel the Commission to use the fourteen-week average, it nevertheless fell within the Commission's\n   discretion to decline to consider Mr. Stine's average wages over a fifty-two-week period. The court entered an order affirming the Commission's order and remanding the case to the\n   Commission. We supply additional facts as necessary below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, Mr. Stine raises two questions that we have rephrased:\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   , whether the circuit court erred in granting the County's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to exclude testimony from Mr. Stine's vocational expert; and\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   , whether the circuit court erred in granting the County's motion to strike the jury and affirming the Commission's order setting Mr. Stine's average weekly wage at $64.65, the average of his wages over the fourteen weeks preceding the injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before delving into the\n   specifics of the parties' arguments, though, we outline the procedural path that appeals take in workers' compensation cases, as well as the standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Judicial review of the Commission's decisions in the circuit court is governed by LE \u00a7 9-745, which, unlike most other judicial review of administrative agency decisions, authorizes essentially a do-over of the agency decision and an opportunity for a jury trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (c) The court shall determine whether the Commission:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (2) exceeded the powers granted to it under this title; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (3) misconstrued the law and facts applicable in the case decided.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (d) On a motion of any party filed with the clerk of the court in accordance with the practice in civil cases, the court shall submit to a jury any question of fact involved in the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (e)(1) If the court determines that the Commission acted within its powers and correctly construed the law and facts, the court shall confirm the decision of the Commission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (2) If the court determines that the Commission did not act within its powers or did not correctly construe the law and facts, the court shall reverse or modify the decision or remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   An appeal from the Commission to the circuit court \"may follow two alternative modalities.\"\n   <em>\n    Simmons v.

The first, subsection (a), addresses computation of average weekly wage \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided\" in the remainder of LE \u00a7 9-602.

LE \u00a7 9-602(d), (h), and (k). Mr. Stine is a volunteer EMT. The County argues that LE \u00a7 9-602(a) does not apply at all because \u00a7 9-602 has a subsection that specifically applies to volunteer EMT's, namely subsection (g). Mr. Stine does not dispute that LE \u00a7 9-602(g) applies, but argues that his average weekly wage nevertheless should be calculated under LE \u00a7 9-602(a)(3), which, he asserts, would allow for a finding of a higher average weekly wage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We begin with (a), the general computation subsection, and work our way through it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (a) (1)\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Except as otherwise provided in this section, the average weekly wage of a covered employee shall be computed\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   by determining the average of the weekly wages of the covered employee:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (i) when the covered employee is working full time; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (ii) at the time of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   1. the accidental personal injury ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (3) If a covered employee establishes that, because of the age and experience of the covered employee at the time of the accidental personal injury or last injurious exposure to the hazards of the occupational disease, the wages of the covered employee could be expected to increase under normal circumstances, the expected increase may be taken into account when computing the average weekly wage of the covered employee under paragraph (1) of this subsection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   LE \u00a7 9-602(a) (emphasis added).

As noted above, the parties do not dispute that Mr. Stine is \"an individual who is a covered employee under LE \u00a7 9-234\" by virtue of his status as a volunteer EMT.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Subsection (g), along with every other subsection in LE \u00a7 9-602, does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   contain any language referring back to the computation method or principles outlined in (a). Moreover, all of the other subsections of \u00a7 9-602, including (g), contain the phrase \"the wages of the covered employee shall be,\" and all of them, save one, contain the language \"for the purpose of\n   computing the average weekly wage.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The presence of those phrases reinforces that the average weekly wage calculation for employees\n   covered by other subsections does not point the Commission back to subsection (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   It follows, then, that the circuit court did not err in excluding testimony from Mr. Stine's vocational expert. Mr. Stine offered the expert to testify about the increases in salary he might have expected over time, testimony that might have been relevant to the subsection (a)(3) analysis (increases he might expect given his age and experience), but wasn't relevant to the subsection (g) question (wages he lost from his other employment). In so holding, we do not intend to foreclose the possibility that it may be appropriate in some instances for the Commission, in its\n   <em>\n    discretion\n   </em>\n   , to follow the general principles of subsection (a) in calculating the respective amounts under the other subsections of LE \u00a7 9-602, even if, as a matter of strict statutory interpretation, it is not\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to apply them. For example, it is doubtful that in computing average weekly wage under subsection (g), the Commission would stray from subsection (a)'s requirement that it is the wage\n   <em>\n    at the time of the injury\n   </em>\n   that should be used, or that tips should be included computing in the wages for volunteer EMTs or firefighters who happen to earn a living on the side as restaurant servers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LE \u00a7 9-602(a)(2)(i). On these facts, though, the circuit court followed the correct statutory path and did not abuse its discretion in excluding Mr. Stine's proffered expert testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Circuit Court Erred In Granting The County's Motion To Strike The Jury.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Stine argues that the circuit court erred in not allowing his case to proceed to a jury trial for a fresh\n   determination of his average weekly wage. The circuit court granted the County's motion to strike the jury because, as the court read it, COMAR 14.09.03.06\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   the average weekly wage to be computed from the average of the covered employee's wages during the fourteen-week period preceding his injury. In the alternative, the circuit court determined that even if COMAR 14.09.03.06 did not impose such a requirement, there was no issue of fact for the jury to decide because the Commission had the discretion not to use the average of Mr. Stine's wages over a fifty-two-week period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The circuit court erred in two respects.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , we disagree that COMAR 14.09.03.06 compelled the Commission to calculate the average weekly wage from a fourteen-week sample. As we recently clarified in\n   <em>\n    Wagstaff\n   </em>\n   (which was decided after the circuit court's decision), that regulation \"does not purport to restrict the Commission in any manner from utilizing a different time period [than fourteen weeks] if the Commission deems it appropriate to do so.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12493367\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/180/211/#p13\">\n    236 Md.

And indeed, the regulation contains nothing requiring the fourteen-week time period in all cases. The only reference to a fourteen-week period appears in COMAR 14.09.03.06(B), which requires the employer or its insurer to file a wage statement as part of the initial proceedings\n   before the Commission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   That statement must\n   include the \"average wage earned by the claimant during the 14 weeks before the accident,\" COMAR 14.09.03.06(B), and it appears that in practice, the Commission generally makes its initial determination of average weekly wage based on the average wages earned during that timeframe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 CLIFFORD B. SOBIN, MARYLAND WORKERS' COMPENSATION \u00a7 11:2 at 279 (2017); THEODORE B. CORNBLATT, WORKERS' COMPENSATION MANUAL at Chapter 1, section VII.B., 18\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   ed. (The Maryland State Bar Assoc., Inc., 2017). But the regulation does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   restrict the determination of average weekly wage to that time period, and allows the Commission to consider other evidence in setting the average weekly wage at a hearing, if one is held.

Again, judicial review in workers' compensation cases is unusual because the parties have two options: an unadorned administrative appeal or an essential trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    S.B.

In his petition for judicial review, Mr. Stine opted for an essential trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , and the exclusion of his expert's testimony under LE \u00a7 9-602(a)(3) did not terminate his right to have a jury decide the factual question of his average weekly wage under LE \u00a7 9-602(g). The circuit court phrased its ruling as if it were deciding a summary judgment motion or a motion for judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   So, under any theory, whether it's a trial or a summary judgment my ruling would be the same that is the Commission acted properly, legally, not arbitrarily, not capriciously, and there was no abuse of discretion, even if they had that discretion, but it was a well-argued case, and it's an interesting area of the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   But there was no motion for summary judgment or motion for judgment before the circuit court at the time of this ruling. Mr. Stine had filed his petition for judicial review, then a request for a jury trial, which transformed the procedural posture of the case to an essential trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , which means that the Commission's decision was not subject to review by the circuit court.
