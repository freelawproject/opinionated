He also argues that the judge failed to apply proper summary judgment standards in considering his LAD claim by failing to view the motion evidence in a light most favorable to plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   4:46-2(c). Neither argument is persuasive. We affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Contrary to plaintiff's assertion, the facts are essentially undisputed. Plaintiff, a fifty-nine-year-old African-American male, was wearing a striped collared shirt, black jacket, and grey baseball cap when he entered defendant's Union Township branch to make a withdrawal. Surveillance video shows a second African-American man, wearing white coveralls and a hardhat, entered the bank, stood near plaintiff, who thought the man was also completing a withdrawal slip, and approached the teller immediately ahead of plaintiff. This man handed the teller a slip, at which point the teller handed the man a stack of bills, and the man walked out of the bank. Plaintiff advanced to the counter; however, unbeknownst\n   to him, the other man had handed the teller a note saying, \"[b]ig bills please this is a hold up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While plaintiff was standing before the teller, another bank employee exited the break room, saw the note and discerned that it said something \"in reference to a robbery.\" She walked back to her desk and called 9-1-1. Under the misimpression that plaintiff was the robber, she told police the robber, an African-American man, was still in the bank. While she was on the phone with the operator, two employees locked the bank's doors. Meanwhile, in this commotion, plaintiff took a seat in the bank's lobby area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Critical to plaintiff's common law negligence claim was the employee's admitted departure from defendant's policy regarding procedures to be followed in the event of a robbery. The employee handbook provided: \"FOLLOWING A ROBBERY only AFTER the Robber has left ... Call Police to Report Robbery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Within four minutes of the 9-1-1 call, police arrived and defendant's employees unlocked the doors. Although plaintiff testified at deposition that police had \"their guns pointed towards\" him when they were \"outside,\" the video shows their guns\n   were not drawn when they entered the bank. Police asked defendant which way the robber went and plaintiff responded, \"[h]e went that way,\" pointing with his left arm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Union Township Police Officer, Teon Freeman, testified at deposition that he never arrested plaintiff, but interviewed him as a witness. Plaintiff remained calm during the interview and provided information about the suspect, leading Freeman to believe plaintiff \"knew he wasn't under arrest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff left the bank and returned home approximately ninety minutes after the incident. He recalled during his deposition testimony being \"pretty upset about the situation\" and \"kind of emotional.\" In February 2015, six months after the robbery, plaintiff sought counseling from Patricia Delgado, a social worker, because he was experiencing \"emotional distress,\" \"fear[ ] of police\" and inhibited sleep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff attended three counseling sessions with Delgado between February 2015 and April 2015. Delgado testified her \"diagnosis within a reasonable degree of social worker probability\" was that plaintiff suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although conceding she was not an expert in PTSD, Delgado opined that plaintiff's condition was related to the robbery at TD Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At oral argument before the motion judge and before us, plaintiff submits defendant breached its duty to provide a reasonably safe environment for its customers, including protection against foreseeable criminal activity on and around the business' premises. Plaintiff argues the risk of criminal activity from a third party was foreseeable, noting defendant's policy specifically outlined the procedure to follow during a robbery. As we understand the argument, plaintiff contends defendant breached its duty because it failed to properly train its employees not to call 9-1-1 until the robber left the bank. According to plaintiff, the information provided in the 9-1-1 call led police to treat him as the \"perpetrator\" and point their weapons at him, resulting in plaintiff's claimed PTSD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We \"review[ ] de novo the ... entry of summary judgment[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Manahawkin Convalescent v.
