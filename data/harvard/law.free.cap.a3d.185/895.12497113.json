We now reverse and remand. We also suggest the assignment judge of Middlesex County, to whom the matter had been transferred for decision, consider appointing a special master, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:41-1, to make findings and recommendations before rendering a decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case has an unusual procedural history. It commenced in 2011, when a Warren County public defender objected to conducting a criminal trial in newly renovated Courtroom No. 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   His objection was overruled, and the matter proceeded to conclusion. On February 6, 2012, a second case was scheduled to be heard in the courtroom, and this time, the trial judge granted the motion to move the trial elsewhere. That judge described in detail problems with the design, including obstructions to a defendant's view of the witness stand and the jury box. The judge determined that the courtroom was constitutionally inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 9, 2012, the Warren County Prosecutor's Office (prosecutor's office) filed a motion before the Warren County assignment judge, seeking to vacate the trial judge's order barring the use of Courtroom No. 2. Meanwhile, a third application was made to stay a criminal trial in that courtroom. The Warren County\n   assignment judge consolidated the matters and transferred them for hearing before the assignment judge of Middlesex County. The prosecutor's office then filed a verified complaint and order to show cause in that vicinage. The OPD removed the matter to federal court; it was remanded back to state court on June 20, 2012. The case, captioned \"In re Vicinage 13,\" thereafter languished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the interim, Warren County filed separate litigation concerning the courtroom, which was settled with the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) on September 23, 2015. After the parties agreed to certain renovations, the action was dismissed. In March 2016, Warren County moved for declaratory judgment\n   pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA), N.J.S.A. 2A:16-50 to -62. The matter bore the docket number of the prior-by then inactive-proceeding. It was the outcome of the DJA application that resulted in the order now appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Turning to that decision, the assignment judge to whom the matter had been transferred ruled that the OPD lacked standing to participate. Acknowledging New Jersey's expansive view of the doctrine, the judge nonetheless reached this conclusion because the OPD did not represent a specific individual whose trial was currently scheduled in the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Additionally, the court reasoned that even if the OPD had standing, the modifications agreed to in 2015 in the Vicinage 13 action between Warren County and the AOC corrected the six courtroom defects identified by the trial judge in 2012. The assignment judge based his determination in part on the representations of an architect the judge had designated for that purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A certification from an OPD attorney, however, stated that not only were the constitutional issues with the courtroom unresolved, the settlement agreement called for modifications that were not completed. The attorney alleged that the alterations to the courtroom made it more cosmetically functional but failed to: correct line of sight issues, provide the space necessary for a criminal trial, and increase the available seats in the courtroom-meaning that, overall, the space was inadequate for jury selection as well as for public attendance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The OPD raises the following points for our consideration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   POINT I\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE PUBLIC DEFENDER HAS STANDING [ ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   POINT II\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT'S GRANT OF A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT WAS [NOT] APPROPRIATE [ ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   POINT III\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   RES JUDICATA BARRED THE ISSUANCE OF A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT [ ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   POINT IV\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   TRIAL COURT INAPPROPRIATELY TOOK JUDICIAL NOTICE OF FACTS IN DISPUTE WITHOUT FOLLOWING RULE 201'S REQUIREMENTS [ ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   POINT V\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING RELIEF AS A MATTER OF LAW, ESPECIALLY ON A DISPUTED RECORD [ ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   POINT VI\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   COURTROOM TWO, AS DESIGNED, IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE LAWS AND APPEARS TO VIOLATE THE AMERICAN[S] WITH DISABILITIES ACT [ ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We discuss only the issues of standing and whether the matter is justiciable under\n   the DJA. The remaining points on appeal either do not warrant discussion in a written opinion,\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   2:11-3(e)(1)(E), or are made moot by our decision to remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We conclude that the OPD has standing and should have been afforded the opportunity to participate in the declaratory judgment action. \"The issue of standing is a matter of law as to which [this Court] exercise[s] de novo review.\"\n   <em>\n    People For Open Gov't v.

Setting that undisputed circumstance aside, however, it was the OPD that initiated the proceedings years before. The subject matter of the litigation implicates the interests of the indigent criminal defendants the OPD is mandated to represent in that county, and such cases will be assigned to that courtroom. Thus, issues \"of substantial justice and sound judicial administration\" cannot be conclusively addressed without the OPD's participation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salorio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1362556\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/82/482/#p490\">\n    82 N.J. at 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=414%20A.2d%20943\">\n    414 A.2d 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The federal court remanded the case to the state court in part because the OPD lacked standing to remove a matter in which it was not a named defendant. The analysis, however, is different and distinct-standing for removal purposes-from the question of whether the OPD has standing at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The State agrees with the OPD on this issue. So does Warren County, with the caveat that the OPD's interest extends only to per se violations of the Sixth\n   Amendment, not to the other concerns the OPD raised before the assignment judge and by way\n   of appeal. Even if that argument were correct, the OPD has a right, if not an obligation, to participate in the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In a different context we have said a litigant must \"raise the constitutional rights of a third party when the third party's rights are likely to be diluted or adversely affected unless they are raised by a plaintiff holding a confidential relationship with the third party.\"\n   <em>\n    Stubaus v.
