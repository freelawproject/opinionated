On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court (1) abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal from the denial of his amended petition, (2) improperly concluded that he failed to establish that his appellate counsel in his direct criminal appeal rendered deficient performance, and (3) improperly concluded that his stand-alone due process claim was procedurally defaulted. We conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying the\n   petition for certification to appeal and, accordingly, dismiss the petitioner's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of the petitioner's appeal. In connection with the murder of the victim, Nathaniel Morris, the state charged the petitioner with capital felony in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b (5) ; felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c ; murder as an accessory in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a (a) and 53a-8 (a) ; conspiracy to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-54a (a) ; kidnapping in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-94 (a) ; conspiracy to commit kidnapping in the second degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-94 (a) ; and commission of a Class A, B or C felony with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A five day jury trial began on October 14, 1997. At the close of the state's evidence, the petitioner's trial counsel, Kevin Randolph, moved for a judgment of acquittal with respect to the charges of capital felony murder, felony murder, murder, conspiracy to commit murder and conspiracy to commit kidnapping in the second degree on the basis of insufficient evidence. The court granted the petitioner's motion only as to the capital felony murder\n   charge. The petitioner was subsequently convicted on all remaining charges and sentenced to a total effective term of fifty-five years incarceration, execution suspended after fifty years, followed by five years of probation.

On June 7, 2016, the petitioner, represented by appointed counsel, filed the amended three count operative petition. The petitioner alleged: (1) the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel; (2) the ineffective assistance of his appellate counsel in his direct criminal appeal, on the basis of her failure to raise claims of instructional error and insufficient evidence to sustain his convictions of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and felony murder; and (3) a violation of his due process rights at his underlying criminal trial on the basis of the aforementioned instructional impropriety. On July 12, 2016, the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, moved to dismiss the petitioner's amended petition in its entirety. On July 21, 2016, the petitioner filed an objection to the respondent's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The habeas trial was held on July 25, 2016. The habeas court granted the respondent's motion to dismiss with respect to the petitioner's claim against his trial counsel. The habeas court heard testimony from Randolph, Zitser, and Assistant State's Attorney C. Robert Satti, Jr., the prosecutor in the petitioner's criminal trial. The\n   petitioner also presented expert testimony from Attorney Norman A. Pattis, an expert in criminal defense matters in state court, and Attorney Michael Taylor, an expert in appellate law, both of whom rendered opinions as to the effectiveness of Zitser. On October 11, 2016, the habeas court issued a written decision denying the petitioner's amended petition. The habeas court concluded that the petitioner failed to establish that Zitser had rendered deficient performance and that the petitioner's due process claim was procedurally defaulted. Thereafter, on October 19, 2016, the habeas court denied the petition for certification to appeal, and this appeal followed.

Section 53a-3 (11) provides that \"[a] person acts 'intentionally' with respect to a result or to conduct described by a statute defining an offense when his conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such conduct ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The petitioner argues that it was improper for the trial court to instruct the jury regarding general intent, the intent to engage in conduct, and specific intent, the intent to cause such result, because the crimes he was charged with required instructions only as to specific intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner further argues that \"[a]s a result\n   of this instructional impropriety, the jury was misled as to the state's burden of proof on the essential element of intent,\" and the error allowed the jury to find him guilty of specific intent crimes while employing the lower standard of general intent. In response, the respondent argues that, viewing the charge in its entirety, there is no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled because the \"trial court repeatedly instructed the jury regarding the specific intent necessary to commit murder, second degree kidnapping, and conspiracy to commit those crimes.\" We agree with the respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We next set forth the legal principles applicable to our analysis of the petitioner's instructional claim. \"[I]ndividual jury instructions should not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.... The pertinent test is whether the charge, read in its entirety, fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law....

On Friday October 17, 1997, during its preliminary instructions, the court explained the following to the jury: \"[The] offenses [to be defined] [on] Monday [are] all specific intent crimes. That means that the person charged has to have a specific intent to commit a particular crime.\" The trial court defined intent as follows: \"[I]ntent is the status in a person's mind. It is the act of an intellect.... [I]ntent is required for the commission of the crime. Intent is defined in the statutes. It binds you and me. And [ General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (11) ] states that a person acts intentionally with respect to a result or to conduct\n   described by a statute defining an offense when his conscious objective is to cause a result or to engage in such conduct. Murder is the unlawful taking of the life of another with an intent to take that life. The person charged with that offense must act intentionally, the intent to take a life at the time the life is taken, and it must be by the act of the person charged. Intentional conduct is purposeful conduct, rather than conduct that is accidental or inadvertent or unintentional conduct.\" The court further stated: \"[A] person's intention may be inferred from their conduct or his conduct. You may infer from the fact that an accused engaged in conduct that he intended to engage in that conduct.... You may not presume the existence of intent. You may not presume that a person intended the consequences of their act, but you may draw reasonable and logical inferences\n   that a person's intention is exhibited by the total circumstances demonstrating the ... conduct of the people involved in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The following Monday, the court repeated its preliminary instructions and, for a second time, read the full statutory definition of intent under \u00a7 53a-3 (11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Throughout the remainder of its instructions, the court referred the jury to this definition of intent on seven occasions, but did not repeat the definition itself. The court explained the principle of accessorial liability under \u00a7 53a-8, noting that \"[i]n order to be an accessory to a crime, the [petitioner] must have the same criminal intent required for the crime to which he is an accessory, as I've explained intent to you and will explain it again.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Thereafter, when instructing the jury on the specific elements of kidnapping in the second degree, the court\n   read the statutory definition set forth in \u00a7 53a-94.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court further instructed that, in order to find the petitioner guilty of that offense, the jury must find that he intended to abduct and restrain the victim. The court's instruction provided in relevant part: \"A person is guilty of kidnapping in the second degree when he abducts another person. The first term is abduct. Abduct means to restrain a person with intent to prevent his liberation either by secreting or hiding him in a place where he is not likely to be found or by using or threatening\n   to use physical force or intimidation....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"The next term to be defined is to restrain. Restrain means to restrict a person's moving intentionally and unlawfully in such a manner as to interfere substantially with his liberty by moving him from one place to another or by confining him either in the place where the restriction first begins or in a place to which he has been moved to without consent. Without consent includes, but is not limited to, deception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"As you can see, abduction and restraining must be intentional. There must be an intent to interfere intentionally with the victim's liberty and an intent to prevent the victim's liberation by, one, secreting or hiding him in a place where he is not likely to be found; two, by using or threatening to use physical force or intimidation. Remember my earlier instruction in regard to intentional conduct.\" The court repeated this proper instruction at least two more times during its charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   With respect to murder,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court instructed that in order to find the petitioner guilty of that offense,\n   the jury must find that he specifically intended to cause the death of the victim. The court's instruction provided in relevant part: \"Now ... take into account the same instructions I have given you Friday and today on intentional conduct and accessorial liability as it applies.... A person is guilty of murder when, with the intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person.\" The court subsequently discussed each element of the offense, stating in relevant part: \"There are two elements, each of which the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt in order to sustain a conviction.... First is that the [petitioner] had the intent to cause the death of another person. Please bring into play my instructions in regard to the definition of intentional conduct. The second element is that the [petitioner] or [a coconspirator] acting with that intent to cause the death of [the victim], did shoot with a firearm and cause the death of [the victim].\" The court repeated this proper instruction at least six more times during its charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The court then instructed the jury on the elements of conspiracy to commit kidnapping in the second degree and conspiracy to commit murder, stating that \"[a] person is guilty of conspiracy when, with the intent to [engage in] conduct constituting a crime ... he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct and any one of them commits an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The court repeated\n   this proper instruction at least six more times during its charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In addition to its oral charge, the court provided the jury with a \"schematic,\" which \"list[ed] ... the essential elements\" and \"what [was] required to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt\" for each charged offense. The jury began its deliberations and, thereafter, sent the following note to the court: \"Your Honor, if possible we would like the\n   <em>\n    written\n   </em>\n   definitions of the following terms: [1] reasonable doubt; [2] intent; and [3] conspiracy.\" (Emphasis in original.) In response to that note, the court provided the jury with written instructions regarding conspiracy, intent\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We now turn to the testimony elicited at the petitioner's habeas trial. The petitioner's appellate counsel explained that as an appellate attorney, she reviewed jury instructions in their entirety, and not in isolated portions. She also testified that she was aware that the court improperly instructed the jury by including the full statutory definition of intent, but believed that the court had provided accurate instructions of the crimes charged, specifically testifying: \"When you look at ... the charge as a whole and specifically when the judge charged on the specific crimes ... he gave the intent to cause the result.... He ... referred only to that\n   portion of the intent instruction.\" Appellate counsel further testified that, although she was aware of the\n   <em>\n    DeBarros\n   </em>\n   case, which was issued in 2000, three years after the petitioner's criminal trial, she did not raise an instructional claim because she \"felt that it would be harmless error.\" Similarly, the petitioner's trial counsel testified that he did not take exception to the court's instructions on intent because he did not think \"they were ... an incorrect statement of the law,\" and that \"focus[ing] on the tenor and timbre of the entire instruction ... [it] left no doubt as to the intent necessary ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The petitioner's experts, Pattis and Taylor, both provided opinions with respect to this issue. Pattis would not concede that \"the court gave what would have been apparent to a lawyer of ordinary skill and training at that time an incorrect instruction,\" but explained that, given\n   <em>\n    DeBarros\n   </em>\n   , he \"would have liked it as a potential appellate issue ....\" Although Pattis opined that there was a \"substantial likelihood\" that the jury was misled regarding the state's burden of proof, he classified the petitioner's case as \"somewhere between\n   <em>\n    DeBarros\n   </em>\n   ... and the cases where the court held it was not pervasive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Taylor testified that in a murder case his practice was to raise any good faith issue because the stakes are so high. Taylor testified that \"the trial court very clearly at one point gave the wrong instruction on intent, including a broader intent aspect than is permissible with respect to these specific intent crimes, but the court repeatedly\n   gave a specific intent charge as well, and when you take the charge as a whole, [he thought] it would be very unlikely that you would convince an appellate court that the jury was misled by the charge.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taylor nevertheless opined that appellate\n   counsel's failure to raise this claim constituted ineffective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The habeas court, in its memorandum of decision, stated that: \"[Appellate counsel] had considered and declined to press this issue in the petitioner's appeal. She recognized that the trial judge lacked the benefit of [this court's] wisdom because [\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeBarros\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1046229\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/58/673/\">\n    58 Conn.

[Appellate counsel] was also aware that our appellate tribunals have seldom reversed convictions based on this particular error since that case was decided....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"In the petitioner's case, the trial judge correctly informed the jurors of the specific intent that the prosecution need[ed] to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, when he instructed on each crime individually. [Appellate counsel] reasonably opined that this claim was unlikely to succeed, and she devoted her limited brief pages and argument to more meritorious issues. The court finds that this professional decision came within the wide boundaries of acceptable legal representation. Therefore, the petitioner has failed to satisfy his burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his appellate lawyer rendered ineffective assistance as to this specification of deficient performance.\" (Citation omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   With the foregoing facts in mind, we now address the habeas court's conclusion that appellate counsel did not render deficient performance by failing to raise this instructional claim on appeal. The petitioner contends that his case \"presents a greater danger of a misled jury than ...\n   <em>\n    DeBarros\n   </em>\n   .\" In\n   <em>\n    DeBarros\n   </em>\n   , the trial court, during its initial instructions, charged the jury\n   on the elements of murder as follows: \"There are two elements that the state has to prove ... beyond a reasonable doubt.... The first element is that the defendant had the intent to cause the death of another person. Our statutes and law [are] that a person acts intentionally with respect to a result or to conduct described by a statute defining an offense when his conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such conduct.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeBarros\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1046229\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/58/673/\">\n    58 Conn.

Additionally, the court, while instructing the jury on other crimes, referred to this definition of intent on seven occasions.

On appeal, this court reversed the defendant's murder conviction, holding that it was reasonably possible that the jury was misled because: (1) \"the trial court's improper instructions were too numerous to be rectified by [its] proper instructions,\" and (2) \"the court read the instruction as a specific definition of the intent required for [murder] ... [which] likely misled the jury to believe that to intend to cause the death of another person means either to intend to cause\n   the death of that person or to intend to engage in conduct that causes the death of that person.\" Id., at 683-84,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=755%20A.2d%20303\">\n    755 A.2d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court in\n   <em>\n    DeBarros\n   </em>\n   also noted that the trial court \"did not provide instructional handouts to the jury that would have properly explained the element of intent.\" Id., at 684,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=755%20A.2d%20303\">\n    755 A.2d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   n.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We are not persuaded that the petitioner's case presents a situation analogous to that of\n   <em>\n    DeBarros\n   </em>\n   or those cases in which it was reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court's instructions. Although similar to\n   <em>\n    DeBarros\n   </em>\n   in that the court in this case read, provided, or referred to the improper instruction a total\n   of ten times, \"[a] quantitative 'litmus test' measuring how frequently a trial court gives an irrelevant instruction is ... insufficient to establish an instruction's tendency to mislead the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Montanez\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5748883\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/277/735/#p743\">\n    277 Conn. at 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=894%20A.2d%20928\">\n    894 A.2d 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001700\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/87/754/#p764\">\n    87 Conn.

In the present case, unlike\n   <em>\n    DeBarros\n   </em>\n   , the record indicates that the trial court read the improper instruction only as a general definition of intent. The record further indicates that the court repeatedly gave a proper instruction as to each specific offense.

Accordingly, the petitioner's claim would have failed to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   's third prong because he is unable to demonstrate that a constitutional violation exists and deprived him of a fair trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Aviles\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4052401\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/107/209/#p230\">\n    107 Conn.

The law and record, therefore, support the habeas court's conclusion that appellate counsel made a reasonable strategic decision in choosing to forgo a weak claim of instructional error, especially in view of other stronger claims, including two on which the petitioner prevailed.

On May 10, 1996, on Laurel Court, a dead-end street in Bridgeport, the [petitioner] and Hamilton had a discussion concerning both money that Hamilton owed the [petitioner] and a gun of the [petitioner's] that he had given to Hamilton approximately two weeks earlier. Also present during the conversation were the victim, and McWarren St. Julien. The [petitioner] also questioned the victim about the whereabouts of the gun. During the conversation, the [petitioner] became upset, began yelling and pulled out a Glock .40 handgun. Police officers subsequently came to the location of the conversation, but when they arrived the [petitioner] was no longer there. Later that night, Hamilton called the [petitioner] to attempt to explain that he did not know where the gun was located, and that he would never steal from the [petitioner]. The [petitioner] told Hamilton that he wanted him 'to get everything straight.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"On the following day, May 11, 1996, Hamilton again called the [petitioner], who told Hamilton that he was going to meet Hamilton ... and that the two men\n   would go together to find the victim to learn what had happened to the gun. Later that evening, the [petitioner] picked up Hamilton and they proceeded to 244 Olive Street in Bridgeport, where Hamilton [and] the victim ... lived. At 244 Olive Street, the [petitioner], the victim, St. Julien [and] Hamilton ... were on the front porch of the house. There the [petitioner] asked the victim about the whereabouts of his gun that had been the topic of the May 10 discussion. At or about the same time, Rodolphe St. Victor arrived at the house. The [petitioner] and St. Julien then left the porch as St. Victor forcibly pulled the victim off the porch. As the [petitioner] and St. Julien proceeded to enter a blue Oldsmobile parked in the driveway of the house, St. Victor grabbed the victim by the sleeve and said 'Come on. [The petitioner] wants to talk to you.' St. Victor then forced the victim into the Oldsmobile, which the\n   [petitioner] then drove away....\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \"Later that evening, the [petitioner], St. Julien and St. Victor returned to 244 Olive Street in the blue Oldsmobile.

The crux of the petitioner's argument is that his convictions for murder as an accessory and conspiracy to commit murder cannot stand because they are logically inconsistent with the trial court's granting his motion for a judgment of acquittal with respect to the capital felony charge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner further argues\n   that\n   \"[a]ppellate counsel's failure to pursue this claim on appeal was not based on reasonable strategy, but on an ignorance of the applicable principles of law and a misreading [of] the trial court's decision.\" In response, the respondent contends that despite appellate counsel's \"misperception of the law regarding capital felony, she did not perform deficiently on this ground given its underlying lack of merit.\" We agree with the respondent and, accordingly, conclude that because there was sufficient evidence adduced at trial to prove that the petitioner was guilty of murder as an accessory and conspiracy to commit murder, appellate counsel acted reasonably by not raising an insufficiency claim in the petitioner's direct criminal appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The following legal principles are necessary to our resolution of these claims. To establish the petitioner's guilt with respect to the offense of murder as an accessory under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a and 53a-8 (a), the state was required to prove that: (1) a murder was committed; see footnote 11 of this opinion; (2) the petitioner had the intent to cause the death of the victim; see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Otto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Conn.%2051\">\n    305 Conn. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 66-67,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20A.3d%20629\">\n    43 A.3d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) ; and (3) the petitioner \"solicit[ed], request[ed], command[ed], importune[ed] or intentionally aid[ed]\" in the\n   commission of the murder. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 (a). \"[A] conviction under \u00a7 53a-8 requires [the state to prove the petitioner's] dual intent, [first], that the accessory have the intent to aid the principal and [second] that in so aiding he intend to commit the offense with which he is charged.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Danforth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20Conn.%20518\">\n    315 Conn. 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 529,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20A.3d%201060\">\n    108 A.3d 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The crime of conspiracy is codified at \u00a7 53a-48.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   To establish the petitioner's guilt with respect to this offense, \"the state must show that there was an agreement between two or more persons to engage in conduct constituting a crime and that the agreement was followed by an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy ....

There undoubtedly will be situations in which reasonable minds could differ regarding whether the particular facts at the close of the state's case could support a verdict of guilty, but once a case is submitted to a jury, however erroneously, and the jury returns a verdict of guilty, review of the evidence ought to be on the basis of that evidence that was before the jury....
