Contrary to the mother's contention, the court did not abuse its discretion in proceeding with the termination hearing notwithstanding her request to replace her court-appointed counsel. The mother does not challenge the court's findings by clear and convincing evidence of parental unfitness and that termination is in the children's best interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Zarianna C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12352984\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/1270/\">\n    2018 ME 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12352984\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/1270/\">\n    177 A.3d 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Alexavier G.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12354907\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/174/891/\">\n    2017 ME 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 1 &amp; n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12354907\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/174/891/\">\n    174 A.3d 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that when the trial court found three bases for parental unfitness, a single undisputed basis \"constitutes a waiver of this issue on appeal\" and \"alone is sufficient to support the court's termination of her parental rights\"). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b6 2] The mother failed to appear for the September 26, 2017, hearing on the Department of Health and Human Services' petition to terminate her parental rights. Her court-appointed counsel was present and represented her interests. Earlier, on September 15, acting pro se, the mother filed two handwritten letters with the court raising numerous issues. Relevant to the sole issue she raises on appeal, in one of the letters the mother alleged that her attorney had failed to adequately communicate with and otherwise represent her, and she named another attorney that she wished to have appointed to her case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon finding that \"I don't take anything from [the letters] ... [t]hey're allegations ... [and the mother] is not here today,\" and without objection from any party, the court proceeded with the evidentiary hearing, in which the State, the mother's counsel, and the guardian ad litem participated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 3] Although the mother has a due process right to appointed counsel in this child protection proceeding,\n   <em>\n    In re T.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310751\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/65/1282/\">\n    2013 ME 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310751\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/65/1282/\">\n    65 A.3d 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"the right to counsel does not include unfettered freedom to change attorneys,\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
