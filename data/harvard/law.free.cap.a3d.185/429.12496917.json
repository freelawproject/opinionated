(Sedgwick) appealing a fee review decision of a Bureau of Workers' Compensation (Bureau) fee review hearing officer (Hearing Officer) that ordered Sedgwick to pay chiropractor Michael Piszel, D.C. (Provider) for office visit charges in his treatment of workers' compensation claimant Robert Grivner (Claimant). The issue in this appeal is what constitutes \"a significant and separately identifiable service performed in addition to the other procedure\" under Workers' Compensation Medical Cost Containment Regulation\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20127.105\">\n    34 Pa. Code \u00a7 127.105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), for which a chiropractor is entitled to payment for an office visit in addition to his charges for the treatment provided at the same visit. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate the Hearing Officer's order and remand this case to the Bureau Fee Review Hearing Office to determine whether the office visit charges in question were for routine examinations involving no new medical condition, change in medical condition, or other circumstances that required an examination and assessment above and beyond the usual examination and evaluation for the treatment performed on that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Claimant suffered a work-related injury on February 28, 2005, in his employment with General Motors (Employer). Claimant and Employer entered into a Compromise and Release Agreement (C &amp; R) with respect to that work injury that was approved by a workers' compensation judge (WCJ) on February 29, 2012. Under the C &amp; R, Employer remains obligated to pay reasonable and necessary medical expenses for the work injury, described as right shoulder partial thickness tear and superior labrum tear with post-operative scarring and rotator cuff inflammation, and left shoulder overuse rotator cuff inflammation. (2014 Utilization Review Decision, Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 802a.) Sedgwick is Employer's workers' compensation insurance third-party administrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Claimant receives chiropractic treatment from Provider for shoulder and neck pain approximately three times per week. (2014 Utilization Review Decision, R.R. at 803a-804a;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Provider's Treatment Notes, R.R. at 141a, 154a-158a, 217a-223a, 277a-281a, 328a-330a, 373a, 419a-420a, 540a-544a, 547a, 554a-556a, 562a-565a, 576a-\n   579a, 585a-588a, 606a-609a, 654a-661a.) Between October 21, 2015 and April 22, 2016, Provider sent Sedgwick bills for his treatment of Claimant that included charges of $78.00 per visit for office visits on dates on which he provided chiropractic treatment to Claimant and billed for the other treatments. (Hearing Officer Decision Findings of Fact (F.F.) \u00b6\u00b6 5-8.) Sedgwick denied payment for the office visit charges, but paid Provider for other treatments that he provided on those dates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   F.F. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.) Provider filed nine timely applications for fee review challenging Sedgwick's denials of payment for 39 of these same-day office visit charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Bureau issued administrative determinations denying Provider's claims for the office visit charges. Provider timely filed requests for hearing to contest the nine fee review determinations and the Hearing Officer consolidated the requests for hearing with the consent of both parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the proceedings before the Hearing Officer, Provider submitted an affidavit in which he stated that \"[e]ach time I treat [Claimant], I perform a physical exam[,] I take a history of his subjective complaints, identify the objective findings on my exam, assess his condition and treatment recommendations, and give a plan\" and that \"[t]his is not included in the value of another procedure.\" (Provider Ex. 1, R.R. at 795a.) Provider's treatment notes for the office visits in question were also admitted in evidence. These treatment notes show that the examinations concerned the same general conditions, right shoulder pain, left shoulder pain, and neck pain, and were only days apart from other examinations. (Provider's Treatment Notes, R.R. at 154a-158a, 217a-223a, 277a-280a, 328a-330a, 373a, 419a-420a, 547a, 585a-588a, 606a-609a, 654a-661a.) In addition, the parties introduced in evidence a 2014 WCJ decision rejecting a utilization review challenge to Provider's treatments of Claimant's work injury and a May 2015 decision of a different Bureau fee review hearing officer rejecting Provider's claims for same-day office visits in his treatment of Claimant in 2013 and 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 5, 2017, the Hearing Officer issued a decision vacating the Bureau's administrative determinations in the nine fee review applications and ordered Sedgwick to pay all of the office visit charges. The Hearing Officer found Provider's affidavit credible. (Hearing Officer Decision\n   F.F. \u00b6 18.) The Hearing Officer recognized that under the Workers' Compensation Medical Cost Containment Regulations (Medical Cost Containment Regulations), payment for office visits on the same day that another procedure is performed is permitted \"only when the office visit represents a significant and separately identifiable service performed in addition to the other procedure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Conclusion of Law (C.L.) \u00b6 3) (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20127.105\">\n    34 Pa. Code \u00a7 127.105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) ) (emphasis omitted).) The Hearing Officer, however, made no factual findings as to the nature of any of the examinations and evaluations for which an office visit charge was billed and no findings as to whether any of them were non-routine or involved new medical conditions or evaluations for new or different treatments. Instead, the Hearing Officer concluded that Sedgwick had not shown that Provider was not entitled to payment for the office visits because it \"did not offer proof, by affidavit or otherwise,\n   <em>\n    explaining\n   </em>\n   what is meant by the phrase 'significant and separately identifiable service' under the regulation\" or \"prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the procedures listed in Provider's bills ... include the value of the office visits.\" (Hearing Officer Decision C.L. \u00b6 4 (emphasis in original).) Sedgwick timely appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sedgwick argues that Section 127.105 of the Medical Cost Containment Regulations prohibits payment of office visit charges for routine physical examinations and evaluations on the same day as other treatment where there is no new medical condition and that all of Provider's office visit charges were for routine examinations for the same medical conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Section 306(f.1) of the Workers' Compensation Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Medical Cost Containment Regulations, promulgated by the Bureau to implement Section 306(f.1), require health care providers to bill for their treatment of workers' compensation claimants in accordance with Medicare procedure codes and limit payment to providers based on Medicare reimbursement rates. 77 P.S. \u00a7 531(1), (3)(i), (vii), (viii) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20127.1\">\n    34 Pa.

Code \u00a7 127.105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (emphasis added), shows a clear intent to make payment for same-day examinations the exception, not the rule. Construing Section 127.105(e) to permit payment of office visit charges for same-day examinations performed on a routine basis without special circumstances unique to the patient's condition or nature of the treatment session would effectively read this limiting language out of the regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Provider argues that the Hearing Officer's decision must be affirmed because he found that Sedgwick did not satisfy its burden of proving that it fully paid Provider. This argument fails, however, because the Hearing Officer made no findings as to the facts on which Sedgwick's liability turned. Instead, the Hearing Officer erroneously treated the legal issue of when an examination constitutes \"a significant and separately identifiable service\" as a factual issue and made no findings as to the nature of and reasons for the examinations from which a ruling could be made as to whether they satisfy the requirements of Section 127.105(e). Provider's affidavit, which the Hearing Officer found credible, does not provide any facts concerning changes in Claimant's medical condition or set forth any circumstances that required an examination and assessment above and beyond the usual examination and evaluation for the treatments that Provider performed that would permit a determination that any of the examinations constituted \"a significant and separately identifiable service.\" To the contrary, Provider's statement that he performed the same examination and evaluation \"[e]ach time I treat [Claimant],\" (Provider Ex. 1, R.R. at 795a), would support the conclusion that the examinations were purely routine. Moreover, Sedgwick did not fail to introduce sufficient evidence to sustain its burden of proof. Provider Notes for all of the office visits were introduced in evidence and those notes set forth Claimant's condition at the time of the treatment, Provider's examination and assessment of Claimant, and the treatment that Provider performed on those dates, from which the necessary factual findings can be made concerning the nature of and need for the examinations. (Provider's Treatment Notes, R.R. at 154a-158a, 217a-223a, 277a-280a, 328a-330a, 373a, 419a-420a, 547a, 585a-588a, 606a-609a, 654a-661a.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sedgwick's request that this Court order the dismissal of Provider's claims for the 39 office visit charges likewise fails. While the question of what constitutes \"a significant and separately identifiable service\" is an issue of law, whether Provider is entitled to payment for the office visits also involves issues of fact concerning the examinations, Claimant's medical condition, and Provider's treatments. Such factual determinations are for the fee review hearing officer to make as the finder of fact, and are not the province of this Court.\n   <em>\n    Jaeger v.
