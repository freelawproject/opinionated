We hold the statute prohibits such non-consensual partition. The statute supersedes and nullifies earlier case law that had allowed such a creditor's remedy in certain equitable circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts pertinent to our legal analysis are limited and essentially undisputed. In October 2006, defendant Raul Anibal Jimenez and his wife Gwyn Jimenez\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   obtained a tract of real property in Mansfield, New Jersey. The tract, which is said to be about thirty acres, is undeveloped and has not been used as the owners' marital residence. It is undisputed that defendant and his wife own the property as tenants by the entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In December 2011, plaintiffs Luis Jimenez, Raul Augustin Jimenez, and Lirio Jimenez\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a complaint in the Law Division against defendant seeking repayment on a line of credit they extended to him, as well as the repayment of additional funds he allegedly owed them in connection with a joint venture. Defendant denied liability and brought counterclaims against plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before a jury trial commenced, the parties settled their respective claims. They entered into a consent judgment on February\n   21, 2014, to be paid by defendant to plaintiffs, in the agreed-upon sum of $225,000. The consent judgment was \"filed and recorded as a lien\" on March 24, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The consent judgment recited that plaintiffs agreed to stay its execution until July 1, 2014. After that date passed, and defendant still had not satisfied the judgment, plaintiffs pursued collection efforts. They unsuccessfully attempted to levy upon moneys due\n   from numerous companies with which defendant does business in New Jersey. Plaintiffs also docketed the consent judgment in Pennsylvania, where defendant resides. Bank account searches in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well as a personal asset search of defendant, were unproductive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In January 2016, defendant responded to a post-judgment information subpoena concerning his finances. He claimed no income from his business activities. He did reveal that he and his wife own together a car, two real properties in Pennsylvania, and the Mansfield parcel in New Jersey. Plaintiffs have been unable thus far to obtain recovery of their judgment out of the Pennsylvania real estate, or from any other assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In November 2016, plaintiffs moved in the Law Division under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:59-1(d) to compel the partition and sale of the Mansfield property. Defendant opposed the motion. He argued that such a forced sale and partition of real property, which he co-owns with his spouse as tenants by the entirety, is prohibited by N.J.S.A. 46:3-17.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In an oral opinion issued on January 6, 2017, the motion judge denied plaintiffs' application. The judge recognized that, under prior case law, a creditor could obtain the forced partition and sale of interests in real estate owned by a married couple as tenants by the entirety, depending upon the relative equities involved. Nevertheless, the judge ruled, with some reluctance, that N.J.S.A. 46:3-17.4 now disallows such a remedy. This appeal ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The sole question before us is the legal interpretation of N.J.S.A. 46:3-17.4, which is contained within a series of provisions at N.J.S.A. 46:3-17.2 to -17.4. The statute was approved on January 5, 1988. The statute became effective ninety days after its adoption, and applies to \"all tenancies which are created on or after\" that effective date.\n   <em>\n    L.\n   </em>\n   1987,\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   357, \u00a7 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freda v.

Nor has it been interpreted in any published New Jersey opinion involving, as here, an attempt by a third-party creditor to force the partition and sale of real estate owned by spouses as tenants by the entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As plaintiffs emphasize, prior to the adoption of N.J.S.A. 46:3-17.4, case law in our state had authorized courts to compel the partition and sale of a spouse's interests in property held in a tenancy by the entirety, in instances where equitable considerations justified such a remedy. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Newman v. Chase\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1928511\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/70/254/#p262\">\n    70 N.J. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=359%20A.2d%20474\">\n    359 A.2d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976), the Supreme Court recognized that \"a debtor's interest in property held as tenant by the entirety\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be reached by his or her creditors.\" (emphasis added). However, the Court qualified that point by stating that \"the remedy of partition is not\n   <em>\n    automatically\n   </em>\n   available to a purchaser at [an] execution sale or to a grantee of a trustee in bankruptcy ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=359%20A.2d%20474\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Rather, the propriety of the remedy of partition was subject to the \"equitable discretion\" of the court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 264,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=359%20A.2d%20474\">\n    359 A.2d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such equitable factors could include, for example, the interests of the debtor's family members in not being dispossessed from their home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 265-66,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=359%20A.2d%20474\">\n    359 A.2d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, the Court also recognized in\n   <em>\n    Newman v. Chase\n   </em>\n   the competing policy concern of not automatically allowing delinquent debtors \" 'the opportunity to sequester substantial assets from just liabilities.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=359%20A.2d%20474\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Way v. Root\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20N.W.%20577\">\n    140 N.W. 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 579 (Mich. 1913) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As the motion judge in this case rightly noted, but for the Legislature's adoption of N.J.S.A. 46:3-17.4, the court would have possessed the equitable authority recognized in\n   <em>\n    Newman v. Chase\n   </em>\n   to consider directing the partition of these spouses' interests in the\n   vacant Mansfield parcel. The parcel is not and was not used as a marital residence, as the spouses apparently live elsewhere. According to the complaint, some of the funds extended by plaintiffs to defendant allegedly related to the anticipated further development or sale of the Mansfield realty. Moreover, plaintiffs have expended considerable efforts to recover the judgment proceeds from other potential sources, but so far to no avail.\n   Despite these apparent equities favoring plaintiffs, we agree with defendant that N.J.S.A. 46:3-17.4 precludes the partition and forced sale of the real property because defendant and his wife own it as tenants by the entirety. We recognize Section 17.4 literally commands that \"neither spouse\" may sever, alienate, or otherwise affect their shared interests in the tenancy by the entirety, and that plaintiffs are not Gwyn Jimenez's \"spouse.\" Even so, we conclude the statutory prohibition applies to a situation where, as here, one spouse's failure to pay his personal debts to third-party creditors has resulted in a money judgment entered against him alone. Otherwise, a free-wheeling spouse, by amassing such individual debt, could detrimentally \"affect\" the other spouse's interests in their co-owned property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A statute must be construed in a sensible fashion to give meaning to its provisions.\n   <em>\n    State v. Harper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12435369\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/229/228/#p237\">\n    229 N.J. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237-38,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12435368,12435369,12435367\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/160/1281/\">\n    160 A.3d 1281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) ;\n   <em>\n    Wilson ex rel.

There would have been little point for the Legislature to have enacted Section 17.4 if it only intended to continue established principles of case law regarding tenancies by the entirety, such as the equitable concepts in\n   <em>\n    Newman v. Chase.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The \"default\" approach in N.J.S.A. 46:3-17.2 -which essentially treats a wide range of conveyances of title enumerating a \"husband and wife\" as tenancies by the entirety-bespeaks\n   a legislative intent to maximize each spouse's protection from a non-consensual diminution of his or her interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although there is no reported New Jersey opinion directly on point interpreting N.J.S.A. 46:3-17.4 in this third-party creditor context, the interpretation we adopt today has been echoed by other courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    In re Wanish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343229\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/555/496/#p499\">\n    555 B.R. 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499 (Bankr.
