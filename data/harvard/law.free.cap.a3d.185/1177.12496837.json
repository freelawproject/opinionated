The sole issue before this Court is whether the trial court erred by admitting a hearsay affidavit as the basis for an expert's valuation opinion. After review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 27, 2007, the Commission filed a declaration of taking (Declaration) condemning Lewis Tarlini's and Louise Ann Tarlini's (the Tarlinis) property formerly located at 2986 Galloway Road, Bensalem, Pennsylvania (Property). The Property is adjacent to and partially surrounded by the Parx Casino and Racetrack (Parx Casino). The remainder of the Property abuts the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The Property was zoned residential at the time the Declaration was filed. The existing access to the Property was through a deeded 12-foot right-of-way. On May 5, 2008, a Petition to Appoint Board of Viewers was filed. On June 4, 2008, the trial court appointed a Board of Viewers; however, on July 24, 2008, that order was vacated and a new Board of Viewers was appointed. On February 8, 2010, the Board of Viewers filed its report. On March 5, 2010, the Commission appealed from the Board of Viewer's Award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 2, 2006, more than a year before the Declaration's filing, the Tarlinis entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (Sale Agreement) with a purchaser who intended to develop a hotel on the Property. The negotiated purchase price was $2,200,000.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the condemnation prevented the Property's sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court commenced a jury trial on February 13, 2017, wherein, the sole issue was the Property's fair market value as of the Declaration date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commission contended that the Property's highest and best use was as a residence. The Tarlinis argued that the Property's highest and best use was as a hotel. In support of the Tarlinis' position, Lewis Tarlini testified, and land planner John H. Kennedy (Kennedy), zoning lawyer John A. VanLuvanee (VanLuvanee), traffic engineer David Horner (Horner) and appraiser Vincent Quinn (Quinn) (collectively, Tarlinis' Experts) also testified. Appraiser William Gontram testified on the Commission's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Tarlinis' Experts offered their opinions that the Property was adaptable to hotel use, and that there was a market for such a use in that area. Among the factors the Tarlinis' Experts considered in concluding that the Property was adaptable to hotel use, was whether there was adequate access to the Property from a public road, and the likelihood the Property would be rezoned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its June 16, 2017 decision, the trial court described the evidence supporting the Tarlinis' position that Property access would be reasonably available:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Lewis Tarlini testified that he used and maintained the area that would have been used for the driveway without being told to cease by the Parx [Casino] [p]roperty owner. He further testified that there was a driveway for his home and that he regularly cleaned and mowed that area as well[,] and removed and pruned trees. He testified that the Parx [Casino] property owner built a fence that severed the proposed easement area from the rest of the Parx [Casino] property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [Kennedy] testified about the probability that the [P]roperty owner could have obtained an easement for a driveway over the Parx [Casino] property. He laid out the foundation for that testimony by stating, that he looked at the area to see if Parx [Casino] was using it, and whether it would infringe upon the main operation of the use of the property as a casino or racetrack business. Ultimately, [ ] Kennedy also relied upon the [affidavit of Thomas Bonner (Bonner), the Vice President and General Counsel of\n   Greenwood Racing, Inc., Parx Casino's owner and operator (Bonner Affidavit)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ] to reach the conclusion that the [Tarlinis] could have obtained an easement for a driveway over the Parx [Casino] property. The Bonner Affidavit is a written and notarized statement signed by [Bonner] .... [Bonner] stated that it is probable for a number of reason[s] that [the Tarlinis] would have been able to acquire a driveway easement over the Parx [Casino] [p]roperty for use as a commercial property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [Quinn] testified that the [Tarlinis] could have obtained access over the Parx [Casino] property for a hotel. He had appraised the Parx [Casino] property several times and knew [ ] Bonner. Based upon his experience with the Parx [Casino] property and his dealings with the representatives of the Parx [Casino] property, [ ] Quinn concluded that [ ] the Tarlinis could have obtained access.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Trial Ct. Decision at 5-6 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In a sidebar conference during the Tarlinis' Counsel's direct examination of Kennedy, the Commission's Counsel objected to the Tarlinis' use of the Bonner Affidavit, contending that it was not probative and it was hearsay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 99a. The following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE COURT: To the extent that [the Tarlinis' Counsel] thinks it says something, he can argue it says something. I am going to let him put that to the jury, No. 1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   No. 2, as to the issue of it being hearsay, it is hearsay, but it's an expert opinion, and this is the more difficult area in terms of expert testimony. Under the federal rule, they allow experts to just wax on forever-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [COMMISSION'S COUNSEL]: But this-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   THE COURT: Under the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence, you have to prove the underlying fact. Knowing that, and knowing that you had knowledge of the information in the affidavit, I am going to let the testimony-I'm going to let [Kennedy] describe that he had knowledge that that person said those words and that those words support his ultimate conclusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   I'm going to say to you, you could have deposed that person, and you still could bring that person into the courtroom and cross-examine him, I guess, in theory. I don't know where the guy is or anything about him; I'm just telling you what I'm thinking through in terms of my ruling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [COMMISSION'S COUNSEL]: It would seem to me in order to meet the evidentiary threshold there would need to be-showing this would be the sort of material an expert would ordinarily rely on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT: I think he just said-when I heard the testimony. He said I would normally go out and speak to people and I would ask people, and that is where I sort of was watching objecting, not objecting, and you were properly waiting for the right question, but I think he covered that. He might want to supplement it with a couple more questions, but I want to be real clear that nothing comes in beyond what was said in [the Bonner A]ffidavit as to what he relied on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [TARLINIS' COUNSEL]: May I show [the Bonner A]ffidavit?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE COURT: I think it would make most sense to show the [Bonner A]ffidavit to hold him within the four corners, but I'll listen to Counsel's argument, yes or no. If you think there is an issue about the jury having published the [Bonner A]ffidavit, I'll listen to it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [COMMISSION'S COUNSEL]: I have a problem with the [Bonner A]ffidavit from start to finish.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE COURT: I understand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [COMMISSION'S COUNSEL]: I don't know that publishing changes-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   THE COURT: As long as I-I want to keep him in the framework, but you don't care, you don't feel you are unduly-you feel you are being prejudiced by allowing the information to come in. So noted; you are preserving that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Whether it is shown by a picture of the [Bonner A]ffidavit or him reading it, you don't care one way or the other?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [COMMISSION'S COUNSEL]: No, I think I'm equally prejudiced either way.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   THE COURT: All right, you made your record on that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   R.R. at 100a-103a. Kennedy then explained that, in situations like the Tarlinis' circumstances, he typically reached out to adjacent property owners to determine if the adjacent owners would be willing to grant an easement. The trial court then explained to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   THE COURT: I'm going to stop here for a moment and give the jury a mini lesson in the law in the hopes you'll understand the weight you should give or not give. It's up to you to determine how much weight you are going to give an expert's testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   One of the issues raised by [the Commission's] Counsel at sidebar is whether or not the information you are about to see is hearsay. The person who created this [Bonner A]ffidavit isn't in the courtroom and is not subject to being cross-examined.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   You have heard that term hearsay before. The purpose of the hearsay rule is to allow someone to cross-examine a witness in front of the jury or the factfinder. Some statements made by a person are admissible for a particular reason but not for another reason, in other words, a statement made that this witness is aware of is the basis of his opinion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   At the end of the day, if the statement has some weakness to it, you feel it's insufficient to provide his interpretation, that goes to your decision of whether or not this expert's opinion is worthwhile.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   You are going to see some information he relied on. You will then have to decide whether or not that information really is sufficient for the purpose of him coming to the final conclusion he reached.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   With that understanding, you may show them the [Bonner A]ffidavit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   R.R. at 103a-105a. Kennedy then testified that the Bonner Affidavit confirmed his opinion that the Tarlinis could have obtained a driveway easement from Parx Casino. At Tarlinis' Counsel's direction, Kennedy read portions of the Bonner Affidavit and then stated that he relied upon it, and as an expert, he typically relied upon similar information in reaching his conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On February 15, 2017, the jury returned a $2,300,000.00 verdict in the Tarlinis' favor. On February 24, 2017, the Commission filed the Motion. On June 16, 2017, the trial court denied the Commission's Motion, and on July 12, 2017, entered judgment in the Tarlinis' favor. The Commission appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The law is well-established that \"[a] trial court is vested with wide discretion in deciding whether to allow the admission of expert testimony into evidence, and is not subject to reversal absent a clear abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Daddona v.

Cmwlth. 2006). In its Opinion pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925(a) (1925(a) Opinion), the trial court explained its rationale for admitting the Bonner Affidavit into evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Despite falling under the definition of 'hearsay,' evidence may be admissible as the basis of an expert's opinion [under Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence (Rule) 703.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Additionally, in an eminent domain case, the standard for the admission of evidence is more lenient than for other cases. The Judicial Code provides that evidence in eminent domain matters are governed by the Eminent Domain Code [ (Code) ] provision. [42] Pa.C.S.[ ] \u00a7 6121. The standard[ ] states:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A qualified valuation expert may, on direct or cross-examination, state any or all facts and data which the expert considered in arriving at an opinion, whether or not [t]he expert has personal knowledge of the facts and data[,] and a statement of [the] facts and [data and] the sources of information shall be subject to impeachment and rebuttal[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   26 Pa. C.S.[ ] \u00a7 1105(1). The [Commission] was aware of the [Bonner] Affidavit prior to trial and it made no attempt to impeach or rebut its content. [ ] Kennedy testified that the Bonner Affidavit was the type of information that he typically relies upon. [ ] Kennedy considered it within the context of whether the proposed use would have access that was 'reasonably available.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   As provided by [Rule] 401, evidence is relevant if (a) it has a tendency to a make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and (b)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   the fact is of consequence in determining the action. Pa. R.E. 401. The evidence provided by the [Bonner] Affidavit is directly related to whether Parx Casino would have allowed an easement over its property, therefore, it was a consequence in determining the action and is relevant evidence. Furthermore, the [Bonner] Affidavit came into evidence with qualifications and instructions to the jury, which were not objected to nor have they since been challenged. This [trial c]ourt found that the [Bonner] Affidavit was properly admitted as one of the basis [sic] of an expert's opinion and was relevant to the subject matter before the [trial c]ourt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   1925(a) Opinion at 8-9 (citation and footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Commission argues that the trial court improperly admitted the Bonner Affidavit. Specifically, the Commission contends that the trial court failed to make a prerequisite finding that a valuation expert would reasonably rely upon an affidavit like the Bonner Affidavit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commission further asserts that the Bonner Affidavit contained \"remarkably vague [ ] assurances that access would 'probably' be provided at a 'fair and mutually agreed upon price' 'for a number of reasons[.]' \" Commission Amended Br. at 12 (quoting Bonner Affidavit, R.R. at 346a) (emphasis omitted). As it argued to the trial court, the Commission complains that the Bonner Affidavit \"doesn't say anything,\" Commission Amended Br. at 12 (quoting R.R. at 99a-100a); thus, it was unreasonable for the Tarlinis' Expert to rely on it, and it was error for the trial court to admit it into evidence before the trial court resolved \"whether the [Bonner A]ffidavit had meaningful substance[.]\" Commission Amended Br. at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Rule 703 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   An expert may base an opinion on\n   <strong>\n    facts or data\n   </strong>\n   in the case\n   <strong>\n    that the expert has been made aware of or personally observed.

Hence, it is often the case, as it was here, that experts are questioned concerning whether relied-upon sources are 'authoritative' or generally accepted, whether the source material is truly the type ordinarily relied on by similar experts, whether independent or further judgment was brought to bear on particular source material and whether the expert is competent enough to judge the reliability of the sources upon which he relied. These are the safeguards which assure that the experts' opinions are not being offered based on inherently untrustworthy data or data which is not commonly used by other professionals.\n   <strong>\n    If an expert has made faulty assumptions or leaps of judgment in relying on certain sources or in forming conclusions based on those sources, these issues are the proper subject of cross-examination.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   The relative roles of jury and expert in this context have been described as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   In a sense, the expert synthesizes the primary source material-be it hearsay or not-into properly admissible evidence in opinion form. The trier of fact is then capable of judging the credibility of the witness as it would that of anyone else giving expert testimony.

Therein, Watkins' expert (Dr. Woods), a psychiatrist who had never examined or even spoken to Watkins, based his opinion of Watkins' competence solely on his reviews of Watkins' medical records and the affidavits. The first affidavit, which was unsigned and undated, was purportedly by an individual identified as a staff person from the KIDS program during Watkins' involvement. The affidavit was accompanied by an email from the individual purporting to have read and agreed with the affidavit. The second affidavit was from an individual explaining that he had participated in the KIDS program with Watkins, and describing his and Watkins' painful emotional experiences and Watkins' physical and emotional state while in the KIDS program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   We cannot find that the PCRA court abused its discretion in this regard.

Dr. Woods'[ ] opinion testimony based on the statements would have no value unless the statements themselves were reliable and credible. Notably, [Watkins] could have called the declarants to testify, allowing them to be cross-examined and thereby tested on the reliability, accuracy, and credibility of their declarations. Indeed, the PCRA court explicitly asked PCRA counsel if the declarants were going to testify, and counsel's answer was 'no.' The PCRA court did not abuse its discretion in declining to allow Dr. Woods to give opinion testimony based on the out-of-court statements in the [affidavits].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276289,6888045\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/108/692/\">\n    108 A.3d at 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Accordingly, precluding the Tarlinis' Experts' testimony because the Bonner Affidavit is hearsay and Bonner was not subject to cross-examination, under these circumstances, does not comport with precedential Commonwealth law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Contrary to the Commission's position, the Bonner Affidavit\n   <strong>\n    does\n   </strong>\n   communicate facts. The Vice President and General Counsel of Parx Casino's owner and operator attested under oath that Parx Casino did not intend to use the proposed easement area and represented that Parx Casino would not have been opposed to granting an easement. He further expressed in his Affidavit that Parx Casino was willing to negotiate with the Tarlinis, and to grant an easement for a \"fair and mutually agreed upon price[.]\" R.R. at 346a. An expression by a neighboring landowner's representative regarding the landowner's willingness to grant an easement permitting access to a property where such easement would permit access, is a fact upon which a valuation expert would reasonably rely when considering whether access would be reasonably available. Kennedy and Quinn confirmed that they reasonably relied upon landowners' positions on granting easements in such circumstances, and the trial court accepted their testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Commission also takes issue with the Tarlini's Experts' reliance on the Bonner Affidavit, given Bonner's statement that \"it is probable for a number of reasons that [Lewis] Tarlini would have been able to acquire a driveway easement over the Parx [Casino] [p]roperty at a fair and mutually agreed upon price to be used for a commercial development.\" R.R. at 346a. The Commission specifically asserts that Kennedy's lack of knowledge as to the \"reasons\" why Parx Casino would permit the easement undermines his reliance on the Bonner Affidavit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7306930\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/72/669/#p677\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, it challenges Kennedy's reliance on the Bonner Affidavit because Kennedy did not know what Bonner meant by his use of the phrase, \"a fair and mutually agreed upon price ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7306930\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/72/669/#p677\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Notably, Kennedy's lack of knowledge regarding Parx Casino's motive for granting an easement is irrelevant. A buyer is not required to know a seller's motives for selling. Thus, the Tarlinis' Experts were not required to know why Parx Casino would be willing to grant an easement. Kennedy's inability to provide such justification does not undermine the Bonner Affidavit's representation that the Tarlinis would have been able to obtain an easement. Further, price specificity was not required in the Bonner Affidavit, as it would be unreasonable to expect a land owner whose property is subject to condemnation to expend a neighboring landowner's time and resources negotiating an unnecessary easement. Notwithstanding, as the Pennsylvania Superior Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Primavera\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]f an expert has made faulty assumptions or leaps of judgment\n   in relying on certain sources or in forming conclusions based on those sources,\n   <strong>\n    these issues are the proper subject of cross-examination\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 521 (emphasis added). Here, the Commission had the opportunity to cross-examine the Tarlinis' Experts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Importantly, the Tarlinis' Experts' opinions regarding Property access were not based solely on the Bonner Affidavit. Kennedy did not rely exclusively on the Bonner Affidavit to conclude that access to the Property would be reasonably available. Kennedy explained that most of the development projects with which he has been involved have required some kind of easement from a neighboring property. Kennedy further stated, \"[i]t's actually unusual if no easements are required.\" R.R. at 92a. Kennedy testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   I looked at the [P]roperty to see if ... Parx Casino[ ] was utilizing that area. [It was] not utilizing that area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Furthermore, the location of a driveway would not infringe on [its] main operation and use of [its] property, which was the casino and racetrack business. It would not affect that business at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   The township is trying to encourage further development of that district, that area, that property[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   R.R. at 94a. Thus, it is reasonable that Kennedy relied upon the statements in the Bonner Affidavit, in that they were consistent with Kennedy's personal observations, and they added additional information upon which Kennedy based his conclusion that access was reasonably available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Further, Quinn testified that he had appraised the Parx Casino racetrack several times and knew Bonner. He explained that the portion of the Parx Casino property that would have accommodated the driveway had been wooded, undeveloped and unused since the 1980s. He believed it was reasonably probable that a buyer or developer could have obtained a driveway easement from Parx Casino \"primarily based on [his] conversations with [ ] Bonner.\" R.R. at 181a. He stated that the Bonner Affidavit was consistent with his understanding that Parx Casino would likely have granted the Tarlinis an easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Moreover, the Commission objects to the trial court's suggestion that Section 1105 of the Code's more lenient admissibility standard permitted the use of the Bonner Affidavit. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   In 1964, in response to such precedent, the General Assembly made changes to the [Code] which substantially broadened the scope of admissible evidence, thus easing evidentiary restrictions for determining fair market value of a property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   26 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1105(1), Joint State Government Comm[']n Comments-1964.
