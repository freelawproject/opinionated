Nicole contends that the evidence does not support the court's finding of a temporarily intolerable living situation for Ella. We agree and vacate the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 2] In April 2016, Tammy Hopkins and her husband, Marlyn Hopkins, filed a petition for guardianship of Tammy's maternal granddaughter, Ella. In October 2016, by agreement between Nicole, Tammy, and Marlyn, the court entered an interim order granting temporary placement of Ella with Tammy and Marlyn. The court then entered another interim, agreed-upon order in February 2017, maintaining that arrangement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 3] On July 11, 2017, at the hearing on the petition for guardianship, the court observed at the outset that Marlyn had not appeared for the proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court\n   then heard testimony from Tammy; Nicole; and Ella's guardian ad litem, Earl Brown, Esq. After the hearing, the court issued the judgment that is the subject of this appeal. Without making any findings of fact, the court granted Tammy's petition and concluded that she had proved, by clear and convincing evidence, that a temporarily intolerable living situation for Ella existed as to Nicole, and that Tammy would provide a living situation that was in Ella's best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   B. Motion for Findings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 4] Four days after the judgment was entered, Nicole filed a motion for findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 52(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Prob. P. 52 (providing that M.R. Civ. P. 52 applies in probate proceedings). The court then issued findings of fact and conclusions of law that included, in relevant part, the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   4. Nicole has lived with her mother and step-father at various times during the course of this litigation but at the time of the hearing was living on her own with her children, outside her mother and step-father's home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   6. Approximately two months prior to the hearing in this case on July 11, 2017, petitioner Tammy Hopkins requested that Nicole and both her children leave her home because of conflict between Nicole and petitioner Marlyn Hopkins. That conflict involved physical confrontation between Nicole and Marlyn Hopkins, in front of both children, and that conflict was upsetting to Ella. Petitioner Tammy Hopkins removed a crying Ella from the area of conflict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   7. Marlyn Hopkins consumes amounts of alcohol daily and sometimes his alcohol use increases his anger, irritability and abusive behavior against Nicole, according to the testimony of both Nicole and his wife Tammy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   9. The presence of Marlyn Hopkins in petitioner Tammy Hopkin[s]'s environment does not by itself render Tammy's home unsafe and not appropriate to the residence of Ella.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   10. Nicole has experienced periods of instability in her life. Nicole's home is not appropriate in the view of the guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   and the GAL's concerns relate primarily to the amount of time that Nicole has been in the environment as well as the presence of at least one pit bull dog. Nicole testified that her intention is to stay in the environment and she has no plans to move. The Court concludes, on the evidence presented, that Nicole's environment is \"temporarily intolerable.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   11. At the time of the hearing Nicole was living with both her children and there was evidence to suggest that her living situation created a risk for Ella. This Court concludes that Tammy Hopkins'[s] (but not Marlyn Hopkins'[s] ) petition for guardianship as the proposed guardian has met her burden to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that Nicole's current living situation creates an environment that is \"temporarily intolerable\" for Ella.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Nicole timely appealed from the judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1-308 (2017) ; M.R. App. P. 2B(c)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Nicole argues that the record lacks sufficient evidence to support the court's finding that her living situation is \"temporarily intolerable\" for Ella.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Title 18-A M.R.S. \u00a7 5-204(c) provides, in pertinent part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The court may appoint a guardian or guardians for an unmarried minor if ... the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that ... a living situation has been created that is at least temporarily intolerable for the child even though the living situation does not rise to the level of jeopardy required for the final termination of parental rights, and that the proposed guardian will provide a living situation that is in the best interest of the child ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   18-A M.R.S. \u00a7 5-204(c).

This case is entirely unlike\n   <em>\n    Thayer\n   </em>\n   , where the court tied its findings of\n   <em>\n    past\n   </em>\n   parental unfitness together with such findings of\n   <em>\n    recent\n   </em>\n   unfitness as, \"[w]hile the petition was pending, the father allowed [his daughter's] health issues to worsen through neglect.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6803117\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/136/349/\">\n    2016 ME 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6803117\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/136/349/\">\n    136 A.3d 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given the overwhelming record evidence that Nicole was a fit parent at the time of the hearing, the court's finding to the contrary is clearly erroneous, as it \"is so against the great preponderance of the believable evidence that it does not represent the truth and right of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Jewel I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7291636\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/989/726/\">\n    2010 ME 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7291636\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/989/726/\">\n    989 A.2d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b6 15] In\n   <em>\n    Dunning v. Dunning\n   </em>\n   , we emphasized that a clear error analysis necessarily requires our review of the entire evidence, reasoning, \"[T]his record contains such evidentiary weight and it has led us to such convictional certainty that we do not feel able to escape the view that the trial court has failed to make a sound survey of or to accord the proper effect to all of the cogent facts ....\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7920076\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/495/821/#p824\">\n    495 A.2d 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 824 (Me. 1985) (alteration omitted) (quotation marks omitted). Here, although not included in the court's findings of fact, Tammy testified at the hearing that Nicole \"can be trusted [with Ella]. She is a good mother.\" Moreover, after Nicole left Tammy's house with Ella-during the \"roughly two months\" leading up to the hearing-Tammy never exercised her right to take custody of Ella. Tammy also testified that Nicole's living situation is adequate for Ella's one-year-old brother and that she has never petitioned for guardianship of the brother. Furthermore, Nicole testified-and Tammy does not dispute-that she is currently working at a hospital and has a lead on an additional job at a medical staffing agency. Nicole also testified that she moved in with her current boyfriend after having known him for roughly six weeks. The boyfriend has full custody of a seven-year-old son and according to Nicole, the \"gluing stone of our relationship\" was the fact that \"[o]ur kids got along great. We loved how they interacted with each other ....\" According to Nicole, it is her intention to remain with the boyfriend, but if they were to separate, she would have enough money to rent a new apartment and would keep Ella in the same school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b6 16] In light of these positive developments, the fact that Nicole is living with the boyfriend after having known him briefly-seemingly the basis for the GAL's concern that she has not spent a sufficient period of time in her current environment-is not the \"exceptional circumstance[ ] affecting [Ella]\" that would justify an intrusion into their parent-child relationship.\n   <em>\n    Pitts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6960835\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/90/1169/\">\n    2014 ME 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6960835\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/90/1169/\">\n    90 A.3d 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
