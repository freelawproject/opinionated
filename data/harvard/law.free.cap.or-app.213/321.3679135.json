J.</author>\n<p id=\"b367-3\">The question in this workers\u2019 compensation case is whether the medical evidence supports claimant\u2019s award of permanent partial disability benefits based on a finding of chronic condition impairment. OAR 436-035-0019. SAIF seeks review of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board\u2019s (board) order affirming an administrative law judge\u2019s (ALJ) award to claimant of 10 percent unscheduled permanent partial disability for chronic condition impairment of the cervical and lumbar spine. SAIF contends that the medical evidence is insufficient to support the award. We conclude that the board\u2019s order is supported by substantial evidence and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The following facts, taken from the board\u2019s order, are not contested. Claimant works for SAIF\u2019s insured as a truck driver. He has a history of back problems dating back some 20 years. In January of 2004, he underwent a hemilaminec-tomy and decompression of the nerve root at L3. Claimant continued to experience low back pain after the surgery, which was successfully controlled with pain medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In October 2004, claimant suffered a work-related injury to his neck and back when he bent over to lift a heavy chain. Dr. Meharry, claimant\u2019s treating physician, and Dr. Marble, an orthopedic surgeon who performed a medical examination at SAIF\u2019s request, diagnosed cervical, thoracic, and lumbar strains as a result of the incident. Both doctors noted that claimant exhibited significant pain response that did not seem to be related to organic causes. They referred claimant for a surgical evaluation and an MRI. The MRI showed that claimant had degenerative changes in his back but no conditions warranting further surgery. SAIF accepted an injury claim for a cervical strain, thoracic strain, and lumbar strain.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In March 2005, Meharry determined that claimant was medically stationary with respect to his work injury, but not with respect to his pain. In April 2005, SAIF closed the claim with an award of temporary disability but no permanent disability, and claimant sought reconsideration of the notice of closure and the appointment of a medical arbiter.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>The Workers\u2019 Compensation Division, Appellate Review Unit (ARU) appointed Dr. Kane as medical arbiter. Kane reviewed the medical records and examined claimant. Kane did not note any loss of muscle strength due to the accepted conditions. As to range of motion, Kane conducted measurements and reported a decreased range of motion in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar areas. He noted, however, that during the examination claimant demonstrated limitations that seemed to be related to pain and that were not organically based, and he concluded for that reason that range of motion findings were invalid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Although claimant\u2019s pain behavior prevented an accurate assessment of loss of function, Kane concluded that claimant was impaired in his ability to repetitively use his back:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">\u201cThe worker is significantly limited in his ability to repetitively use the cervical and lumbar spine regions as a result of a permanent medical condition arising out of accepted conditions. Despite pain behavior and symptom amplification, there has been consistent demonstration of impaired functional capacity. <em>This has been recorded by his attending physician, his physical therapist, and by the IME examiner, and during my interview and exam today. Objective evidence of the accepted conditions giving rise to permanent impairment in the cervical and lumbar spine is not available by virtue of the nature of those conditions.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">(Underlining in original; italics added.) Thus, Kane opined that claimant had significant limitations in his ability to repetitively use the cervical and lumbar spine due to the accepted condition, although he qualified that finding with a statement that there was an absence of \u201cobjective evidence\u201d of permanent impairment. In reliance on Kane\u2019s report, the ARU issued an order on reconsideration that modified the notice of closure and awarded claimant 10 percent (32 degrees) unscheduled permanent disability for chronic impairment of the cervical and lumbar spine. OAR 436-035-0019(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>SAIF requested a hearing, challenging the award under ORS 656.283(7), which states that \u201c[a]ny finding of fact regarding the worker\u2019s impairment must be established by medical evidence that is supported by objective findings.\u201d SAIF argued that Kane\u2019s finding that claimant is significantly limited in his ability to repetitively use the cervical and lumbar spine does not support an award for chronic condition impairment, because, as Kane himself noted, the finding is not supported by \u201cobjective evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">The ALJ rejected SAIF\u2019s challenge, reasoning that Kane\u2019s finding that claimant is significantly limited in his ability to repetitively use his cervical and lumbar spine <em>is itself </em>an objective finding in support of the board\u2019s finding of impairment, and that the finding was persuasive because it was based on sound reasoning and a thorough evaluation of claimant and the medical record. As for the reference to an absence of \u201cobjective evidence,\u201d the ALJ found that the statement merely referred to Kane\u2019s inability to make objective measurements in light of claimant\u2019s responses. The board adopted the ALJ\u2019s opinion and order and affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">SAIF seeks review, contending once again that the board\u2019s 10 percent award of unscheduled permanent partial disability for chronic condition impairment of claimant\u2019s cervical and lumbar spine is not based on objective findings of permanent impairment. Specifically, SAIF argues that Kane\u2019s statement that claimant has limitations in the repetitive use of his cervical and lumbar spine is not supported by objective findings and, further, that it is contradicted by Kane\u2019s own statement that \u201cobjective evidence of the accepted conditions giving rise to permanent impairment in the cervical and lumbar spine is not available.\u201d SAIF asserts that, in the absence of \u201cobjective medical evidence,\u201d no award of chronic condition impairment is authorized. SAIF reasons that Kane\u2019s statement that there is no objective evidence of impairment means that Kane\u2019s opinion concerning chronic condition impairment does not satisfy claimant\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Claimant responds that, as the Supreme Court held in <em>SAIF v. Lewis, </em>335 Or 92, 97, 58 P3d 814 (2002), what the statute requires is medical evidence supported by \u201cobjective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>findings,\u201d which consist of findings that are \u201creproducible, measurable, or observable.\u201d In this case, claimant contends, Kane\u2019s report clearly includes such findings, and the board\u2019s finding to that effect is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">As previously noted, any finding of impairment by an ALJ or the board must be \u201cestablished by medical evidence that is supported by objective findings.\u201d ORS 656.283(7); ORS 656.295(5); <em>see also </em>ORS 656.726(4)(f)(B) (\u201cImpairment is established by a preponderance of medical evidence based upon objective findings.\u201d). Further, when a medical arbiter is used on reconsideration, \u201cimpairment is established based on objective findings of the medical arbiter.\u201d OAR 436-035-0007(5). ORS 656.005(19), in turn, defines \u201cobjective findings\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\u201c \u2018Objective findings\u2019 in support of medical evidence are verifiable indications of injury or disease that may include, but are not limited to, range of motion, atrophy, muscle strength and palpable muscle spasm. \u2018Objective findings\u2019 does not include physical findings or subjective responses to physical examinations that are not reproducible, measurable or observable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In this case, it is not disputed that Kane\u2019s opinion that claimant suffers from impairment is \u201cmedical evidence.\u201d <em>See Lewis, </em>335 Or at 97 (\u201cThe opinion of a medical expert * * * qualifies as \u2018medical evidence\u2019 under the statute.\u201d). The dispute concerns whether Kane\u2019s opinion provides \u201cobjective findings\u201d on which a finding of impairment can be based. The board concluded that Kane\u2019s statement that claimant \u201cis significantly limited in his ability to repetitively use the cervical and lumbar spine regions\u201d (underlining in original) is itself an \u201cobjective finding\u201d on which to base a finding of impairment. In SAIF\u2019s view, that statement is merely a description of an impairment that must be independently verifiable. Further, SAIF asserts, there is no documentation in the medical report that supports the conclusion that Kane\u2019s finding is independently verifiable, especially in light of Kane\u2019s own statement that there is no \u201cobjective evidence\u201d of claimant\u2019s impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">In determining whether Kane\u2019s report is sufficient to support a finding of impairment, we draw assistance from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Lewis </em>of the meaning of the term \u201cobjective findings\u201d as it is defined in ORS 656.005(19). The court began by addressing the first sentence of the definition, which states that \u201cobjective findings in support of medical evidence are verifiable indications of injury or disease that may include, but are not limited to, range of motion, atrophy, muscle strength and palpable muscle spasm.\u201d The court explained that, in light of dictionary definitions of \u201cverifiable\u201d and \u201cindications,\u201d the legislature apparently intended the phrase \u201cobjective findings in support of medical evidence\u201d to refer to \u201csymptoms that indicate the probable presence of injury or disease.\u201d In addition, the court said, \u201cthe indication of injury or disease must be <em>capable </em>of being \u2018verified,\u2019 that is, be susceptible to the possibility that a reference to empirical facts either theoretically or actually will prove the claim of injury or disease to be true or false.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>335 Or at 98. (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The court noted, further, that the statutory context of the dispute \u201cwill determine the legal and factual issues that medical evidence supported by objective findings must address.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99. When, for example, the issue at the hearing concerns not compensability, but the extent of permanent disability, \u201cthen the medical evidence supported by objective findings logically must be sufficient to support a finding of fact that the disability not only existed, but has become permanent.\u201d Id at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The court then turned to the second sentence of the statutory definition of \u201cobjective findings,\u201d explaining that objective findings must include either physical findings or subjective responses to physical examinations \u201cthat are \u2018reproducible, measurable or observable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99. The court said that \u201cany one of those characteristics, if established, will serve to qualify a physical finding or a subjective response to a physical examination as a verifiable indication of injury or disease that will constitute an \u2018objective finding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the court explained, the statutory definition of \u201cobjective findings</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">\u201cdoes not prescribe a particular diagnostic methodology for making an objective finding about an injury or disease or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>determining whether one of those characteristics is present. For example, the statute does not address how a health care professional must conduct an examination or form a diagnosis of a claimant\u2019s injury or disease. The definition simply anticipates that the person who makes the objective finding will determine, in some medically acceptable way, whether the claimant had or has an indication of injury or disease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 100. Finally, the court explained, whether a particular finding by a medical professional has the characteristics of being \u201creproducible, measurable or observable\u201d is a question of fact, subject to appellate review for substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">We turn to the disposition of this case. Although the court in <em>Lewis </em>considered the definition of \u201cobjective findings\u201d in the context of determining the compensability of a claim, the same analysis applies in the context of determining impairment. <em>Id. </em>at 98; <em>SAIF v. Drury, </em>202 Or App 14, 24, 121 P3d 664 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 359 (2006). We readily conclude that Kane\u2019s opinion that claimant is significantly limited in his ability to repetitively use the cervical and lumbar spine regions is an \u201cobjective finding\u201d that supports the board\u2019s finding of chronic condition impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\"> OAR 436-035-0019(1) provides, in part: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Kane\u2019s report shows that he based his opinion on a review of claimant\u2019s medical records and on his observations of claimant\u2019s subjective responses during a physical examination. Kane\u2019s finding complies with the court\u2019s observation in <em>Lewis </em>that the requirement for objective findings \u201csimply anticipates that the person who makes the objective finding will determine, in some medically acceptable way, whether the claimant had or has an indication of injury or disease.\u201d 335 Or at 100.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number><em>\u201cA </em>worker is entitled to a 5% chronic condition impairment value for each applicable body part, when a preponderance of medical opinion establishes that, due to a chronic and permanent medical condition, the worker is significantly limited in the repetitive use of one or more of the following body parts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">\u201c(e) Cervical;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">\u201c(h) Lower back [.] \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-12\">Thus, in the context of a chronic condition impairment, the \u201cobjective finding\u201d in support of a finding of impairment is that the worker is \u201csignificantly limited in the repetitive use\u201d of the relevant body part. As the court stated in <em>Lewis, </em>no specific methodology is required for making \u201cobjective findings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Finally, we address SAIF\u2019s concern that, despite Kane\u2019s statement that claimant is significantly limited in the repetitive use of his back, an interpretation of Kane\u2019s opinion as supporting a finding of impairment cannot be reconciled with the expert\u2019s own statement that claimant\u2019s impairment is not measurable by \u201cobjective evidence.\u201d The board, in affirming the ALJ, reasoned that in using the term \u201cobjective evidence,\u201d Kane was not referring to an absence of \u201cobjective findings,\u201d as required to support a finding of impairment under the statutes. Rather, the board explained, the statement reasonably can be interpreted as a comment on Kane\u2019s inability to make objective measurements in light of claimant\u2019s pain responses. The order further explained that a determination that a worker is \u201csignificantly limited\u201d need not, like range of motion or loss of strength, depend on measurements by a scale or degrees, but that it may be based on the medical expert\u2019s judgment, based on observation, and that Kane\u2019s finding that claimant was significantly limited in the ability to repetitively use the cervical and lumbar regions of his back satisfied that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The board\u2019s interpretation of Kane\u2019s opinion reconciles what would otherwise be a stark contradiction with Kane\u2019s finding of impairment, and we conclude that it is a reasonable one. Further, the board\u2019s explanation is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cobjective findings\u201d in <em>Lewis. </em>Finally, we conclude that the board\u2019s finding, based on Kane\u2019s report, that claimant suffers from chronic condition impairment is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Weckesser v. Jet Delivery Systems, </em>132 Or App 325, 888 P2d 127 (1995) (record that contains a medical opinion from which it can be found that the worker is unable to repetitively use a body part due to a chronic and permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>medical condition supports an award for chronic condition impairment).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\"> OAR 436-035-0007(12) provides that when findings are determined to be invalid, the findings receive a value of zero.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
