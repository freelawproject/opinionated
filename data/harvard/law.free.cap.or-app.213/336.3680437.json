He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence of the arrest captured on an audiotape. The prosecution stipulated that the arresting officer did not inform defendant that the encounter was being recorded; according to defendant, that fact alone required suppression of the tape containing the recorded information as well as the arresting officer\u2019s testimony regarding the contents of the tape. The state maintains that, because the officer both recorded the conversation and participated in it, suppression of his testimony was not required. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The following facts are undisputed. Oregon State Trooper Glass stopped defendant because his license plate light was not working and because the officer saw defendant\u2019s car drift across the center line several times. After detecting the smell of alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath, Glass asked defendant to perform field sobriety tests. He agreed to the testing and failed. Glass then informed defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, after which defendant made inculpatory statements in response to Glass\u2019s questioning. The entire encounter was recorded by Glass, but Glass did not inform defendant of that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Defendant moved to suppress the tape recording and any testimony by Glass about the recording\u2019s content. In support of the motion, defendant\u2019s counsel submitted an affidavit stating that, in a telephone conversation, Glass informed him that he had \u201crelied in part upon the video/audio tape in preparation to write his police report in this case,\u201d and that he \u201csat and watched and listened to the video/audio tape with [the prosecutor] as they prepared for the hearing on the motion to suppress.\u201d The state agreed not to offer the tape itself, but opposed the motion with respect to the trooper\u2019s testimony. The court found as fact that Glass \u201creviewed the video and audio recording before preparing his police report, and later in preparation for his testimony at the suppression hearing.\u201d The court also found as fact that \u201c[t]he recording was not the sole source of the information obtained by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>police officer.\u201d Based primarily on those facts, the court concluded that the testimony was admissible. Defendant was subsequently tried and convicted; the record before us, however, does not contain the trial transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Defendant has two theories to support his argument for suppression. The first relies entirely on ORS 165.540. That statute prohibits recording a conversation without the knowledge of all participants, using that recording, and divulging its contents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">\u201c(1) Except as otherwise provided * * * a person may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">\u201c(c) Obtain or attempt to obtain the whole or any part of a conversation by means of any device, contrivance, machine or apparatus, whether electrical, mechanical, manual or otherwise, if not all participants in the conversation are specifically informed that their conversation is being obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">\u00ab\u00edj? # \u00edf\u00ed \u00ed|\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">\u201c(e) Use or attempt to use, or divulge to others, any conversation, telecommunication or radio communication obtained by any means prohibited by this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">In <em>State v. Carston, </em>323 Or 75, 85, 913 P2d 709 (1996), the Supreme Court held that paragraph (e) required suppression of \u201call the evidence that was derived, directly or indirectly, from the information\u201d obtained in violation of paragraph (c); according to the court, the legislature\u2019s intent to require suppression is \u201cclear.\u201d Thus, defendant argues, ORS 165.540(1)(e), especially as construed by <em>Carston, </em>unambiguously requires suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">The state disagrees. It argues that, under ORS 136.432(1) to (3), which became effective after <em>Carston, </em>we are powerless to suppress relevant evidence unless suppression is required by the United States or Oregon constitutions, the \u201crules of evidence governing privileges and the admissions of hearsay,\u201d or the rights of the press. However, we held in <em>State v. Thompson-Seed, </em>162 Or App 483, 489, 986 P2d 732 (1999), that ORS 136.432 did not repeal existing exclusionary statutes; rather, it only \u201cconstrains the courts from creating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>rules of exclusion where the legislature itself has not created them.\u201d Further, in <em>State v. Chipman, </em>176 Or App 284, 294, 31 P3d 478 (2001), we held that the legislative creation of exclusionary rules did not need to be express; if, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the court concludes that the legislature intended that violation of a statute result in suppression, courts have to give effect to that intention notwithstanding ORS 136.432. The Supreme Court held in <em>Carston </em>that the legislature clearly intended the suppression of information \u201cderived directly or indirectly\u201d from a violation of ORS 165.540. 323 Or at 85. That statute and its suppression remedy therefore survive ORS 136.432. We therefore reject the state\u2019s first argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The state also argues that, under <em>State v. Jones, </em>339 Or 438, 121 P3d 657 (2005), even if the trooper violated ORS 165.540(1)(c) \u2014 which the state does not concede \u2014 and even if, for that reason, the recording itself and information derived from it are inadmissible, the trooper\u2019s testimony, to the extent that it derives not from the recording itself but from the trooper\u2019s independent recollection of the recorded events, is not. We agree. In <em>Jones, </em>police violated ORS 165.540(1)(c) by recording part of an interview with the defendant without his knowledge. The court held that the <em>recording </em>of that part of the interview had to be suppressed, but not the <em>testimony </em>of the officers who conducted the interview. That information, the court explained, did not derive from unlawful action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">\u201c[T]he interviewing officers\u2019 testimony concerned their own knowledge of defendant\u2019s identity and statements. The officers did not acquire their knowledge of defendant\u2019s identity through videotaping him; neither did they hear defendant\u2019s statements through the use of any device. Put differently, the officers\u2019 knowledge of defendant\u2019s identity or statements did not arise by virtue of any interception activity, but through their direct participation in the communication. That participation occurred simultaneous to, but independent of, the videotaping; the relationship between the two was temporal and nothing more.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Thus, even if the trooper\u2019s act of recording defendant\u2019s arrest was unlawful, testimony regarding that arrest is nonetheless admissible if the testimony is \u201cindependent of\u2019 the illegality. Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\">\u201cwhen a defendant seeks to suppress evidence on a theory that the evidence derives from * * * some earlier constitutional violation by government agents, * * * the defendant [ ] [has the] burden * * * of establishing a \u2018factual nexus\u2019 between the unlawful police conduct and the challenged evidence \u2014 at a minimum, the existence of a \u2018but-for\u2019 relationship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\"><em>State v. Johnson, </em>335 Or 511, 520, 73 P3d 282 (2003) (citations omitted). Defendant has not done so here. Although he produced an affidavit of counsel quoting the trooper as stating that \u201che relied in part upon the video/audio tape in preparation to write his police report in this case,\u201d the trial court found as fact that \u201c[t]he recording was not the sole source of the information obtained by the police officer.\u201d From those statements, we cannot conclude that defendant has carried his burden, because we cannot determine the extent to which the trooper\u2019s testimony \u201crelied on\u201d the recording, or the extent to which a source other than the recording \u2014 that is, the trooper\u2019s independent recollection \u2014 accounted for the testimony. To meet that burden, defendant would at least have to establish a but-for connection between the recording and the trooper\u2019s testimony. Defendant not only fails to establish that connection, he fails even to produce the testimony in question. Indeed, because he failed to ensure that the record before this court contained the transcript of the trial, as was his responsibility, <em>State v. Lemon, </em>251 Or 606, 447 P2d 394, <em>cert den, </em>393 US 1004 (1968), he fails to demonstrate even that the trooper testified. <em>See also Jones, </em>339 Or at 449 (declining to reach suppression issue where the record does not \u201creflect whether the officers relied on their review of suppressed parts of the videotapes and, if so, to what extent\u201d). We therefore conclude that defendant cannot prevail on his argument that ORS 165.540(1)(e) requires suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">For the same reason, his argument that suppression is required by ORS 41.910(1), which provides, \u201cEvidence of the contents of any wire or oral communication intercepted * * * [i]n violation of ORS 165.540 shall not be admissible in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>any court of this state, except as evidence of unlawful interception\u201d cannot prevail. Defendant, on the record before us, has not presented any evidence that the testimony he sought to have suppressed derived from the violation of ORS 165.540 and not the trooper\u2019s independent memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
