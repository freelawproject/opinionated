On the assault conviction, the trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment, based on the court\u2019s findings that defendant was on supervision at the time of the offense and that defendant had permanently injured the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">On appeal, defendant makes several assignments of error relating to the trial court\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of evidence and to the instructions the court gave to the jury. We reject all of those assignments without discussion. Defendant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s imposition of a departure sentence. He argues that the sentence violated his right to a jury trial as articulated in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), because it was based on facts that were not admitted by him or found by a jury. Although he did not advance such a challenge below, he argues that the sentence should be reviewed as plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The state acknowledges that, under <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>205 Or App 113, 133 P3d 343, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>207 Or App 1, 139 P3d 981 (2006), <em>rev allowed, </em>342 Or 256 (2007), defendant\u2019s sentence was plainly erroneous. The state also argues, however, that <em>Ramirez </em>was incorrectly decided. We decline to reconsider our decision <em>in Ramirez. </em>Under that decision, imposition of the departure sentence was plain error, and the proper disposition is to vacate defendant\u2019s sentences and remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Sentences vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
