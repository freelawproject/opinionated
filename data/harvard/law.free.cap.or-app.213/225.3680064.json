Appellant contends that the court erred in finding that she was afflicted with a mental disorder at the time of the commitment hearing and that the disorder caused her to be a danger to herself. On <em>de novo </em>review, <em>State v. R. H., </em>212 Or App 479, 481, 157 P3d 1286 (2007), we conclude that there was insufficient evidence that appellant posed a danger to herself and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">ORS 426.130(1) authorizes an order of commitment if the court determines that a person is \u201c[m]entally ill, based upon clear and convincing evidence\u201d and is unlikely to willingly participate in treatment on a voluntary basis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For this purpose, ORS 426.005(1)(d)(A) defines \u201cmentally ill person,\u201d among other things, as \u201ca person who, because of a mental disorder\u201d is \u201c[d]angerous to self or others.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The issues on appeal are whether the state proved by clear and convincing evidence that appellant had a mental disorder and whether that disorder caused her to be dangerous to herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The facts at the time of the commitment hearing are probative. <em>State v. North, </em>189 Or App 518, 520, 76 P3d 685 (2003). Appellant was a 43-year-old woman with a history of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>mental disorders and drug abuse. For a number of years during her childhood, appellant was sexually abused by an acquaintance of her mother. She continued to suffer effects from that sexual abuse, experiencing depression, recurring nightmares, and \u201cflashbacks\u201d about that abuse. Appellant was diagnosed as having post-traumatic stress disorder because of that history. Five years before the commitment hearing, appellant had been hospitalized for treatment of that disorder, but had ended her hospital treatment prematurely and against the recommendation of her doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Appellant\u2019s drug abuse was extensive. For many years, she regularly smoked marijuana. During the six to eight years before the hearing, appellant habitually used Soma, a muscle relaxant, taking up to 40 tablets each day. That abuse led to three criminal charges of driving -under the influence of intoxicants, suspension of her driving privileges, and a credit card fraud claim from purchasing Soma on the Internet. Appellant\u2019s excessive use of Soma grew more acute in the months before the commitment hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Appellant became incapacitated by her addiction to Soma. She was not eating and lost 56 pounds in the three months prior to the hearing. Her drug use made her confused, frightened, and tearful. It impaired appellant\u2019s memory and inhibited ordinary conversation. Under the influence of some drug, she fell down frequently and was bruised.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Appellant had been suicidal in the past. She first began to contemplate suicide when she was 20 years old and since then had had \u201cnumerous past suicide attempts.\u201d Appellant was hospitalized in May 2004 for an overdose of prescription medication. That overdose may have been an attempted suicide. Appellant attempted suicide in early 2005 through an overdose of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The evidence is conflicting on the event that triggered the commitment process. Dr. Khaleeq, a physician who examined appellant at Eastern Oregon Psychiatric Center (EOPC), testified at the hearing. In his notice of mental illness emergency hospitalization and written admission history, Khaleeq concluded that appellant had overdosed in a suicide attempt on August 15, 2005. The report of the mental health examiner notes the same attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>On the other hand, appellant testified she did not attempt to commit suicide at that time. Appellant\u2019s friend, Lindley, testified that she did not believe that appellant attempted suicide. The mental health investigator\u2019s examination determined that appellant\u2019s most recent suicide attempt was some months earlier. Appellant had ingested between 30 and 40 Soma tablets that day, but that consumption may not have been for purposes of killing herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">There is no dispute that appellant was contemplating suicide and called Lindley on August 15, 2005, to seek help. Appellant testified that the suicidal thoughts were prompted by her recent discovery that her molester had abused someone else. Appellant spent the night at Lindley\u2019s home, recovering from using Soma. The next day, appellant told Lindley that she was \u201chaving some bad thoughts again\u201d and that \u201cshe needs help with her addiction.\u201d Appellant called a crisis center. Appellant, Lindley, and another friend went to the emergency room of the local hospital for treatment. The two friends then accompanied appellant to EOPC, where she was admitted voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Appellant\u2019s condition improved during her hospitalization. The staff noted that she was \u201ccooperative\u201d and \u201cpleasant\u201d with staff and the other patients. Her appetite and ease of sleeping improved. By August 22, appellant concluded that she should be in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program and that she was hospitalized \u201cbecause I took too much Soma and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t die.\u201d That same day, an attending physician concluded that the appellant \u201cneeds treatment readiness work,\u201d but was a \u201cminimal short-term risk for completed suicide, but moderate chronic risk,\u201d and needed an \u201caddictions oriented disposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The commitment hearing occurred on August 23. There was equivocal testimony at the commitment hearing on the nature of appellant\u2019s mental illness and whether she posed a risk to herself at that time. Khaleeq discussed his initial examination of appellant at EOPC, and his conclusion that she suffered from a post-traumatic stress disorder because of the flashbacks and nightmares. He testified,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>\u201cI think her problem is actually substance dependency, which is (inaudible), especially if she was taking barbiturates. Sonol does have a component of barbiturate, and is sometimes life-threatening situation. People when they\u2019re overdosing on Sonol, it can be a life-threatening situation, and that was my concern, so I placed her on some (inaudible) just to avoid any withdrawal problems.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Based on his examination of appellant\u2019s past medical records, Khaleeq stated that he \u201chad the impression that she was probably depressed at some point * * This examination by the state\u2019s attorney then followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">\u201c [STATE]: How does the \u2014 she obviously has some substance abuse issues. How does that tie with the actual mental illness that we\u2019re dealing with here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">\u201c[KHALEEQ]: Sometimes when people suffer from a mood disorder, like depression, anxiety, or PTSD, they try to self-medicate and it\u2019s from alcohol or with different drugs to make themselves calm. So I was under the impression that she\u2019s been suffering from this trauma for awhile, so I think that\u2019s the only way she can fight to make herself feel better.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">\u201c[STATE]: Now, if she were able to be in a situation, either inpatient or outpatient, where she\u2019s dealing with her substance abuse issues, is that alone going to be enough to mean that she\u2019s no longer a danger to herself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">\u201c[KHALEEQ]: Well, I think right now she\u2019s not a danger to herself, and she has a really good understanding. In fact, from day one, she told me that she knows there\u2019s a problem and she needs help for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">\u201cBut, looking at her history, she left the hospital against medical advice twice in the past, and I have a feeling that she won\u2019t go for further treatment. So I\u2019m not exactly sure if she\u2019s going to follow through this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">\u201c[STATE]: You testified that she\u2019s not a danger to herself, in your opinion, at this moment. In your opinion, if she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>is to not be committed here today, if she\u2019s to leave the hospital, to a reasonable medical probability, will she deteriorate such that she is again a danger to herself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\">\u201c[KHALEEQ]: If she starts taking Sonol again and trying to overdose, as she was telling me that she takes 30 to 45 pills a day as a routine, so I\u2019m not sure her judgment would stay the same as you see her today, and she may get into a difficult situation, plus her history when she left the hospital against medical advice twice makes me wonder if she can comply with the treatment this time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">When pressed on the point again, on the \u201cdegree of certainty\u2019 that appellant would become a danger to herself without commitment, Khaleeq stated that he \u201cstill [has] some doubts\u201d as to whether she would obtain voluntary treatment. He later testified that appellant \u201cprobably\u2019 would be a danger to herself in the future, but that, if she obtained voluntary treatment, \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Under questioning from appellant\u2019s counsel, Khaleeq responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">\u201c[COUNSEL]: Is there anything that she \u2014 is there any lifesaving, I guess, concern that \u2014 if we assume that she\u2019s a danger to herself under your assumption, that she couldn\u2019t get at a drug inpatient treatment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">\u201c[KHALEEQ]: Well, I think she\u2019s willing to go to an inpatient drug treatment. If she continues that, then I have no problem with accepting that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">\u201c[COUNSEL]: So the only reason, just to clarify, that you believe she\u2019s a danger to herself is that she\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">\u201c[KHALEEQ]: Her history.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-11\">\u201c[COUNSEL]: \u2014is her history, and in the future, she might start taking drugs again, which might induce this mood disorder, which might then induce the post-traumatic stress, which might then lead to a suicide attempt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-12\">\u201c[KHALEEQ]: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">When asked whether appellant needed to be committed to effectively treat her post- traumatic stress disorder, Khaleeq testified that \u201cher insight seems a little better, and I think she is willing to seek help voluntarily, and I think she should be okay * *</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Khaleeq revealed that appellant had told him that she wanted to be committed \u201cbecause she has a tendency not to follow through with treatment,\u201d but that she changed her mind after speaking with her attorney. The medical investigator testified that appellant \u201chad specifically requested that we seek a commitment for her * * *. She asked us because she had said that she would probably walk if we did not go ahead and seek commitment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">There was evidence that appellant was disposed and able to seek drug addiction treatment outside the confines of a mental health hospital. Appellant was a member of a women\u2019s mental health support group with Lindley and others. Lindley stated that she would help appellant in attending a voluntary drug treatment center. For a number of weeks immediately prior to the commitment hearing, appellant attended counseling sessions at New Horizons treatment center. She regularly had been seeing a psychologist every other week for almost three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Lindley testified that \u201cwe\u2019ve talked about [appellant\u2019s drug abuse when she was] sober, that she wants to get help and that she knows she needs it, and she knows of her addiction.\u201d Appellant testified that she wanted help in getting assistance with her drug abuse, that she wanted to do a voluntary drug inpatient treatment, and was prepared to \u201cstay someplace long-term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court determined that appellant suffered from a mental illness and committed her to the Mental Health Division for a period not to exceed 180 days. Based on appellant\u2019s prior experience in ending two hospitalizations against doctors\u2019 orders, the court found that appellant was not willing and able to participate in treatment on a voluntary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">On appeal, appellant claims that the state failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that she had a mental disorder and that the disorder caused her to be a danger to herself. We conclude that there was insufficient evidence that appellant\u2019s mental condition caused her to be a danger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>to herself and do not decide whether the state met its burden on establishing her mental disorder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Under ORS 426.130(1)(d), the state has the burden to prove by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that appellant\u2019s mental disorder caused her to be either a danger to herself or others, or unable to care for her basic needs. That standard of proof requires evidence that is of \u201cextraordinary persuasiveness\u201d and that makes the fact at issue \u201chighly probable.\u201d <em>State v. Allen, </em>209 Or App 647, 652, 149 P3d 289 (2006); <em>State v. Hambleton, </em>202 Or App 526, 533-34, 123 P3d 370 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In order to establish that appellant is a danger to herself, the state must show that her mental disorder has \u201cresulted in harm to [her] self * * * or created situations likely to result in harm.\u201d <em>State v. Christofferson, </em>47 Or App 1087, 1090, 615 P2d 1152 (1980). The likelihood of harm need not be immediate but \u201cmust exist in the near future.\u201d <em>State v. Jacobson, </em>142 Or App 371, 377, 922 P2d 670 (1996). That proof cannot be speculative or conjectural. <em>See State v. Ayala, </em>164 Or App 399, 404, 991 P2d 1100 (1999) (\u201cApprehensions, speculations and conjecture are not sufficient to prove a need for mental commitment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The expert opinion about the potential of future harm to appellant was equivocal. The treatment records of an attending physician stated that appellant was a \u201cminimal short-term risk for completed suicide, but moderate chronic risk.\u201d Khaleeq, the state\u2019s chief witness, opined that appellant was not currently a danger to herself, but that he had \u201ca feeling\u201d that she would not attend future treatment sessions, so that he was \u201cnot exactly sure if she\u2019s going to follow through this time.\u201d When pressed for a \u201creasonable medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>probability\u201d of appellant\u2019s potential deterioration, he stated that appellant\u2019s history \u201cmakes me wonder if she can comply with the treatment this time\u201d and that he \u201cstill [had] some doubts.\u201d Nevertheless, Khaleeq ultimately opined that \u201cshe is willing to seek help voluntarily, and I think she should be okay * * The mental health examiner\u2019s report concluded only that, without hospitalization, appellant\u2019s \u201cchance of success in completing alcohol &amp; drug treatment will be reduced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">That evidence of danger to appellant is not extraordinarily persuasive. Khaleeq testified that appellant was not a risk to herself at the time of the hearing. Appellant stated she had no intention of hurting herself in the future. Khaleeq\u2019s \u201cdoubt\u201d about appellant\u2019s fortitude in continuing treatment for drug abuse does not constitute clear and convincing evidence of appellant\u2019s danger to herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In light of the equivocal testimony about probable future harm, we cannot say that the state discharged its burden of proof to show likelihood of future harm by clear and convincing evidence. Given that conclusion, there is no need to resolve appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, that the state failed to show the existence of a mental disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-7\"> ORS 426.130(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">\u201cAfter hearing all of the evidence, and reviewing the findings of the examining persons, the court shall determine whether the person is mentally ill.
