The Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) issued a final order concluding that petitioners had mixed, served, or sold alcoholic beverages without a license, in violation of ORS 471.360(1)(b), and that, on each of two occasions, they had conducted a \u201cdrinking contest\u201d of alcoholic beverages, in violation of OAR 845-006-0345(11)(c). Petitioners seek judicial review of the order, contending that, for various reasons, OLCC erred in concluding that they conducted drinking contests in violation of OAR 845-006-0345(11)(c). We review for substantial evidence, substantial reason, and errors of law. ORS 183.482(8)(a), (c); <em>Drew v. PSRB, </em>322 Or 491,499-500, 909 P2d 1211 (1996). We reverse and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Unless otherwise noted, the following pertinent facts are taken from the record and from OLCC\u2019s order and are undisputed. Petitioners operate the Downtown Deli and Greek Cusina in Portland. The restaurant features authentic Greek decor, food, language, music, dancing, and entertainment that incorporates Greek traditions. On weekend nights, petitioner Papas acts as a master of ceremonies for a stage show, which includes traditional Greek activities such as breaking plates, dancing, and drinking ouzo, a Greek liqueur. Patrons who are celebrating special occasions are invited to participate in a competition in which Papas places his finger over the pour spout of an unlabeled bottle of ouzo and \u201cdrizzles\u201d or \u201cdribbles\u201d the liqueur directly into participants\u2019 mouths while the crowd counts. A count of 30 results in the participant receiving about half a shot of ouzo; the highest count any participant in the competition has ever achieved is 90. The participants are not charged for the ouzo that they drink during the competition. OLCC found that Papas \u201ctries to provide a fun atmosphere with the ouzo contest, not to induce more drinking.\u201d Petitioners have been providing the described entertainment at the restaurant for 18 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Effective April 1, 2003, OLCC adopted a rule prohibiting what it describes as \u201chigh volume drinking practices.\u201d As pertinent here, OAR 845-006-0345(ll)(c) prohibits</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\u201c[c]onducting, operating, organizing, or promoting any \u2018drinking contest\u2019 or \u2018drinking game\u2019 that is designed to increase consumption at an extraordinary speed, or in increased quantities, or in a more potent form.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">According <em>to the </em>advisory committee that was appointed for the rulemaking proceeding, the rule was intended to address \u201cfree-pouring\u201d of alcohol into a person\u2019s mouth and drinking games in which a person does not have control of her consumption, in which the reward is a shot of alcohol, or in which the quantity of alcohol consumed is itself the contest. However, the rule as adopted did not include any definitions or illustrations of prohibited conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In March 2004, after OLCC received an anonymous complaint, two OLCC compliance inspectors went to petitioners\u2019 restaurant to determine whether petitioners were conducting drinking contests. The investigators observed petitioner Papas asking patrons whether they were there for special occasions and escorting seven patrons to the dance floor of the restaurant, where they stood in a line facing the crowd. Papas stood on a chair and, holding a bottle of ouzo, poured directly into each participant\u2019s mouth until the participant signaled for him to stop. While Papas was pouring, the crowd cheered and counted; the patron who continued drinking for the longest count won a T-shirt. The investigators did not see any visibly intoxicated patrons or any minors on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Two months later, OLCC issued a notice of proposed license suspension and civil penalty. After petitioners requested a hearing, OLCC again sent compliance inspectors to the restaurant. The inspectors again observed Papas carry out the described conduct, this time with five patrons. A few days later, when the inspectors met with Papas, he disagreed that the activity constituted a \u201cdrinking contest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The requested hearing was held before an administrative law judge (ALJ) from the Office of Administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Hearings. OLCC\u2019s witnesses included its rules coordinator, Hilton, and three inspectors. Petitioner Papas testified on behalf of petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">In November 2004, the ALJ issued a proposed order in which he concluded that petitioners had served alcoholic beverages without a valid service permit in violation of ORS 471.360(1)(b), but that the preponderance of the evidence did not show that petitioners had conducted a drinking contest in violation of OAR 845-006-0345(11)(c). The ALJ imposed a civil penalty of a 12-day license suspension or a fine of $1,980 in lieu of suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The following month, OLCC remanded the order to the ALJ for consideration of a constitutional challenge to OAR 845-006-0345(11)(c) that petitioners had raised previously, which had not been addressed in the prior order. On remand, petitioners contended that the rule is unconstitutionally vague in violation of Article I, sections 20 and 21, of the Oregon Constitution because it does not define or provide notice of what conduct is prohibited. OLCC responded that petitioners\u2019 \u201cfair notice\u201d argument is not cognizable under either constitutional provision. In June 2005, the ALJ issued an amended proposed order, again concluding that petitioners had violated ORS 471.360(1)(b), concluding that they had failed to demonstrate that OAR 845-006-0345(11)(c) was constitutionally infirm, and again concluding that petitioners had not violated that rule in any event. The ALJ again imposed a suspension or, alternatively, a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In August 2005, OLCC adopted in part and modified in part the ALJ\u2019s amended proposed order and issued its final order in the case. As pertinent here, OLCC concluded that, on the two occasions observed by the inspectors, petitioners had violated OAR 845-006-0345(11)(c). OLCC explained that the relevant conduct constituted a \u201ccontest\u201d that had the \u201cobject\u201d of \u201cconsum[ing] the greatest amount of alcohol of all the contestants,\u201d that involved the declaration of a winner who was awarded a prize, and that involved \u201c \u2018increased quantities\u2019 due to the unlimited nature of the consumption\u201d of the alcohol, regardless of whether the alcohol was \u201cdribbled\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>poured in a steady stream. OLCC increased the total suspension of petitioners\u2019 license to 60 days or, alternatively, a suspension of four days and a fine of $9,240.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">As noted, in their sole assignment of error on judicial review, petitioners assert that OLCC erred in various respects in concluding that they violated OAR 845-006-0345(11)(c). Relying on <em>Cottrell v. OLCC, </em>27 Or App 525, 556 P2d 982 (1976), and <em>Sun Ray Dairy, Inc. v. OLCC, </em>16 Or App 63, 517 P2d 289 (1973), petitioners first contend that the rule is invalid and unenforceable because it fails to define the prohibited conduct and therefore provides no guidance for its application. Petitioners note that, at the hearing, OLCC\u2019s own rules coordinator, Hilton, was unable to tell the ALJ what constituted \u201cextraordinary speed\u201d in consuming alcohol or, as relevant to OLCC\u2019s conclusion in this case, how persons subject to the rule should understand what \u201cincreased quantity\u2019 means.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Next, petitioners contend that there is no evidence that the conduct at issue was \u201cdesigned\u201d to \u201cincrease consumption\u201d of alcohol \u201cin increased quantities.\u201d Petitioners point to OLCC\u2019s own findings in its final order that the conduct here was \u201cdesigned to duplicate Greek traditions\u201d and that petitioners\u2019 purpose was \u201cto provide a fun atmosphere * * *, not to induce more drinking.\u201d According to petitioners, those findings are consistent with the evidence in the hearing; by contrast, OLCC\u2019s apparent conclusion that the conduct was \u201cdesigned\u201d to increase consumption is not. Petitioners particularly point to evidence that the ouzo used in the entertainment was provided free and that petitioners therefore have no incentive to increase the quantities consumed, that no customer had ever participated in the entertainment in order to receive a prize, and that no participant ever showed signs of intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Finally, petitioners contend that OLCC\u2019s final order lacks substantial reason \u2014 that the commission\u2019s conclusion that petitioners violated OAR 845-006-0345(11)(c) is not rationally related to its own factual findings. Specifically, petitioners challenge OLCC\u2019s reasoning that the contest involved \u201cincreased quantities\u201d because of the \u201cunlimited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>nature of the consumption.\u201d According to petitioners, \u201cunlimited consumption\u201d is not itself prohibited by the rule; petitioners also point out that, in any event, there is no evidence of any baseline amount against which the quantities consumed constituted an \u201cincrease.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">OLCC responds that petitioners\u2019 challenge to the validity of the rule properly should be considered a challenge to OLCC\u2019s interpretation of its own rule, which, OLCC contends, is entitled to deference under <em>Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com. v. Energy Facility Siting, </em>320 Or 132,142, 881 P2d 119 (1994). It first contends that, consistently with <em>Trebesch v. Employment Division, </em>300 Or 264, 710 P2d 136 (1985), it properly construed the rule in the context of issuing the final order in this case and that, having done so and in the absence of any statutory directive to engage in additional rulemaking, further definition of the terms used in the rule was not necessary. OLCC also contends that, to the extent that petitioners assert that it has applied the rule inconsistently with other applications, there is no evidence to support that assertion; according to OLCC, the rule is relatively new, the record does not demonstrate that it has been applied in other cases, and nothing in the record suggests that OLCC will apply it differently in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">OLCC argues that, in any event, the meaning of OAR 845-006-0345(ll)(c) is readily determined from its text. In particular, OLCC asserts that, as a matter of plain meaning, a \u201ccontest\u201d is a competition with a winner, and whether a drinking contest is \u201cdesigned\u201d to increase alcohol consumption depends on the rules of the contest, not on the subjective intent of the person conducting it or the \u201cultimate effect\u201d of the contest. OLCC contends, moreover, that its rule need not be so specific that it necessarily notifies a licensee that its particular conduct is unlawful. Rather, relying on <em>McCann v. OLCC, </em>27 Or App 487, 556 P2d 973 (1976), OLCC contends that, when decisional criteria are set out in general terms, the reviewing court looks to the decision itself for a rational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>exposition of the facts and of the reasoning that leads from the facts to the conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">According to OLCC, that rational connection exists here. Specifically, OLCC contends that, where it plausibly and properly has construed OAR 845-006-0345(11)(c) to focus on the rules of a drinking contest and, in addition, to prohibit the free pouring of alcohol into a person\u2019s mouth; where substantial evidence in the record demonstrates that the rules of the contest at issue here included providing ouzo for free, telling contestants that they would win by consuming more ouzo than other competitors, and encouraging them to drink ouzo continuously while the other patrons counted; and where substantial evidence in the record also demonstrates that the contests at issue were conducted in accordance with those rules, substantial reason supports OLCC\u2019s conclusion that the contests violated OAR 845-006-0345(ll)(c) by being \u201cdesigned to increase consumption * * * in increased quantities,\u201d because the rules \u201cencouraged contestants to consume more ouzo at once than they otherwise would.\u201d OLCC also contends that it articulated that reasoning in its order \u201cby emphasizing the competitive nature of the activity that petitioners conducted, and by emphasizing the lack of any restrictions \u2014 financial or otherwise \u2014 on how much ouzo each competitor might consume.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Petitioners reply that they do not contest OLCC\u2019s authority to define the terms used in OAR 845-006-0345(11)(c) by decision rather than by rule; rather, they dispute that OLCC sufficiently did so here. According to petitioners, OLCC merely recited the facts and summarily concluded that those facts constituted violations of the rule. Noting that OLCC never identified any benchmark amount of consumption, petitioners particularly object to OLCC\u2019s conclusion that the contests at issue here involved \u201cincreased consumption\u201d in \u201cincreased quantities.\u201d Petitioners again point to evidence in the record that not even OLCC\u2019s own witnesses were able to explain the meaning of the rule in those respects or its proper application. Petitioners contend that OLCC could have adopted a rule that prohibits all drinking contests or all \u201cfree pouring\u201d but did not do so here and that OLCC erred in concluding that they committed the narrower class of prohibited conduct addressed by the rule. Petitioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>also again note that OLCC\u2019s order itself finds that the contests were \u201cdesigned\u201d to duplicate Greek traditions, \u201cnot to induce more drinking,\u201d and that, as OLCC itself acknowledged, the maximum amount of alcohol ever consumed by a winner was only about one-and-a-half shots. Finally, petitioners dispute that OLCC\u2019s emphasis on the competitive nature of the contests conducted by them was a sufficient articulation of the reasoning leading to its conclusion that petitioners violated the rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">An agency may determine whether the standard established in a rule has been met in a particular instance by interpreting the rule in the course of applying it. <em>Goin v. Employment Dept., </em>203 Or App 758, 763-64, 126 P3d 734 (2006). We defer to the agency\u2019s plausible interpretation of its own rule \u2014 including an interpretation made in the course of applying the rule \u2014 if that interpretation is not inconsistent with the wording of the rule, its context, or any other source of law. <em>Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com., </em>320 Or at 142; <em>Goin, </em>203 Or App at 763-64. Under our substantial reason review of an order in a contested case, we determine whether the agency\u2019s factual findings logically lead to its conclusions of law \u2014 here, the conclusion that petitioners violated OAR 845-006-0345(11)(c). <em>Goin, </em>203 Or App at 763-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In determining that petitioners violated the rule, OLCC in effect interpreted the rule to mean that conduct involving \u201ccompetition\u201d and \u201cfree pouring\u201d constitutes a \u201cdrinking contest [ ] designed to increase consumption\u201d of alcohol \u201cin increased quantities,\u201d regardless of the licensees\u2019 intent in conducting such a contest or any measurement of the amounts consumed during the contest relative to amounts otherwise consumed. We conclude that OLCC\u2019s interpretation of the rule is inconsistent with the wording of the rule and with its context; accordingly, that interpretation is not entitled to this court\u2019s deference under <em>Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com., </em>and we remand for application of a plausible interpretation of the rule to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">We begin with whether OLCC\u2019s interpretation of the rule, as developed and applied in this case, is consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>the rule\u2019s text. Certainly, OLCC\u2019s understanding that the rule applies to \u201ccompetitions\u201d is consistent with the use of the term \u201ccontest\u201d in the rule. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>492 (unabridged ed 2002) (defining the noun \u201ccontest\u201d as a \u201ccompetition\u201d). However, by its terms, the rule refers and applies to specific types of drinking contests: as pertinent here, ones that involve \u201cincreased] consumption * * * in increased quantities\u201d of alcoholic beverages. OLCC\u2019s interpretation and application in this case fail to account for that qualification or to yield any pertinent point of reference in that regard; that is, nothing in OLCC\u2019s interpretation or application of the rule here identifies the consumption or quantities against which the required \u201cincrease\u201d is to be, or was, measured. <em>See Webster\u2019s </em>at 1145 (defining the transitive verb \u201cincrease\u201d as \u201cto make greater in some respect (as in bulk, quantity, extent, value, or amount): add to : enhance\u201d and defining the adjective \u201cincreased\u201d as \u201cmade or become greater\u201d). Thus, OLCC\u2019s proposed interpretation \u2014 that mere competition between participants constitutes conduct violating the rule \u2014 is inconsistent with the latter, qualifying aspects of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Conversely, although OLCC interprets the rule to prohibit \u201cfree pouring,\u201d the rule says nothing about that or any other particular manner of serving or providing alcohol to a patron. Accordingly, OLCC\u2019s interpretation lacks support in the text of the rule in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Finally, OLCC\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201cdesigned\u201d is problematic. The ordinary meaning of the verb \u201cdesign\u201d includes \u201cto conceive and plan out in the mind\u201d; \u201cto plan or have in mind as a purpose : to intend, purpose, contemplate\u201d; \u201cto devise or propose for a specific function\u201d; and \u201cto create, plan, or calculate for serving a predetermined end.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 611. As particularly pertinent here, when used in the passive or participial form, the verb \u201cdesign\u201d means \u201cto plan or produce with special intentional adaptation to a specific end * * *&lt;statutes are <em>~ed </em>to meet * * *&gt;.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Those definitions suggest that a drinking contest is \u201cdesigned to increase consumption * * * in increased quantities\u201d only if that characteristic is the intended purpose of the person devising the contest, not merely a possible or even probable result of the contest\u2019s rules.</p>\n<p id=\"ArD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>We turn to the rule\u2019s context. Another provision of the same rule prohibits a licensee from giving any alcoholic beverage \u201cas a prize, premium, or consideration for any * * * contest * * * or any competition <em>of any kind.\u201d </em>OAR 845-006-0345(8) (emphasis added). The emphasized phrase demonstrates that, when OLCC wishes to refer to all forms of contests without qualification, it knows how to do so. Accordingly, OAR 845-006-0345(8) confirms that OAR 845-006-0345(11)(c) applies only to the particular types of contests described therein: those \u201cdesigned to increase consumption * * * in increased quantities.\u201d OAR 845-006-0345(8) sheds no light, however, on the contours of that category.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">OAR 845-006-0345 was adopted pursuant to OLCC\u2019s authority to enforce ORS chapter 471 (also known as the Liquor Control Act, <em>see </em>ORS 471.027). Accordingly, that chapter also is context for the rule. However, we have not found any statutory provision that directly addresses the subject of OAR 845-006-0345(11)(c). Several statutes demonstrate that the legislature generally intended that alcoholic beverages be consumed in a temperate manner. <em>See </em>ORS 471.030(l)(b) (providing, in part, that the act shall be liberally construed so as to \u201cpromote temperance in the use and consumption of alcoholic beverages\u201d); ORS 471.115 (providing that OLCC may limit the quantity of alcoholic liquor purchased at any one time by any person); ORS 471.410(1) (prohibiting licensees from making any alcoholic beverage available to an intoxicated person); ORS 471.412 (prohibiting licensees from knowingly allowing an intoxicated person to consume alcoholic beverages). At least one statute regulates conduct relating to contests; it provides, in part, that, with specified exceptions, \u201calcoholic liquor may not be given as a prize, premium, or consideration for a lottery, contest, game of chance or skill, or competition of any kind.\u201d ORS 471.408. However, none of the described statutes, nor any other that we have identified, refers to or regulates contests in which the consumption of alcohol is itself the form of competition involved. Although the statutes generally embody a policy of encouraging temperance, we have not found any statute effectively requiring OLCC to adopt a rule prohibiting all drinking contests or precluding it from adopting a rule that prohibits some, but not all, drinking contests. Thus, OLCC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>authorizing statutes are of limited assistance in assessing the agency\u2019s interpretation of OAR. 845-006-0345(11)(c). We have not found any other source of law that is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">In summary, OLCC\u2019s interpretation of OAR 845-006-0345(11)(c) is inconsistent with the text of the rule\u2014 particularly, the plainly stated limitation as to which drinking contests are subject to the rule and the plain meanings of the words \u201cincrease\u201d and \u201cdesign.\u201d It also is inconsistent with contextual evidence that OLCC knows how to refer to all contests or competitions without qualification. Other sources of law are not helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">On balance, we cannot say that OLCC\u2019s interpretation is plausible. Accordingly, we remand for OLCC to determine, under a proper interpretation of the rule, whether petitioners\u2019 conduct violated the rule. ORS 183.482(8)(a)(B); <em>see also Nichols v. Office of Medical Assistance Programs, </em>171 Or App 255, 262,15 P3d 578 (2000) (where an agency\u2019s interpretation of a rule was implausible and therefore erroneous, the court remanded for application of a plausible interpretation of the rule to the facts of the case).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Violation of OAR 845-006-0345(11)(c) reversed and remanded for reconsideration; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\"> Licensees are notified about rule amendments through OLCC\u2019s quarterly publication, Distilled Data.
