J.</author>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">This is the companion case to <em>State v. Jackson, </em>212 Or App 51, 157 P3d 239 (2007). Defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction for, among other crimes, robbery in the second degree, ORS 164.405(1)(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He challenges, principally, (1) the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal (MJOA) on that charge and (2) a jury instruction describing the elements and application of ORS 164.405(1)(b). For the reasons stated in <em>Jackson, </em>we reject defendant\u2019s argument, in support of his MJOA, that the state failed to prove that he was \u201cactually present\u201d at the scene of the robbery within the meaning of ORS 164.405(1)(b). However, we agree with defendant that, in the circumstances of this case, the court\u2019s instruction to the jury on second-degree robbery was erroneous in that it permitted defendant to be convicted of that crime notwithstanding that he had not personally used physical force against the victim of the predicate theft. Accordingly, we reverse and remand as to that charge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">We review the denial of an MJOA to determine whether, after viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the state, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>320 Or 47, 63, 880 P2d 431 (1994), <em>cert den, </em>514 US 1005 (1995). We review the trial court\u2019s jury instructions for errors of law. <em>See State v. Moore, </em>324 Or 396, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>426-27, 927 P2d 1073 (1996). In determining whether instructional error requires reversal, we consider the jury instructions as a whole in assessing potential prejudice. <em>See, e.g., State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 356, 800 P2d 259 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">This appeal and <em>Jackson </em>both involved a robbery at the Hood River Wal-Mart store where, according to the state\u2019s evidence, Jackson acted as the principal robber and defendant drove the getaway car. In <em>Jackson, </em>consistently with the standards for reviewing the denial of an MJOA, we described the operative facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">\u201cOn May 18, 2004, [Jackson] and [defendant] drove together from Portland to the Hood River Wal-Mart store. As [defendant] sat in the car in a \u2018no parking\u2019 zone, with the engine running, [Jackson] approached the victim, who was standing outside, in front of the store. The distance from the car to where [Jackson] encountered the victim was roughly 25 feet. [Jackson] grabbed the victim\u2019s purse \u2014 and, when the victim did not immediately let go, [Jackson] knocked her to the ground and struggled with her for between 10 and 15 seconds until the purse strap broke. [Jackson] began to run with the purse, leaving the victim on the ground, and, as he did so, [defendant] put the car in motion with the passenger side door open. In seconds, [Jackson] jumped into the moving car, and he and [defendant] sped away. They were eventually apprehended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">212 Or App at 53-54.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Based on that incident, the state charged defendant (and Jackson) with several crimes, including second-degree robbery, ORS 164.405(1)(b), second-degree theft, ORS 164.045, and fourth-degree assault, ORS 163.160. Count 1 of the indictment, charging second-degree robbery, provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">\u201cThe defendant * * * acting together with * * * Jackson, did unlawfully and knowingly while in the course of committing theft, with the intent of preventing and overcoming resistance to defendant\u2019s taking of property and retention of the property after the taking, and being aided by another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>person actually present, use physical force upon [the victim].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Defendant and Jackson were tried together. Jackson waived a jury trial, but defendant did not. After the state presented its case, defendant, like Jackson, moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that he could be found guilty of, at most, third-degree robbery. After a lengthy discussion, the trial court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">After the close of the evidence, the court and counsel engaged in a protracted colloquy concerning proposed jury instructions on the elements and proof of second-degree robbery. That discussion touched on both direct liability and accomplice liability pursuant to ORS 161.155(2)(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, the state contended, and defendant disputed, that defendant could be convicted either because of his own violation of ORS 164.405(1)(b) or because he aided and abetted <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>violation of that statute. Ultimately, the court declined to instruct the jury on the state\u2019s alternative, aiding and abetting, theory with respect to second-degree robbery. Indeed, although the court did instruct the jury on aid and abet liability with respect to the theft and assault charges against defendant, it explicitly informed the jury that those instructions pertained solely to those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">With respect to defendant\u2019s direct liability under ORS 164.405(1)(b), the court, over defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s objection, gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">\u201cIn this case to establish the crime of Robbery in the Second Degree the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following elements: the act occurred in Hood River County, Oregon; the act occurred on or about May 18, 2004; [defendant], by intentionally aiding and abetting Luke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Jackson, or Mr. Jackson, committed theft; <em>that physical force was used </em>upon [the victim]; <em>that the physical force was used with the intent of overcoming resistance to the theft of her property, </em>and [defendant] was present and was aided by another person actually present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\"><em>* </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">\u201cI further instruct you that the term \u2018aided by another person actually present\u2019 as used in the instruction defining Robbery in the Second Degree, means aided by a person who is close enough to be in a position to aid in exerting force upon the victim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, the only reference to \u201caiding and abetting\u201d in the court\u2019s instruction regarding second-degree robbery was to the effect that defendant\u2019s aiding and abetting of the theft underlying the predicate third-degree robbery could, in turn, be used to establish an element of defendant\u2019s direct liability for second-degree robbery under ORS 164.405(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Defendant objected to the court\u2019s instruction \u2014 and, specifically, to the italicized language \u2014 because it did not specify \u201cby whom the physical force was used.\u201d According to defendant, the court should have instructed the jury that it could not convict him of second-degree robbery unless it found that he had personally used force upon the victim. That is, defendant contended that the instruction was erroneous and misleading in that it allowed the jury to convict him of second-degree robbery under ORS 164.405(l)(b) even if it found that someone else, <em>viz., </em>Jackson, and not defendant, had used physical force against the victim in committing the predicate theft. The jury subsequently convicted defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">On appeal, defendant, as noted, assigns error both to the denial of his MJOA on second-degree robbery and to the court\u2019s instruction on second-degree robbery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is considerable overlap between the arguments that he advances in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>support of each of those assignments of error \u2014 at points they are completely congruent, with defendant\u2019s brief presenting \u201ccombined\u201d argument on both assignments. Nevertheless, each assignment of error is functionally distinct \u2014 and, critically, as described below, defendant, in moving for the MJOA, failed to raise one crucial contention that he did, in fact, later raise and preserve in objecting to the jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Whether pertaining to the denial of the MJOA, the content of the jury instructions, or both, defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal ultimately implicate the proper interplay between two statutes. First, ORS 164.405 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of robbery in the second degree if the person violates ORS 164.395 and the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">\u00abH\u00ed H&lt; * * H\u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">\u201c(b) Is aided by another person actually present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Second, ORS 164.395, which defines the predicate crime of third-degree robbery, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of robbery in the third degree if in the course of committing or attempting to commit theft * * * the person uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person with the intent of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">\u201c(a) Preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property or to retention thereof immediately after the taking; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-11\">\u201c(b) Compelling the owner of such property or another person to deliver the property or to engage in other conduct which might aid in the commission of the theft * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">In arguing that the court erred in denying his MJOA, defendant advances two overarching, alternative arguments. <em>First, </em>as amplified below in our discussion of the asserted instructional error, defendant contends that he could not be convicted of second-degree robbery because the state failed to present any evidence that he personally \u201cuse[d] * * * physical force\u201d upon the victim of the predicate theft, ORS 164.395(1), and, in fact, only Jackson used such force. That is so, defendant reasons, because (1) the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>\u201cviolation\u201d of ORS 164.395 is an element of ORS 164.405(1)(b); and (2) he did not \u201cviolate\u201d ORS 164.395 by-engaging in conduct proscribed under that statute \u2014 rather, he merely aided and abetted <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>violation of ORS 164.395. In a related sense, defendant contends that ORS 164.405(1)(b) contemplates that only the \u201cprincipal\u201d robber, i.e., Jackson, is to be liable for second-degree robbery; that is, that such liability does not extend to \u201canother person actually present\u201d who merely \u201caids\u201d the robbery by virtue of his proximate presence. Again, in defendant\u2019s view, such a person is liable only for aiding and abetting a robbery in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The state responds, and we agree, that defendant, in seeking the MJOA, did not raise that contention and, thus, that contention is not preserved for purposes of our review of the denial of the MJOA. The colloquy between the court and counsel on the MJOA was extremely protracted, convoluted, and sometimes circuitous. It would not benefit the bench, the bar, or the public to recount that discussion in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">It suffices to say that, although there may have been, at some points in that colloquy, glimpses of the substance of the argument that is now coherently proffered on appeal, they were, at best, implicit \u2014 allusion, not argument.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, the pervasive theme and persistent thrust of the argument focused on the meaning of \u201cactually present\u201d in ORS 164.405(1)(b) and on a variation of accomplice liability that is inapposite. In sum, counsel\u2019s argument in support of the MJOA did not cogently \u201calert[ ] the trial judge and opposing counsel to the substance of the position that is advanced on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Taylor, </em>198 Or App 460, 469, 108 P3d 682, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 66 (2005); <em>see State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (to satisfy preservation requirement, trial counsel is required to \u201cprovide the trial court with an explanation of his * * * objection that is specific enough to ensure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><em>Second, </em>with respect to the MJOA, defendant contends that, in all events, ORS 164.405(1)(b) requires the \u201cactual presence\u201d of at least two perpetrators and the state failed to prove that he was \u201cactually present\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Defendant\u2019s arguments in that regard are identical to those previously unsuccessfully advanced by his coperpetrator. In <em>Jackson, </em>we rejected Jackson\u2019s challenge to the denial of his MJOA, concluding that a question of fact existed with regard to whether defendant (Rennells) was \u201cactually present\u201d so as to find the defendant there (Jackson) guilty of second-degree robbery. Specifically, we held that, based on the evidence presented, a finder of fact could conclude that defendant (Rennells) was \u201c \u2018within reach, sight or call\u2019 as to present an immediate \u2018added threat to the victim\u2019s safety.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson, </em>212 Or App at 57 (quoting <em>State v. Miller, </em>14 Or App 608, 611, 513 P2d 1199 (1973)). We adhere to that reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"> Defendant\u2019s argument in support of his second assignment of error, challenging the court\u2019s instruction on second-degree robbery, substantially tracks his first appellate argument pertaining to the MJOA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, as noted, defendant contends that a person cannot be held directly liable under ORS 164.405(1)(b) unless he or she personally used, or attempted to use, physical force against the victim and that the court\u2019s instruction, <em>see </em>213 Or App at 427-28, was erroneous as misleading because it permitted the jury to convict defendant based on <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that, unlike in the context of the MJOA, that contention was so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>cogently raised in the subsequent colloquy concerning jury instructions as to preserve the matter for our review.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifically, Jackson\u2019s counsel, whom the court permitted to participate in the colloquy, advanced the following arguments, in which defendant\u2019s counsel concurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">\u201c[JACKSON\u2019S ATTORNEY]: * * * Under [robbery] II the person that\u2019s charged with [robbery] II to be convicted first has to be \u2014 has to be guilty of [robbery] III\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">\u201c[JACKSON\u2019S ATTORNEY]: *** Robbery [II] that says, \u2018A person * * * commits the crime of Robbery in the Second Degree if the person violates ORS 164.395 and\u2019\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">* <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">\u201c [JACKSON\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Okay, you look at [ORS] 164.395, it applies only to a person who actually uses or threatens to use the force. Except if you get into the generic \u2014 generic accomplice testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">* <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">\u201c[JACKSON\u2019S ATTORNEY]: * * * [T]o find him guilty of [robbery] III you have to [apply an accomplice theory] because [defendant] didn\u2019t use the force. So the only way it can go against him \u2014 the only way you can get up to [robbery] II is the State trying to use this generic \u2014 this generic accessory [theory]. Because he did not use the force. He could not be \u2014 it could not be aggravated up to against him. He can\u2019t be \u2014 the accessory can\u2019t be his own principal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-13\">\u201c[JACKSON\u2019S ATTORNEY]: * * * It has to be the person who actually does the force\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, we\u2019re dealing with Robbery II though, aren\u2019t we?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-15\">\u201c[JACKSON\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Yeah, the first one. But Robbery II only applies to someone who has violated Robbery III to begin with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">\u201c[JACKSON\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And that person has to be the person who actually used the force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">\u201cNow, what they\u2019re trying to do is saying he\u2019s vicariously liable for Mr. Jackson\u2019s force, so therefore that bootstraps it up against him, [defendant], to be charged with [robbery] II. He can\u2019t \u2014 he\u2019s the accomplice. He cannot be accomplice to himself. Because he didn\u2019t use the force.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Notwithstanding those arguments, the court instructed the jury as noted. Thereafter, defendant\u2019s counsel reiterated his objection that the instruction failed to specify \u201cby whom the force was used.\u201d Thus, the trial court was sufficiently alerted to the substance of defendant\u2019s present challenge to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Defendant\u2019s challenge to the court\u2019s instruction ultimately depends on the premise that, when two defendants, A and B, cooperate in a theft, with both being \u201cactually present,\u201d and only A actually uses (or threatens to use) physical force against the victim, only A can be convicted of second-degree robbery under ORS 164.405(1)(b). Concomitantly, in defendant\u2019s view, B is liable only for aiding and abetting a third-degree robbery. From that premise, defendant reasons that the court\u2019s instruction was erroneous as misleading because the use of the passive <em>voice </em>\u2014 viz., \u201cphysical force <em>was used\u201d </em>(emphasis added) \u2014 permitted the jury to convict defendant under ORS 164.405(1)(b), notwithstanding that only Jackson ever used physical force against the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Defendant\u2019s fundamental premise depends, in turn, on several predicate assumptions about the proper construction and application of ORS 164.405(1)(b). <em>First, </em>only the person who actually employed force, or threatened the use of force, in committing the predicate theft can properly be deemed to have <em>\u201cviolated </em>ORS 164.395\u201d (emphasis added) for purposes of ORS 164.405(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\"><em>Second, </em>the other \u201cactually present,\u201d but otherwise passive, coperpetrator merely <em>aids </em>that \u201cviolation\u201d and, of logical necessity, is not <em>\u201caided by </em>another,\u201d as required under ORS 164.405(1)(b). Bluntly: In such circumstances, the \u201caider\u201d cannot also, and simultaneously, be the \u201caidee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number><em>Third, </em>to apply ORS 164.405(l)(b) to a person in defendant\u2019s circumstances would effectuate an impermissible \u201cdouble dipping\u201d by which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">\u201cdefendant\u2019s conduct in aiding Jackson\u2019s robbery could be used twice \u2014 first to aggravate Jackson\u2019s conduct into robbery in the second degree and, then, to convert defendant\u2019s aid and abet liability on the robbery in the third degree into an aid and abet for robbery in the second degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The state\u2019s response is unadorned: (1) Defendant, by aiding and abetting Jackson\u2019s use of force against the victim of the theft, \u201cviolat[ed] ORS 164.395\u201d; and (2) defendant (who was himself \u201cactually present\u201d) was \u201caided\u201d in his violation of ORS 164.395 \u201cby another person actually present,\u201d <em>viz., </em>Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Defendant\u2019s arguments substantially partake, at least implicitly, of aspects of the lead dissent in <em>State v. Pine, </em>181 Or App 105, 45 P3d 151 (2002) (affirmed by equally divided court) <em>(Pine I), rev\u2019d, </em>336 Or 194, 82 P3d 130 (2003); <em>see Pine </em>I, 181 Or App at 118-23 (Haselton, J., dissenting). In <em>Pine I, </em>this court divided evenly on an ostensibly analogous issue involving the enhancement, under ORS 163.165(1)(e), of fourth-degree assault to third-degree assault.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Conversely, the state contends that <em>Pine I </em>is inapposite, not only because the Supreme Court ultimately did not endorse any of our contending positions, but, more importantly, because of material differences between the operative language of the assault statute at issue in <em>Pine I </em>and ORS 164.405(1)(b) here.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Before addressing the substance of the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the operation of ORS 164.405(1)(b), we emphasize two critical caveats. Both pertain to what is <em>not </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>issue in this case \u2014 and, by extension, to what we do <em>not </em>purport to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><em>First, </em>this case, and our discussion that follows, pertains solely to a defendant\u2019s <em>direct </em>liability for violating ORS 164.405(1)(b). We appreciate that the term \u201cdirect\u201d may be somewhat imprecise, but we employ it in contradistinction to \u201caiding-and-abetting\u201d or \u201caccomplice\u201d liability. <em>See generally </em>ORS 161.155 (concerning criminal liability for conduct of another). As noted previously, the state here did not cross-assign error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on the theory that defendant could be convicted of second-degree robbery if he aided and abetted Jackson\u2019s violation of ORS 164.405(1)(b). <em>See </em>213 Or App at 428 n 5. Thus, the state here is in approximately the same position as in <em>Pine </em>\u2014 and, for the same reasons identified in <em>State v. Pine, </em>336 Or 194, 207-08, 208 n 6, 82 P3d 130 (2003) <em>(Pine II), </em>we do not consider the availability in this context of \u201caid-and-abet\u201d liability of the sort explored in Judge Edmonds\u2019s concurrence in <em>Pine I. See </em>181 Or App at 113-18 (Edmonds, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><em>Second, </em>we do not revisit the correctness of any of the contending positions in <em>Pine I. </em>To be sure, certain features of this dispute resemble aspects of <em>Pine. </em>Nevertheless, the robbery statutes at issue here and the assault statutes in <em>Pine </em>are substantially different in both their texts and their legislative histories. Whatever the \u201ccorrect\u201d analysis in <em>Pine, </em>those differences are decisive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">We begin with the statutory text. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). A person is guilty of second-degree robbery under ORS 164.405(1)(b) \u201cif the person <em>violates </em>ORS 164.395 and the person * * * [i]s <em>aided by </em>another person actually present.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cViolate,\u201d as generally used in Oregon statutes, <em>\u201cincludes </em>failure to comply.\u201d ORS 174.100(9) (emphasis added). That definition, by its terms, is not exclusive. In common usage, \u201cviolate\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">\u201c[T]o fail to keep: break, disregard &lt;~ the law&gt;[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2554 (unabridged ed 2002).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Those definitions of \u201cviolate\u201d are sufficiently general to, at least arguably, encompass both \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201caccomphce\u201d /aiding-and-abetting criminal liability. That is, unless \u201cviolates\u201d is somehow contextually restricted, one can \u201cviolate\u201d the third-degree robbery statute either by (as pertinent here) using or threatening the use of physical force against the victim of a theft or by aiding and abetting another person who does.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Two aspects of statutory context suggest, however, that \u201cviolates ORS 164.395\u201d may, in fact, have a more restrictive scope. Specifically, that term may pertain only to someone whose conduct renders him or her directly liable under ORS 164.395, as opposed to liable for someone else\u2019s conduct in violation of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">First, \u201cviolates\u201d in ORS 164.405(1) is appropriately viewed in the totality of that subsection, as well as in the context of the parallel \u201cviolates\u201d construct in the first-degree robbery statute, ORS 164.415. ORS 164.405(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201cA person commits the crime of robbery in the second degree if the person violates ORS 164.395 and the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">\u201c(a) Represents by word or conduct that the person is armed with what purports to be a dangerous or deadly weapon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">\u201c(b) Is aided by another person actually present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">ORS 164.415(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">\u201cA person commits the crime of robbery in the first degree if the person violates ORS 164.395 and the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">\u201c(a) Is armed with a deadly weapon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-12\">\u201c(b) Uses or attempts to use a dangerous weapon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-13\">\u201c(c) Causes or attempts to cause serious physical injury to any person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">As a matter of syntax, structure, and function, by far the most plausible referent \u2014 and perhaps the only plausible referent \u2014 for the enhancing circumstances identified in ORS 164.405(1)(a) and ORS 164.415(1)(a) to (c) is the person who actually, physically commits the predicate third-degree robbery. That is, in prescribing direct liability, those enhancing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>elements most plausibly pertain to conduct undertaken during the actual commission of the third-degree robbery, <em>e.g., </em>the robber threatens the victim, uses a dangerous weapon, or causes serious physical injury \u2014 or to conditions also heightening the danger and risk associated with the robbery, <em>e.g., </em>the robber is armed with a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Second, the juxtaposition of the <em>\u201caided by </em>another\u201d language in ORS 164.405(1)(b) (emphasis added) also plausibly limits the universe of those who \u201cviolate [ ] ORS 164.395\u201d to persons who actually, physically engage in the conduct proscribed by ORS 164.395. In common usage, to \u201caid\u201d means \u201cto give help or support to : further, facilitate, assist * * *: contribute to &lt;finances are <em>[aid]ed </em>by rummage sales&gt; * * * : to give assistance : be of use : help &lt;he <em>[aid]ed </em>in the attempt syn see help[.]\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 44 (boldface and emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Defendant contends, not unreasonably, that, in the circumstances presented here \u2014 with two \u201cactually present\u201d coperpetrators, one who \u201cactively\u2019 commits the robbery, and the other who merely remains in such physical proximity as to be able to intervene if necessary \u2014 the former is \u201caided by\u2019 the latter, and not vice versa. Thus, defendant argues, because the person who \u201cviolates ORS 164.395\u201d must be the same person who \u201c[i]s aided by another person actually present,\u201d only the \u201cactive\u201d robber can properly be deemed to be the directly culpable \u201cviolator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Conversely, the state suggests that, in those circumstances <em>(i.e., </em>the circumstances of this case), each of the \u201cactually present\u201d defendants is, in fact, \u201caiding\u201d the other\u2019s \u201cviolation\u201d of ORS 164.395. That is, if \u2014 as the state posits\u2014 defendant \u201cviolate[d] ORS 164.395\u201d by virtue of aiding and abetting Jackson\u2019s commission of the predicate robbery, defendant was \u201caided by\u2019 Jackson in that \u201cviolation.\u201d That is so, the state suggests, because but for Jackson\u2019s participation there would have been no third-degree robbery for defendant to aid and abet.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">On balance, we find defendant\u2019s contextual arguments to be compelling. The design of ORS 164.405(1), particularly the \u201caided by\u2019 formulation and the parallel context of ORS 164.415(1), strongly suggests that the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>intended only those who \u201cactively\u201d engage in the conduct proscribed by ORS 164.395 be deemed to have \u201cviolate[d] ORS 164.395\u201d for purposes of ORS 164.405(1). That, in turn, would render the disputed jury instruction erroneous because it permitted the jury to find defendant directly culpable under ORS 164.405(1)(b) based on Jackson\u2019s conduct, notwithstanding that defendant himself had not, in fact, \u201cviolate [d] ORS 164.395.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Still, the statutory context, while strongly suggestive, is not conclusive. The state\u2019s construction is not unreasonable. Accordingly, we turn to the legislative history and, particularly, to the pertinent portions of the Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7\u00a7 148-50 (July 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">ORS 164.405(1)(b) was enacted as part of the omnibus 1971 criminal code revisions. Or Laws 1971, ch 743, \u00a7 149. Three aspects of the Commentary pertaining to paragraph (1)(b) are instructive and enlightening. First, the Commentary describes that provision\u2019s purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">\u201cThe primary rationale behind paragraph (b) of subsection (1) * * * is the increased danger of an assault on the victim <em>when the robber is reinforced by another criminal who is actually present. </em>Furthermore, when two or more persons commit the crime, it indicates greater planning and more likelihood that they are professional criminals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Commentary \u00a7 149 at 155 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Second, the Commentary explained the proper application of paragraph (1)(b) \u2014 and, particularly, contrasted the consequences of \u201cactually present\u201d assistance as opposed to generic \u201caid and abet\u201d liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">\u201cIt is important to note * * * that <em>inclusion of the factor of actual aid by another person does not affect the doctrine of vicarious responsibility of accomplices for the general acts of the principal. </em>This matter is handled in the general provisions of [the proposed code] covering complicity. The language employed is intended to include only those situations in which the accomplice is in such proximity of the victim that he is in a position to assist in exerting force upon the victim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Finally, the Commentary described the relationship of the proposed revisions to then-extant Oregon law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201cAs provided [under then-current statutes], the single factor that aggravates robbery is that of being armed with a dangerous weapon. As noted previously, that factor is retained, but in terms of a \u2018deadly weapon,\u2019 and four new factors are added. <em>The crime becomes second-degree robbery if the </em>actor represents that he is armed or if he is aided by an accomplice actually present. The crime is enhanced to first-degree status if <em>the </em>actor is armed with a \u2018deadly weapon,\u2019 or uses or attempts to use a \u2018dangerous weapon,\u2019 or if he causes or attempts to cause serious physical injury to any person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 149 at 156 (boldface and emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Each of the emphasized references in the Commentary corroborates defendant\u2019s construction of ORS 164.405(1)(b). Specifically, as pertinent here, only a person who actually engages in the conduct constituting third-degree robbery \u2014 an \u201cactor\u201d or \u201crobber\u201d in the Commentary\u2019s rubric \u2014 \u201cviolates ORS 164.395\u201d for purposes of ORS 164.405(1)(b). Consequently, only such a person, and not a coperpetrator, who merely aids and abets the predicate third-degree robbery through his or her \u201cactual presence,\u201d can be directly culpable for second-degree robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The challenged instruction in this case was erroneous in that it permitted the jury to render a verdict that did not comport with those principles of direct culpability under ORS 164.405(1)(b). <em>See </em>213 Or App at 427-28 (setting out instruction in full). In particular, given the phrasing of that <em>instruction </em>\u2014 e.g., \u201cphysical force <em>was used\u201d </em>(emphasis added) \u2014 the jury could convict defendant of second-degree robbery based not on his own conduct but, instead, on Jackson\u2019s commission of the predicate third-degree robbery, including Jackson\u2019s use of force against the victim. Given the parties\u2019 proof, that defect in the instruction may well have been decisive. Accordingly, we reverse and remand defendant\u2019s conviction for second-degree robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Conviction for robbery in the second degree reversed and remanded; sentences vacated and remanded for resent-encing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-6\"> ORS 164.405(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">\u201cA person commits the crime of robbery in the second degree if the person violates ORS 164.395 and the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">\u00ab\u00edj\u00ed \u00edfc Sfc sfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">\u201c(b) Is aided by another person actually present.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-10\"> Defendant also raises three other assignments of error, each of which challenges the trial court\u2019s instruction, corresponding to ORS 136.450(1), that, as to each of the charged counts, the jury could convict upon a concurrence of 10 jurors. Specifically, defendant contends that \u201ca conviction of [a] crime by a less-than-unanimous jury violates the right to trial by jury in criminal cases specified by the Sixth Amendment[.]\u201d Defendant acknowledges that the United States Supreme Court \u201cdecided that issue contrary to defendant\u2019s position 33 years ago\u201d <em>in Apodaca v. Oregon, </em>406 US 404, 92 S Ct 1628, 32 L Ed 2d 184 (1972) (plurality opinion), and <em>Johnson v. Louisiana, </em>406 US 356, 92 S Ct 1620, 32 L Ed 2d 152 (1972). Nevertheless, defendant asserts that \u201crecent constitutional developments, social studies, and changes in the law, require a reevaluation\u201d of those holdings. We respectfully decline that invitation without further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b474-10\"> Defendant and Jackson were tried together, so the evidentiary record in the two cases was virtually identical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\"> ORS 161.155 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">\u201cA person is criminally liable for the conduct of another person constituting a crime if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">* ** * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">\u201c(2) With the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of the crime the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-12\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-13\">\u201c(b) Aids or abets or agrees or attempts to aid or abet such other person in planning or committing the crime [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\"> The state does not cross-assign error to the court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on the state\u2019s alternative theory that defendant could be convicted of second-degree robbery based on aiding and abetting Jackson\u2019s violation of ORS 164.405(1)(b). <em>Accord State v.

As in <em>Jackson, </em>where an identical contention was raised for the first time on appeal in challenging the denial of the MJOA, that argument was not raised and preserved in objecting to any instruction, or the failure to give any proposed instruction, in this case. Accordingly, we will not review that contention. <em>See Jackson, </em>212 Or App at 55.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b480-16\"> After the court denied both defendant\u2019s and Jackson\u2019s MJOAs, each presented his case-in-chief, consisting of testimony by the same witness.
