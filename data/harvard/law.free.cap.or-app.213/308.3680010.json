J.</author>\n<p id=\"b355-3\">Oregon\u2019s wrongful death statute, ORS 30.020(1), provides that the decedent\u2019s personal representative may bring an action for wrongful death \u201cif the decedent might have maintained an action, had the decedent lived, against the wrongdoer for an injury done by the same act or omission.\u201d The question in this case is the meaning of that provision \u2014 specifically, whether a personal representative can bring a wrongful death action when the decedent already recovered damages for personal injury based on the same act or omission that is the basis for the wrongful death claim. The trial court concluded that, if decedent already recovered damages for the same act or omission, the statute precludes a wrongful death action, because decedent could not have maintained the action had he lived. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. Morris Nagl worked as a floor installer from 1953 to 1991. During that time, he was exposed to asbestos-containing building materials, including joint compound, filler, and leveling and patching products. In 2001, Nagl was diagnosed with an asbestos-related disease. In 2003, he was diagnosed with mesothelioma.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In 2004, Nagl and his wife, Donna, brought a personal injury action against a number of companies engaged in the manufacture, distribution, and sale of asbestos-containing materials. Defendant Dowman Products, Inc., (Dowman) was among those companies named as a defendant. The complaint alleged claims of negligence, product liability, and loss of consortium, based on Nagl\u2019s exposure to asbestos-containing products that Dowman manufactured, delivered, or sold. The Nagls settled with other defendants and then obtained a verdict against Dowman for a total of $659,720.87, consisting of $274,720.87 in economic damages to Nagl, $350,000 in noneconomic damages to Nagl, and $35,000 in loss of consortium damages to his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Approximately five months after the judgment was entered in the personal injury action, Nagl died.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">In 2005, plaintiff, the personal representative of Nagl\u2019s estate and Nagl\u2019s three surviving children, initiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>this wrongful death action against, among others, Dowman. The complaint alleges claims of negligence and product liability, based on Nagl\u2019s exposure to asbestos-containing products that Dowman manufactured, delivered, or sold. The prayer of $2.7 million includes medical expenses to Nagl that were not covered by the personal injury judgment, burial expenses, and damages for loss of consortium to Nagl\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\">Dowman moved for summary judgment on the ground that the wrongful death action was not permitted by statute. According to Dowman, the statute permits a wrongful death action only \u201cif the decedent might have maintained an action, had the decedent lived, against the wrongdoer for an injury done by the same act or omission.\u201d In this case, Dowman argued, Nagl could <em>not </em>have brought the action, had he lived. Because Nagl already had brought a successful action for damages against the same wrongdoer (Dowman) for injury done by the same act or omission (injury produced by exposure to asbestos-containing products), Nagl would have been precluded from bringing a second claim for the same wrongdoing, as a matter of law. Because Nagl could not have brought the action, under the plain terms of the statute, neither can plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Plaintiff responded that it makes no sense to read the statute to condition a personal representative\u2019s right to initiate a wrongful death action on the decedent\u2019s ability to bring the claim, had the decedent lived. According to plaintiff, a wrongful death action is entirely independent of any claims that the decedent himself could have brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The trial court agreed with Dowman that the wrongful death statute itself precluded plaintiff from bringing this action and entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">On appeal, plaintiff assigns error to the trial court\u2019s decision to grant Dowman\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In support of the assignment, plaintiff reprises its argument that Nagl\u2019s successful prosecution of his personal injury claim against defendant does not preclude Nagl\u2019s estate from pursuing its own claim, even if both claims arise out of the same acts or omissions. Plaintiff asserts that the portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the statute on which the trial court relied \u2014 permitting a wrongful death action only \u201cif the decedent might have maintained an action, had the decedent lived\u201d \u2014 is no bar in this case. In plaintiffs view, Nagl \u201cnot only \u2018might have\u2019 maintained such an action while alive but he <em>did </em>so and <em>won.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Dowman responds that plaintiff is ignoring the wording of the statute, which requires that the decedent have been able to have brought the action \u201chad the decedent lived.\u201d That wording, Dowman contends, makes clear that the determinative issue is whether decedent could have brought the action <em>at the time of death. </em>In this case, Nagl could not have done so, having already recovered on his personal injury claim against defendant for the same wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Plaintiff rejoins that we should read the statute to require only that the decedent have been able to have brought the claim <em>at any time, </em>and not at the time of death. Any other reading of the statute, plaintiff complains, \u201cproduces an absurd result\u201d that \u201cdefies the statutory language, policy, and history.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In Oregon, an action for wrongful death is regarded as exclusively statutory in nature. <em>Storm v. McClung, </em>334 Or 210, 222 n 4, 47 P3d 476 (2002) (\u201cSince at least 1891, this court has adhered to the view that no right of action for wrongful death existed at common law.\u201d); <em>Groth v. Hyundai Precision and Ind. Co., </em>209 Or App 781, 801, 149 P3d 333 (2006) (\u201cA well-established line of Oregon cases holds that there was no right of action for wrongful death at common law and that wrongful death claims are purely statutory.\u201d). To be sure, as the Oregon Supreme Court itself has noted, there is reason to doubt the widely held view that there was no common-law action for wrongful death. <em>Storm, </em>334 Or at 222 n 4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Still, to date, the court has not had occasion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>reconsider the matter. <em>See, e.g., Juarez v. Windsor Rock Products, Inc., </em>341 Or 160, 169, 144 P3d 211 (2006) (noting the issue but determining that it was not necessary to resolve it in that case). The point is worth emphasizing, for it frames the dispute before us, which is one not of policy or of developing common-law principles, but of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\">As such, our decision rests on familiar principles that apply to the interpretation of statutes. We attempt to discern the intentions of the legislature that enacted the statute into law by reference to the statute\u2019s text and, if necessary, its history and other aids to construction. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). In our examination of the statute\u2019s text, we consider prior judicial construction of it. <em>Martin v. Board of Parole, </em>327 Or 147, 156, 957 P2d 1210 (1998). Prior Supreme Court construction of a statute, in fact, becomes part of the statute as if written into the text of the statute itself. <em>Stephens v. Bohlman, </em>314 Or 344, 350 n 6, 838 P2d 600 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Oregon\u2019s wrongful death statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">\u201cWhen the death of a person is caused by the wrongful act or omission of another, the personal representative of the decedent * * * may maintain an action against the wrongdoer, if the decedent might have maintained an action, had the decedent lived, against the wrongdoer for an injury done by the same act or omission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">ORS 30.020(1). The statute has been amended on a number of occasions over the years, but the portion relevant to this case has remained essentially unchanged since its original enactment as part of the Deady Code of 1862. <em>See Storm, </em>334 Or at 222 n 4. The Supreme Court has explained that, although the effect of the statute is to create a new cause of action distinct from one that the decedent had while alive, <em>Hansen v. Hayes, </em>175 Or 358, 398, 154 P2d 202 (1944), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>new cause of action remains \u201cderivative\u201d of the decedent\u2019s rights. <em>Smothers v. Gresham </em>Transfer, <em>Inc., </em>332 Or 83, 127, 23 P3d 333 (2001). The statute, in effect, \u201cplaces a decedent\u2019s personal representative in the decedent\u2019s shoes, imputing to the personal representative whatever rights, and limitations to those rights, that the decedent possessed.\u201d <em>Storm, </em>334 Or at 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The statute also imposes a limitation on the personal representative\u2019s authority to bring an action. That limitation is that the decedent must have been able to bring an action for the same wrongful conduct, \u201chad the decedent lived.\u201d ORS 30.020(1). It is the meaning of that provision that is in dispute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The phrasing of the statute suggests that the relevant time for determining whether a decedent might have brought such an action is at the time of death. The statute provides that the determinative issue is whether decedent might have brought the action, \u201chad the decedent lived,\u201d in other words, had the decedent not died. Grammarians refer to that phrasing as \u201cpast hypothetical conditional,\u201d which is understood to suggest what might have happened, but did not actually happen \u2014 in this case, that decedent might have survived, but did not survive. <em>See generally </em>Randolph Quirk, Stanley Greenbaum, Geoffrey Leech, and Jan Svartvik, <em>A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language </em>1010-12 (1985). The key event, in other words, is the time of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The same conclusion seems to follow from the derivative nature of wrongful death claims. If, as the Supreme Court has explained, the claim is derivative of the decedent\u2019s rights and the estate steps \u201cin the decedent\u2019s shoes,\u201d <em>Storm, </em>334 Or at 223, then it would follow that the authority of the estate to bring a claim would depend on the nature of the decedent\u2019s rights at the time of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Consistent with the foregoing, in two decisions from early in the previous century, the Supreme Court has construed ORS 30.020(1) to refer to the extent to which a decedent might have brought a claim at the time of death. First, in <em>Kosciolek v. Portland Ry., L. &amp; P. Co., </em>81 Or 517, 160 P132 (1916), the decedent was injured in a street-car accident. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>decedent brought an action for negligence against the streetcar company for his injuries. The case was settled, and the decedent recovered a sum of money in satisfaction of his claim. Some months later, the decedent died, and his surviving wife brought suit under the wrongful death statute for damages arising out of the same street-car accident. <em>Id. </em>at 518-19. The street-car company obtained a dismissal of the wrongful death claim for failure to state a claim, and the Supreme Court affirmed. The court explained that, by the time of the decedent\u2019s death, the decedent already had settled his claim against the street-car company, leaving no further basis for a wrongful death claim. \u201c[I]t would be unreasonable to hold,\u201d the court commented, \u201cthat the defendant, after fairly compensating the injured man for the negligent wrong inflicted upon him, should be compelled to search out all others of his relatives and litigate or settle with them.\u201d Id. at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\">Second, in <em>Piukkula v. Pillsbury Flouring </em>Co., 150 Or 304, 42 P2d 921 (1935), the decedent became ill as a result of exposure to flour dust during many years of work for Pilllsbury. He sued Pillsbury, but Pillsbury demurred on statute of limitations grounds. But, before that matter was finally resolved, the decedent died, and the case was dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 308-09. The decedent\u2019s estate then brought an action against Pillsbury under the wrongful death provisions of the Employers\u2019 Liability Act (ELA),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as it then existed. Pillsbury moved to dismiss the action on statute of limitations grounds, and the trial court granted the motion. The decedent\u2019s estate appealed, arguing that its claim was not dependent on the viability of the decedent\u2019s claim at the time of his death but, instead, consisted of an entirely separate claim. Pillsbury argued that the claim of the estate depended on the viability of the decedent\u2019s claim at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The Supreme Court agreed with Pillsbury. The court explained that the wrongful death provisions of the ELA were \u201cakin\u201d to the state\u2019s wrongful death statute. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>then commented, after surveying a variety of wrongful death cases that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\">\u201c[b]y the great weight of authority * * * where the statute in effect gives a remedy to recover damages where the death of a person is caused by the negligent or wrongful act of another, such remedy depends upon the existence in the decedent, <em>at the time of death, </em>of a right of action to recover damages for such injury[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 314 (quoting Annotation, <em>Release by, or Judgment in Favor of, Person Injured as Barring Action for his Death, </em>39 ALR 579 (1925); emphasis added). In that regard, the court noted that its prior decisions were consistent with that general rule. In particular, the court noted, its decision in <em>Kosciolek </em>made clear that a wrongful death action cannot be maintained if the decedent had settled his or her claim before the time of death. <em>Id. </em>at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Turning to the argument of the decedent\u2019s estate that the statute created an independent claim, the court agreed, but only in part. Referring explicitly to both the wrongful death statute and the ELA, the court stated that \u201cour legislation * * * does not merely revive the cause of action, if any, possessed by the deceased, but * * * creates a new right of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318. At the same time, the court cautioned, although the legislation creates a new right of action, \u201cthe new right is dependent upon the possession by the deceased of a cause of action at the time of his death.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">We are aware of no more recent decisions of the court suggesting that either <em>Kosciolek </em>or <em>Piukkula </em>no longer remain good law. To the contrary, in at least one subsequent case, the Supreme Court expressly reaffirmed its decision in <em>Piukkula. Hansen, </em>175 Or at 398 (\u201cWe adhere to the ruling in that case.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both decisions make clear that the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>question is whether the decedent might have brought a claim <em>at the time of death. </em>Unless the answer to that question is affirmative, the estate can assert no wrongful death claim arising out of the same act or omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\">We note also that the Supreme Court\u2019s reading of the Oregon wrongful death statute in those two cases is consistent with what is widely regarded as the traditional and dominant view of the issue. <em>See, e.g., Kessinger v. Grefco, </em>Inc., 251 Ill App 3d 980, 987, 623 NE2d 946, 951 (1993) (\u201cThe vast majority of other jurisdictions having legislation including the phrase \u2018if death had not ensued\u2019 have similarly held a settlement by the injured party or a suit reduced to judgment during the lifetime of the injured party barred a later suit by the next of kin.\u201d); <em>see also Brown v. Pine Bluff Nursing Home, </em>359 Ark 471, 474, 199 SW3d 45, 48 (2004); <em>Xu v. Gay, </em>257 Mich App 263, 277, 668 NW2d 166, 174 (2003); <em>Varelis v. Northwestern Memorial Hosp., </em>167 Ill2d 449, 454, 657 NE2d 997, 999 (1995); <em>Suber v. Ohio Medical Products, Inc., </em>811 SW2d 646, 649-50 (Tex App 1991); <em>Variety Childrens\u2019 Hosp. v. Perkins, </em>445 So2d 1010, 1011 (Fla 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">As the reporter of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>\u00a7 46, Reporter\u2019s Note (1982), comments, \u201cThe clear weight of authority is that a prior judgment for or against the decedent precludes a wrongful death action by his beneficiaries.\u201d <em>See also </em>Stuart M. Speiser &amp; James E. Rooks, Jr., 3 <em>Recovery for Wrongful Death </em>\u00a7 15:20, 15-82 (4th ed 2005) (noting traditional rule that \u201cif the injured party recovers damages for his fatal injuries during his lifetime, the cause of action is thereby satisfied\u201d); Dan Dobbs, <em>The Law of Torts </em>820 (2000) (citing rule of \u201cmost courts\u201d that \u201ceither a settlement by the victim or a judgment for or against him will preclude the wrongful death action where death resulted from the original injury\u201d); Fowler V. Harper, Fleming James, Jr., and Oscar S. Gray, 4 <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 24-26, 471-72 (2nd ed 1986) (\u201cIf the deceased recovered a judgment for injuries or settled and released a claim for injuries, before death, most courts hold this a bar to any action under either a survival or wrongful death statute.\u201d). The consistent rationale of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>authorities is the derivative nature of the wrongful death claim. As one leading commentator explains,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-4\">\u201cThe argument for this position is summed up by describing the wrongful death suit as derivative of the deceased\u2019s own rights. If the deceased had no right to sue at her death, or would have had none had she survived, then survivors have no wrongful death claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Dobbs, <em>The Law of Torts </em>at 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Plaintiff notes that courts in several states and the United States Supreme Court have reached a contrary conclusion and that we should follow those decisions as \u201cbetter reasoned.\u201d Plaintiff is correct that there has developed a minority view on the question whether a decedent\u2019s prior settlement or judgment precludes a later wrongful death action arising out of the same wrongdoing. The United States Supreme Court, for example, concluded in <em>Sea-Land Services, Inc. v. Gaudet, </em>414 US 573, 579-95, 94 S Ct 806, 39 L Ed 2d 9 (1974), that a decedent\u2019s prior settlement or judgment does not bar a subsequent wrongful death action under a federal maritime statute. Several state courts have reached a similar conclusion with respect to their state wrongful death statutes. <em>See, e.g., Alfone v. Sarno, 87 </em>NJ 99, 108-24, 432 A2d 857, 861-63 (1981), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by La Fage v. Jani, </em>166 NJ 412, 438, 766 A2d 1066, 1070-76 (2001); <em>Schmidt v. Moncrief, </em>151 P2d 920, 921-22 (Ok 1944); <em>Rowe v. Richards, </em>151 NW 1001, 1007 (SD 1915).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The consistent rationale for those cases, however, is that wrongful death statutes create a completely independent action that is not merely derivative of the rights of the decedent. <em>See </em>Dobbs, <em>The Law of Torts </em>at 820 (discussing cases). As we have noted, in Oregon, the Supreme Court has long regarded wrongful death claims to be derivative of the decedent\u2019s rights. <em>Storm, </em>334 Or at 223; <em>Smothers, </em>332 Or at 127. Moreover, and apart from that, it must be remembered that, as we emphasized at the outset of this opinion, the question before us is not one of better reasoning in the abstract, but one of statutory construction. That means that we are required to determine what the legislature most likely intended when it enacted Oregon\u2019s wrongful death statute in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>1862, in light of the wording of the statute as it has been construed by the courts since enactment. Plaintiff offers no evidence that the Oregon legislature intended to adopt the minority view when it enacted the statute, and we are aware of none. Nor has it explained how such a view can be reconciled with Oregon case law construing the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\">We conclude that Nagl\u2019s successful prosecution of a personal injury claim for exposure to asbestos-containing products bars plaintiff from bringing another claim on behalf of Nagl\u2019s estate and children on the basis of the same exposure because plaintiffs cannot satisfy the requirement of the wrongful death statute that, Nagl, had he not died, might have brought the claim. The trial court therefore did not err in granting Dowman\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\"> A number of nineteenth-century American courts declared that no right of action for wrongful death existed at common law. <em>See, e.g., Putman v. Southern Pacific Co., </em>21 Or 230, 231-32, 27 P1033 (1891). Usually, the American courts cited for that proposition an English decision, <em>Baker v. Bolton, </em>1 Camp 493,170 Eng Rep 1033 (Nisi Prius 1808). The problem is that a number of scholars have come to believe that <em>Baker </em>was wrong in that regard. <em>See, e.g., </em>T.A. Smedley, <em>Wrongful Death </em>\u2014 Bases <em>of the Common Law Rules, </em>13 Vand L Rev 605, 614 (1960) (noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>that <em>Baker </em>has been \u201cwidely criticized as embodying a careless overstatement of the law\u201d). In the meantime, however, <em>Baker </em>was cited by a number of state courts in this country. <em>See Goheen v. General Motors Corp., </em>263 Or 145, 150-51, 502 P2d 223 (1972) (reviewing cases). That creates an interesting question as to precisely what was the state of the \u201ccommon law\u201d in the mid-nineteenth century, given the fact that so many American courts perpetuated <em>Baker's </em>overstatement of the law. We do not, however, need to resolve that matter in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b360-5\"> We are aware of the fact that the current preference is to refer to the statute as the \u201cEmployer Liability Law.\u201d <em>See Woodbury v. CH2M Hill, </em>Inc., 335 Or 154,157 n 1, 61 P3d 918 (2003). We refer to the \u201cEmployers\u2019 Liability Act\u201d in describing <em>Piukkula, </em>however, because that is how the Supreme Court referred to the enactment in that case. 150 Or at 309.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\"> Plaintiff argues that, notwithstanding <em>Hansen\u2019s </em>express reaffirmation of <em>Piukkula, Hansen </em>actually supports its contention that a decedent\u2019s prior judgment does not bar a subsequent wrongful death action. Plaintiff misreads the decision, however. In <em>Hansen, </em>the decedent died as a result of an auto accident, and his estate brought a successful wrongful death action for damages permitted under the statute. <em>After that, </em>the decedent\u2019s surviving spouse brought an action for unpaid medical expenses. The question in <em>Hansen </em>was whether the spouse could recover those expenses. The court held that, because the estate could not recover the medical expenses in the wrongful death action, that action was not a bar to her subsequent action to recover them. 175 Or at 396-98. <em>Hansen </em>thus was a straightforward case of preclusion \u2014 if the medical expenses had been recoverable in the wrongful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>death action, the later action would have been barred, <em>id. </em>at 378 \u2014 and did not involve the statutory construction at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
