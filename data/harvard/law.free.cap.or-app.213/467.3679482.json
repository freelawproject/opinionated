We review <em>de novo, Hanzo v. deParrie, </em>152 Or App 525, 953 P2d 1130 (1998), <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 418 (1999); <em>Boyd v.

We affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to vacate or modify the SPO, but we reverse its award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The parties were next-door neighbors and friends in West Linn. In March 2001, they had a dispute over the location of a fence. In June 2001, petitioner sought, and the circuit court issued, a permanent uniform stalking citation against respondent based on findings that respondent was making vulgar phone calls to petitioner, harassing her, degrading her friends, sending faxes and e-mails, following petitioner through the neighborhood, giving petitioner \u201cthe finger,\u201d and playing loud hate music. The circuit court\u2019s order prohibited respondent from having contact with petitioner. The order defined \u201ccontact\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">\u201cComing into visual or physical presence of the petitioner except for incidental contact as neighbor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">\u201cFollowing the petitioner * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">\u201cWaiting outside the home, property, place of work or school of the petitioner * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">\u201cSending or making written communications in any form to the petitioner * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">\u201cSpeaking by any means with the petitioner * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>\u201cCommunicating through a third person with the petitioner * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\">\u201cCommitting a crime against the petitioner * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">\u201cCommunicating with a third person who has some relationship to the petitioner * * * with the intent of affecting the third person\u2019s relationship with the petitioner * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">\u201cDamaging the home, property, place of work or school of the petitioner * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">\u201cDelivering directly or through a third person any object to the home, property, place of work or school of the petitioner * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">\u201cNot play [sic] music audible on petitioner\u2019s property, specifically, but not limited to songs \u2018TNT\u2019 or \u2018Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">In August 2004, respondent filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to terminate the SPO, which she voluntarily dismissed two days before the scheduled hearing. In January 2005, respondent again sought relief from the SPO, this time represented by an attorney, asserting that, in light of changed circumstances since the issuance of the SPO \u2014 primarily her having moved away \u2014 the justification for the order no longer exists. At the hearing, the court heard testimony from petitioner concerning respondent\u2019s conduct after issuance of the SPO. Petitioner testified that, three days after the issuance of the SPO, in June 2001, respondent placed unsightly boards on a gazebo in her yard on the side facing petitioner\u2019s house. In August 2001, within two months after the issuance of the SPO, respondent directed threatening communications toward petitioner, including telling her, \u201cIf you thought you were scared before, you should be really scared now,\u201d and pointing a finger at petitioner and saying, \u201cYou are going to get it.\u201d Petitioner was arrested in August 2001 for violating the SPO. After her arrest, respondent began shining a large vapor light from the outside of her house into petitioner\u2019s yard. The parties later signed a civil compromise allowing for dismissal of the charges against respondent. Petitioner testified that, as required by the civil compromise, respondent removed the boards from the gazebo, cleaned up her yard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>and moved the light that was shining onto petitioner\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Petitioner and respondent have not had any personal contact since the end of 2001; however, petitioner testified that, since the signing of the civil compromise, respondent has engaged in other conduct that causes her to remain fearful. Petitioner believes that on Christmas Eve 2001, respondent or her husband parked two 26-foot U-Haul trucks on the street adjacent to petitioner\u2019s residence. Also on Christmas Eve 2001, respondent erected a clothes line in her yard, from which she hung women\u2019s undergarments for a period of three months, illuminated with spotlights at night. Petitioner also testified that, after the civil compromise, and until about six months before respondent moved in the fall of 2003, respondent would frequently stare at petitioner from her house for up to 45 minutes at a time. In August 2003, the day after the statute of limitations ran on respondent\u2019s alleged August 2001 violations of the SPO, respondent returned the spotlight to its original location so that it once again shone into petitioner\u2019s yard. In that same month, respondent filed a lawsuit against petitioner seeking damages of $500,000, which was subsequently dismissed. The trial court took judicial notice of the judgment in that case, in which the court had awarded attorney fees to petitioner for the reason that respondent\u2019s claims were malicious and motivated by a desire to retaliate against petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In the fall of 2003, respondent moved to a new residence several miles from the property, but she continued to own the property. Since that time, apart from legal filings, respondent and petitioner have had no interaction. However, in October 2004, after respondent filed her first motion for relief from the SPO, unsightly boards reappeared on the side of respondent\u2019s gazebo facing petitioner\u2019s property. Petitioner testified that the above-described incidents cause her to remain in fear of respondent. Petitioner testified that respondent</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">\u201ccontinues to make herself available for me to see things to remind me that she\u2019s still there, and even though she can\u2019t get arrested for trashing her gazebo, or hanging a vapor light, or hanging up bras and a pair of panties inside out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>with the crotch facing my yard spotlighted for months, maybe she can\u2019t get arrested for that but she\u2019s telling me that she\u2019s still there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The court also heard from respondent. She testified that the SPO has made her life difficult and prevented her from enjoying her yard. She has undergone mental health counseling relating to the SPO and her relationship with petitioner. Respondent denied ever having threatened petitioner and specifically denied the conduct that gave rise to the civil compromise in August 2001. She denied placing boards on the gazebo in her yard, using or shining a spotlight on her clothesline, shining a light onto petitioner\u2019s property, or parking trucks in front of petitioner\u2019s house. She testified that as a result of the SPO, she has lived her life in fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The trial court denied respondent\u2019s motion, concluding that it had no authority under the statutes to modify the order. Further, the court said, assuming that it had authority to grant the requested relief, it would not do so, finding that respondent was \u201cone of the least credible people I have had occasion to see in court,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and had not met her burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>proof. The court explained that respondent\u2019s answers to questions relating to the gazebo, the trucks, and the lingerie were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>\u201cso unbelievable as to approach the level of peijury in my estimation, and you\u2019re utterly and totally unbelievable, Mrs. Andrews, and you\u2019re your own worst enemy, and your conduct in court I probably \u2014 as indicated in Mr. Dean\u2019s closing, I\u2019m not going to modify the order as respondents requested to order that you have a mental health evaluation, because I don\u2019t think I have the authority to do that either, but I think I probably missed the mark based on what I\u2019ve seen of your conduct here in court. You scare me as well. [Petitioner] has a right to have reasonable apprehension of you, <em>and let the record reflect that [respondent] is nodding her head in agreement with me as I say this, and is speaking in a soft voice of, \u2018Oh, really?\u2019 </em>** * * By outright threatening the petitioner on August 4th and 5th of 2001, by parking trucks or having trucks parked in a fashion that was intended to frighten the petitioner, by filing these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>frivolous and unwarranted motions, which were without any merit, which were clearly filed for a desire to retaliate against the petitioner, that when you take all of those things together with the statements they can only be intended, the fact finder can conclude that it was intended to intimidate the petitioner in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\">\u201cThe petitioner\u2019s apprehension of imminent physical injury from the respondent was objectively reasonable at the time I issued this order. It continues to be to this very day based on what I\u2019ve heard here in court, what I\u2019ve observed personally of the respondent\u2019s demeanor here in these judicial proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">(Emphasis added.) The court found that respondent</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">\u201chas engaged in a continuous course of conduct, which the court finds was motivated by her desire to retaliate against petitioner for having originally been granted a permanent Stalking Order. These activities included:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">\u201ca. The trashing of a gazebo on respondent\u2019s property causing an unsightly view towards petitioner\u2019s property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">\u201cb. The maintaining of an unsightly clothesline with unsightly garments thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">\u201cc. Outright threats to petitioner on two occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">\u201cd. Parking of rental trucks in front of petitioner\u2019s residence with the purpose to harass or annoy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">\u201ce. Filing frivolous Motions to vacate the Stalking Order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">Taken all together, the court ruled,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">\u201cthese actions on the part of respondent were intended to further intimidate petitioner and that petitioner had a reasonable apprehension of threat to her personal safety. These apprehensions continue to this date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">Respondent appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">Subsequent to the trial court\u2019s order, in <em>Edwards v. Biehler, </em>203 Or App 271, 277, 124 P3d 1256 (2005), we held that a permanent SPO may be terminated when, on the respondent\u2019s motion, a court finds that the criteria for issuing the order are no longer present.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Under ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B), the court may enter an SPO</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\">\u201cif the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">\u201c(i) The person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly engages in repeated and unwanted contact with the other person or a member of that person\u2019s immediate family or household thereby alarming or coercing the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">\u201c(ii) It is objectively reasonable for a person in the victim\u2019s situation to have been alarmed or coerced by the contact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">\u201c(iii) The repeated and unwanted contact causes the victim reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of the victim or a member of the victim\u2019s immediate family or household.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">As the party seeking to set aside the SPO, respondent has the burden of demonstrating that the concerns that underlay the issuance of the original SPO have sufficiently abated that the order should be set aside. <em>See, e.g., </em>OEC 305 (\u201cA party has the burden of persuasion as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which the law declares essential to the claim for relief or defense the party is asserting.\u201d). The court\u2019s function in determining whether an SPO should be terminated is not to re-evaluate the correctness of the original order <em>or </em>to determine whether the circumstances since the issuance of the original SPO would be sufficient to justify the issuance of a new SPO. \u201cThe court\u2019s inquiry will focus primarily on whether petitioner continues to suffer \u2018reasonable apprehension\u2019 due to the past acts of the respondent [.]\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>203 Or App at 277. Although an awareness of the circumstances giving rise to the original order is necessary to the court\u2019s determination, the circumstances subsequent to the order also bear on whether the petitioner continues to suffer a \u201creasonable apprehension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Respondent contends that she has had no personal contact with petitioner since moving in the fall of 2003, and that the circumstances since the issuance of the SPO are such that a person would not continue to have reasonable apprehension for her safety based on the conduct that gave rise to the issuance of the SPO. Specifically, respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>argues that, even assuming that she has engaged in the conduct described by petitioner since the issuance of the SPO, that conduct is not of the type that should cause petitioner reasonable apprehension for her personal safety, and respondent\u2019s move from the property has abated any possible threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">We have reviewed the record <em>de novo </em>and, as did the trial court, we find that respondent\u2019s testimony at trial was not credible and that she did engage in the conduct complained of by petitioner, including the verbal threats in August 2001 that gave rise to the civil compromise. In light of the higher standard applied to the evaluation of expressive conduct, <em>State v. Rangel, </em>328 Or 294, 303, 977 P2d 379 (1999) (Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution requires proof that the contact constitutes a threat that \u201cinstills in the addressee a fear of imminent and serious personal violence from the speaker, is unequivocal, and is objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts.\u201d), we agree with respondent that her conduct subsequent to the signing of the civil compromise would not independently establish the right to an SPO. However, that conduct shows that, as recently as a few months before the filing of her motion, respondent actively directed her anger against petitioner by putting unsightly boards back on the gazebo on respondent\u2019s property. Her blatant lying on the witness stand about her participation in or even awareness of that conduct strongly suggests that she has not constructively resolved the emotional issues that precipitated the conduct giving rise to the SPO and, in fact, continues to pursue her vendetta. We conclude that respondent, as the party with the burden of proof, has failed to establish that petitioner no longer has a reasonable apprehension for her safety. We accordingly affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion for relief from the SPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Respondent asserts further that the trial court erred in awarding petitioner attorney fees under ORS 20.105. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">\u201cIn any civil action, suit or other proceeding in a circuit court or the Oregon Tax Court, or in any civil appeal to or review by the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court, the court shall award reasonable attorney fees to a party against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>whom a claim, defense or ground for appeal or review is asserted, if that party is a prevailing party in the proceeding and to be paid by the party asserting the claim, defense or ground, upon a finding by the court that the party willfully disobeyed a court order or that there was no objectively reasonable basis for asserting the claim, defense or ground for appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">In the limited judgment denying respondent\u2019s motion to vacate or modify the stalking order, the trial court found that there is no statutory authority for the termination of a stalking order and that respondent\u2019s motion to terminate or modify or amend the stalking order was a frivolous action. In two supplemental judgments, the trial court found that there was no objectively reasonable basis for respondent to have sought to set aside the permanent stalking order, \u201cin that the evidence overwhelmingly establishes the absence of any such objectively reasonable basis for respondent to further litigate this matter.\u201d The court awarded attorney fees to petitioner under ORS 20.105 for prevailing on both the August 2004 and January 2005 motions to terminate the SPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\"> We review the trial court\u2019s decision to award fees under ORS 20.105 for errors of law. <em>Secor Investments, LLC v. Anderegg, </em>188 Or App 154, 175, 71 P3d 538, <em>rev </em>den, 336 Or 146 (2003) (\u201c[E]ntitlement to fees under ORS 20.105 ultimately depends on the determination of whether plaintiffs claims were not \u2018objectively reasonable.\u2019 That determination is a matter of law.\u201d). It is possible that the trial court awarded fees because, as it found in its rulings from the bench, respondent filed her motions because she was personally motivated by a desire to retaliate against respondent. The controlling standard under ORS 20.105, is whether there was \u201cno objectively reasonable basis for asserting the claim.\u201d Thus, respondent\u2019s personal motivation for seeking relief is not relevant. The trial court may also have based its ruling on its conclusion that there is no statutory authority for termination of a permanent SPO. In light of our holding in <em>Edwards, </em>that a person subject to a SPO may seek to terminate it when the criteria for issuing the order are no longer present, it was not objectively unreasonable for respondent to seek to terminate the SPO after she had moved away from the West Linn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>house. We accordingly reverse the supplemental judgments awarding attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Limited judgment affirmed; supplemental judgments reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-6\"> The following are excerpts of respondent\u2019s testimony on cross-examination by petitioner\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">\u201cQ [By petitioner\u2019s counsel]: Now I\u2019ll show you what\u2019s been marked as Exhibit 3, for example.
